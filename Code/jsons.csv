LAS VEGAS (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton entered Tuesday night's first Democratic debate a weakened front-runner, anxious to move past the controversy over her email practices and persuade voters she's the best-qualified candidate to lead the party to a third straight term in the White House. 
Clinton, the former secretary of state, faces her biggest challenge from Bernie Sanders, the rumpled independent senator from Vermont who has energized liberals with his call for a ""political revolution."" Much of the focus in the prime-time contest was sure to be on how they engage each other, given that they have gone long stretches in the campaign without even mentioning each other's names. 
Joining them on stage in Las Vegas was a trio of low-polling candidates looking for a breakthrough moment: former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley; Jim Webb, a former Navy secretary and U.S. senator from Virginia, and Lincoln Chafee, the Republican-turned independent-turned Democrat from Rhode Island. 
While Clinton maintains financial and organizational advantages over her Democratic rivals, months of Republican criticism of her use of personal email and a private Internet server while in the Obama administration have shadowed her campaign and hurt her standing with voters. The Associated Press reported Tuesday that Clinton's server was connected to the Internet in ways that left it somewhat vulnerable to hackers. 
The candidates and their teams focused elsewhere for the Democrats' first big TV event. 
Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who worked for Clinton's failed 2008 White House campaign, said that as long as the email issue didn't dominate the debate, ""this will be a win for her no matter how you look at it."" 
Sanders, too, seemed eager to keep the debate focused on policy, and he was looking to broaden his appeal to more Democratic voters. The self-described democratic socialist, who is drawing massive crowds and challenging Clinton's fundraising prowess, has called for breaking up big Wall Street banks, expanding Social Security and providing free tuition to public colleges and universities. 
In recent days, Sanders has stepped up his efforts to draw a contrast with Clinton, casting her as a late-comer to the liberal positions he's held for decades. 
After Clinton announced her opposition to a sweeping Pacific Rim trade deal, a pact she had previously called the ""gold standard,"" Sanders said he was glad she'd come around to ""a conclusion I reached on day one."" 
Indeed, Clinton has increasingly moved to the left on domestic policy since announcing her campaign this spring, including voicing opposition to the Keystone XL oil pipeline and support for expanded gun control legislation. While she rarely mentions Sanders by name, she's suggested her proposals are more realistic and well-formed than those espoused by the Vermont senator. 
In an interview with NBC's ""Today"" show last week, Clinton went after Sanders' call for free college tuition, a popular initiative among progressives. 
""I'm a little different from those who say 'free college for everybody,'"" Clinton said. ""I am not in favor of making college free for Donald Trump's kids."" 
Not on the scene in Las Vegas but on many minds was Vice President Joe Biden. 
Biden, flirting for weeks with a late entry into the race, had nothing new to say. His office said he would be watching from his residence in Washington. 
Despite the Biden speculation, the Democratic primary has lacked the drama of the Republican contest and the unexpected rise of Donald Trump. Debate host CNN said it expected significantly lower ratings for Tuesday night's debate than for the Republican contest the cable channel hosted in late September, which drew an audience of 23 million. 
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he expected President Barack Obama to watch at least some of his party's debate. 
""I don't think that he will watch it wire to wire - there is some pretty good playoff baseball on tonight,"" said Earnest, referring to the Major League Baseball playoffs. 
Even with smaller viewership than the GOP debates, Tuesday's event was sure to be largest audience for Democratic candidates since the primary race began. It's one of six debates the Democratic National Committee has sanctioned, a point of contention among some candidates seeking more nationally televised events to generate attention. 
O'Malley, who had expected to be Clinton's chief rival, has led the push for more debates. He's also been sharply critical of what he sees as Clinton's flip-flopping on policy and has said questions about her email use are legitimate. 
Webb has been a chief critic of Clinton's early support of the Iraq war and could push her on her hawkish foreign policy positions. It's unclear what role Chafee might play in the debate, given that his most notable campaign moment thus far has been his call for the U.S. to adopt the metric system.

Facebook Some Lincoln High School students are pushing back against a plan by Denver Public Schools to open a charter middle school on the LHS campus, located in southwest Denver. A protest organized by the community group Padres y Jovenes Unidos is scheduled for 5 p.m. tonight in advance of a 6 p.m. public comment session being held by the DPS school board.
""The school board, the community and the students agree there is a need for a high-quality middle school in the southwest,"" says Karissa Frolov, a youth organizer with the Denver-based group. ""But there are ways to go about it. You can't just put a middle school here and say, 'Let's see how it works.'""
The DPS plan calls for adding a branch of the high-performing DSST charter school network at Lincoln in the 2017-2018 school year. The school would actually open the year before but would be ""incubated"" at an existing DSST school for a year before moving to Lincoln. There are already six DSST middle schools and three DSST high schools in DPS. All nine are charter schools that focus on STEM education, which stands for science, technology, engineering and math.
Middle schoolers in southwest Denver need better schools, DPS officials say: 47 percent of the area's sixth graders are enrolled in under-performing schools, according to a presentation by district staff to the school board last week. By comparison, the district's existing DSST schools perform very well — and officials hope that a new DSST middle school at Lincoln would do the same.
Related Stories Obama touts his jobs plan at Lincoln High School in Denver (PHOTOS) Denver Public Schools But some community members are worried that adding a middle school at Lincoln will be detrimental to a high school they say is already overcrowded and lacking key resources. In a recent survey of more than 600 Lincoln students, 85 percent said they've been late to class because of overcrowding in the hallways and 92 percent said they've experienced long waits to get lunch. The survey was organized by students, some of whom spoke at a recent school board meeting in opposition to the plan.
""It just doesn’t make any sense to the students,"" Frolov says of the plan, which involves phasing in the middle school to add a total of 450 middle school students to the Lincoln campus by the 2018-2019 school year. ""Where are they going to put them?""
DPS officials say there's plenty of room. Lincoln has a capacity of 2,100 students but it hasn't been full for years — and the district predicts that the student population will shrink even more by 2018-2019. “As Lincoln becomes smaller, it creates the space for the additional students,"" Susana Cordova, DPS's chief of schools, said at a recent school board meeting . She denied that adding a middle school at Lincoln was the first step toward eventually closing the high school altogether.
Denver Public Schools ""We are very committed to ensuring that Lincoln continues, that it has high-quality educational opportunities for students and that it needs to be fed by very strong middle schools across the board,"" she said. ""We have made the commitment that we will never turn students away from Lincoln.”
But not everyone is convinced. The slogan of the campaign opposing DPS's plan? Fix Lincoln First.
The school board is expected to vote on the plan on Thursday.

Bobby Jindal's administration are headed back to federal court Oct. 16, the second time the two sides will square off on the organization's Medicaid contract.
But if a recent court decision in Arkansas is any indication, the Jindal administration could face some difficulty in convincing a judge the administration shouldn't be temporarily blocked from canceling Planned Parenthood's contract. Arkansas was in a very similar position as the Jindal administration, having terminated Planned Parenthood of the Heartland's contract on Aug. 14.
According to court documents, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the Planned Parenthood contract was terminated because ""this organization does not represent the values of the people of our state."" Also similar to the Louisiana case is the fact that three unnamed Planned Parenthood patients were listed as plaintiffs.
In the Arkansas case, The Washington Post reported U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker issued a ruling that blocked the state from terminating benefits for the three women in the case only. But that may prove to be a technicality; Planned Parenthood is now seeking class action status to expand Baker's ruling to cover all Planned Parenthood patients who are eligible for Medicaid in Arkansas, according to The Associated Press.
Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, which bills the state for Medicaid reimbursement for about 5,200 patients in New Orleans and Baton Rouge, appears to have learned a lesson from the Arkansas case. The most recent filing in Louisiana was filed as a class action injunction that seeks to cover all the Medicaid patients Planned Parenthood treats in Louisiana.
Planned Parenthood's chapter in Alabama is seeking a similar injunction.
All three states moved to cut Medicaid funding for the organization after a series of videos were released over the summer depicting Planned Parenthood Federation of America discussing a fetal tissue donation program. Republicans in Congress are seeking a similar measure that would affect the organization nationwide.
Planned Parenthood has argued before in Louisiana that its patients have a right to choose providers, and that the state doesn't have the right to cut off funding and force those patients to go to other providers. In this case, Planned Parenthood will try to convince a federal judge that Louisiana's termination is ""highly irregular"" and the state's standards ""have not been applied to any other Medicaid provider.""

It finds that epigenetic effects, chemical modifications of the human genome that alter gene activity without changing the DNA sequence, may have a major influence on sexual orientation. The new work, from Eric Vilain's lab at the University of California (UC), Los Angeles, is “exciting” and “long overdue,” says William Rice, an evolutionary geneticist at UC Santa Barbara, who proposed in 2012 that epigenetics plays a role in sexual orientation. But Rice and others caution that the research is still preliminary and based on a small sample. 
That last bit Michael wrote was key: ""But Rice and the others caution that the research is still preliminary and based on a small sample."" It seems like there is a bit more drama than fact finding in these study results. These scientists are just working hard to give the homosexual community more justification for immoral and unethical behavior. 
If scientists published a study presenting the discovery of a ""rape gene"" does anybody really think the culture would then embrace rapists and support their culture? 
Science offers society many benefits. We all are blessed to be alive in a time when science has improved medicine, nutrition, transportation, the atmosphere, and so much more. But science is not the be all and end all of life. Science does not make ethical decisions for us. 
This article in the Atlantic offers some support of the study, but even its author, Ed Yong, is not fully convinced. He writes: So, ultimately, what we have is an underpowered fishing expedition that used inappropriate statistics and that snagged results which may be false positives. Epigenetics marks may well be involved in sexual orientation. But this study, despite its claims, does not prove that and, as designed, could not have. 
It looks like more studies are needed for science to back up the suggested biological evidence presented here. Better luck next time!"
