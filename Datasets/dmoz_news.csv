3:16 p.m.

Authorities say at least half a dozen homes have burned in a fast-moving brush fire in Southern California.

Anaheim Sgt. Daron Wyatt says the fire that broke out on Monday had stretched to about 4 square miles.

Wyatt says the blaze has been driven westward by winds toward heavily populated areas of Orange County, prompting authorities to expand evacuations.

Wyatt says one firefighter suffered minor injuries fighting the blaze.

An overnight shelter has been set up at a nearby high school for evacuees.

2:56 p.m.

Authorities have expanded evacuations in Southern California's Orange County because of a fast-moving wildfire.

Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt told KABC-TV on Monday that residents in the neighborhoods of Orange Park Acres, North Tustin and East Orange were also being evacuated.

Television cameras showed homes charred by flames in the hilly area known as Anaheim Hills. At least 1,000 homes in that area were previously evacuated.

Residents reported ash falling miles away in areas near the Pacific Coast.

Regional authorities have issued a smoke advisory through Tuesday morning for portions of Orange and Riverside counties.

2:20 p.m.

Officials say a wind-driven wildfire churning through canyons in hilly neighborhoods of Southern California has burned multiple homes.

Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt says there's still no count of the number of homes affected by Monday's blaze.

Anaheim Fire & Rescue says the fire has grown to 2,000 acres and is being fought by 200 firefighters, six helicopters and six airplanes.

One firefighter has been injured.

The fire erupted during the fall's first significant blast of Santa Ana winds, which blow out of the northeast and toward the coast.

In Northern California wine country, officials say at least one person was killed and two others were seriously injured in fast-spreading wildfires,

At least 1,500 homes and commercial buildings have been destroyed, and 20,000 people have been evacuated.

1:10 p.m.

Officials say at least one person was killed and two others were seriously injured in fast-spreading wildfires in Northern California wine country.

CalFire said Monday the death and injuries occurred in Mendocino County, one of several counties struggling to contain a total of 14 major fires burning out of control.

Additional details were not immediately available.

Official say high winds are hampering firefighting efforts about 140 miles (225 kilometers) north of San Francisco.

12:41 p.m.

A wind-driven wildfire has ignited homes in a Southern California subdivision.

TV news helicopters over the blaze in the Anaheim hills of eastern Orange County are showing several homes fully involved and flames spreading in others Monday afternoon.

Fire crews are scrambling to protect structures. Evacuations have been ordered for neighborhoods and two elementary schools.

The fire erupted during the fall's first significant blast of Santa Ana winds, the seasonal gusts linked to some of the region's worst wildfires.

In Northern California, wildfires overnight have destroyed at least 1,500 homes and commercial buildings, and 20,000 people have been evacuated.

12:30 p.m.

Authorities say they expect fatalities after 14 fast-moving wildfires destroyed more than 1,500 homes, department stores, hotels and other commercial structures in Northern California.

The state's top fire officials said Monday that firefighters have focused on evacuating residents and saving lives rather than battling the blaze and protecting buildings.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Director Ken Pimlott said fatalities are expected, but the fires are still out of control and it's difficult for authorities to assess the damage done and the number of people hurt and killed.

He said about 50,000 people are without power.

October is typically the most dangerous time for fires in the state. He said there have been 1,500 more wildfires this year than last year at this time.

The California Highway Patrol says numerous roads are closed in the fire region, which is an eight-county swath of wine country north of San Francisco.

12:05 p.m.

A wind-driven wildfire is sweeping along the outskirts of a Southern California subdivision.

The blaze erupted at late morning Monday in Anaheim and moved rapidly through hills and canyons in Orange County, about 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

Authorities have ordered evacuations of neighborhoods and two elementary schools and shut down heavily traveled freeways.

City officials could not immediately say how many people are affected.

An evacuation center is being set up at a downtown community center. Authorities also are setting up a place for residents to evacuate their horses.

In Northern California, firefighters are battling blazes that have destroyed at least 1,500 homes and commercial buildings.

11:45 a.m.

Emergency workers and staff at a state home for the severely disabled outside of Sonoma have evacuated all of about 240 patients as flames from fast-spreading wildfires approached the center and ash rained down.

Officials at the Sonoma Developmental Center, located on 900 acres, in the town of Glen Ellen said there were no known injuries during the evacuation.

Center spokesman Jorge Fernandez says ""everybody is safe so far.""

Crews got all patients from threatened buildings as flames closed within a few dozen feet of the center's buildings.

Many of the patients were confined to beds and wheelchairs and had breathing or feeding tubes.

Vans and school buses were lining up to remove the last patients as workers in masks pushed frail residents in wheelchairs across parking lots and roads.

11 a.m.

Another wildfire has erupted in California, this time about 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles in the hill country of eastern Orange County.

The Anaheim Fire Department says the fire erupted late Monday morning and is being pushed by 25 mph winds.

An unknown number of people have been ordered to evacuate.

Much of Southern California is under red flag warnings for fire danger due to the fall's first significant Santa Ana winds, the seasonal gusts linked to some of the region's worst wildfires.

The Anaheim fire erupted as the tally from numerous fires in Northern California worsens.

State officials say at least 1,500 homes and commercial buildings have been destroyed, and 20,000 people have been evacuated in California wine country.

———

10:45 a.m.

California's fire chief says at least 1,500 homes and commercial buildings have been destroyed in wildfires that have ripped through the state's wine country.

He says numerous people have been injured and a number of residents are also missing as 14 large fires burn.

California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Director Ken Pimlott say an estimated 20,000 people have been evacuated.

He called the estimates of destroyed structures very conservative. Pimlott says the fires are burning throughout an eight-county swath of Northern California, including Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties.

Pimlott said most of the fires started at about 10 p.m. Sunday and their causes are under investigation. He said firefighters are concentrating on saving lives rather than battling the blazes.

He didn't have an estimate on the number of people hurt and missing.

10 a.m.

More than 200 people were hurriedly evacuated from two Santa Rosa hospitals threatened by wildfires that bloomed overnight.

Lisa Amador, a spokeswoman with Sutter Health, said around 9 a.m. that Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital had finished evacuating the last of more than 80 patients in surgical, labor and emergency care.

She says the hospital is sending staff home. Amador says the hospital and the medical office building next to it are intact, but other structures are ruined.

Jenny Mack, a spokeswoman for Kaiser Permanente, says about 130 patients were evacuated from the Santa Rosa medical center Monday morning.

She said all appointments and surgeries are cancelled for the day in Santa Rosa and Napa, and the KP medical offices in Napa are closed.

9:30 a.m.

California Gov. Jerry Brown has declared a state of emergency in Napa, Sonoma and Yuba counties because of wildfires that the governor says are threatening thousands of homes.

Brown issued the declaration on Monday, as multiple fires forced people to evacuate their homes.

Napa County Fire Chief Barry Biermann said more than 50 structures had been destroyed, but there were no reports of injuries or deaths.

Residents describe terrifying middle-of-the-night scrambles to flee from raging wildfires.

Biermann says the fires had burned more than 68 square miles (176sq. kilometers).

8:55 a.m.

Residents in Napa and Sonoma counties are describing their terrifying middle-of-the-night scramble to flee from raging wildfires.

Terri Ruttledge, who lives on Adobe Canyon in Kenwood, just made it out before the fire burned her house.

Ruttledge says she looked out her window and saw the mountain across the road on fire. When she couldn't reach 911, she quickly loaded up the car and fled.

Mandatory evacuations were ordered after blazes broke out late Sunday.

Napa County Board of Supervisors chairwoman Belia Ramos says officials do not yet have a count on how many properties have been affected in the 20,000 acre (8,100 hectare) fire.

She says the wind gusts were tremendous and made the fire unpredictable.

Fires also burned just to the east in the Napa County wine country as well as in Yuba, Butte and Nevada counties.

———

6:07 a.m.

Residents of Northern California wine country are describing harrowing escapes from wind-whipped wildfires.

Marian Williams says she caravanned with neighbors through flames early Monday as one of several fires reached the vineyards and ridges of the small Sonoma County town of Kenwood.

Williams says she could feel the heat as trees turned into torches.

The fires are being fanned by strong, dry and gusty winds raking the region.

1:53 a.m.

Firefighters are battling several wind-whipped fires that forced evacuations of rural neighborhoods in Northern California.

The Press Democrat reports ( http://bit.ly/2xt7ekR ) that mandatory evacuations were ordered after a blaze broke out late Sunday near Santa Rosa, which is 54 miles (87 kilometers) north of San Francisco.

The Sonoma County Sheriff's Office says deputies were dispatched to help firefighters and California Highway Patrol officers with evacuations.

Multiple fires broke out Sunday night as strong winds buffeted the area. Emergency lines were inundated with callers reporting smoke in the area.

Downed trees were blocking parts of one rural road and fires were burning on both sides of Highway 12 as gusts reached up to 60 mph (96.5 kph).

http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/cold-war-radiation-testing-us-widespread-author-claims-50233516,['Abc News'],,[],,"Three members of Congress are demanding answers after a St. Louis scholar's new book revealed details of secret Cold War-era U.S. government testing in which countless unsuspecting people, including many children, pregnant women and minorities, were fed, sprayed or injected with radiation and other dangerous materials.

The health ramifications of the tests are unknown. Lisa Martino-Taylor, an associate professor of sociology at St. Louis Community College who wrote ""Behind the Fog: How the U.S. Cold War Radiological Weapons Program Exposed Innocent Americans,"" acknowledged that tracing diseases like cancer to specific causes is difficult.

But three House Democrats who represent areas where testing occurred — William Lacy Clay of Missouri, Brad Sherman of California and Jim Cooper of Tennessee — said they were outraged by the revelations.

Martino-Taylor used Freedom of Information Act requests to obtain previously unreleased documents, including Army records. She also reviewed already public records and published articles. She told The Associated Press that she found that a small group of researchers, aided by leading academic institutions, worked to develop radiological weapons and later ""combination weapons"" using radioactive materials along with chemical or biological weapons.

Her book, published in August, was a follow-up to her 2012 dissertation, which found that the government conducted secret testing of zinc cadmium sulfide in a poor area of St. Louis in the 1950s and 1960s. The book focuses on the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s.

An Army spokeswoman declined to comment, but Martino-Taylor's 2012 report on testing in St. Louis was troubling enough to trigger an Army investigation. The investigation found no evidence that the St. Louis testing posed a health threat.

Martino-Taylor said the offensive radiological weapons program was a top priority for the government. Unknowing people in places throughout the U.S., as well as parts of England and Canada, were subjected to potentially deadly material through open-air spraying, ingestion and injection, Martino-Taylor said.

""They targeted the most vulnerable in society in most cases,"" Martino-Taylor said. ""They targeted children. They targeted pregnant women in Nashville. People who were ill in hospitals. They targeted wards of the state. And they targeted minority populations.""

The tests in Nashville in the late 1940s involved giving 820 poor and pregnant white women a mixture during their first pre-natal visit that included radioactive iron, Martino-Taylor said. The women were chosen without their knowledge. Blood tests were performed to determine how much radioactive iron had been absorbed by the mother, and the babies' blood was tested at birth. Similar tests were performed in Chicago and San Francisco, Martino-Taylor said.

Cooper's office plans to seek more information from the Army Legislative Liaison, said spokesman Chris Carroll.

""We are asking for details on the Pentagon's role, along with any cooperation by research institutions and other organizations,"" Carroll said. ""These revelations are shocking, disturbing and painful.""

In California, investigators created a radiation field inside a building at North Hollywood High School during a weekend in the fall of 1961, Martino-Taylor said. Similar testing was performed at the University of California, Los Angeles and at a Los Angeles Police Department building.

Sherman said he wants a survey of people who graduated from the school around the time of the testing to see if there was a higher incidence of illness, including cancer. He also said he will seek more information from the Department of Energy.

""What an incredibly stupid, reckless thing to do,"" said Sherman, whose district includes North Hollywood High School.

Among those who recall the testing is Mary Helen Brindell, 73. She was playing baseball in a St. Louis street in the mid-1950s when a squadron of green planes flew so low overhead that she could see the face of the lead pilot. Suddenly, the children were covered in a fine powdery substance that stuck to skin moistened by summer sweat.

Brindell has suffered from breast, thyroid, skin and uterine cancers. Her sister died of a rare form of esophageal cancer.

""I just want an explanation from the government,"" Brindell said. ""Why would you do that to people?""

Clay said he was angered that Americans were used as ""guinea pigs"" for research.

""I join with my colleagues to demand the whole truth about this testing and I will reach out to my Missouri Delegation friends on the House Armed Services Committee for their help as well,"" Clay said in a statement.

St. Louis leaders were told at the time that the government was testing a smoke screen that could shield the city from aerial observation in case of Soviet attack. Evidence now shows radioactive material, not just zinc cadmium sulfide, was part of that spraying, Martino-Taylor said.

Doris Spates, 62, was born in 1955 on the 11th floor of the Pruitt-Igoe low-income high-rise where the Army sprayed material from the roof. Her father died suddenly three months after her birth. Four of her 11 siblings died from cancer at relatively young ages. She survived cervical cancer and suffers from skin and breathing problems.

""It makes me angry,"" Spates said. ""It is wrong to do something like that to people who don't have any knowledge of it.""

According to Martino-Taylor, other testing in Chicago; Berkeley, California; Rochester, New York; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee, involved injecting people with plutonium-239.

She said her book shines a light on the team of mostly young scientists tasked with developing radiological weapons. They worked in a closed world with virtually no input from anyone ""who could say, 'This isn't right,' or put some sort of moral compass on it,"" she said.

She hopes her book prompts more people to investigate.

""We haven't gotten any answers so far,"" Martino-Taylor said. ""I think there's a lot more to find out.""

Marsha Blackburn's Senate campaign announcement ad has been blocked by Twitter over a statement the abortion rights opponent makes about the sale of fetal tissue for medical research.

Blackburn, who is running for the seat being opened by the retirement of Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, boasts in the ad that she ""stopped the sale of baby body parts."" A Twitter representative told the candidate's vendors on Monday that the statement was ""deemed an inflammatory statement that is likely to evoke a strong negative reaction:

Twitter said the Blackburn campaign would be allowed to run the rest of the video if the flagged statement is omitted. While the decision keeps Blackburn from paying to promote the video on Twitter, it doesn't keep it from being linked from YouTube and other platforms.

Blackburn took to Twitter to urge supporters to re-post her video and join her in ""standing up to Silicon Valley.""

Blackburn was the chair of a Republican-run House panel created to investigate Planned Parenthood and the world of fetal tissue research that earlier this year urged Congress to halt federal payments to the women's health organization. Democrats said the GOP probe had unearthed no wrongdoing and wasted taxpayers' money in an abusive investigation.

The panel was created after anti-abortion activists released secretly recorded videos in 2015 showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing how they sometimes provide fetal tissue to researchers, which is legal if no profit is made.

Fetal tissue research has strong backing among scientists for its value in studying Down syndrome, eye disease and other problems. But Blackburn's committee report said fetal tissue ""makes a vanishingly small contribution to clinical and research efforts, if it contributes at all,"" and recommended curbing federal grants for such research.

Blackburn's nearly two-and-a-half minute video features footage of her shooting a gun, espousing her ""100 percent pro-life"" credentials and taking fellow Republicans in the Senate to task for failing to repeal the Obama health care law.

""I know the left calls me a wingnut or a knuckle-dragging conservative,"" she said in the video. ""And you know what? I say that's all right. Bring it on.""",,,

An article on AOL's website posted Friday says AOL Instant Messenger will be discontinued on Dec. 15. In a blog post , a spokesman for AOL's parent company explained the platform's demise as the casualty of the evolving way people communicate.

""AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,"" wrote Michael Albers, vice president of communications at Oath.

The program will still function until Dec. 15 After that date, users won't be able to sign in and all data will be deleted. AOL says people with an aim.com email address will still be able to use it.

Launched in 1997, AOL Instant Messenger was at the forefront of what was called at the time the biggest trend in online communication since email.

The platform, which provided instant access to friends and contacts on a user's ""buddy list,"" was wildly popular for the first few years after its launch. It claimed more than 100 million registered users in 2001.

AOL was fiercely protective of its dominance in the instant messaging market. It fended off rivals, including Microsoft, by blocking their messaging platforms from communicating with AOL users. Its actions prompted a coalition of rivals to complain to the federal government ahead of AOL's ill-fated merger with Time Warner that was completed in 2001.

Its popularity as a communication tool waned amid the rise of text messaging, Google Chat and social networking sites.

Despite the decline in usage, the announcement Friday made the platform a trending topic online and revealed an outpouring of nostalgia. Some users posted images of the AIM's famous ""running man"" logo outfitted with wings and a halo. Others reminisced.

In his post, Albers noted the strong affinity many feel for the messaging platform and its place in the evolution of communication.

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/white-house-plans-order-expand-health-care-options-50363336,['Abc News'],,[],,"The White House is finalizing an executive order that would expand health plans offered by associations to allow individuals to pool together and buy insurance outside their states, a unilateral move that follows failed efforts by Congress to overhaul the health care system.

President Donald Trump has long asserted that selling insurance across state lines would trigger competition that brings down premiums for people buying their own policies. Experts say that's not guaranteed, partly because health insurance reflects local medical costs, which vary widely around the country.

Moreover, White House actions may come too late to have much impact on premiums for 2018.

Trump was expected to sign the executive order next week, likely on Thursday, a senior administration official said Sunday.

Under the president's executive action, membership groups could sponsor insurance plans that cost less because — for example — they wouldn't have to offer the full menu of benefits required under the Affordable Care Act, also called ""Obamacare."" It's unclear how the White House plans to overcome opposition from state insurance regulators, who see that as an end-run to avoid standards.

""There are likely to be legal challenges that could slow this effort down,"" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Similar alternatives have been promoted by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican holdout during the health care debate. Senate leaders didn't bring the latest GOP health care bill to a vote because they lacked the votes to pass it.

Association plans ""kind of went away with the ACA, and now the idea seems to be to re-create them,"" said Jeff Smedsrud, a health insurance marketing entrepreneur. ""It's not clear what they would really look like.""

Smedsrud said a different option also under consideration by the White House, to loosen restrictions on ""short term"" insurance plans, could be a safety valve for some consumers.

Those plans generally have limited benefits and remain in force for less than a year. During the Obama administration, the availability of short-term coverage was restricted. One of Smedsrud's companies sells short-term plans.

Others warned that over time the White House order could undermine state insurance markets created under Obama's law, by siphoning off healthy people to plans with lower premiums and skinnier benefits.

The order was being drafted as Trump expressed his willingness to work with Democrats on health care after Republicans were unable to approve legislation that would have repealed and replaced ""Obamacare.""

The president said Saturday that he had spoken to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to see if Democrats would want to collaborate with him on improving health care. He told reporters before departing for a North Carolina fundraiser that he was willing to consider a ""temporary deal"" and referred to a popular Republican proposal that would have the federal government turn over money for health care directly to states in the form of block grants.

Schumer said through a spokesman Saturday that Trump ""wanted to make another run at 'repeal and replace' and I told the president that's off the table."" Schumer said if Trump ""wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.""

It was unclear if the expected White House order could lead to changes sweeping enough and quick enough to help several million consumers exposed to higher premiums next year for their individual health insurance plans.

It typically takes government agencies several months to carry out presidential directives, since they generally must follow a notice-and-comment process. Sign-up season for individual health insurance starts Nov. 1 and ends Dec. 15.

""Whether this executive order could impact the 2018 market is yet to be seen, since the health plans have created and priced their 2018 products already, and open enrollment begins in just three weeks,"" said health industry consultant Robert Laszewski.

While nearly 9 million consumers who receive tax credits under the Obama-era law are protected from higher premiums, about 6.7 million other customers with individual coverage get no subsidies and will bear the full brunt of cost increases that reach well into the double digits in many states.

Many in this group are solid middle-class, including self-employed business people and early retirees. Cutting premiums for them has been a longstanding Republican political promise.

""If the question is, is the president interested in working with Democrats to repeal and replace — that would be our language — the answer is yes,"" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said during an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ''The Democrats would use a different word for that, but the president wants to get something done.""",,,

http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/mother-refused-bring-sons-vaccinations-date-sentenced-days/story?id=50276507,['Abc News'],,[],,"Rebecca Bredow, of the Detroit area, has has been sentenced to seven days in jail for refusing to bring her child's vaccinations up to date.

Bredow appeared at a hearing on Wednesday morning at the Oakland County Circuit Court where Judge Karen McDonald sentenced her for contempt of court after Bredow refused to comply with court orders for her to allow her son to receive all his missing vaccinations within one week.

The mother of two told the judge that she takes ""full responsibility"" for her actions and that vaccinations go against her beliefs.

In an interview with ABC News last week, Bredow said that she would ""absolutely"" rather go to jail than allow her 9-year-old son to receive the swath of vaccinations in one week.

""I would rather go to jail for standing up for what I believe in than vaccinating my child,"" Bredow told ABC News, adding that she believes the decision to vaccinate a child is a ""personal choice.""

Bredow is the primary caregiver for the boy, though she shares legal custody with his father, her ex-husband Jason Horne. Bredow said that when her son was much younger, she and Horne originally agreed to space out vaccinations for him. She said that she was most concerned about the grouping of vaccinations.

The state of Michigan allows parents to opt-out of certain vaccines for non-medical reasons. The American Academy of Pediatrics emphasizes the safety and importance of vaccines and recommends a schedule of when to provide them.

Last week, the court ordered Bredow to bring the boy's vaccinations up to date according to the recommended schedule and said she had one week to comply.

""Now I have four-and-a-half business days ... to fully vaccinate, they want me to bring him up to the fullest extent medically allowed, which would be up to eight vaccines, in one dose,"" Bredow told ABC News. ""This is supposed to be done before 9 a.m. on Wednesday.""

""God forbid if he were to be injured by a vaccine,"" she continued. ""I would have to take care of him.""

The divorced parents have been embroiled in a legal battle over several matters, according to Horne's attorney Benton G. Richardson, the dispute over vaccinations for their son is one among them.

Horne told the courts he now wants the boy to receive all of the vaccinations recommended by his age and the court ruled in his favor.

Court documents obtained by ABC News state that Bredow was first asked to have the immunizations provided to her son in November 2016.

While Bredow serves her seven-day prison sentence, the child will be in the care of Horne. Bredow will be back in court next week at a time to be determined.",,,

Free booze, mountains of delicious food, and if you’re a single girl like me, there’s usually at least a few single men to flirt with. Before I became a mom, I was all about weddings. Even the ones that required me to travel. Because heck, who doesn’t love an excuse to get on a plane and go somewhere for a party?

I’ll tell you who: Moms.

Since my daughter was born four years ago, I have RSVP’d “Can’t make it” to six different weddings. And three of those were weddings for some of my very closest friends. Unfortunately, they all required expensive travel. And one was actually a kid-free wedding.

Sorry (okay, not sorry), but I’m a single mom, and especially in that kid-free wedding scenario, there was just no way that was going to work. I don’t have family nearby I can leave my kiddo with, which would have meant either begging friends to take my then-2-year-old for a few days, or bringing her with me and hiring a stranger to babysit her there. And that extra hassle would have been on top of the $2,000+ in airfare and $500+ on hotel accommodations. All so that I could go to a wedding where a friend —- who I do dearly love and miss terribly, for the record —- would have had 200 other guests she would also have been spending her time catching up with.

So nope, I couldn’t do it. There was just no way I could justify spending that kind of a money on a trip that would have involved so much hassle and so little actual quality time with the person I was traveling to see.

Mom’s Viral Post Sums Up the “Glorious Mess” of Parenthood — and How to Rise Above It

I Have Four Kids, But Having “Just” One at Home Is Killing Me

If I’m being honest, I haven’t always had the money to spend on these weddings even if there was more quality time involved. Because, motherhood.

Part of this is on me. I’m the one who is a bit of a nomad and has made friends who are also a bit nomadic themselves, leaving me with invites to weddings all over the country. But you want to know a secret? I’ve even bailed on weddings for acquaintances right here in my hometown. Because while I technically could have brought my kiddo with me, trying to manage her unpredictable toddler behavior at a wedding attended by a bunch of people I didn’t know super well did not sound like a fun way to spend one of our coveted weekend days. And hiring a sitter would have meant giving up one of my rare sitter nights just to watch someone I knew and liked, but wasn’t super close to, say “I do.”

Call me selfish, but I’d rather use that sitter for a girl’s night out and some quality time with the close friends I otherwise don’t get to see enough of.

A few weeks ago though, I did drag my daughter along to the first and only wedding she’s ever attended. We had to travel to Seattle, but I have other close friends there as well — so we made a week of that wedding trip, and even got two extra days of quality time in with the bride and groom before the rest of their guests arrived. That quality time with both them and my other friends absolutely made the trip worth it in my mind.

But the wedding itself was a reminder of why I’ve said “no” more often than not to these invites.

Don’t get me wrong: I had a great time, and my daughter had a blast being the life of the party. But you know what? I spent so much time turning her into a princess that I had only 15 minutes to get ready myself. She got extra pouty and fidgety as we waited in our seats for the wedding to begin. And we had to spend the reception cocktail hour back in our room cleaning up her dress, because she was devastated when it got mud on it. I couldn’t really have adult conversations, because I was too focused on her most of the time. She wasn’t digging any of the fancy foods we were served for dinner, and struggled with understanding that the bride and groom could not make her their sole focus once the meal was over. After all, they had spent days doting on her, shouldn’t she still be by their side for every second of their wedding celebration as well?

Of course not. But you try explaining that to a 4-year-old who thinks her auntie and uncle hung the moon.

Once the dancing started, her smile returned. But around 9 PM, she started fading (and misbehaving as a result). We had to say our goodnights just as the party was getting to the good part — the drinking and dancing and reminiscing that I used to love most about weddings.

So yes, we had a good time. And I was thankful to be there for one of my best friends in this world. But … having a kid changes things. And weddings aren’t quite the same when you have them to think about. (I mean, I didn’t even have more than a single glass of wine!)

So friends, don’t take it personally if I have to send my regrets to your wedding invite. The truth is, I’m much more frugal with both my time and my money these days. And if your wedding requires travel, is kid-free, or is going to be attended by a bunch of people I really don’t know that well, there’s a strong chance I won’t be able to make it.

I’ll still be celebrating you in spirit, though. And keeping all my missed weddings in mind when my own day comes.

Their moms, both photographers, arranged the pint-size photo shoot for their kids who “love hanging out together.”

The newlyweds, Sullivan, 5 and Ella, 3, loved playing dress up and pretending to celebrate their big day.

“We told them they were getting married and found a little baby-sized ring box. I told her she got to dress like a princess for her wedding,” Ella’s mom, Breana Marie of Breana Marie Photography, told ABC News. “I braided her hair and then they saw each other and they said, ‘We’re getting married today!’ They did pretty much everything themselves, then they’d look at each other and they would giggle.”

Breana Marie Photography

Breanna teamed up with Sullivan’s mom, Bria of Wolf & Rose Photography, after working together several times and knowing their children would get along.

“I would die of happiness if they got married in the future,” Breanna said with a laugh.

Breana Marie Photography

They had a wedding dress, a suit, a bouquet of flowers, an altar and a beautiful blue cake.

“They would run from one set to another set holding hands the whole time,” said the proud mom. “They even kissed once or twice and it was the funniest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.”

Breana Marie Photography

Breanna said her favorite part about the special photo shoot was when Sullivan, completely unprompted, dropped to his knee to propose to Ella.

“He asked, ‘Can I propose to her?’” she recalled. “Ella started giggling so hard. He put it on her pointer finger.""

Breanna said both kiddos were thrilled for the chance to be the focus of their moms' professions.

“They were excited to get married because both of their moms work in the wedding industry, which made it exciting for us to incorporate them into our world,” she said.",,,

http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/parents-teal-pumpkins-include-kids-food-allergies-halloween/story?id=50275021,['Abc News'],,[],,"Some parents around the nation are adding teal-colored pumpkins to their doorsteps to help include children with food allergies in Halloween festivities.

The nonprofit Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) group launched the Teal Pumpkin Project in 2014 to raise awareness about food allergies and to let trick-or-treaters know which houses are offering non-food treats. According to the Centers for Disease Control, an estimated 4 percent to 6 percent of children in the United States are affected by food allergies, and some reactions can be life-threatening.

Over the past three years, the Teal Pumpkin Project has spread across the country, thanks largely to social media, Nancy Gregory, the senior director of communications for FARE, told ABC News.

""We continue to see the campaign grow and the feedback from then to today has always been overwhelmingly positive from both people in and out of the food allergy community,"" Gregory said. ""In 2014, we created a participation map where people could add a pin to show where their participating homes were located in the community. Each year, the number of homes has grown and in 2016 we saw a nearly 80 percent increase in the number of people who added their pins to the map.""

FARE encourages parents to share their own stories and pictures on social media as well as adding their homes to its maps.

Vikki Meldrum, a mom from Westlake, Ohio, told ABC News that discovering the Teal Pumpkin Project in 2015 helped her come up with a strategy to help her 4-year-old daughter Lyla -- who has multiple life-threatening food allergies -- enjoy and participate in Halloween.

Vikki Meldrum

""Using the Teal Pumpkin Project as motivation, I reached out to every member of my neighborhood. I let them know about Lyla's food allergies, about the Teal Pumpkin Project and asked if they plan to give out candy and if they would be open to providing a non-food treat for Lyla,"" Meldrum said. ""To our surprise and delight, every house participated that first year.""

FARE suggests that families who want to participate swap out traditional Halloween candy for inexpensive toys and other non-food treats such as glow sticks. The group sells starter kits on their website and offers free printable posters for those wishing to participate as well.

Meldrum said houses put out teal pumpkins and other decor to let Lyla know she was welcome.

""Vikki really embraced the project and knew that to make it successful in her own neighborhood she would have to spread the word herself and the stories about her daughter prove how open people are to the idea to help spread awareness,"" Gregory said of Meldrum.

Vikki Meldrum

One first-time parent participant, Cheryl Drzal-McCormack from Wappingers Falls, New York, said she has heard about the project on Facebook and purchased a teal pumpkin to bring awareness to her community.

""My middle son Aiden has a allergies to some foods,"" McCormack said. ""I thought this was such an amazing idea, especially being a mother of four, and I'd never even thought about doing something like this until I read about it.""

McCormack said that while her son has never experienced an allergic reaction from Halloween candy, she's glad the project exists to help other kids with food allergies. She said she spoke about it with her friends and with the principal at her childrens' school about including it in their Fall Festival.

""I hope that more parents are aware of this and think about the kids that cant trick-or-treat because they can't have the candy,"" McCormack said.",,,

http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/gary-andersen-football-coach-oregon-state/story?id=50375948&cid=share_facebook_widget,['Abc News'],,[],,"Gary Andersen is out as the football coach at Oregon State, effective immediately.

The university announced Monday that the parties have mutually parted ways and agreed to release each other from the remaining contractual obligations. Andersen was under contract through the 2021 season.

Assistant coach Cory Hall has been named the interim coach.

Andersen signed a contract extension in December and had more than $12.4 million remaining on the deal. Oregon State owed him $883,332 for the rest of this season, $2.75 million for 2018, $2.85 million for 2019, $2.95 million for 2020 and $3.05 million for 2021.

""After many discussions with [athletic director] Scott [Barnes], waiving my contract is the correct decision and enables the young men and the program to move forward and concentrate on the rest of this season,"" Andersen said in a statement. ""Coaching is not about the mighty dollar. It is about teaching and putting young men in a position to succeed on and off the field. Success comes when all parties involved are moving in the same direction.""

After two years as the coach at Wisconsin, where he went 19-7, Andersen made the surprising jump to Oregon State before the 2015 season to replace Mike Riley. He inherited a team devoid of talent but seemingly had the program heading in the right direction coming into the season. The Beavers improved from 2-10 in his first season to 4-8 last year but are just 1-5 to this point with the lone victory coming against FCS Portland State at home.

Against FBS opponents, the Beavers' narrowest margin of defeat came on Saturday in a 38-10 loss to USC.

""This is an exceptionally difficult time for me, personally and professionally,"" Barnes said in a statement. ""I have known Gary for many years and respect him highly as a person, my friend, a head football coach and an incredible leader of young men. The timing of this is very difficult; however it is the best for all involved.""

Andersen was the head coach at Utah State from 2009 to 2012, where he compiled a 26-24 record, including an 11-2 season in his final year that propelled him to the Wisconsin job.

The Beavers host Colorado on Saturday.

She was one of the 58 people slain by Paddock's bullets.

Second search conducted

After questioning Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, federal agents returned to Paddock's three-bedroom home resting on a cul-de-sac inside a sleepy retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada.

They breached the boarded-up garage days after Las Vegas cops first searched the home shortly after the rampage and confirmed they pulled 19 guns and several pounds of potentially explosive materials.

The return to the residence that Paddock purchased back in early 2015 was reportedly for ""re-documenting and rechecking,"" local police chief Troy Tanner, who tagged along with the FBI agents to serve the search warrant.

Killer's brother in Las Vegas

Paddock's younger brother Eric arrived in Las Vegas Sunday to aid authorities in their investigation.

“I’m here to help them move forward with their investigation,” Paddock, 57, told The Las Vegas Review Journal Sunday outside his hotel. “I want to help them understand what they’re seeing.”

Eric had spoken to ABC News after the bloodshed, and said he was “dumbstruck” by the news, and compared discovering his brother had committed the killings to being “crushed by an asteroid.”

“We have no idea how or why this happened,” he said. “As far as we know, Steve was perfectly fine.”

He added that his brother wasn't one to harbor any strong political, extremist or religious beliefs.

So far, no extreme group ties

While ISIS came forward claiming responsibility for the attack shortly after the death toll rose, the FBI has not uncovered connections between the suspect and any foreign terrorist groups.

“The FBI stated there is no apparent tie to international terrorism,” one senior official told ABC News. “Perhaps ISIS is just trying to take credit.”

Employee comes forward

Lisa Crawford spoke to ""Good Morning America"" today about working as Paddock's property manager from 2006 to 2012 in Texas.

She recalls him as generous to his tenants.

“He actually cared about everybody,” Crawford said. ""He tried to make people happy; he tried to make people care and I don't know what happened to him.""

Paddock's girlfriend

Marylou Danley was questioned by authorities and privately told her family she has a ""clean conscience.”

When her boyfriend fired bullets at thousands of unarmed concertgoers, Danley was in the Philippines ""to see family and friends,"" she said in a statement.

Paddock had apparently purchased her airfare to the Philippines and then wired her money to purchase a house for herself and her family.

The move made her ""grateful, but worried,"" thinking that Paddock was breaking up with her, she said in her statement.

Through her attorney Matthew Lombard, Danley said she never foresaw ""something horrible like this was going to happen,"" and described the shooter as a ""kind, caring man.""

She added that she had planned to be with him in the future.

http://abcnews.go.com/US/paramedic-searched-victims-inside-vegas-hotel-shooter-floor/story?id=50334318,"['Abc News', 'More Cat']",,[],,"When Joe DiGaetano showed up for his 24-hour shift as a paramedic coordinator at 7 a.m. Sunday morning, he was ready for anything, but expected it to just be another Sunday.

After a typical weekend day of paperwork, answering calls, and making some deliveries, DiGaetano and his team were settling in for the night.

“Everybody winds down around 9 o’clock. We go into the room, we take our boots off,” he told ABC News in an exclusive interview. Several members of the team turned on HBO and started watching a movie.

But at 10:08 p.m., the call came in: Reports of a ""mass casualty incident.""

“When my phone rings, for serious calls, it rings differently,” he said.

In less than 60 seconds, he grabbed his radio off the charger and was on his way to the spot where Jason Aldean had just left the stage amid a hail of gunfire.

DiGaetano is an EMS flip coordinator and has worked with Las Vegas Fire and Rescue for 20 years. The vehicle he drives into emergencies is stocked with various medical supplies, from bandages to medications that can “bring someone back to life after they’ve died from smoke inhalation,” he said. He is accustomed to walking into tragedies. He says he switches gears in high-pressure situations.

""You find ways to take emotion out of the emergency because when you show up, they want to make sure that they called the right guy who’s going to fix this, not a guy who’s going to be sad with them and be upset with them. They don’t need that, they’re already there.""

DiGaetano says by the time he arrived at 10:20 p.m., four command centers had already been set up, and he reported to the southern command post at Russell Road and Las Vegas Boulevard.

“When I arrived, the shooting had stopped. It was still I would say a scene of chaos. We didn't know at any moment, any car driving toward us was that the bad guy getting away, was that a good guy or these people shot,” he said.

Amid the chaos, DiGaetano jumped in and immediately began triaging patients who had arrived at the center. He says when he arrived they immediately started filling the ambulances with the most critically wounded.

“We have a golden hour from the moment the trauma happens, the moment the surgeon gets to do his thing. There's an hour there where you really have a good chance of keeping these people alive. After that, it really goes down by a significant amount. It's like falling off a cliff.”

Triage levels were assigned based on criteria like breathing rate, amount of blood lost, pulse rate and consciousness. Decisions were made in moments using a color system.

“'Black' means you’re deceased, 'red' means you’re very critical, 'yellow' is you can stay on scene for a minute, and 'green' means you’re walking wounded, you have, you know, a sprained ankle, a cut that’s manageable, nothing that’s gonna need an ambulance or a hospital now,” he said.

But making those determinations could be painful for both the paramedic and the patient. “You had to actually tell people with gunshot wounds, ‘You're not as critical as this person. Wait a minute.’ To them it was the worst thing in their life, and we're telling them to hold on.

“Within about 20 minutes, we had used up all of the ambulance resources that we had,"" said DiGaetano. So he called his battalion chief and called for all the ambulances from Las Vegas County that were available. “I told him, hey, there’s a big event in the county, I’m going to drain your fleet of rescues.”

As the EMS flip coordinator, DiGaetano’s vehicle full of supplies was critical to help the dozens of people with injuries. Around 11 p.m., he was called to the eastern command center, which ran along the eastern fence line of the concert on Reno Avenue.

“We get there and that's the area where people were coming out. They were jumping over the walls from the venue into the street and into a church across the street,” he said.

He also organized groups of paramedics and armed officers called “force protection teams.” He says people of all stripes, mostly self-reported off-duty servicemen and women, were stepping forward to help.

“Anybody who wanted to help, we would take you. Off-duty firefighters, off-duty cops, civilians from out of town who were off-duty firefighters, they made themselves known. I'm not going to lie, we believed them, we put them to work.

“The initial critical people were being organized and led by the off-duty firefighters and cops. They were actually turning over cattle gates, loading people up and picking up like stretchers and hand carrying them out.”

The force protection teams were dispatched into the concert area to search for more wounded people who had scattered in fear.

“You had people hiding in that church in a parking lot in their cars. You had people hiding in semi trucks, people hiding in the venue, under tables and behind walls and they stayed there for 20 or 30 minutes.”

At about midnight, DiGaetano says he reported to the northern command post, at Tropicana Boulevard and Reno Road, where he says his help was needed taking part in a force protection team himself.

“I was given my team of firefighter paramedics. I was also given a team of patrol and detective officers from Metro who were armored and with their AR-15s -- heavy weaponry.”

The team immediately found two people, one with a gunshot to the leg, another with trampling injuries. He instructed his paramedics to administer oxygen and IVs, and they moved on.

After answering 911 calls to the MGM and Fat Burger, he was suddenly called away again.

It was about 1 a.m. and DiGaetano said, “We were given a new assignment by our commander who was told by SWAT that they have four teams they want to send into Mandalay, do a room-by-room search. They want to be able to have us [paramedics] there in case they go into a room and there's another victim that's not identifying themselves via radio or cell phone or any other means.”

He said the four teams were each given master keys and were instructed to sweep the entire hotel.

“We went from floor to floor, room by room and literally opened every door in the Mandalay Bay to make sure that entire hotel was safe.”

“Most of the rooms didn't have anybody in it, but the rooms that did, they identified themselves prior to entering. They get in there. The citizens were very thankful that they got that room searched because everybody was obviously scared.”

He said the four teams took several hours searching every one of the rooms in the hotel, from about the 13th floor all the way up to the Foundation Room on the 62nd floor -- skipping the 32nd floor, where Stephen Paddock, the alleged shooter, had shot concertgoers from his room. According to the Mandalay Bay website, there are 3,211 guest rooms in the hotel.

After several hours of canvassing each room of the Mandalay Bay hotel, the teams had completed their assignment by about 5 a.m., Monday morning.

“We got down and demobilized where the northern commander had basically said, ‘That was your last assignment…. You're free to go.’ I spent that half-hour from 5:00 to 5:30 shaking hands and saying goodbye to the people I just met and/or people I'd worked with and giving hugs.”

As the sky began to lighten, DiGaetano stopped for a coffee on his way home, where he met another officer on her way into work.

“I stopped at Starbucks, and then I actually happen to meet a Metro CSI agent who was just getting on for the day. So I was getting off, she was getting on. I bought her a cup of coffee. We both got grande white mochas,” he said.

She told him “she was actually going to be one of the people who had to take photographs of the people who didn't make it at the fairgrounds. That was her assignment. She wasn't looking forward to her day but like all professionals, she was ready for it,” he said. “She went to work and I went home.”

DiGaetano said the night was, by far, the largest mass casualty incident of his career, and he hopes he never gets a call like that again. But he’s proud of his city’s response to the unthinkable tragedy.

“Vegas is an example of strangers stepping up when they weren't asked to. And if you want an example of what the best of this country is, you should look at the response that Vegas gave. Whether you're a firefighter, a police officer, a civilian who was enjoying a concert show, everybody did something.”",,,

On Sept. 28, an 18-year-old male student who allegedly became intoxicated at Delta Tau Delta was found unconscious off campus by police, Penn State said in a statement. The student was hospitalized and is recovering, the school said.

Penn State said Delta Tau Delta fraternity functions are ""suspended on an interim basis"" pending an investigation into the teen's injuries.

Penn State said its Office of Student Conduct is investigating any alleged connection Delta Tau Delta may have with the 18-year-old's hospitalization.

""The findings of the investigation will provide direction for decisions or sanctions that could follow,"" the university said. ""The Office of Student Conduct also is looking into whether individual students had a role in providing alcohol to minors that may have contributed to the injured student’s condition on Sept. 28.""

Delta Tau Delta said in a statement, ""The health and safety of our members and guests remain a top priority. We share the University’s commitment to student well-being. Recognizing the concerns that led to the chapter’s interim suspension by the University, we will continue to work closely with them during the review of this situation.""

The teen's hospitalization comes eight months after the death of Beta Theta Pi pledge Tim Piazza. Following his death, Penn State announced new reforms for safety, including limiting alcohol to beer and wine and banning kegs; no daylong events; no more than 10 social events with alcohol per semester; sanctions for Greek organizations that don't prevent underage consumption and excessive drinking; and the university taking control of the fraternity and sorority misconduct and adjudication process.

Penn State also said all fraternities have been under a ban on alcohol-involved social functions until undergoing additional alcohol education and training.

Damon Sims, vice president for Student Affairs, said in Penn State's statement, ""The potential involvement of Delta Tau Delta is very disturbing news, given all of the recent efforts and education that have gone into emphasizing student safety.”

“None of us can be tolerant of organizations or individuals who value access to alcohol above student welfare,"" Sims said. ""We'll see where our investigation of this incident leads.""

Sims added, ""University leaders have acknowledged that excessive underage drinking is a vexing problem on campuses nationwide and true change will not happen without the members, chapters, alumni boards, housing boards, council, and national organizations commitment and partnership in putting student safety first.""

Penn State Greek life has been under a national spotlight since Feb. 4, when 19-year-old Piazza died after he fell down stairs at a fraternity house two days earlier during a night of drinking for a pledge ceremony.

Fraternity members did not call 911 until the morning of Feb. 3, about 12 hours after Piazza's fall, according to a report on the grand jury's investigation. High-quality surveillance video captured Piazza's final movements throughout that night, including him falling multiple times. Piazza's death ""was the direct result of traumatic brain injuries,"" according to the forensic pathologist.

Prosecutors allege that the former fraternity brothers waited to get Piazza help in an attempt to cover up their drinking and ""coordinate a story.""

But defense attorneys say a ""tragedy ... doesn't mean there's any intent involved in any of this.""

Eighteen former members of Penn State's Beta Theta Pi were initially facing charges.

On Sept. 1 charges were dismissed completely against four of the former fraternity members who were facing single counts of either tampering with evidence or recklessly endangering another person in this case.

The most serious charges -- involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault -- were also dropped for eight former fraternity members.

Cases against 14 students will head to trial but for less serious alleged offenses.

The fraternity itself is also facing charges.

Trump deemed any NFL player who decided to take a knee while the national anthem as disrespecting the Stars and Stripes.

""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say: 'Get that son of a b---- off the field right now, out. He's fired. He's fired,"" the president boomed to the crowd.

Since those comments Kaepernick's mother, Teresa Kaepernick tweeted back: ""Guess that makes me a proud b----!""

This comes just months after another fraternity at the school, Beta Theta Pi, was banned following the death of a pledge.

On Sept. 28, an 18-year-old male student who allegedly became intoxicated at Delta Tau Delta was found unconscious off campus by police, Penn State said in a statement. The student was hospitalized and is recovering, the school said.

Penn State said Delta Tau Delta fraternity functions are ""suspended on an interim basis"" pending an investigation into the teen's injuries.

Penn State said its Office of Student Conduct is investigating any alleged connection Delta Tau Delta may have with the 18-year-old's hospitalization.

""The findings of the investigation will provide direction for decisions or sanctions that could follow,"" the university said. ""The Office of Student Conduct also is looking into whether individual students had a role in providing alcohol to minors that may have contributed to the injured student’s condition on Sept. 28.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/ohio-mayor-asks-trump-combating-lake-erie-algae-50343121,['Abc News'],,[],,"Three years after toxic algae in Lake Erie tainted the drinking water for more than 400,000 people, many are still leery about what's coming out of their faucets.

Some have taken to stockpiling bottled water in the summer months when algae blooms blanket the western end in the shallowest of the Great Lakes.

Store shelves were emptied of bottled water a week ago when algae pushed into a river that flows through downtown Toledo into the lake, turning the river fluorescent green and sparking rumors that another ""do not drink"" advisory was looming.

It wasn't the first time there's been a run on bottled water even though there have been no water warnings since the first one in 2014.

Toledo's mayor has asked President Donald Trump for help from the federal government in cleaning up the lake and wants the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to declare the western end impaired, which would allow for increased pollution regulations.

""There is something very wrong with our country when our rivers and lakes turn green,"" Mayor Paula Hicks-Hudson wrote in a letter sent to Trump last week. ""As I look out my office at a green river, I can tell you one thing: the status quo is not working.""

A message seeking comment on the letter was left with the White House.

Scientists largely blame farm fertilizer runoff and municipal sewage overflows for feeding the algae growth. While there are a number of efforts to tackle the problem, it won't be solved for years.

This year's algae bloom has stretched along the shores of Ohio, Michigan and Ontario, Canada, and will be among the largest in recent years. The 2015 bloom was the largest on record, covering an area the size of New York City.

The uncertainty some still have about the Toledo's drinking water, the mayor said in an interview Wednesday, shows there's a general mistrust about what some hear from government leaders and how easily rumors spread.

She pointed to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and how residents there were told the water was safe for months despite dangerous lead levels.

""We're going to do what we can to regain their trust,"" said Hicks-Hudson, a Democrat who's up for re-election in November. ""That's all we can do.""

She said she has spent many hours talking with residents and reassuring them the water is safe. ""Some will give me a suspicious look,"" she said.

The tap water, she said, is tested daily and more often than the state requires. The city also has invested in upgrading its treatment plant and there's an early warning system in the lake to notify the plant's operators when toxic algae is increasing.

The city also has created a site that shows the daily tests on raw and treated water. But that's not enough for some.

Tammie Nixon, of Toledo, said her family hasn't drunk the city's water since officials issued a ""do not drink"" for two days in September 2014. She was pregnant at the time and now also has a 3-month-old.

""Definitely not with the kids,"" she said while loading jugs of milk and water into her car at the grocery. ""It's kind of scary. There's only so much you can filter out.""",,,
http://abcnews.go.com/Health/patients-recommendations-prostate-cancer-screening/story?id=46726379,['Abc News'],,[],,"In a decision of concern to many middle-aged men and the doctors who care for them, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, has changed its recommendation for prostate cancer screening specifically related to the blood test that measures prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, which can indicate a growing cancer.

Prostate cancer is diagnosed in about 180,000 men every year and leads to roughly 26,000 deaths annually. But many men can live with the disease for years without its causing serious illness.

The task force, a panel of experts supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, today is advising men between the ages of 55 and 69 to start a conversation with their doctors about whether to have a PSA test based on each patient’s personal values and priorities. While a PSA test itself isn’t invasive -- it requires drawing blood -- experts are concerned that patients may end up undergoing invasive procedures despite having little chance of developing an aggressive cancer.

Here’s a breakdown of what patients should know about the recommendation change.

What should patients keep in mind when they go to the doctor?

The new guidelines are relatively simple: Men between the ages of 55 to 69 should start a conversation with their doctors about whether to have a PSA test and focus on their own values and priorities. The group continues to recommend against PSA testing for men 70 and older because the harm can outweigh any benefits.

What were the previous recommendations?

Prostate cancer screening is notoriously rife with uncertainty, and the previous 2012 guidelines advised against PSA testing. This is in part because high levels of PSA often spur more invasive steps.

Many men who have high PSA levels undergo a biopsy, which provides vital insight into whether a man has cancer but can’t predict how aggressive it might be. While many prostate cancers cause no problems, men may opt for radiation or surgery, which can cause sexual impotence and/or bowel and bladder problems.

The new recommendations may help patients get personalized care to address their health and specific concerns.

The guidelines empower patients to talk with their doctor about personalized care tailored to their health and priorities, Dr. Jeff Karnes, a urologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who was not involved in the new recommendations, told ABC News.

“A man should be allowed to discuss with his physician whether to have a PSA ordered or not,” Karnes said.

Does a high PSA mean you have cancer?

Dr. Alex Krist, a member of the USPSTF task force and a family medicine doctor at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, said a high PSA may not necessarily point to prostate cancer. Other conditions can affect the results.

“Many men will have a high PSA at some point in their lives, and most of those will not be prostate cancer but that will be something that the patient and doctor will be worried about” and will evaluate, Krist told ABC News.

Additionally, prostate cancer in many patients may not result in dangerous complications. Many people may not even be aware they have the disease.

Prostate cancer is so common that one published 2015 study reported more than one-third of white men and one-half of black men ages 70 to 79 were found to have previously undiagnosed prostate cancer on autopsy.

Krist said the uncertainty at every step of the way in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer makes it crucial for men to discuss the options, and their concerns, with their doctors.

Why did the recommendations change?

The new guidance stems from recent evidence of the benefits of screening, and from a movement among prostate specialists toward active surveillance. In this approach, doctors keep a close eye on men with a high risk of prostate cancer, rather than treating outright.

“There is a close balance of benefits and harms,” Krist said, “and that’s why it’s important for men to be involved in making the decision of whether screening is right for them.”

The staggering count of people injured in the shooting at a Las Vegas music festival means their recoveries are likely to be as varied as the victims themselves. Some injuries are as simple as broken bones, others gunshot wounds involving multiple surgeries and potential transplants, and all come with the added emotional scars of enduring the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history, with 59 killed.

At least 130 people remained hospitalized Tuesday, with 48 listed in critical condition. Hospitals said 185 others had already been released. At Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center alone, the count of those treated included 120 people who were struck by gunfire, a glimpse of the amount of ammunition unleashed in the attack.

Rehabilitation for the most seriously hurt victims will take far longer than many may realize.

""Years,"" said Dr. Thomas Scalea, physician-in-chief at the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, one of the nation's largest trauma centers. ""It's not days or weeks.""

Edward Leon raced to Las Vegas from Palm Springs, California, after learning his niece was shot in the stomach. He said he cried the whole way there. Although she survived an initial operation, he worries about what will come next.

""She's out of surgery,"" he said, ""but it's a long road ahead.""

At the site of the attack, people fashioned stretchers out of fence posts and tarps, and tourniquets from belts. At area hospitals, the scene was similarly grave.

""It was like a war zone,"" said Dr. Jay Coates, a trauma surgeon at University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, who operated on three people with gunshot wounds.

Coates saw news of the shooting flash across his phone Sunday night and rushed to the hospital. Ambulances were parked four and five deep. Dozens of wounded filled the trauma bay inside. There were people with injuries to their lungs, liver and spleens, some with huge wounds torn open by bullets. Eight or nine surgeons made flash assessments.

""At this point, I'm still processing. I have no idea who I operated on,"" Coates said. ""They were coming in so fast. ... We were just trying to keep people from dying.""

Mike Kordich, a firefighter from Rancho Cucamonga, California, was giving CPR to a severely injured person at the concert when he was hit in the arm by a bullet.

""I kept doing chest compressions with one arm until I noticed I was starting to bleed a lot,"" Kordich recalled. He ran for cover, jumping fences, and said he could hear the bullets whizzing by.

In the hours after the shooting, workers rushed to mop up blood at UMC's 11-bed trauma center, but by Tuesday, it sat empty and quiet. Those caring for survivors of the attack were working to keep pain controlled and wounds clean and safe from infection. Some people seeking word on a missing friend or relative milled around in hopes of a clue.

""We still don't know if our friend is dead or alive,"" said Kris Delarosby, who flew in from Minnesota to search for friend Steve Berger, who was among the dead.

For those who did survive, their prognoses depend heavily on where exactly the bullets struck.

""It really is a game of millimeters and centimeters,"" said Dr. Jack Sava, trauma director at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C.

Bullets can pass through a victim's body and miss vital organs, or veer slightly and leave a person paralyzed or dead. Sava cared for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, a Republican who was shot during a congressional baseball practice over the summer, and said patients and their families have to deal with the uncertainty of their recoveries.

""There's so many things that happen, so many branches in the road,"" he said. ""A lot of times in trauma we talk about death, and that's a tiny tip of the suffering that's caused by injury and gunshot wounds. For every person we talk about living or dying, there's an ocean of suffering we're not talking about.""

Rob McIntosh, a 52-year-old from North Pole, Alaska, is among those facing that recovery, having been hit by three bullets at the concert, according to his friend, Mike Vansickle. He said McIntosh had emerged from surgery and would survive.

""He'll get through all this and come out with some stories to tell,"" Vansickle said.

Others who have been through such trials sounded similar notes of optimism, including Jeff Bauman, who lost his legs in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. In a Facebook post, Bauman said those waking up in hospitals may wonder how life could ever be the same again, but they will find a way through the tough moments to go on.

""You will walk again. You will laugh again. You will dance again,"" he wrote. ""You will live again.""

The content of the emails was first reported by The Washington Post. The correspondence was then independently procured by ABC News.

In the emails, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya wrote to promoter Rob Goldstone about including in the meeting an associate, Rinat Akhmetshin, who had been lobbying Congress about, as the attorney said, ""these issues"" and who ""has invaluable knowledge about the positions held by the members of the Foreign Relations Committee that will be important to our discussion.""

Though Veselnitskaya does not specifically mention it, the emails imply that she is referring to the Magnitsky Act, a 2012 law that barred certain Russian officials from entering the U.S. and subsequently led to the Russian government blocking Americans from adopting Russian children. The attorney was engaged in efforts at the time to repeal the law.

When news of the meeting on June 9, 2016, emerged earlier this year, Trump Jr. released a statement saying that Veselnitskaya ""wanted to talk about adoption policy and the Magnitsky Act,"" although a separate email revealed that Goldstone told Trump Jr. he was in contact with someone who offered to provide ""information that would incriminate Hillary [Clinton]."" Trump Jr. responded to that email by writing, ""if it's what you say, I love it.""

Veselnitskaya told ABC News in an interview in Moscow in July of this year that it was always her intention to discuss adoptions.

The June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, which was also attended by then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and then-candidate Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, has attracted the attention of special counsel Robert Mueller who is investigating Russian interference in last year's election and potential collusion with the campaign.",,,

He was 66.

Mooney’s news career stretched from the age of typewriter ribbons to Twitter, and he worked for a variety of outlets, including the United Press International wire service, The New York Post, The New York Daily News, ABCNews.com and CNNMoney.

By the end of his run in the trade, he had served as war correspondent, a New York City Hall bureau chief and a national editor and had covered news beats ranging from education to prisons. He edited thousands of new stories over four decades.

Mooney wrote his own obituary, “My last byline,” which was published by his wife on the day of his death.

“I’m sure you’ve heard the old saw that you’ll never hear a dying man say that he wished he had spent more time at the office,” it began. “But if I were still here I would tell you that I wish I had done more work as a news reporter. Written better stories. Made more and better contacts. Skipped some of the easier pieces and done more in-depth stories. Spent more time on foreign stories. Been a better editor.

“I loved being a reporter. (Journalist is kind of a lace curtain word for the job.) It’s where I met most of my best friends. It’s where I met my wife Barbara, also a reporter. It’s where I had my biggest audiences. “And take a look at the top of this page, that byline. It looks good, right?”

Influential mentor

Widely remembered as a thoughtful editor with a deft touch for the language of news, Mooney was liked and admired by both the old guard New York City print veterans with whom he grew up and Snapchatting millennials. His proteges include now Washington Post Baghdad bureau chief Tamer El-Ghobashy, who recalled in a recent email to Mooney how the older man had sent the young reporter on his first overseas assignment for The New York Daily News.

“I can't overstate the impact you’ve had on me as a journalist and how that one opportunity in 2006 — when you sent me to Lebanon with 500 bucks and ill-fitting body armor — formed me as a man and a journalist,” he wrote in the email, which was read to Mooney by his wife. “Your support, feedback and enthusiasm for the work I produced gave me energy when I was overwhelmed by the task and by my own fear and inexperience.”

At ABCNews.com, Mooney was an influential mentor to scores of younger journalists.

“I can’t imagine [a newsroom] without Mooney — barking out orders and commentary, swaggering over to reporters’ row for another round of boot-camp editing, an act of bravado, toughness … and great affection,” former ABCNews.com editor Nancy Ramsey said.

Former ABCNews.com business reporter Susanna Kim said Mooney never let a story that could be better slip through his fingers.

“Instead of emailing … he would pull up a chair next to my desk and, with sincere honesty, tell me that my lede [paragraph] was a piece of crap — in the nicest possible way.”

‘My last byline’

Mooney wrote nearly until his death last week, penning his modest, 478-word obituary as the coda to a yearlong blog about his cancer.

Mooney underwent treatment for prostate cancer for 12 years, but in the fall of 2016 it spread to his spine and other parts of his skeleton. He began to chronicle his failing health in a Medium.com blog, which concluded last week with “My last byline.”

Mooney reported on his impending death with blunt, unsentimental humor, and in his final months he pecked out short, clever, heartbreaking blog posts with headlines that aimed to leaven the brutality of the encroaching disease — “You can leave the oxygen tank next to the firecrackers” and “Cancer complaints interrupted by a great story” — about his last, packed-house reading from “Three Cents a Mile,” his recent memoir of hitchhiking across Southeast Asia and Europe in his 20s.

The posts grew graver with time: “I am breathing, I am safe,” about his terrifying bouts with breathlessness, his decision to end chemotherapy and a moving love letter to his wife and primary caregiver, Barbara Goldberg, a Thomson Reuters national correspondent based in New York. As the cancer progressed, his blog following grew.

‘Three Cents a Mile’

A graduate of New York’s Fordham University, Mooney covered politics for The Westchester News in the mid-1970s but quit the job and set out for Bangkok, where he wrote for a business journal and began hitchhiking his way around Southeast Asia and Europe — colorful adventures that he chronicled in “Three Cents a Mile.”

He was dazzled by Paris.

For a few months in his 20s, he lived in the second-floor writer’s room above the Shakespeare & Company bookstore in Paris and opened the shop in the morning while the owner slept in.

“I loved the routine of opening up,” he wrote. “Emerging from the store in the early morning, a bank of thick fog would be laying right on top of the Seine, muffling the city’s noise. Poking through the top of that gauze were the majestic spires of Notre Dame. It was like a hymn.”

Mooney reported for United Press International in the early 1980s and served as the wire service’s New York City Hall bureau chief.

In 1986 he moved to The New York Post, which early on sent him abroad with assignments that included covering the first Gulf War, a coup in Haiti and the assassination of then–Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.

“Mark was a reason to love hanging out in the old Post newsroom — with those eyes that literally twinkled at the absurdity of it all,” Post reporter Cathy Burke said.

In 1991, Mooney headed to The New York Daily News, where he was appointed national editor in 2000. He also covered a variety of beats, including health and hospitals, prisons, emergency services and City Hall politics. He was named the paper’s national editor in 2000 and held that position for seven years before his departure.

“Mark Mooney — it was just one of those power bylines you wanted on your side in a big city tabloid war,” New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg, who worked with Mooney at The New York Daily News, said. “You always knew he had your back when he dispatched you into the news storm.”

In 2007 he was appointed national editor at ABCNews.com, where he managed breaking news stories and ran the website’s U.S. and international coverage. He also mentored scores of young reporters, many of whom arrived at the network with little or no formal training in print reporting.

“He taught me that even on your worst day, be grateful that you get to tell stories for a living,” former colleague Katie Morison, now an MSN news editor, said.

Former colleague Nikki Batiste, now a CBS News correspondent, said Mooney was her digital counterpart at ABC for the Amanda Knox murder case in Perugia, Italy, and the two of them grew close over the seven years they worked together.

""Here’s a secret,” she said. “It was Mark Mooney who wrote those 300 ABC News articles on the Knox case. No one knew because he always refused to give himself a byline.”

In late 2011, Mooney embraced social media.

“I helped him set up his Twitter account,” ABC News producer Christina Ng said. “He was so excited about it, and we were in constant competition for followers.""

She continued, “He was inching toward 500 [followers], and he knew every single one of them. I remember someone stopped following him, and he knew who it was, and he wanted to confront them to find out why they unfollowed him.”

“I was like, ‘God, no.’”

When Mooney hit his mark, he took newsroom reporters out for drinks at a dive bar near ABC News’ headquarters in Manhattan.

“I remember how giddy he was — Jameson [whiskey] in hand – celebrating his Twitter milestone,” former ABCNews.com reporter Alyssa Newcomb, now a technology reporter at NBC News, said.

In the end, social media served Mooney well.

His self-penned obituary spread rapidly on social media, prompting click-friendly story headlines like “Reporter writes his own obituary” and tweets from reporters like Karen Tumulty, a national political correspondent for The Washington Post: “Never met this guy, but really wish I had.”

Ng said it was gratifying to watch “My last byline” spread online last Friday.

“You know what?” she said. “He wouldn’t ever want to be the story, but you know, he would have loved this. It would have delighted him.”

Mooney is survived by Goldberg and children Paul and Maura Mooney, whom he described in his obituary as “my holy trinity.”",,,
http://abcnews.go.com/US/student-sues-fraternity-alleging-hazing-ritual-left-brain/story?id=50336145,"['Abc News', 'More Enjoli']",,[],,"The son of a legendary Dallas Cowboys player is now suing a University of Oklahoma fraternity, alleging that a hazing ritual left him with permanent brain damage so severe he can no longer remember his Social Security number.

According to lawyer Christopher Cooke, Blake Novacek, 20, whose father is former NFL tight end Jay Novacek, was subjected to numerous hazing incidents as he pledged the Gamma Phi chapter of Beta Theta Pi fraternity in the fall semester of 2015.

""Frankly, Blake's parents sent him off as a happy, healthy, well-adjusted boy and he came back a basket case,"" Cooke said.

LSU fraternity pledge may have been 'forced to drink in excess' before death

Wheaton College doubted football player’s story of alleged hazing: Documents

In court documents related to the lawsuit, Blake Novacek said that on Oct. 11, 2015, he was taken into Shane Musselman's room, where Musselman asked him to recite pledge facts.

When he was unable to do that, the complaint alleges, Novacek was struck in the stomach with a baseball bat, which caused him to ""fall backwards and strike his head on a hard object, knocking [him] unconscious.""

Cooke, his lawyer, said he was knocked unconscious around 2:30 a.m. and woke up at noon. According to the complaint, he awoke ""on a couch in the fraternity house. His clothes had been laundered and were folded beside him.""

The complaint alleged that after the incident, Novacek ""was then confronted by Defendant Gavin Martindale, who told Plaintiff to keep his mouth shut about the hazing incident.""

The lawsuit also includes Martindale and Musselman.

In a statement to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Musselman said: ""The allegations against me are completely false, and I have no idea why they are being made. My family is hiring an attorney, and I intend to aggressively fight this suit and defend my reputation.""

Martindale told OUDaily: ""I'm bewildered by this lawsuit. The allegations are entirely untrue, and I'm mystified why this person is making these claims against me. To be honest, I'm angry about this, and I will be hiring a lawyer to aggressively defend me against these baseless accusations.""

Cooke said Novacek had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, bipolar disorder and postconcussive syndrome, and is under the care of numerous doctors.

""All of this was brought on by the injury,"" Cooke said. ""As time has gone on and he realizes the extent of his brain injury, he felt compelled to bring this lawsuit.""

""Blake dropped out after the fall semester and he does not currently attend class,"" he said.

In a statement, the fraternity called Novacek’s allegations ""false and inflammatory.""

""We take any allegations of this character very seriously. However, since learning of this lawsuit, we have performed an initial investigation of Blake's allegations and have yet to uncover any evidence whatsoever which corroborates the substance of his claims. To the contrary, we have numerous witness accounts and other evidence which contradict Blake’s story and which question his credibility. Based on our investigations to date, we firmly believe Blake’s allegations are false and that his lawsuit is entirely without merit,"" the fraternity said.

""We note in particular that Blake's petition alleges the subject events occurred in the early morning of Sunday, October 11, 2015. In fact, no pledge or other fraternity activities occurred on that date. This date occurred during the weekend for the OU-Texas football game in Dallas, Texas, which was attended by nearly all the fraternity’s members and pledges, including Blake and the two individual members named in the suit.

‘Furthermore, while the plaintiff claims to have been in Norman the morning of October 11, 2015, he was actually in Arlington, Texas for the Dallas Cowboys game that day, as seen in the Instagram photograph below. Witness accounts confirm that he did not return to Norman until late that evening, and that neither he nor any other pledges were at the chapter house at any point during that day.""

The University of Oklahoma said in a statement: ""The university investigates every report of a violation of the Student Rights and Responsibilities Code. It would not be appropriate to comment on matters involved in pending litigation.""

The fraternity's national office said in a statement: ""Active litigation prohibits specific commentary on the matter, but Beta Theta Pi's position on hazing is unequivocal and unwavering: it is not condoned and it will not be tolerated. As such, and given that Beta has long been one of OU's hallmark student and alumni organizations, the General Fraternity is working closely with local alumni and undergraduate leaders in Norman to determine the basis for allegations they deem to be unfounded and without merit. We remain convinced that Beta's record of leadership and character will shed important light on these claims, and are committed to that truth, whatever it may be.""

Cooke told ABC News today that after Novacek was injured, he lost the ability to process dates. Cooke said the Oct. 11, 2015 date was the closest in Novacek's mind, and that the incident had happened sometime shortly after the OU-Texas game.

Cooke said he plans to amend court papers.

MARTHA RADDATZ, HOST: One week of tragedy in Las Vegas.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody, go.

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: America is truly a nation in mourning.

RADDATZ: Still so many unanswered questions.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We are looking at every aspect from birth to death of this suspect.

RADDATZ: What was the gunman's motive? This morning, our team with the latest details as we learn more about the attacker.

TRUMP: This was a sick person, but probably smart.

RADDATZ: And as the gun control debate reignites.

REP. JOHN LEWIS, (D) GEORGIA: After Newtown and Aurora, after Charleston and Orlando, now Las Vegas, how many more must die?

RADDATZ: Is the White House open to new regulations, and will congress take action? I talk to representatives from both sides of the aisle in a rare conversation together.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why are we so afraid to have a conversation?

UNIDENIFIED MALE: So I'm not afraid to have a conversation. I'm here having a conversation.

RADDATZ: Can they bridge the divide?

Plus, Trump's cryptic comments.

TRUMP: You guys know what this represents? Maybe it's the calm before the storm.

RADDATZ: What does that really mean? And faced with tensions at home and abroad, what's the president's next move? Our Powerhouse Roundtable takes that on and the latest on the Gulf Coast taking a direct hit from Tropical Storm Nate.

From the White House to your house, we take on the moments that mattered this week.

ANNOUNCER: From ABC News, it's This Week. Here now, co-anchor Martha Raddatz.

RADDATZ: Good morning.

What a week. A devastating national tragedy in Las Vegas claiming 58 lives and leaving hundreds injured. An epic natural disaster in Puerto Rico. Millions of American citizens still struggling to recover. An alarming nuclear showdown with North Korea, both sides doubling down.

Over the next hour, we'll explore the president's response to crises both at home and abroad. And in just a moment, a rare conversation with two lawmakers, both Iraq War veterans, from opposite sides of the aisle on whether a new generation of lawmakers has what it takes to break through the stalemate over guns.

But we begin with yet another challenge, a dangerous tropical storm now making its way through the south. It hit land overnight as a category 1 hurricane, the fourth hurricane to hit the U.S. this season.

Let's go to ABC's Steve Osunsami in Biloxi, Mississippi, where Hurricane Nate made landfall last night. Good morning, Steve. A long night there for you.

STEVE OSUNSAMI, ABC NEWS: Yes, it was.

Martha, one of the things we noticed when we went out looking this morning is directly behind me, this sailboat shouldn't be here. The winds, which we know reached up to 85 miles an hour were strong enough to push it from wherever it was onto the beach. Another thing that they're dealing with this morning is cleaning up after the storm surge. The water that came into the casinos, their basements was so high, it flooded cars that were in their barking garages. We're talking about several feet of water. It has since receded.

City officials here, though, say that they are fortunate and thankful that no one was hurt. There doesn't appear to be any homes that were destroyed, but the cleanup will certainly begin here this morning -- Martha.

RADDATZ: Thanks very much, Steve. Let's look at the forecast for Nate with ABC News senior meteorologist Rob Marciano.

Rob, where does this storm head now?

ROB MARCIANO, ABC NEWS SENIOR METEOROLOGIST: Well, good morning, Martha. It is racing off towards the north and east. And saving grace with Nate the whole time has been its forward speed allow it not to really strengthen to a major hurricane. And now it's weakening rapidly as it races across Alabama. Heavy rain with this. And the track is going to bring it across Tennessee and up through Kentucky over the Appalachians and into the northeast over the next two days.

So everybody in the eastern quarter of the country really going to get a piece of what Nate has to offer. And that include some wind. Most of the wing, pretty much all of the heavy wind is east of the center. And we could see some more power outages in northern Alabama and Georgia today as winds gust well over 30 miles an our, even winds gusting over 30 miles an hour across the east coast during the day tomorrow.

Rainfall, of course, with this.

Now some folks need the rain, but as with all tropical systems any time you get tropical downpours, it can come down fast and furious and create some flooding here and we expect some of that in pockets over the next 36 to 48 hours.

This is the -- including Maria -- this is the fourth hurricane to make landfall in the U.S. in the last 45 days, and the ninth storm, Martha, to reach hurricane status, an incredibly busy season for sure.

RADDATZ: It certainly has been. Thanks very much, Rob.

MARCIANO: You bet.

RADDATZ: So let's bring in FEMA Administrator Brock Long.

Mr. Long, thanks for joining us this morning. Tell us what FEMA is doing right now.

BROCK LONG, FEMA ADMINISTRATOR: Good morning. So right now the focus is on supporting all of the governors from Louisiana to Florida with their life-saving missions. Over the past 48 to 72 hours we've been working with them around the clock to pre-stage commodities and embed our incident management teams with the emergency management directors in their EOCs.

The most important thing about this storm is this is one of the fastest-moving storms in the Gulf Coast since they've started to record tropical history. And so that's very dangerous for many reasons. One, while it's a 45-mile-per-hour tropical storm right now, you have to add to it the forward speed of 23 miles an hour.

So basically hurricane-force winds or just right at hurricane-force winds are going to pass through many portions of Alabama into Tennessee. And then also when it interacts with the mountains within western North Carolina, a lot of rainfall is going to occur from this as well.

RADDATZ: And we know it's the fourth hurricane so far this year. We have about two months left in hurricane season. What are your concerns going forward? Do you have enough people? Do you have enough money?

LONG: Money is not the issue. Congress has been on top of that working with us. Back on October1, we had another 6.7 billion added to the disaster relief fund. And we continue to update them on a regular basis and will ask for supplementals as needed.

In regards to resources, of course we're strained. You know, bottom line is, is that over nearly 85 percent of my entire agency is deployed right now. We're still working massive issues in Harvey, Irma, as well as the issues in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and now this one.

But the bottom line is, is that we're positioned to support Nate, you know, very well. The next thing is, is that, you know, some of the fail-safes that we have are through mutual aid agreements with states to be able to call upon emergency managers from other states and around the states if we continue to have more disasters.

RADDATZ: And, Mr. Long, let's turn to Puerto Rico. The mayor of San Juan tweeting again this morning, saying power collapses in San Juan hospital with two patients being transferred out, have requested support from FEMA, Brock, nothing.

And she also says: ""Increasingly painful to understand the American people want to help and U.S. government does not want to help. We need water."" What's your reaction to that?

LONG: We filtered out the mayor a long time ago. We don't have time for the political noise. The bottom line is, is that we are making progress every day in conjunction with the governor. And in regards to the power failure, we're restringing a very fragile system every day. As we make progress, simple thunder storms pass through, knocked the progress out.

Rebuilding, rebuilding Puerto Rico is going to be a greater conversation for the Congress in conjunction with the governor on how they're -- you know, what the way forward is in the future of Puerto Rico.

But in regards to the power outages and the hospitals, we built an entire 911 system. We monitor the hospital system daily. And so if there is a power failure at a hospital, which we've seen two of, you know, over this past week, we're actually life-flighting (ph) the ICU patients out of those hospitals, onto the USS Comfort.

And we continue to stabilize that situation with hospitals. But as far as the political noise, we filter that out, keeps our heads down, and continue to make progress, and push forward restoring essential functions for Puerto Rico.

RADDATZ: OK, thanks very much for joining us, Mr. Long.

LONG: Thank you.

So basically hurricane-force winds or just right at hurricane-force winds are going to pass through many portions of Alabama into Tennessee. And then also when it interacts with the mountains within western North Carolina, a lot of rainfall is going to occur from this as well.

LONG: Thank you.

RADDATZ: Now to new revelations overnight about the state of mind of the Las Vegas killer, about the meaning of those numbers left behind on a note and new insight into what may have driven him to mass murder. Last night the president praised the police response to the shooting, saying their swift action saved lives.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: You know, they got to that room very quickly. Now, they didn't get in because they were playing all sorts of things, they didn't know, are there bombs in there? What -- but they kept his attention. He stopped shooting. In other words, he was focused because you had cameras out there. This was a sick person. But probably smart and he had cameras. But they got there so quickly.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RADDATZ: A sick person, but probably smart. Joining me now with the very latest on the mind-set of the shooter, ABC News senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas and former FBI special agent and ABC News contributor Brad Garrett.

Good morning, gentlemen. Here we are talking about these things once again. But, Pierre, I know you have some reporting overnight about the state of the shooter's mind.

PIERRE THOMAS, ABC SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the portrait that's emerging is of a man who had probably severe undiagnosed mental health issues. And they are stunned that nearly a week out they still have no clear motive after hundreds of interviews spanning this country and overseas, no manifesto, no suicide note, no social media footprint, nothing to indicate a clear motive, Martha, and they're quite frustrated.

RADDATZ: And what led them to believe there was undiagnosed mental illness? Obviously anybody who carries out something like this, something is wrong with them. But give us a little more detail, if you can.

THOMAS: Well, the profilers at the FBI and behavioral scientists are looking at some of the witness interviews that have been done. And the portrait that emerges is of a man who had difficulty connecting with people, anti-social behavior. It's a lot of the patterns that they've seen in past mass shooters. And they think that's what's unfolding here.

RADDATZ: And, Brad, you and I have sat in my office for hours this week trying to take a look at this. It has been fascinating hearing what you have to say as you look at this, because this seems so unlike mass shootings before.

BRAD GARRETT, ABC CONTRIBUTOR: Well, think about it this way, Martha. You have a guy who is wealthy, What does that buy you? Isolation and independence. You don't need the rest of us to get through your day. Well, the rest of us, that's what gives you feedback and it also would give law enforcement or mental health people feedback.

This is a guy that totally lived on his own, gambled 10, 12, 14 hours a day. And so as...

RADDATZ: Was in a relationship, though.

GARRETT: Well, yes, but I think not in a relationship that most of us would define as far as super closeness, I know what you're doing all the time, particularly what was going on inside his head. And so what happens is you get older, all of that stuff starts to distort even bigger.

And I think, you know, anxiety and depression are super high in gamblers. And I think the combination of that and the isolation, the rage continued to build up. What's fascinating with him, he chose to pick a venue where his total identity was hooked.

RADDATZ: I was at a gun shop this week. And I want to run something with the owner of that gun shop, which I asked him about who he'd sell a weapon to.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you say something that I don't like because it made me feel uncomfortable, then you're not getting a gun.

RADDATZ: What kind of things would make you feel uncomfortable?

UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Questions like, you know, what's the effective range on human targets? Does one round or another make things blow up?

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RADDATZ: So what do you do about a person like that, Pierre? He could report that person. What could the police do? And back to that mental health issue, you don't want to stigmatize people with mental health issues.

THOMAS: Martha, this is truly the nightmare scenario. You have a man with no criminal background, no real ties to terror, nothing that would indicate that he would be a person that would do this outwardly. So one of the things that they are doing right now is they're going back and they're talking to all these different people that know him and they're looking at what was going on, particularly August...

RADDATZ: Birth to death, right?

THOMAS: Birth to death, but there's a time frame of September to October of last year when he began buying the guns in a much more sustained pattern. And also some of the gambling amounts went up significantly, sources are telling me.

RADDATZ: And, Brad, just quickly, really what can be done about this? I mean, in a way it sort of lowers the bar for what you're looking at in a mass murder?

GARRETT: That's exactly right. We're looking for things that are obvious, people talking to other people, people know that you're buying the guns. But when you have somebody like him that leads -- basically lives his life in total isolation, you're not unfortunately going to stop him, because he didn't talk to anybody. That's the scary thing about this shooter.

RADDATZ: OK, thanks very much, Brad and Pierre, we love to hear your insights on this.

After horrific events like what happened in Las Vegas, you get the gun debate. One side yelling at the other, not enough talking. If you find that frustrating, you have to stick around for this, Is this the generation that can crack the impasse over guns? Two members of Congress, both veterans, at my kitchen table on opposite sides working it out. That's next. Please stay tuned.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: That is a bump stock, the device used by the Las Vegas shooter to fire off almost 10 rounds a second, close to the rate of fire from an automatic weapon.

There's a lot of talk in congress this week that bump stocks should be regulated just like machine guns. The NRA even willing to consider that.

It's a rare moment where both sides on the gun debate seem like they may be able to agree, rare, because as we all know, mass shootings almost always send the opposing camps deep into their bunkers.

So, what will it take to break the logjam on the big issues that divide the country on guns? Will it take a new generation? Maybe combat veterans who know all about guns and the damage they cause to get past the politics.

So we got two members of congress, both 38 years old, who have very different views on the gun control debate, to sit together at my kitchen table.

Virginia Republican Scott Taylor, a former Navy SEAL sniper who saw combat in Iraq and recovered from severe injuries sustained there; and Massachusetts Democrat Seth Moulton, a former Marine Corps captain and combat platoon leader who had four tours in Iraq.

And I began by asking Congressman Moulton to make the case for why he thinks gun restriction would decrease gun violence.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

REP. SETH MOULTON, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: Well, it's shown -- they're shown to affect gun violence. I mean, there are plenty of studies that show that states that have tighter gun laws have less gun violence. And this is an American epidemic. It's really a public health crisis.

I've seen the effects of gun violence firsthand in Iraq. And I know that it has no place in our schools, on our streets, at our concerts. And there are things that we can do to reduce it that within the second amendment.

You know, Scott and I swore an oath to protect and defend the constitution of the United States, both as members of congress, and the same oath as a Navy SEAL and a United States Marine, so I don't want to do anything that violates the constitution. But there are common sense things that we can do if democrats and Republicans come together to reduce this violence in our communities.

RADDATZ: You feel entirely differently.

REP. SCOTT TAYLOR, (R) VIRGINIA: Sure.

And let me say it's great to be with you, it's great to be with Seth as well, too. And, look, he like most other folks in congress, both Dems and Republicans, care very deeply about this country. They want to protect the constitution. They want to protect their people. I understand that for sure.

But at the same time, you know when you have a situation that happened, which was tragic, traumatic, and everyone feels the same emotion, they do. But it's up to leaders like us to have -- to see clarity through the emotional chaos and understand that it is a high, very high bar, to be able to take some folks' rights away to try to enact policies that may take their rights away, but not really do anything.

So, when you look at gun violence in America, and when you look at deaths, when you look at like 30,000 some thousand gun -- the overwhelming majority of them are suicides. The overwhelming majority of them use handguns, right. When you look at some of the populations that are more predisposed, I guess, if you will, to gun violence -- there's domestic disputes, there's young men in certain areas, when you do look at some of the cities. When you look at the numbers of them, the vast majority of gun violence are in a few cities. And all have tight restrictions on guns.

You can't have a gun in D.C., but there's still gun violence.

MOULTON: As Justice Scalia has said, you can have restrictions under the Second Amendment, as we do with any amendment to the United States Constitution.

TAYLOR: It is up to us...

MOULTON: And we already restrict -- I mean, you want to protect your family's home.

TAYLOR: Sure.

MOULTON: And a great way to protect your family's home, as you know as a Navy SEAL, would be have some to land mines out in front and have some grenades stockpiled, but we don't allow that in our community, we don't allow those weapons of war here. We don't allow families to own tanks.

So we have reasonable restrictions that are perfectly respectful of the Second Amendment, and we know from experience that restrictions like this, that common sense reforms will help.

TAYLOR: I would love to comment, because you hear reasonable, you hear common sense. Those are all wonderful words that everybody can agree are great, that sounds well. The reality is, though, reasonable common sense, what does that actually mean?

MOULTON: And I would also say...

TAYLOR: Let me just finish that point, though, because I think again I want to say it, we have to see, you and I, have to see clarity in all this emotion and to say it is a high burden for these constitutional rights that we have, whether it's speech, whether it's freedom of the press, whether it's, you know, gun rights, as well, it's a very high burden that shouldn't be swayed just by political emotion.

RADDATZ: Let me talk about that.

MOULTON: Let me stay for a second, though, because I think a lot of times opponents of making these reforms talk about political emotion.

I mean, I'm sitting here. I'm just trying to do something as a leader, as a representative in congress, of communities that want these reforms. Nine out of ten Americans want background checks on guns. In fact, 69 percent of NRA...

RADDATZ: You agree with that.

TAYLOR: There already are background checks.

RADDATZ: Universal background checks at gun shows.

TAYLOR: When you're a federally licensed...

MOULTON: Without loopholes you can get around.

TAYLOR: When you're a federally licensed arm dealer. If you had universal backgrounds, somebody, if they really wanted to, and you very well know this, would be able to get around -- if they want to do harm, they can do that.

MOULTON: Scott, you can always find an exception, but like we don't say that...

TAYLOR: Yeah, but these are the exceptions. These mass shootings.

MOULTON: We don't say, there are exceptions that are unique to America...

TAYLOR: They're not unique to America.

MOULTON: Oh, yes they're are.

TAYLOR: There are more of them America, that's true.

MOULTON: There are far more of them. Far more.

RADDATZ: Why do you think that is? Let's stop there for a second. Why do you think that is? Why do you think there are far more mass shootings in America.

TAYLOR: Let's talk about that. Some guy just -- in France killed 84 people with a car.

MOULTON: How many mass shootings does France have?

TAYLOR: But that's not the point, Seth. The point is, it is not...

MOULTON: That is the point.

TAYLOR: The point is, it's not unique to America. It's not unique to America. Yes, there are more. There's no question about that. I understand that. But the reality is, like I said, I'm not willing to impede on someone's rights, because just because of emotional rhetoric.

And other thing is, when you look at evidence-based studies. You mentioned studies. The things that are proposed, like the background checks, like the assault ban. You know, I know you were supporting in that, they don't necessarily help reduce gun violence.

MOULTON: Actually backgrounds have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence.

RADDATZ: Let's talk about mass shootings for a second.

TAYLOR: You're a federally licensed arm dealer, you have to have a background check anyway. I get a background check, you get a background check.

MOULTON: Almost 50 percent of gun sales do not happen through federally licensed dealers.

So I mean look...

TAYLOR: How many of those were used in mass shootings? How many of those were used in mass shootings? Because this guy went through a background check. In Vegas, you went through a background check.

MOULTON: You can always find an example of what certain mass shooting...

TAYLOR: But I'm looking for -- you mentioned one thing, you said...

MOULTON: Nine out of 10...

(CROSSTALK)

TAYLOR: I want to get things done, too.

MOULTON: So, let's look at Virginians. Nine out of 10 people...

TAYLOR: That's not true. That is not true.

MOULTON: Nine out of 10 Americans want us to do this. Why are we so afraid to have a conversation?

TAYLOR: So, I'm not afraid to have a conversation. I'm here having a conversation. I am not going -- I'm not willing to impede on people's rights based upon your political desires. I'm just not.

RADDATZ: I want to go back, and you watched this horrible event this week, just horrible, horrible.

TAYLOR: Sure.

RADDATZ: Is there anything you thought that we should do differently as a nation?

TAYLOR: That's a great question.

When you look at -- let's look at this instance, you know, because like I said there's a lot of rhetoric out there. You got to do background checks and all these things. Well, this guy went through checks. And there was nothing -- his brother didn't know anything wrong with him. We didn't.

Look, I'm still struggling with that profile as well too. I don't understand. I think there's probably some other information that is going to come out.

But the reality is when you look at some of the things that have been proposed on the other side are people who want gun control, none of them would have done anything about this issue.

Now, I'm not saying we shouldn't do something, I'm saying when you look at gun violence in America, and when you look at the populations that are more affected by it than other ones, I think there are some things that we can work together on doing.

But simple just saying we're -- gun control without confiscating them, because if you want to confiscate them, yeah, maybe we could do it then, but then you probably have civil war.

RADDATZ: How about fully automatic weapons? Should those be legal without these restriction.

TAYLOR: That's a great question. I watched the video, and I listened to that rate of fire, and I'm sure that you did as well, too, and you probably heard the same thing that I did.

It was faster than semiautomatic. It was not as fast as fully automatic. It wasn't a sustained and fully automatic. But it was fast. The rate of fire was fast.

And I hadn't even heard of bump stocks, and then I did some research on it. I think that that should be re-evaluated. I think they should look at that again and figure out if, in fact, it should meet the same burden of a fully automatic, because, of course, it is faster than semiautomatic.

RADDATZ: How do you draw the line? I mean, semiautomatic, you can fire pretty quickly and do a lot of damage, too. Why do people nose those weapons?

TAYLOR: I don't feel like a semiautomatic weapon rises to that level of an automatic weapon.

I said, I do believe when you look at this bump stock and I think that ATF should re-evaluate them.

MOULTON: Martha, first of all, let me just say that, you know, Scott and I don't agree on all the details here. We both support the Second Amendment. We obviously disagree on exactly how gun reform should be carried out. But I respect the fact that you're willing to have the conversation. And this is the kind of conversation that we should be having; democrats and Republicans across the aisle doing our job as representatives of congress, representing the people in America.

And when the American people are saying we need to do some thing about these mass shootings, we should be having conversations like this.

And I'm actually working on a bipartisan bill that will eliminate this bump stock exception, and will try to address the other ways that you can get around this law.

Look, the gun manufacturers are smart. They figured out a way to get around the law. It's the job of congress to then step in and say that was not our intent. We did not want to provide this loophole in the law, so we should fix it.

RADDATZ: We've had conversations about Fort Hood shooting. We've had conversations about Newtown. We've had conversations about the Navy Yard shooting over the years. Nothing has really changed. So why do you think this will resonate now?

MOULTON: You know, I don't know how many innocent Americans need to die in mass shootings like this before we're willing to simply have these discussions. I'm sitting down with Republicans in the House of Representatives working on legislation because of this mass shooting.

The sad thing is that if we don't get anything done this time, we all know there will be another one. And someday, we'll have the courage to do something that's respectful of the Second Amendment, that respects the fact that we're a society that people like to hunt and people have the right to own guns, but not weapons of war. We have ways that we can reduce this violence. We're not going to elminate it. You're right, Scott. There's no silver bullet that is going to eliminate all of these things.

I mean, look, you live in Virginia. Virginia outlaws homicides and rapes, right? That doesn't mean that people don't get around the law and still figure out how to kill people.

But you're also not going to repeal that law, right, and say we're not going to have any restrictions. I mean, there are common sense reforms, there are common sense laws that we can pass that are respectful of gun rights, that still will reduce this public health crisis in America.

TAYLOR: I hear reasonable. I hear common sense, that sounds great, sounds great. But at the same time, when -- like what are they? What are they that actually, backed by evidence, do something? And I have not seen that. And I know that you support the Second Amendment. We disagree on how much we both support it, or where it is. That's fine. Reasonable people can disagree, of course.

But the Second Amendment is not just for hunting. And you know you hear that a lot, oh, it's for hunting. It's not for hunting. And I get how weapons have changed over time, but the Second Amendment was put in place to be able to overthrow tyranny, and with weapons of war at the time.

Now, look, I don't disagree that people shouldn't have tanks and stuff like that, but let's not misunderstand history. I mean that's why it's there.

So I think there are people who feel very, very strongly about that, very strongly. And same on your side as well too.

And, look, I applaud you for reaching across the aisle and trying to figure out ways that that are reasonable, you know, that aren't what I've heard in some of the emotional, not you, but emotional other folks with your party that have come out and said things that I don't final reasonable. I find they take people's rights away.

MOULTON: But do you think restricting these modifications like bump stocks and other things that turn semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons that we've outlawed before. I mean, do you think that's reasonable?

TAYLOR: I think that you -- I think, yes, so you could create a law that says, OK, you can't modify your semiautomatic to automatic, which is already illegal, right, but you know as well as I do that it's not that hard to figure out -- if you want to figure it out, and you're a little bit crafty, you can do it, you know that.

And so if you just create a law, you're already outside of the law if you're doing it.

MOULTON: I do. But the reality is that these bump stocks are available for sale. I mean we don't know if the shooter had the skills to modify his...

RADDATZ: Had you ever heard of them before?

MOULTON: I had not heard of them before, either.

TAYLOR: I hadn't either.

MOULTON: But you know there's a difference between being able to machine a part to make a weapon into an automatic weapon versus just buying something off the shelf.

RADDATZ: So where do we go from here? Where do you think we'll be a year from now?

MOULTON: I hope that this conversation will continue. You know, it took some courage for Scott to show up here, especially as a Republican, because a lot of Republicans are not willing to have this conversation.

And I'm willing to sit down as a Democrat and be reasonable. But these are the conversations that we should be having in congress to protect the American people. And let's not say that just because people are emotional. I mean, my gosh, I'm kind of emotional. I mean, to see that many innocent Americans killed senselessly, of course that's emotional, but we've got to take action. We've got to do something.

TAYLOR: And I'm more than willing to sit down and have a conversation to figure out how we can help out, but the action that we take should be reasonable and common sense, of course, and it shouldn't unnecessarily infringe on people's constitutional rights.

So I enjoyed the conversation and I look forward to having a lot more.

MOULTON: All right.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

RADDATZ: And I enjoyed it, as well. Our thanks to both congressmen for having that conversation.

When we come back, the powerhouse ""Roundtable"" is here, ready to take on a busy week in politics and the latest war of words with North Korea. We'll be right back.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.

QUESTION: Mr. President, what did you mean by ""calm before the storm"" yesterday? What did you mean by that?

TRUMP: Thank you very much. You'll find out.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RADDATZ: ABC's Cecilia Vega asking President Trump about that cryptic comment this weekend. That wink as well. The powerhouse ""Roundtable"" joins me now. ABC News political analyst Matthew Dowd; Jeanne Cummings, The Wall Street Journal's deputy bureau chief; NPR White House reporter Geoff Bennett; and Susan Glasser, Politico's chief international affairs columnist.

Welcome to all of you. So much to talk about this week. And I want to start with those comments. Susan, what did you make of that? I don't think anybody expected that.

SUSAN GLASSER, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS COLUMNIST, POLITICO: No, nobody expected that. We're still waiting to find out. The storm, is it the next hurricane in the wave of Atlantic hurricanes that seems to be extending on forever? Is it some international crisis? Is it North Korea? Is it a follow-up to the ""fire and fury"" comment of President Trump back in August?

We don't know, but I think we all feel like maybe it's just this week's cliffhanger in the episode of the Trump show.

RADDATZ: And, Geoff, his aides did not know about that. And, you know, the military standing behind him were probably cringing.

BENNETT: That's right. And the fact that no senior Trump administration official, including the vice president, wants to engage on questions about what the president actually meant I think suggests that the president was just speaking entirely off the cuff here. He was in a mood to make mischief and to be messed with the press a little bit.

RADDATZ: Whether he's talking off the cuff or not, the world watches. What do you think the reaction is around the world there, Matt Dowd, not that you're, you know, our world affairs correspondent but I think you got a little...

DOWD: Tales of the cryptic comments.

I was thinking about this as I was watching him and oviously this has been going on off and on since January 20. This is the Halloween presidency. And I say it in that he says all these kind of things that bring horror to many people that he says these things and people are scared out of their minds and that everybody else is asking trick-or-treat. What is about to happen in this?

This is a presidency that is all visceral, that's all visceral action. I don't think there's any strategic part of this presidency at all, let alone North Korea, Iran, whatever it happens to be, I don't think he fundamentally has a strategy. The only strategy is leave them wanting, leave them wanting.

RADDATZ: And leave them guessing.

Jeanne Cummings, everybody's mind, as Susan said, I think, went to North Korea. That is without question the biggest crisis that we're facing now.

He tweeted this week, presidents and their administrations have been talking to North Korea for 25 years, agreements made and massive amounts of money paid hasn't worked. Agreements violated before the ink was dry making fools of U.S. negotiators. Sorry but only one thing will work.

And is he calling his secretary there a fool?

So where are we on North Korea? To me it's coercive diplomacy. It's part of that.

CUMMINGS: It is.

I mean, there is an argument to be made that we have tried the same thing over and over again with North Korea and it hasn't worked. I mean, we at the journal have a video about -- with these experts who have been tracking North Korea who believe they already have nuclear weapons and that we already are there and we have to learn to live in a world with that.

So I mean if you look at Obama and Cuba, he said, look, we've done that are to 50 years. It didn't work. If there is an argument to be made -- what's I think disorienting right now is that we have a good cop/bad cop scenario going on as we approach North Korea. And the bad cop is the president, that's what -- that's really disorienting. Usually the president is the good cop and the secretary of state or defense secretary would be the bad cop.

DOWD: We've often the rational actor in this. Well, it seems to be the head of North Korea is the rational actor in all of this.

I actually think there's one thing we haven't tried which is letting North Korea and South Korea manage the part of this and figure out what they want to do. It's always been a policy of ours and Russia and China is we're somehow going to impose it on the Korean peninsula. We're going to impose it on them.

RADDATZ: And yet, if he perfects a missile that can reach the United States, I'm not sure we're going to like them more.

DOWD: Well, and I don't think -- whatever we're doing or have done isn't going to do anything to stop that. We ought to get to a place where our policy should be containment or deterrence, just like it is with every other country that has nuclear weapons. We are not going to do anything to stop him from getting a nuclear weapon.

RADDATZ: And Geoff, we know what happened with Rex Tillerson this week. He actually came out and said I never wanted to resign and he didn't quite say he didn't call the president a moron, but his spokesperson came out and later said that.

Does he stay? Does he pretty much have to stay now?

BENNETT: I think he stays at least until the scheduled trip to Asia, which is happening in early November. It doesn't seem that there's any situation in which he could step down before that. But it does beg the question can he be effective in this role, because secretary of state is effective -- you know, his relationship really rests in the kind of relationship that he has with the president, his perception overseas.

And yet you have all these world leaders who believe that he thinks that the president of the United States is a moron, as was reported, and that Trump doesn't have, you know, faith in his top diplomat.

RADDATZ: And Susan, I want to turn to Iran. The president is expected to announce next week that he will decertify the Iran nuclear agreement. So what happens with that? And then it ends up with congress.

GLASSER: Well, that's right. It is going to be a lot of fancy footwork, because basically since the campaign trail, since his speech at the UN, remember, President Trump came out, he said it's an embarrassment. It's the worst deal ever. So he's left his advisers scrambling. And now they're actually going to put out it appears this week almost an awkward split the baby proposal where Trump is going to with great fanfare say I'm not certifying the deal. It's no longer in the national interest of the United States, but the policy is going to be basically we're going to you, congress, but we don't want you to do anything just yet. And now we'll see if we've created leverage in order to negotiate a better deal.

Of course, the Iranians...

DOWD: The discomfort -- I mean, everybody was going to get comfort in the idea that Donald Trump was surrounding himself with people that knew what they were doing -- General Mattis, Rex Tillerson, all that. But now in two instances it looks like he is going to do exactly exactly the opposite of what they want. In one, he's disregarding diplomacy in North Korea, which Rex Tillerson seems to want to do, and the other, Jim Mattis, seems to be saying, no, we need to not do that in Iran. It's actually working -- and if we move forward in the same way it'll continue to work.

He seems to be going the opposite of those things that people give us comfort.

RADDATZ: OK, we're just getting started here. We'll be right back with more.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: So will congress actually get something done about gun violence? The roundtable takes on that debate when we come back.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Good afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against al Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

RADDATZ: President George W. Bush 16 years ago this weekend, the start of America's longest war. It's just extraordinary, Susan, to think back at how long we've been there and that we're now putting in about 3,500 more U.S. troops beginning the 17th year. We'll have about 14,000 here. Will it make a difference?

GLASSER: You know, it's amazing, I went back recently and read a story I wrote in September of 2001 quoting Soviet generals who knew it all too well. They said, it's easy to go to war in Afghanistan and it's really hard to leave.

RADDATZ: You know, and I think of the soldiers and marines who are headed over there who were toddlers when 9/11 happened.

DOWD: Yes, it's -- there are soldiers now that are having children older than the war -- I mean, older than the war.

RADDATZ: And do you think it will make a difference, those troops?

DOWD: None. It's not going to make any difference at all. And I think at that point in time, we need to (INAUDIBLE), which is every other empire, the British Empire, the Soviet empire, even Alexander the Great, at some point you just have to pull out because you realize it's not going to work.

RADDATZ: OK. And I want to turn back to more domestic issues here, Jeanne, and I want to start with you. And you heard the very civil gun debate we had between the two members of Congress, but do you think there will be any legislation, especially about those bump -- actually the NRA said they believe the device is designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles, should be subject to additional regulations.

So is that a sign they'll do something?

CUMMINGS: It is a sign that they want to do something. The trouble is if you look at the regulations, they have -- the ATF cannot do it by itself. And they're going to have to move a bill if they want to do it properly. And once you put a piece of gun legislation on the Senate floor, strange things can happen.

So, I mean, I think the NRA wants it to be regulation because that's a piece of paper. They can help write the sentence. They can keep it really, really narrow. But if you talk to the ATF, they told us that this is not an area in which they have the authority to regulate. They need Congress to give them that authority, that means legislation.

RADDATZ: And, Geoff, if there is something that happens, if there is a change, is it really that much different because the fully automatic -- it's the same regulations as you would have on fully automatic weapons?

BENNETT: That's right, yes.

RADDATZ: I think most people just didn't even know these existed.

BENNETT: Yes, before a week ago most people didn't know that these bump stocks existed. And gun enthusiasts didn't really know that they existed. I mean, it's considered to be a novelty item. The NRA would rather have this be a conversation about this very specific thing than have a very large argument about the gun control debate.

And the GOP is really caught in this position of, you know, sort of instinctively trying to defend gun rights and then being seen as doing nothing in the wake of what was the most...

(CROSSTALK)

RADDTAZ: In many ways, is it harder story get gun restrictions after this shooting because he bought all those guns legally for those who want to have restrictions.

DOWD: I don't know what it's going to take for us to finally do something after all of these thing -- Sandy Hook, this, what happened in Orlando, all of these things. I own three rifles and two shotgun. I live this Texas. I'm a reasonable -- hopefully reasonably responsible gun owner. And most reasonable responsible gun owners think something should be done.

Here are two facts that I think people ought to realize. In the last 50 years, more people have died from guns than died in all the wars in all the battles that the United States has been in since the revolution. More Americans have been killed in the last 50 years by guns than died in all those battles.

And second, more Americans were killed in Las Vegas in that shooting than have died from radical Islamic terrorism in the United States in the last ten years.

RADDATZ: Saw that statistic.

DOWD: The talking is done. The problem is we have to at least start to do something because if we do nothing this is going to continue.

RADDATZ: And, of course, we had Pierre reporting earlier about mental health issues.

I want to move on to the birth control issue. And the Trump administration announced Friday it's rolling back the mandate for health insurance to cover birth control, allowing employers to opt out based on their religious belief. Where does this go, Susan?

GLASSER: Well, you know, look, I think what you see is this is a way of once again focusing like a laser on what Trump perceives to be the political base that brought him to power. And, you know, they are not taking a let's make a deal whether it's on gun control or birth control.

RADDATZ: Or transgender people.

GLASSER: Absolutely.

The strategy is very clear, it's to focus on 2020 in a way, even more than 2018, to focus on the president and who brung him. And I think that you also see they have appointed a very conservative executive branch government, so Trump might not have his own sort of cadre of Trumpians to come into power, which is why we see these fights inside the White House, right, but there is a very clear group of people who have come and to different executive agencies of the Trump administration and they are systemically, you know, rolling back policies they disagreed with fervently of eight years of President Obama.

I think it's not going to change the minds of almost anybody, right, but it might be something that earns Trump a little bit more goodwill with his voters that he's going to need.

BENNETT: That's absolutely right. And it's one of the reasons why, though, Democrats don't view as credible President Trump's overtures to Chuck Schumer to find some sort of bipartisan approach to fixing health care because of the way they view the Trump administration as, you know, vandalizing and sabotaging the Affordable Care Act. And this is one of the things they point to.

DOWD: It's ludicrous. We are not going to decrease access to guns, but we're going to decrease access to birth control in our country? And to me, the argument is if you want to lessen abortion in the country, which many of the religious community does, increasing -- decreasing the ability of women to get birth control is only going to make that worse.

RADDATZ: And, Jeanne, I want to go back to the Hill and the Russia investigation. It was a year ago that the intelligence community said that Russia interfered with the elections. We're learning more and more about this, the Facebook ads. Where are we with this?

CUMMINGS: Well, we're starting to get -- at least on the Hill we're starting to get into the thick of it, where they're bringing in primary players now to do some public hearings as well as behind the scenes. And, of course, Mueller is hard at work.

The focus now is on what happened on social media and how did they try to influence votes. And we're learning so much about the Russian ads that were bought that echoed some of the Trump campaign themes. And they were in the same neighborhoods and precincts that the Trump campaign needed to win.

RADDATZ: OK. I'm sorry we have got to leave it here. Great talking to all of you.

When we come back, our tribute to the 58 lives lost in Las Vegas.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

RADDATZ: This morning, we pause to remember the 58 lives lost this week in Las Vegas. The special education teacher from California, the husband who died while shielding his wife, the mother of four leaving behind a 1-month-old baby. 58 lives cut short. 58 families devastated and a nation once again remembering.

The Clean Power Plan caps the amount of greenhouse gases that may be emitted from power plants and was a centerpiece of President Barack Obama's plan to slow the effects of global warming.

But at Monday's announcement, Pruitt said the regulation picked ""winners and losers,"" echoing comments from Trump and other officials that environmental regulations eliminated jobs in businesses like the coal industry.

""When you think about the Clean Power Plan, it wasn't about regulating to make things regular,"" Pruitt said. ""It was truly about regulating to pick winners and losers, and they interpreted the best system of emission reduction is generating electricity not using fossil fuels.""

Trump called for a review of the Clean Power Plan in an executive order signed in March to reverse what he has called government overreach that hurt the economy.

""Perhaps no single regulation threatens our miners, energy companies and workers more than this crushing attack on American industry,"" Trump said in March, referring to the Clean Power Plan.

More details on what will happen after the plan is withdrawn were not immediately available.",,,

Bloom had been advising the film producer, who The New York Times reported this week has been accused of sexual harassment by several women, about how to better his behavior.

""I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein,"" she said in a statement to ABC News. ""My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.""

Bloom told ABC News on Saturday that she will not be elaborating on what agreement she is referring to.

Weinstein has not yet commented on her resignation.

On Thursday, The New York Times published a report alleging that several women, including actress Ashley Judd, had made accusations against Weinstein. The producer disputed the report but immediately apologized for misconduct and announced that he would be taking a leave of absence from his company.

Bloom, who says she has known Weinstein for about a year since her book “Suspicion Nation” was optioned for a film, defended him this week in an interview with ""Good Morning America.""

""He's a big, loud guy. People are intimidated by him. I'm not. I'm a big-mouth lawyer myself. I'll stand up to him, but if I'm a 23-year-old in his workplace... of course, they're intimidated,"" she explained.

The attorney and women's rights advocate added that with regard to ""a lot of the allegations, there are witnesses who say this did not happen.""

The Weinstein Company board of directors -- including his brother Bob Weinstein, Tarak Ben Ammar, Lance Maerov and Richard Koenigsberg -- stated Friday evening that the company will launch its own investigation into the claims during Weinstein's ""indefinite"" leave.

""As Harvey has said, it is important for him to get professional help for the problems he has acknowledged. Next steps will depend on Harvey’s therapeutic progress, the outcome of the Board’s independent investigation, and Harvey’s own personal decisions,"" the board stated.

Weinstein’s lawyer said in a statement this week that he plans to sue The New York Times.

“The New York Times published today a story that is saturated with false and defamatory statements about Harvey Weinstein,” attorney Charles J. Harder said in a statement. “It relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report, apparently stolen from an employee personnel file, which has been debunked by nine different eyewitnesses. We sent the Times the facts and evidence, but they ignored it and rushed to publish. We are preparing the lawsuit now. All proceeds will be donated to women’s organizations.”",,,

Erdogan said that Ankara will continue to follow the situation of Crimean Tatars, and thanked Ukraine for defending their rights.

Swedish broadcaster TV4 reported Monday that the southern region of Skane has around 120 unsolved killings.

Bo Lundqvist, head of the cold case unit in Skane, said that ""we also have cases with quartered bodies.""

Next month, DNA databases from Sweden and Denmark will be joined up, with Madsen's DNA expected to be tested against unsolved killings.",,,

Heather Rae Ellis got lost as she walked her dogs near Scott River in Western Australia. The 65-year-old was in the forest for 25 hours, she told local station 9NEWS, and her three golden retrievers helped keep her warm during the night.

“Unfortunately, I’d made a bed with covering and all the rest of it and no sooner had I laid down than a helicopter came over,” she recalled. “I was trying to attract its attention so I ran, and of course, lost where I had done the bed.”

The 9NEWS crew found Ellis as she made it out to the road after hearing the sound of the crew’s car.

“Early this morning, I heard the traffic, but I got into some really thick forest and lost the sound of it,” she said. “And so I just kept stopping until I really got my bearings and just followed the sound of the traffic.”

The products the company unveiled on Wednesday are packed with artificial intelligence that Google has accumulated from those very same services. The company's widely used search engine, Gmail, maps, Chrome web browser and other services have yielded a fountain of data the company has used to smarten up its software and gadgets.

Over the past year, Google has been transplanting that knowledge into its Pixel line of phones, internet-connected speakers and, as of Wednesday, a new type of laptop and a small, hands-free camera that automatically learns when to snap pictures or record video of candid moments.

""All that hardware is just housing, and that isn't as interesting as what's inside the house,"" said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen. ""The hardware is just a way for Google to show people the best way to experience its services.""

THE HARDWARE TROJAN HORSE

Google recently signaled a long-term commitment to its own phones by spending $1.1 billion to bring on board 2,000 HTC engineers specializing in mobile devices — and to acquire some related technology, too.

Although sleekly designed, Google's Pixel phones and Home speakers aren't breakthroughs in themselves. In many respects, Google is simply copying or offering slight variations on devices made by Apple and Amazon that have been bigger hits so far.

But Google believes its services, particularly those driven by AI, can give it an edge over its rivals. If its devices catch on, they'll then generate additional data that Google can use to further refine its AI systems.

Already part of Google's smartphones and speakers, the assistant will soon also be featured in the new Pixelbook laptop and in new wireless headphones called Pixel Buds. It will be easier to summon in the next generation of Pixel phones; a new feature lets you squeeze the side of the device to ask a question.

Google's emphasis on its assistant is part of a battle with Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa to prove which is the most intelligent and efficient aide — one that might, one day, become a trusted companion.

NEW PHONES

The second generation of Google's Pixel phones unveiled Wednesday feature larger, brighter screens that take up more of the device's front, changes that Apple is also making with its iPhone X scheduled to be released next month.

Both the 6-inch Pixel XL and the 5-inch Pixel will also do away with the headphone jack, something Apple did with the iPhone 7 last year.

Google also souped up the already highly rated camera on the Pixel, boasting that it will take even better photos than the iPhone.

The Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 are adding a new mode for taking portraits, another popular feature on the iPhone 7 and recently released iPhone 8. But instead of relying on two cameras to take better portraits, Google is using AI software that adjusts photos automatically to enhance close-ups and blur backgrounds.

The smaller Pixel will sell for almost $650, $50 less than the iPhone 8. The Pixel XL will sell for almost $850, or $50 more than the iPhone 8 Plus. Prices for the iPhone X, by comparison, start at $1,000.

SMARTER HEADPHONES

Google also announced wireless headphones, called Pixel Buds. In addition to relaying audio from the phone, the headphones can also translate spoken language in real time, working with translation software built into the new Pixels. The feature also will be coming to last year's Pixel models in an update.

Another new photo feature, called Lens, will automatically display information about a landmark or piece of art in a picture. This will also be added to last year's Pixel models as Google tries to build brand loyalty.

The company, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., still has a long way to go before making a significant dent in the market. In the past year, Google sold just 2.8 million Pixel phones, accounting for less than 1 percent of the worldwide market, according to the research firm International Data Corp.

Most of the Pixel buyers so far have been ""fanboys and fangirls who understand and appreciate what Google brings to the table with Android, and voraciously take advantage of every new feature,"" said IDC analyst Ramon Llamas.

SMART SPEAKERS

The Google Home Mini unveiled Wednesday is a button-sized speaker covered in fabric. It includes the same features featured in a cylindrical speaker that Google rolled out last year in response to Amazon's Echo .

The Mini will cost almost $50, roughly the small price as Amazon's smaller speaker, the Echo Dot. The standard Google Home speaker costs almost $130. Last week, Amazon announced the next generation of its Echo speaker, coming out in time for the holiday shopping season, will cost just $100, a price that Google decided not to match.

The Google Home Max is a rectangular speaker with superior acoustics for playing music, mimicking Apple's HomePod. Google is selling the Home Max for almost $400, about $50 more than the HomePod. Both speakers are due to hit stores in December.

CANDID CAMERA

In a surprise move, Google is introducing a hands-free camera that will automatically take photos and video for people looking to catch candid moments of their family, friends and pet.

The small, square device, called Google Clips, can capture images of everything within its range of view. It will rely on AI to decide what and who is important to its users so it knows the best times to snap a photo or record video.

Google is promising that privacy controls built into Clips will give the camera's users complete control over the images they want to transfer to another device or to share with someone else.

Clips will sell for almost $250 and will be available in stores in December.",,,
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/gaza-hamas-levels-ancient-treasure-50318775,['Abc News'],,[],,"Palestinian and French archaeologists began excavating Gaza's earliest archaeological site nearly 20 years ago, unearthing what they believe is a rare 4,500-year-old Bronze Age settlement.

But over protests that grew recently, Gaza's Hamas rulers have systematically destroyed the work since seizing power a decade ago, allowing the flattening of this hill on the southern tip of Gaza City to make way for construction projects, and later military bases. In its newest project, Hamas-supported bulldozers are flattening the last remnants of excavation.

""There is a clear destruction of a very important archaeological site,"" said Palestinian archaeology and history professor Mouin Sadeq, who led three excavations at the site along with French archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji after its accidental discovery in 1998. ""I don't know why the destruction of the site was approved.""

Tel Es-Sakan (hill of ash) was the largest Canaanite city between Palestine and Egypt, according to Sadeq. It was named after the great amount of ash found during the excavations, which suggests the settlement was burnt either naturally or in a war.

Archaeologists found the 10-hectare (25-acre) hill to be hiding a fortified settlement built centuries before pharaonic rule in Egypt, and 1,000 years before the pyramids. But the excavations stopped in 2002 due to security concerns.

When calls on Hamas to stop the recent flattening intensified last month, the nearest available expert to gain access to Gaza was Jean-Baptiste Humbert, a Jerusalem-based archaeologist at the Ecole Biblique and who had excavated other sites in Gaza.

""Today the complete southern facade of the Tel is erased,"" said Humbert. In previous years, faces and ramparts on other sides were also destroyed. ""Now it is destroyed all around,"" he said.

It's among the earliest sites indicating the emergence of the ""urban society"" concept in the Near East, when communities were transforming from farming villages around 4,000 BC, and it was on trade routes between Egypt and the Levant, according to Humbert.

Humbert shared an aerial photo from 2000 showing patterns of walls from atop the mound. The area ""was the first city of Palestine to have a city wall,"" he said. Now, ""the field work you see in the photo is totally destroyed.""

Gaza is home to numerous ancient treasures, but politics have long complicated archaeological work.

The French excavations stopped in 2002 because of a Palestinian uprising in which protesters violently clashed with Israeli troops around the nearby Netzarim settlement. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. But Hamas, shunned by the West as a terrorist group, won elections and eventually drove out the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. The excavations never resumed.

Unlike more extreme Islamic groups, Hamas has not deliberately destroyed antiquities for ideological reasons.

But with little open space in Gaza, a fast-growing population and an economy stifled by Israeli and Egyptian blockades, Hamas officials say they have no choice but to develop the area, making archaeology a low priority.

But the group has also seized ancient sites to build military training camps, including the 3,000-year-old Anthedon Harbor, parts of which were bulldozed in 2013.

In 2009 and 2012, the expansion of universities destroyed the western and northern facades of Tel El-Sakan. People displaced during three wars between Hamas and Israel set up temporary dwellings on the eastern side.

The southern front remained, but Hamas says it needs the land to compensate some of its senior employees, who have only received partial salaries from the cash-strapped group.

When the bulldozer work started in early August, the Hamas-run Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities appealed for help. Humbert rushed to Gaza, and with the help of colleagues from Gaza's Islamic University, he succeeded in stopping the work for two weeks while the ministry and Hamas' Land Authority worked to settle the dispute.

Jamal Abu Rida, the ministry's director of antiquities, said Tel Es-Sakan is a protected archaeological site, but that his ministry could not stop the more powerful Land Authority from destroying another 1.2 hectares (three acres).

The work resumed last week. Bulldozers loaded a truck with soil that contained fragments of jars. When the workers saw Associated Press cameras, they quickly left the scene.

Abu Rida said they recovered an early Bronze Age jar from the site during the most recent leveling. Fadel al-Outul a Gaza archaeologist, salvaged fragments that he used to reassemble two thirds of another jar. He also found a flint knife blade.

Junaid Sorosh-Wali, an official with the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, inspected the damage at the site Tuesday after the bulldozers left.

What happened was ""disastrous for the archaeology and cultural heritage in Palestine,"" he said. He said UNESCO had raised concerns with ""the relevant authorities.""

Amateur videos showed ramparts crumbling under the bulldozer's treads. The rampart of the southern facade was also uncovered and is slated for destruction.

Dozens of ancient sites have been found in Gaza, and excavations have revealed temples, monasteries, palaces, churches and mosques and mosaics. But most of the sites have been lost to urban sprawl and looting. UNESCO is struggling to preserve some of remaining ones.

In 2016, the remains of a Byzantine church were discovered in Gaza, but authorities are believed to have destroyed them. And in 2014, a rare Apollo statue went missing and is believed to be held by a militant group.

At St. Hilarion monastery in the central Gaza Strip, which spans from the late Roman Empire to the Islamic Umayyad period, a breach in the fence suggested looters were trying to get in. Private construction is taking place next door. Someone recently dumped brick debris in the site from over the fence.

The birthplace one of the 4th century founders of Christian monasticism still has the clear remnants of a baptism hall, a church and an atrium.

Sorosh-Wali, the UNESCO official, said it is among around a dozen locations in the West Bank and Gaza that the Palestinian Authority wants to be listed as a UNESCO ""world heritage"" sites.",,,

http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/sweet-75-percent-honey-samples-key-pesticide-50307836,['Abc News'],,[],,"When researchers collected honey samples from around the world, they found that three-quarters of them had a common type of pesticide suspected of playing a role in the decline of bees. Even honey from the island paradise of Tahiti had the chemical.

That demonstrates how pervasive a problem the much-debated pesticide is for honeybees, said authors of a study published Thursday in the journal Science. They said it is not a health problem for people because levels were far below governments' thresholds on what's safe to eat.

""What this shows is the magnitude of the contamination,"" said study lead author Edward Mitchell, a biology professor at the University of Neuchatel in Switzerland, adding that there are ""relatively few places where we did not find any.""

Over the past few years, several studies — in the lab and the field — link insecticides called neonicotinoids (nee-oh-NIH'-kuh-tih-noyds), or neonics, to reduced and weakened honeybee hives, although pesticide makers dispute those studies. Neonics work by attacking an insect's central nervous system;

Bees and other pollinators have been on the decline for more than a decade and experts blame a combination of factors: neonics, parasites, disease, climate change and lack of a diverse food supply. Honeybees don't just make honey; about one-third of the human diet comes from plants that are pollinated by the insects. Bees pick up the pesticide when they feed on fields grown from treated seeds.

As part of a citizen science project, the Swiss researchers asked other experts, friends and relatives to ship them honey samples. More than 300 samples arrived and researchers tested 198 of them for five of the most common types of neonics.

Overall, 75 percent of the samples had at least one neonic, 45 percent had two or more and 10 percent had four or more.

Results varied by region. In North America, 86 percent of samples had the pesticide; Asia, 80 percent; Europe, where there's a partial ban, 79 percent; Africa 73 percent; the Australian region, 71 percent and South America, 57 percent.

The study found that nearly half of the honey samples exceeded a level of the pesticide that some previous research said weakens bees, but the pesticide makers say otherwise. An outside expert, University of Nebraska's Judy Wu-Smart, said the study used too few honey samples to make the broad conclusions the researchers did.

Ann Bryan, spokeswoman for Syngenta which makes the neonic thiamethoxam, said the amount of the pesticide found in honey samples ""are 50 times lower than what could cause possible effects on bees.""

Jeffrey Donald, a spokesman for Bayer Crop Science which makes the neonic clothianidinsaid, said the study ""perpetuates the myth that exposure to low levels of neonicotinoids implies risk, even though there is no compelling scientific evidence to support this conclusion.""

The study authors likened neonics to DDT, the pesticide in the 1960s linked to declines in bald eagles and other birds. They said neonics are dangerous to all sorts of insects, even ladybugs. University of Illinois bee expert Sydney Cameron and other scientists said those comparisons aren't right because neonics don't stay in an animal's system like DDT did and are applied to seeds and not sprayed in mass quantities.

""This is an important paper if for no other reason that it will attract a great deal of attention to the mounting problem of worldwide dependence on agrochemicals, the side effects of which we know relatively little,"" Cameron said in an email. She wasn't part of the study.

One side benefit of collecting honey is that researchers could sample some. Mitchell's favorite is a dark and bitter honey from Africa. He called the honey fantastic, but added ""I couldn't eat it all the time. It was just too strong.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/harvey-weinsteins-adviser-lisa-bloom-speaks-misconduct/story?id=50321561,"['Abc News', 'More Nicole']",,[],,"Harvey Weinstein's adviser, attorney Lisa Bloom, revealed why she is helping the Hollywood mogul respond to a New York Times report which alleged that several women have over nearly three decades accused him of sexual harassment or unwanted physical conduct.

Bloom, who has made a career of representing women claiming sexual harassment cases, told ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos on ""Good Morning America"" today, ""I'm working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful.""

The New York Times, in addition to reporting the claims of sexual harassment or unwanted physical contact against the head of Weinstein Co., cited two anonymous company officials saying that the famed studio executive reached at least eight settlements with accusers.

Stephanopoulos asked Bloom today if Weinstein did in fact sexually harass women.

""I think Harvey has acknowledged that, yes, that there was misconduct over a period of years,"" she said. Bloom added that ""the term 'sexual harassment' ... is a legal term,"" and that she is instead ""using the term 'workplace misconduct.'""

Of Weinstein, she said, ""He has certainly a very bad temper, and that's a big part of the problem.""

""He's well known for that,"" Bloom said. ""He's a big, loud guy. People are intimidated by him. I'm not. I'm a big-mouth lawyer myself. I'll stand up to him, but if I'm a 23-year-old in his workplace, of course, they're intimidated.""

The alleged victims, as reported by the Times, were at the time of the alleged incidents in various positions, from an assistant to a model to actress Ashley Judd.

Judd told the Times that two decades ago she was asked to meet Weinstein in his hotel room and that the studio executive greeted her wearing a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she would watch him shower, the newspaper reported.

ABC News

Bloom told Stephanopoulos that she was not suggesting that Judd was lying.

""I have great respect for Ashley Judd and so does Harvey,"" Bloom said. ""While [Judd and Weinstein] had this little different perspective on what happened 20 years ago, this is not about attacking any of the women.""

She also said she is glad the women came forward. ""I encourage them to come forward. Harvey has authorized me to say that. This is a very different day. What do you do if you have behaved badly for 30 years? Are you going to continue or are you going to start a different approach? That's what he's doing.""

Weinstein said in a statement obtained by ABC News that he has ""caused a lot of pain"" and that he is taking a leave of absence from his company, during which time he said he will dedicate himself to working against the National Rifle Association.

""I so respect all women and regret what happened. I hope that my actions will speak louder than words and that one day we will all be able to earn their trust and sit down together with [attorney] Lisa [Bloom] to learn more. Jay Z wrote in [his song] '4:44' 'I'm not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children.' The same is true for me. I want a second chance in the community but I know I've got work to do to earn it.""

Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/File

Stephanopoulos asked Bloom why, if Weinstein is not accusing the alleged victims as lying about his behavior, he is saying he plans to sue the Times.

Bloom said that in regard to ""a lot of the allegations, there are witnesses who say this did not happen.""

Weinstein has hired Hulk Hogan's lawyer, Charles Harder, who won the former wrestler a $140 million-dollar verdict against Gawker that was later settled for $31 million. Harder told ABC News in a statement that the Times' report on Weinstein is ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"" about his client and that he is preparing a lawsuit against the newspaper.

Last Thursday, the New York Times published a report alleging that several women, including actress Ashley Judd, accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and/or unwanted physical contact over the past few decades.

Though the producer immediately apologized for misconduct and announced that he planned to take a leave of absence from work while he bettered himself, on Sunday night, the board of The Weinstein Company voted to terminate him permanently.

Weinstein, 64, issued a mea culpa last week, and wrote in a statement that he ""respect[s] all women and regret[s] what happened.""

""I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them,"" he added.

However, his attorney Charles Harder stated to ABC News at the time that the Times article was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements,"" and as a result, he was preparing a lawsuit against the newspaper. Any proceeds made as a result of the lawsuit would be donated to women's charities, Harder added.

Streep, who said that Weinstein ""was exasperating but respectful"" toward her professionally, claimed that in spite of reports, ""not everybody knew"" about his inappropriate behavior. She was unaware of the many allegations made against him, she added.

“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes,"" she said. ""The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”

Streep collaborated with Weinstein on films including ""August: Osage County"" and ""The Iron Lady."" She earned Oscar nominations for both.

The allegations made against Weinstein have been met with varied responses from the entertainment community. Late-night hosts were criticized for not mentioning the allegations in their monologues last week and ""Saturday Night Live"" executive producer Lorne Michaels came under fire for omitting the storyline from last weekend's episode. The Huffington Post also noted that stars including Gwyneth Paltrow and Quentin Tarantino, both of whom have worked with Weinstein for many years, have also remained silent.

However, others have been outspoken with their criticism. Director Kevin Smith said he was ""ashamed"" that Weinstein financed ""the first 14 years of my career,"" and Dame Judi Dench released a statement, calling the allegations ""horrifying.""

“Whilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offences which are, of course, horrifying,"" she said, according to People. ""I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out.""

http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/60-years-sputnik-russian-space-program-faces-troubles-50274991,['Abc News'],,[],,"Six decades after Sputnik, a refined version of the rocket that put the first artificial satellite in orbit remains the mainstay of Russia's space program — a stunning tribute to the country's technological prowess, but also a sign it has failed to build upon its achievements.

And unlike the Cold War era, when space was a key area of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union, space research now appears to rank low on the Kremlin's priorities.

The Soyuz booster, currently the only vehicle that launches crews to the International Space Station, is a modification of the R-7 rocket that put Sputnik in orbit on Oct. 4, 1957.

Another Soviet-designed workhorse, the heavy-lift Proton rocket that has been used to launch commercial satellites to high orbits, was developed in the 1960s.

Both rockets established a stellar reputation for their reliability, but their record was tarnished by a string of failed launches in recent years that have called into question the Russian space industry's ability to maintain the same high standards of manufacturing.

Glitches found in Proton and Soyuz in 2016 were traced to manufacturing flaws at the plant in Voronezh that builds engines for both rockets. The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, sent more than 70 rocket engines back to production lines to replace faulty components, a move that resulted in a yearlong break in Proton launches.

The suspension eroded the nation's niche in the global market for commercial satellite launches. Last year, Russia for the first time fell behind both the U.S. and China in the number of launches.

Clients have increasingly opted for new, more efficient and affordable choices, such as the Falcon 9 built by SpaceX, which broke ground in reducing costs by making its rockets reusable.

Russian officials have recognized the challenge posed by SpaceX and others, but they have offered few specifics on how the nation hopes to retain its place in the global market. The only short-term answer appears to be a plan to manufacture a less-powerful version of the Proton booster to lower costs.

In an astonishing recognition of the depth of Russia's space woes, Roscosmos chief Igor Komarov declared earlier this week that the Voronezh factory used substandard alloys because of a logistical failure that occurred after a warehouse worker had become ill.

The Khrunichev company that assembles the Proton also has fallen on hard times amid criminal investigations into alleged mismanagement and a decision to sharply cut its assets. Much of the prized real estate it occupies in western Moscow has been designated for development.

Meanwhile, the development of the Angara, a booster rocket intended to replace both the Soyuz and the Proton, has been repeatedly pushed back, and its future remains uncertain. More expensive and lacking the long-established track record of its predecessors, the Angara probably will find it hard to compete with SpaceX rockets and others in the international market.

The first tests of the Angara have been successful, but full-scale production is yet to be organized at a plant in the Siberian city of Omsk.

And while the Soyuz is now the only vehicle for ferrying crews to the International Space Station following the retirement of the U.S. space shuttle fleet, Russia stands to lose the monopoly soon as the SpaceX's Dragon v2 and Boeing's Starliner crew capsules are to fly test missions next year.

Work on a new spacecraft intended to replace the Soyuz crew capsule designed 50 years ago has crawled slowly. The ship, called Federation, is tentatively set for its first manned flight in 2023, but little is known about it.

Roscosmos also has talked about sending several unmanned missions to the moon in the next decade, but details are yet to be worked out. Attempts to send unmanned probes to Mars in 1996 and to the Martian moons Phobos in 2011 failed due to equipment problems.

Russia also has struggled for years to build its own scientific module for the International Space Station. Originally set for 2007, the launch of the Nauka, or Science, module has been pushed back repeatedly. A 2013 check revealed that its systems had become clogged with residue and required a costly cleaning. The launch is now tentatively set for next year, but some reports suggest it could be delayed further.

Amid funding shortages, Roscosmos has decided to cut the size of its ISS crews from three to two, a move criticized by many in Russia.

""It's very bad when we have to cut the number of cosmonaut seats,"" cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya said in parliament this year. ""The situation in our space industry is quite alarming.""

One Russian cosmonaut currently in orbit, Sergei Ryazanskiy, on Wednesday posted a picture of himself holding a tiny replica of Sputnik on Twitter to mark the 60th anniversary. Ryazanskiy's grandfather, the chief designer of radio guidance systems for space vehicles during Soviet times, was involved in Sputnik's launch.

While other space programs faced cutbacks, Russia spent billions to build the new Vostochny launch pad in the Far East as a possible alternative to the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan that Moscow has leased from its former Soviet neighbor.

Many have questioned the feasibility of the expensive new facility, given the fact that Russia intends to continue using Baikonur for most of its launches. Work at Vostochny has also been dogged by scandals involving protests by unpaid workers and the arrests of construction officials accused of embezzlement.

A launch pad for Soyuz finally opened in 2016, but another one for heavier Angara rockets is only set to be completed in late 2021.

Amid massive spending on Vostochny, whose future remains unclear, some have criticized Roscosmos for cutting corners on personnel. Cosmonaut Maxim Surayev, who now serves as a lawmaker, lamented the poor conditions for future space crews at the Star City training center outside Moscow.

""It's wrong when, instead of fulfilling their task to prepare for space flight, they have to find side jobs and a place to live,"" Surayev said in parliament.

Several veteran cosmonauts were forced to retire earlier this year amid vicious infighting at Star City. One of the retirees was Gennady Padalka, who holds the world record for the longest time in orbit — 879 days over five space missions.

In a letter to the media, Padalka urged authorities to fire the director of Star City to prevent the facility from falling into ""complete ruin.""

Lars Harald Blikra of Norway's Water Resources and Energy Directorate says 75,000 liters (19,500 gallons) of water had been pumped up overnight onto the Mannen mountain, 350 kilometers (217 miles) northwest of Oslo.

He said Friday the pumping could continue for days, adding ""we have not seen so large a shifting before.""

In recent weeks, movement of up to 10 centimeters (4 inches) has been recorded — compared with a normal shifting rate of 1-2 centimeters (0.4-0.8 inches) per year.

http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/nobel-chemistry-prize-major-award-molecular-matters-50269342,['Abc News'],,[],,"Three researchers won a Nobel Prize on Wednesday for developing a microscope technique that lets scientists see exquisite details of the molecules that drive life — basically providing a front-row seat to study these tiny performers in their biological dance.

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said molecules can be captured down to the level of their atoms, and snapshots can catch them in mid-movement. That can help reveal how they interact.

""This method has moved biochemistry into a new era,"" the academy said in awarding its chemistry prize to Switzerland's Jacques Dubochet of the University of Lausanne, German-born U.S. citizen Joachim Frank at New York's Columbia University, and Briton Richard Henderson of MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.

The detailed images may pave the way for developing new medicines, vaccines and industrial chemicals, but experts said such payoffs are largely in the future.

""This is a technique that is just starting to find its way into the research community,"" said Allison A. Campbell, president of the American Chemical Society. It was recently used to reveal the structure of the Zika virus.

The method is called cryo-electron microscopy. It's like ""Google Earth for molecules,"" Campbell said, because it ""allows the scientist to zoom in down to the fine detail (giving) that fine resolution that you want to have.""

Other methods have been used before to determine structures of some biological molecules, but they run up against fundamental limitations. The three winners of the $1.1 million (9 million kronor) prize adapted another technique, electron microscopy, which uses a beam of electrons rather than ordinary light to inspect samples.

Between 1975 and 1986, Frank developed mathematical models to turn fuzzy two-dimensional images into sharp, three-dimensional ones. Henderson, in 1990, was able to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at atom-level resolution, showing the technology's potential, the Nobel committee said.

Dubochet, in the early 1980s, found a way to cool the water in a biological sample so quickly that it solidified without forming the ice crystals that can disrupt the electron beam.

Those early advances were followed by others that have greatly improved the technique, the Nobel committee said.

""It's the first time that we can see biological molecules in their natural environment and how they actually work together down to the individual atoms,"" said Nobel chemistry committee member Heiner Linke.

Henderson said Dubochet ""kicked off the field; he invented this method of making specimens we now use.""

Speaking to reporters in Cambridge, England, Henderson also said he felt ""the three of us have been awarded the prize acting on behalf of the entire field.""

Frank said he was ""fully overwhelmed"" and speechless upon hearing he had won a share of the prize.

""I thought the chances of a Nobel Prize were minuscule because there are so many other innovations and discoveries that happen almost every day,"" he said.

He said he hasn't yet thought about what to do with the prize money, but added: ""I was telling my wife that we don't have to worry about a dog sitter anymore.""

The chemistry prize was the third Nobel announced this week.

The medicine prize went to three Americans studying circadian rhythms: Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young. The physics prize went to Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne for detecting gravitational waves.

The literature winner will be named Thursday and the peace prize will be announced Friday.

The European Union, which organized the Our Ocean conference in the Maltese capital of Valletta, its 28 member states and its EIB investment bank gave almost half those financial commitments, about $3.4 billion.

Representatives from businesses, almost 100 countries and others pushed the total up to the unprecedented level.

The conference focused on funding and leading projects as varied as combating plastics pollution to countering illegal fishing and looking at the effects of climate change.

The Our Ocean conference has accumulated some 8.7 billion euros ($10.2 billion) since it started in 2014 but the efforts in 2017 exceeded expectations.

""We are beginning to see leaders in government, civil society and the private sector standing up to be counted to make tangible commitments to conservation, which is most encouraging,"" said Demetres Karavellas, head of the delegation for the WWF wildlife group.

On top of the financial commitments, nations also promised to add new Marine Protected Areas spanning more than 2.5 million square kilometers, which the EU said translates to over half its territory.

The efforts to better protect marine life came in in all shapes. Five top global insurance industry companies committed to refuse insurance to vessels internationally blacklisted for illegal or unregulated fishing.

""Today is a major breakthrough, with leading insurers committing to deny a financial lifeline to pirate-fishing vessels,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, the executive director of Oceana Europe.

""In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company ... have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately,"" said a statement from the company's board of directors to ABC News on Sunday.

Here's a look at the events over four days that unraveled the career of a movie mogul.

Thursday, Oct. 5 -- 'Harvey Weinstein paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades'

That was the headline of an explosive story in The New York Times alleging that several women had over nearly three decades accused the co-founder of The Weinstein Co. of sexual harassment or unwanted physical contact.

The Times also cited two anonymous company officials claiming that the famed studio executive reached at least eight settlements with accusers.

Weinstein admitted wrongdoing in a statement to ABC News and revealed that he'd be taking a leave of absence.

But he also fired back at the Times, with his attorney, Charles Harder, saying the newspaper story is ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"" and that he is preparing a lawsuit against the Times on Weinstein's behalf. That lawsuit has yet to be filed.

A request for comment Monday on the status of the forthcoming lawsuit did not receive an immediate response.

In the wake of the publication of the Times article, Weinstein's adviser Lisa Bloom released a statement on Twitter explaining her work with the studio executive, a role that appeared to be a sharp change from her previous work representing high-profile women such as Blac Chyna and Kathy Griffin.

Friday, Oct. 6 -- 'There was misconduct'

From late Thursday to early Friday, three members of the Weinstein Co. board -- Dirk Ziff, Marc Lasry and Tim Sarnoff -- resigned, according to the Times.

Bloom said in an interview on ""Good Morning America"" on Friday that Weinstein is ""genuinely remorseful.""

ABC News Chief Anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Bloom on ""Good Morning America"" if Weinstein did in fact sexually harass women.

""I think Harvey has acknowledged that, yes, that there was misconduct over a period of years,"" she said.

Bloom added that ""the term 'sexual harassment' ... is a legal term,"" and said she is instead ""using the term 'workplace misconduct.'""

Of Weinstein, she said, ""He has certainly a very bad temper, and that's a big part of the problem.""

""He's well known for that,"" Bloom said. ""He's a big, loud guy. People are intimidated by him. I'm not. I'm a big-mouth lawyer myself. I'll stand up to him, but if I'm a 23-year-old in his workplace, of course, they're intimidated.""

Bloom said she was glad the women came forward and encouraged more to do the same.

Friday night, Oct. 6 - Other alleged victims come forward

As the week came to a close, other alleged victims came forward.

Saturday, Oct. 7 - Bloom, others resign from advising Weinstein

Just one day after Bloom appeared on ""GMA,"" she announced she was stepping down as Weinstein's adviser.

""I have resigned as an adviser to Harvey Weinstein,"" she said in a statement provided to ABC News and posted on Twitter. ""My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.""

http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/engineers-lives-lost-mexico-quake-saved-50374362,['Abc News'],,[],,"Warm lighting would enhance the wood floors' natural glow, the developer promised, so when all the custom lightbulbs burnt out, Anahi Abadia and her husband grudgingly drove to Home Depot to replenish supplies for their chic new flat in central Mexico City.

They had just reached the register when the earthquake hit, shaking the store so fiercely the structure screeched. Minutes later, a text came in from their neighbor: The elegant apartment they had purchased only six months earlier had collapsed, rendering their new home a pile of crushed concrete.

They were among the fortunate: Two women working in their building and dozens more perished on Sept. 19 in structure failures that several prominent engineers now say could have been prevented. Nearly two-thirds of the 44 buildings that fell in Mexico City were designed with a construction method called flat slab — in which floors are supported only by concrete columns — now forbidden in parts of the United States, Chile and New Zealand according to data compiled by a team of structural engineers at Stanford University and obtained by The Associated Press.

Mexico City officials were widely lauded for tightening their building codes after thousands died in the 1985 earthquake. But they left out one crucial reform: a prohibition on the building technique that caused 61 percent of the building collapses in last month's magnitude 7.1 quake, which killed 369 people and blanketed tree-lined avenues in rubble.

""I keep thinking about what would have happened if I had still been in bed that afternoon."" said Abadia, 26, who was in her bedroom that morning recovering from thyroid cancer, dreaming of furnishing the home she and her husband moved into in March. ""That was where we used to feel safe.""

The concrete slabs used to build floors and ceilings can be cast to include some rebar for reinforcement, and give builders greater flexibility in room layout and allow for higher ceilings.

But in an earthquake, without reinforced concrete walls or lateral bracing to resist forces pushing structures sideways, buildings with that design can move too much. The columns, and connections between the slabs and columns, can easily break, prompting collapse, as was the case at a school where 26 people died, most of them children.

""We have known for 30 years that this system killed lots of people, so why are we still using it?"" asked Eduardo Miranda, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and global expert on earthquake-resistant design who compiled the data. ""The right decision after '85 would have been to completely ban this kind of construction. We could have saved lives.""

Abadia's trendy, ecofriendly apartment building with its wood-paneled balconies and solar-paneled roof collapsed when a corner column failed, and the flat-slab structure pancaked, Miranda said. There, the construction method was only the start of the problems: The units were designed by an architect whose license lapsed, and approved in a borough where auditors previously found illegal construction occurred unchecked.

Experts concur that the devastation caused by last month's earthquake in the city of 8.9 million people could have been much worse had the building codes not been so strong, but it also has forced an uncomfortable conversation about their shortcomings. Now, as experts race to toughen standards to retrofit hundreds of damaged buildings, they are grappling with the reality that corruption has allowed hundreds of structures to be built outside the rules atop the soft soils of Mexico City's ancient lakebed.

———

After the quake, Abadia and her husband made their way home to find their flat in ruins, concrete and rebar tangled in the parking lot, pieces of Styrofoam filler used in the slabs floating in the breeze. Frantic neighbors gathered to search for a missing mother and daughter-in-law they knew cleaned an apartment down the hall, but the builder never appeared, so residents were left to sketch out their own graphs of the building's structure for rescue crews seeking a safe entry point.

""The two people working in #404 couldn't get out,"" said Abadia, the scars from her operation still fresh at the base of her throat. ""How is it possible that after less than a year after it opened, the building was completely demolished?""

The day after the earthquake, the builder, Canada Building Group, sent residents an email saying that the company was not responsible for the collapse because the earthquake was a ""fortuitous event"" out of its control.

Little did residents know that the private engineer who designed the building had been working under a license that expired in July 2015, online records show. City officials and the engineer did not return calls seeking further details about the expiration.

And the borough official who heads the department that signed off on the plans the engineer submitted, including the waffle slab construction, reportedly had been suspended for illicit enrichment after an investigation by Mexico City's controller found he failed to report a home and two cars on his income statement. Neither the builder nor the official, Nicias Rene Aridjis, responded to AP's calls or messages but Aridjis has disputed the claim on Twitter.

An audit performed by Mexico City's controller in 2015 shows that the same borough, Benito Juarez, had been rubber stamping construction drawings, allowing unpermitted and illegal construction to sail through its offices.

""It?was?found that the department of public works and urban development does not have a specific program to administratively verify?construction drawings,"" the audit said.

Borough officials did not return calls seeking comment, but previously announced they were investigating possible sanctions against the developer of Abadia's apartment building and planned to file a criminal complaint.

""It will need to be investigated ,"" said Renato Berron, head of the Institute for the Security of Constructions of Mexico City, a city agency. ""It can't be that something so new fell down.""

———

In the crisis following the 1985 quake, a group of academics, building officials and engineers worked day and night to draft emergency recommendations to strengthen Mexico City's seismic codes, which were swiftly passed into law.

The committee was under pressure to analyze what caused the collapses and quickly issue new norms, and some architects and builders were opposed to an outright ban on flat slab construction, said Miranda, whose work at the time was to write reports that informed the committee as they crafted tougher rules.

""There were lots of builders and owners who were not going to be happy that you just stopped their construction,"" said Miranda, who later went on to serve on Mexico's code committee in the 1990s, as well as on committees funded by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""These things start as technical conversations but then you run into policy and politics very quickly.""

The new codes allowed flat slab construction if developers designed the building to be seismically stronger than structures with beams or concrete walls.

Authorities did not focus enough on evaluating if existing flat slab structures needed a seismic retrofit after 1985, Miranda said.

""It would have been better to have insisted very much about not using flat slab, or using it only it in very special cases,"" said Roberto Meli, a renowned structural engineer who served on the code committee in 1985, and went on to head the federal Center for Disaster Protection founded after that quake. ""There should have been more of a public information campaign to designers and builders that this was not a good solution.""

The new codes gave more responsibility to a network of private engineers who are hired and paid by developers, and who submit structural plans to borough authorities. In practice, that means private engineers — not government experts — vet projects' structural safety, and even city officials say the process can be vulnerable to corruption.

""Corruption can come in many forms, from the moment someone accepts a bribe to when someone falsifies documents, or fails to present the right structural plans to borough authorities,"" said Berron. ""If the construction rules were implemented as they are written, then this could be avoided. But that hasn't always worked out.""

In recent decades, middle-class enclaves close to the city's professional center have experienced vertiginous growth, and a dizzying array of unpermitted helipads and illegal, multi-floor garages have sprouted up between historic neoclassical homes. In the last 15 years, residents of Abadia's Benito Juarez borough and two others nearby have sent in the highest number of complaints about land-use violations to a city watchdog agency.

Now, those same boroughs are home to dozens of damaged buildings that may need to be demolished or require emergency retrofitting, according to data from the Mexican Society of Structural Engineers. Miranda, whose team compiled the data on the 44 collapses through in-person visits and detailed structural analysis, estimates that hundreds of damaged buildings were built with flat slab systems, including some built relatively recently. Some 57 percent of the collapsed buildings had a soft story, a garage or other similar opening on the ground floor, Miranda's data shows.

Meli said he and others on the expert committee will seek to strengthen retrofitting standards first, and by early next year he said they may reexamine flat slab, although he is not convinced prohibiting the method outright would have worked.

Abadia, who is living temporarily at her mother-in-law's apartment on the other side of the vast city, said she hopes shoddy builders will be held responsible.

""We lost everything,"" she said. ""We know an earthquake is an unexpected event. But a new building should not fall down.""

When a Crisis Is an Opportunity

The Perils of Trumpism and the Call to Engagement

American democracy was never supposed to give the nation a apresident like Donald Trump.

We have had more or less ideological presidents and more or less competent presidents. We have had presidents who divided the country and presidents whose opponents saw them as a danger to everything they believed in. But we have never had a president who aroused such grave and widespread doubts about his commitment to the institutions of self-government, to the norms democracy requires, to the legitimacy of opposition in a free republic, and to the need for basic knowledge about major policy questions and about how government works. We have never had a president who daily raises profound questions about his basic competence and his psychological capacity to take on the most powerful and challenging political office in the world. We have never had a president who spoke more warmly of dictators than of democratic allies, and whose victory came with the assistance of a foreign power that meddled in our election. We have, in short, never had a president who, from his first day in office, plainly showed that he had no business being president.

Trump arouses anger, yes, but also fear—fear about whether our institutions can survive a leader who praises strongmen abroad and sees them as a model for bold leadership; fear about the instincts and commitments of a narcissistic politician who assails and insults revered national heroes, from John Lewis to John McCain, simply because they refuse to fall in behind him; fear about the future of a tolerant, multiracial, and multiethnic nation under a leader who freely demeans whole groups of Americans; fear about an incompetent executive branch staffed by loyalists with contempt for government and little understanding of its critical functions; fear about the country’s standing in the world, given his cavalier and often hostile attitude toward long-standing alliances and toward many of our closest friends; fear about the future of gender equality under a president who shamelessly demeaned women and bragged about assaulting them; fear of the likelihood of corruption on the part of a chief executive who refuses to separate himself from his business empire in any meaningful way; and, finally, fear for the future of the united states’ great experiment in freedom and democracy.

In his duplicitous reaction to Russia’s efforts to undermine our democracy, he has shown us how the dysfunction of our politics puts our nation directly at risk. it makes us vulnerable to outside efforts to use our internal divisions to sow chaos and weaken our nation. Trump uses terrorist attacks to personal advantage, as when he responded in June 2017 to the death of seven people and the injury of dozens of others in London by criticizing the city’s mayor and trying to score points in our domestic debate on gun control.

And far from bringing us together, Trump demeans his office by regularly turning its power to petty and often cartoonish assaults on his enemies, particularly in the media. Thus, his sexist Twitter outburst against MSNBC’s Mika Brzezinski and his posting of a video two days before the nation’s July 4th holiday of his violently wrestling a figure labeled “CNN.” These and other episodes we describe in these pages reveal a presidency devoted to the interests, proclivities, and will to power of one man, not to the needs of the nation.

Yet precisely because the crisis created by Trump’s rise is so profound, we believe that the popular mobilization and national soul-searching he has aroused could be the occasion for an era of democratic renewal. if Trump is a threat to our democracy and the product of its weaknesses, the citizen activism he has inspired is the antidote, the way to vindicate our long experiment in self-rule. opposition to Trump is calling millions of Americans to a new sense of citizenship.

We offer One Nation After Trump to encourage this new engagement and to insist that the movement against Trumpism needs not only tactics and strategies but also a vision—a hopeful and unifying alternative to his dark and divisive assessment of our country’s prospects. his opponents need to offer clear, compelling, and practical ideas that respond to a distemper that led many of our fellow citizens to feel such disgust with the status quo and such anger about their place in it that they were prepared to risk empowering a deeply and obviously flawed demagogue.

We also propose answers to what we see as questions our country must face. in some cases, we suggest that the conventional responses to them are wrong or incomplete. in others, we highlight what we feel are the underappreciated insights of historians and political scientists who draw our attention to the long-term nature of the problems we confront. at the same time, we also acknowledge the very good work that journalists and scholars have done in a short time to help our country understand how we came to this moment and what we face now.

We thus ask: Where did Trumpism come from? Why were nearly 63 million Americans persuaded to vote for him? What is the nature of Trump’s threat to our free, democratic republic, and how can those who would protect it take him on? how can we defend those whose rights he undermines? how can we create a politics that is not a zero-sum game pitting Americans against each other along the lines of race, class, gender, region, and background? and how can we begin solving the problems and responding to the legitimate grievances that gave rise to Trump in the first place?

If Trump represents a unique hazard, he did not single-handedly create the circumstances that made him president. he did not become the dominant figure in the republican Party simply because of his mastery of reality television, cable news, tweets, and the power of the oft-repeated lie, as helpful as these were to his unlikely ascent.

Rolling back the Trump threat requires seeing that he represents an extreme acceleration of a process that was long under way. it involves the decline of basic norms in politics, governing, and the media as well as the decay of institutions that are central to republican government. The radicalization of the republican Party and its primary electorate began three decades ago. absent these forces, Trump would still be a loudmouthed developer and brand-peddler far removed from the levers of power.

Trumpism can be understood as a protest movement among a minority of Americans to long-term changes in the country’s social, economic, religious, and political life. it is, in the literal sense of the term, reactionary. This separates it not only from progressivism but also from a traditional conservatism that, in principle at least, always accepted what Edmund Burke, the first conservative, taught: that preserving what is best in a regime and a society means accepting that change and reform are inevitable.

Burke recommended “a disposition to preserve, and an ability to improve.” Trumpism looks backward, not forward.

Trump took advantage of a trend in american politics toward minority rule, or what might be called “non-majoritarianism.” our system is now biased against the american majority because of partisan redistricting (which distorts the outcome of legislative elections), the nature of representation in the united states senate (which vastly underrepresents residents of larger states), the growing role of money in politics (which empowers a very small economic elite), the workings of the Electoral College (which is increasingly out of sync with the distribution of our population), and the ability of legislatures to use a variety of measures, from voter iD laws to the disenfranchisement of former felons, to obstruct the path of millions of Americans to the ballot box. Trump profited from this bias against the majority, becoming president despite losing the popular vote by the largest margin ever for an Electoral College winner.

But he also exploited the seething rage created by economic changes that left significant parts of our country devastated and the citizens of these regions angry enough to turn to a charlatan whom they saw as at least articulating their sense of discontent. Trump’s opponents will not prevail if they ignore the roots of this unhappiness. The conversion process requires listening as well as preaching. it mandates self-criticism and self-examination if the call on others to think differently is to have any chance of being heard. it’s true that some of his enthusiasts have expressed views about African Americans, women, immigrants, and Muslims that demand condemnation. But while denouncing Trump’s supporters for “voting against their interests” or for being “backward” or “reactionary” may be emotionally satisfying to his opponents, it will not persuade any of them to reconsider the choice they made. Worse still, some of the hostility that Trump’s critics express toward those who voted for him merely mirrors the attitudes encouraged by his own strategists, who would intentionally divide our nation for their own political purposes.

Republican leaders confront an even more profound moral reckoning in acknowledging their role in enabling Trump’s ascendancy. for decades, they had taught their supporters to mistrust Washington and hate government. They exploited the Tea Party and other mass movements on the right for electoral gain. Their rhetoric opened the way for Trump’s nihilism and his promise to take a wrecking ball to the very system in which these Republican officials were complicit. for the republican establishment, Trump’s triumph ratified John F. Kennedy’s warning in his inaugural address: “Those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside.”

The times were well suited to a candidate prepared to combine elements of populism, nationalism, nativism, and protectionism, and to marry these to the promise of strongman leadership (“i alone can fix it”). Paradoxically in light of who Trump is, a man deeply immersed in the world of high-level influence peddling, he cast himself as an implacable opponent of powerful moneyed interests and as the guardian of working people. That his own party had championed the role of large donations and that a conservative supreme Court had struck down long-standing limits on their influence did not deter him.

His nationalism and his forays into old-style “america first” isolationism played to a country exhausted by long and unsuccessful wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. his protectionism was welcomed by many voters—especially in the pivotal states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Ohio—after the disappearance of mil- lions of well-paying manufacturing jobs, many of them to China. his nativism responded to the unease among many native-born Americans about the rise in the proportion of immigrants in our population over the last four decades. and the Republican Party’s success in obstructing Barack Obama’s agenda contributed— again paradoxically—to a popular desire for strong leadership that showed little regard for rules or norms.

Trumpism represents something far more important than the scheming of one man. To see clearly where Trumpism comes from is to understand that this worldview did not just suddenly sweep the country, does not command vast support among the american people, and does not represent an irresistible wave of the future. But for Trump and Trumpism to be defeated, Americans must understand the nature of the threat that he poses, the shortcomings in our society that he exploited, and the dangers of his overt and covert appeals to racism and xenophobia. They must also embrace public engagement—from demonstrating and attending town meetings to organizing a precinct, registering voters, working on campaigns, running for office, and, of course, voting itself. saving our democracy requires citizens to devote themselves to the messy, sometimes frustrating, but ultimately gratifying work of self-government.

Trump poses a challenge for Republicans and Democrats alike. With some courageous early exceptions, Republicans in large numbers were willing to work with Trump and overlook or apologize for even the shabbiest aspects of his presidency in the hope of winning policy victories that have eluded them for more than a decade. republicans who know better have also been intimidated by the very forces they helped unleash within their own party. They fear primaries, and they fear assaults from the conservative media. They worry that the GOP really has become Trump’s party and are thus willing to accommodate him in order to hold on to the power they have.

The Democrats’ path has, in one sense, been easier. opposition to Trump runs so deep among so many Americans that standing up to him has turned out to be the best way to mobilize new forces into politics that could herald a revival of the center-left and the Democratic Party. But Democrats face a complex set of choices, partly because many of their senators, especially those up for reelection in 2018, come from states where pro-Trump feeling ran strong; partly because they are seeking to win over and work with at least some conservatives who may agree with certain Trump policy initiatives but share the center-left and left’s deep concern about his authoritarianism and unfitness; and partly be- cause defeating Trump will require both a vigorous defense of the rights of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities—including American families endangered by Trump’s hostility to immigrants—and an understanding of the legitimate grievances of white working- class voters who expressed their frustrations by supporting him. Empathy can be hard in a period of profound political polarization, but it is indispensable. at the same time, warm feelings are not the same as coherent policies, and we hope here to show where they can be found.

The first part of One Nation After Trump analyzes the meaning of Trump’s ascendancy and the dangers it poses. We open by insisting that Trump’s opponents should take heart from the fact that he has never represented an american majority. a large share of the Trump vote was a negative verdict on the status quo (and, in the general election, on Hillary Clinton). his election was not a mandate for Trumpism. understanding what did not hap- pen in 2016 is as essential as understanding what did for moving forward.

So is an understanding of the complicated role of the media. The paradox is that the media, particularly television, facilitated Trump’s election and yet is now one of the most powerful forces holding him accountable. We vigorously defend the role of a free and independent media while also pointing to the problems in our media system, the failures of journalism during the 2016 campaign, and the historical roots of Trump’s attacks on the press’s legitimate and essential role. Truth is the ally of both a free press and our democracy, and it is not well served by the temptation of false balance, the insistence that both sides are equally at fault even when this is plainly not the case.

We then offer three closely related chapters on the decay of the norms essential to democratic government, how this decay can lead to lawbreaking and the rise of autocracy, and how Trump has used populist appeals to gain power, even as his economic policies strongly favor society’s most privileged sectors. We use these chapters to detail many of Trump’s abuses during his first six months in office. our purpose is to make clear that Trump’s is not a normal presidency, that he lacks the self-restraint a functioning democracy requires of its leaders, and that his ethical misconduct raises systematic doubts about his capacity to govern in the public interest.

Norms, we argue, are often more important than formal rules in ensuring the functioning of a constitutional republic. Trump has violated these basic understandings of how our democracy works in an unprecedented way, yet his behavior is rooted in the evolving politics of the american right. in briefly revisiting arguments we made in our recent books (Why the Right Went Wrong and It’s Even Worse Than It Looks), we trace how democratic norms have been under a sustained attack for decades by an increasingly radicalized Republican Party and conservative movement. Trump is less of an outsider than he seems, and he was building on rather than resisting recent trends within the GOP. This history helps explain why so many Republican leaders are reluctant to call out Trump’s excesses and to acknowledge the risks he poses to our political system. Defeating Trumpism will require reversing longer-term political trends.

This norm-breaking is not simply a matter of political nicety. it is part of Trump’s larger assault on our institutions, his tendency to think in autocratic terms, his abusive attitude toward the judicial system, and his disrespect for civil servants and the day-to-day work of government. We show how Trump’s words and behavior parallel those of authoritarian leaders, past and present. We also deal with the curious contradictions of the Trump presidency. in many ways, it embodies weakness, the result of his refusal both to engage himself in the details of government and to appoint qualified men and women to the second and third tiers of his administration. Yet it also makes vast claims to power.

Because Trump sometimes resembles the authoritarian populists of other nations and other periods of history, we next dis- cuss the difficulties with populism as a concept, describe the many forms it can take, and examine how the term can be overused and misapplied. We conclude that to the extent that Trump is a populist (in many ways an absurd label for a well-born billionaire developer), he fits into the category of those who define “the people” in an exclusionary way. his purpose is to cast political opponents and members of minority groups as the people’s enemy. and whether or not Trump can fairly be called a populist, his policies make clear that he is a phony friend of the working class.

We close the first part of the book by taking on a debate that is of central importance both to understanding our country and to developing strategies for effective opposition to Trump: whether his support depended more on economic discontent or on a backlash rooted in race, culture, religion, and nativism. it is a debate that often divides Trump’s opponents. after examining a raft of postelection studies, we conclude that while the cultural- backlash thesis explains a very large share of Trump’s support, the economic backdrop of 2016 was critical to his victories in the key rust Belt states. We thus point to the dangers of two forms of denial: the temptation to underplay the large role of race, immigration, and cultural conservatism in his campaign and his appeal, and the danger of overlooking the desire of many of his supporters to strike back against their sense of economic dispossession. Dealing with both is essential to moving beyond Trumpism.

This leads directly to the second part of our narrative. if we hope to encourage successful opposition and resistance to Trump and Trumpism, our purpose here is also forward-looking. We of- fer a substantive agenda because we agree with those who say that Trump’s opponents have an obligation to offer a coherent alter- native vision. at the same time, we insist that those who oppose Trump do so precisely to affirm a series of values he has put in jeopardy—about what political leadership demands, how politics should be carried out in a free republic, and how Americans should treat each other across our many differences. Trump’s ascent to power is a warning sign pointing to the need for national renewal. The answer to Trump—the way both to defeat him and to solve the problems that led to his presidency—will be found, we believe, in efforts to forge a new economy, a new patriotism, a new civil society, and a new democracy.

It should not have taken Donald Trump to remind us of the profound imbalances in our national economy or to demonstrate that many Americans have been left behind over the last 30 years. Trump-style protectionism galvanized many voters because advocates of trade agreements regularly broke their promises of new paths to prosperity for communities and individuals distressed by globalization.

Trumpian discontent is typically defined as the product of an angry white working class that has suffered as manufacturing jobs have been moved overseas or supplanted by new technologies. True, Trump’s supporters were and remain overwhelmingly white, and his appeal was inflected with a white ethno-nationalism. But the process of deindustrialization affects Americans across all races—and, it should always be remembered, a very large share of the american working class is not white but African American and Latino. as the sociologist William Julius Wilson noted in his book When Work Disappears, the vanishing of blue-collar jobs in a globalized and technologically sophisticated economy began wreaking havoc in our nation’s inner cities long ago.

A new economy will rise from an honest reckoning with the growing inequality and despair in many kinds of communities across our country, and also from an effort to build on the many economic advantages the united states enjoys. it will deal with the legitimate sources of discontent felt both among Trump’s sup- porters and in the neighborhoods and precincts most strongly op- posed to him. We do not pretend to offer a full-fledged economic program in these pages, but we do lay out a framework for dealing with the structural barriers to a more just economy. We propose a Charter for American Working Families, a GI Bill for American Workers, and a Contract for American Social Responsibility to offer ways of improving incomes, increasing social mobility, and strengthening communities caught on the wrong end of the economy. responding to the grievances of the working class—white and nonwhite alike—must be part of the response to the economic struggles of all Americans. Trump’s opponents cannot engage in a false-choice argument about whether to maintain their commitment to the rights of our country’s ethnic minorities or to focus entirely on the white working class. Their task is to find policies that serve the interests of both groups, and of all Americans.

A new patriotism is the alternative to Trump’s nationalism. it is ironic that despite Trump’s calls for “america first,” he has imported into American politics a blood-and-soil nationalism far removed from the united states’ pluralistic and constitutional traditions. Despite many bouts of nativism, american patriotism has always returned to a definition of national identity rooted in constitutional republicanism and democratic institutions. a new patriotism would defend our commitment to pluralism while also stressing ideals shared across all of our differences. E pluri- bus unum—out of many, one—is our brilliant national motto that stresses both the “many” and the “one.” our pluralism must speak to all Americans, upholding both our right to express particular identities and our shared commitment to an equality that martin Luther King Jr. insisted was “a dream deeply rooted in the american dream.” a new patriotism would also reaffirm the united states’ commitment to democratic values and renew our alliances with other democratic nations. a foreign policy that walks away from international structures that are themselves products of creative american statecraft is not a form of “realism.” it is short- sighted and self-defeating.

And a new patriotism requires that our country rediscover empathy as the antidote to Trumpian division. Left, right, and center have contributions to make in the task of reweaving our nation’s social bonds and in insisting that empathy cannot be selective. The injustices confronting African Americans in inner cities and rural areas must bring alive our social consciences, and so too should the anguish in declining and predominantly white communities in Appalachia and the old factory towns across the northeast and Midwest.

Recognizing that the economic and social anxieties Trump exploited are fueled by a sense of dislocation and alienation, we also call for a new civil society. Trumpism thrives on division and seeks to deepen rather than heal the polarization in our politics. Trump’s approach to politics always requires an enemy. This is true in a personal sense, as was obvious in his, by turns, vitriolic and mocking attacks on President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and his republican primary opponents. he also needs a collective enemy, whether at home (“the dishonest media” and Mexican Americans as “rapists”) or abroad (isis, which truly is an enemy, but also our European allies, whom he regularly denigrates).

It is an irony of Trump’s appeal that while his combative rhetoric made him anything but a unifier, many rallied to him out of a yearning for forms of community and solidarity that they sense have been lost. Economic change has ravaged not only individual living standards but also cities and towns that once created thriving forms of civil society through churches and labor unions, veterans’ organizations and service clubs, sports leagues and ethnic associations. it is not mere nostalgia to miss the forms of sociability and mutuality that are far more difficult to maintain when communi- ties lose the vitality of a strong economic base. Writers as varied in their views as Robert Putnam, Charles Murray, and J. D. Vance have shown that economic decline is often implicated with family breakdown and the decay of social institutions. family and community disruption, in turn, push many toward alcoholism, opioid abuse, and suicide, setting off a vicious generational cycle that is hard to break. The rise of what economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton have called “deaths of despair” among middle-aged whites is a national tragedy and a national emergency. This should be recognized, but so too should the deep hurts in African American and Latino communities. here again, casting one group’s pain against another’s is a recipe for division and inaction.

Finally, a new democracy requires answering political dysfunction and a pervasive sense of political cynicism with reforms that would make our system more inclusive and more democratic. as long as so many citizens see the system as rigged (a word Trump used to great effect), they will be reluctant to embrace the work of self-governance. This is why we call for institutional reforms to reduce the power of big money in politics and to protect the voting rights of all Americans.

But all this will only be possible if citizens once again join the democratic fray in large numbers. Trump’s election called forth an extraordinary mobilization and drew millions of Americans to political engagement. This new era of civic commitment is essential to stopping Trump and reversing the effects of Trumpism. it is also a prerequisite to healing the wounds in our body politic that allowed him to reach the White House.

We are aware that events during the Trump presidency have moved with an unprecedented speed that far outpaces book- publishing schedules. however, absent a miraculous change in Trump’s character we believe the story we tell here will be consistent with further developments. The damage that Trump has inflicted on our system will need repair no matter when he actually leaves office. That is why much of this book is forward-looking. our nation must begin devising a new politics to move us beyond the chaos he has sown.

Our title consciously echoes the final words in the Pledge of allegiance, “one nation under god, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.” We certainly make no claims to speak for the almighty, but the last seven words of the pledge define our hopes. The battle against Trump is a fight against national division—for the idea that we still are “one nation”—and a defense of liberty and justice. restoring our capacity to work together to protect these values is the best way to put Trump and Trumpism behind us.",,,

“We filtered out the mayor a long time ago,"" Long told ABC News ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz on Sunday. ""We don't have time for the political noise.”

The mayor of Puerto Rico's capital city, Carmen Yulín Cruz, has slammed President Donald Trump and the federal response to the damage to the U.S. territory since Hurricane Maria struck over two weeks ago.

Cruz continued her criticism in a tweet this morning, claiming that San Juan had requested support from FEMA following power outages but had received “nothing,” and that the U.S. government “does not want to help.”

Increasingly painful to undestand the american people want to help and US Gov does not want to help. WE NEED WATER! @cnnbrk — Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) October 8, 2017

Power collapses in San Juan hospital with 2 patients being transferred out. Have requested support from @FEMA_Brock NOTHING! @cnnbrk — Carmen Yulín Cruz (@CarmenYulinCruz) October 8, 2017

Long said FEMA is flying patients from Puerto Rican hospitals without power to a massive Naval hospital ship, the U.S.N.S. Comfort docked at San Juan.

He added that in regard to ongoing work to restore Puerto Rico's power grid, ""we're restringing a very fragile system every day. As we make progress, simple thunderstorms pass through, knock the progress out.""

With another hurricane, Nate, having hit the Gulf Coast early today -- the fourth to make landfall in the U.S. this hurricane season -- the FEMA chief told Raddatz that the emergency management agency is stretched thin.

“Money’s not the issue. Congress has been on top of that working with us,” Long said.

But, he said, the ""bottom line is ... that over nearly 85 percent of my entire agency is deployed right now. We're still working massive issues in [response to hurricanes] Harvey, Irma, as well as the issues in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and now this one.""

""In regards to resources, of course we're strained,"" Long said.

He said, however, he is confident in FEMA’s relief efforts to respond to the latest storm as it heads through the U.S., saying, “The bottom line is, is that we're positioned to support Nate very well.”",,,

Wesley Mathews, 37, said he ordered Sherin Mathews to stand next to a tree behind the fence at their Richardson home at around 3 a.m. Saturday, according to an arrest affidavit. The tree is across an alley from the home.

Mathews went outside about 15 minutes later to check on her, but Sherin was gone, the affidavit states. The child, who has a developmental disability, was wearing leggings, a pink long-sleeved shirt and pink flip-flops.

The father didn't notify police that his daughter was missing until about five hours later, said Sgt. Kevin Perlich. He said the delay in reporting the matter ""is certainly concerning to us.""

""That does not seem like a normal response that one would do if you have a missing child,"" Perlich said.

Mathews was arrested Saturday on a charge of abandoning or endangering a child. He posted bond late Sunday, according to Perlich. A working phone number for Mathews could not be found and it's not clear if he's hired an attorney to speak on his behalf.

Mathews at one point told investigators that coyotes have been seen in the alley, but investigators say there's no indication that one might have dragged the girl away.

Investigators have seized three vehicles, cellphones and laptops from the family in an effort to find out what became of Sherin, Perlich said. Footage from surveillance cameras in the area also is being reviewed.

State Child Protective Services removed a 4-year-old child from the home early Monday, he said. A CPS spokeswoman, Marissa Gonzales, said the agency has had dealings with the family before, but she declined to release additional information.

Perlich said Mathews and his wife adopted Sherin, who was malnourished when the couple took her in. Mathews told investigators it wasn't unusual for the girl to wake up late at night to eat so that her weight would increase, Perlich said. That may explain why she was punished at 3 a.m., he said. He said authorities are casting a broad net in determining what happened to the girl.

""We don't have any other indication or evidence that she was forcibly abducted from that area,"" he said.",,,

http://abcnews.go.com/US/ivana-trump-opens-surprising-facts-life-donald-trump/story?id=50330454,"['Abc News', 'More Katie']",,[],,"President Donald Trump’s first wife, Ivana Trump, said she has a “direct number” to the White House, turned down the U.S. ambassadorship to the Czech Republic and takes “full credit” for raising the couple’s three children.

Those are just a few of the revelations Ivana Trump, 68, made in a sit-down interview with ABC News’ Amy Robach to promote her new memoir, “Raising Trump.”

Ivana Trump said she speaks to her former husband about once every two weeks, and she has a ""direct number"" to the White House.

""I [don't] really want to call him there, because Melania is there,"" she said, referring to first lady Melania Trump. ""And I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, because I'm basically first Trump wife. OK? I'm first lady.""

In response to the interview, a spokesperson for Melania Trump told ABC News the first lady is ""honored by her role.""

""Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President,"" the spokesperson said, referring to the couple's son. ""She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as First Lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books. There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex. Unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise. ""

Ivana Trump's book, set to be released Tuesday, documents Trump’s journey from growing up under Communist rule in the former Czechoslovakia to marrying a future U.S. president and raising their three children together -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump.

Ivana Trump

Below are seven key revelations about Trump’s life as a mother and the first of President Trump’s three wives.

1. 'I would hate Washington'

Ivana Trump said she has no desire to change places with Melania Trump.

""I think for her to be in Washington must be terrible,"" Ivana Trump said of the first lady. ""It's better her than me. I would hate Washington.""

She continued, ""Would I straighten up the White House in 14 days? Absolutely. Can I give the speech for 45 minutes without [a] teleprompter? Absolutely. Can I read a contract? Can I negotiate? Can I entertain? Absolutely. But I would not really like to be there. I like my freedom.""

She said that keeping her freedom also meant declining when the president of the Czech Republic wanted her to be the U.S. ambassador.

When asked by Robach what President Trump said about the offer, Ivana Trump replied, ""Well, Donald called me and he said, 'If you want to take the position, I [will] give it to you.' I said, 'Donald, no. I want my freedom.'""

Speaking of her advice for his presidency, Ivana Trump said, ""Sometimes I tell him to just, not to speak that much, and tweet are the tweets. I don't disagree with him because he has so much press against him, so if he says something his words are going to be twisted immediately.""

""If he tweets, the whole world can really get his mind and what is his in mind, and he can tell it in his own words.""

2. 'I was in charge'

When Donald and Ivana Trump divorced in 1992, she told him that when it came to raising their three children together, ""There can be only one chef in the kitchen.""

""I would go and call Donald, I said, 'Ivanka is going to Chapin, or she's going to go to the Georgetown University. Eric is going to go to Hill School,' and he said, 'OK,'"" she recalled. ""I was in charge.""

Ivana Trump

Ivana Trump

She continued, ""I just told him where they're going to go, and he said, 'OK.' He trusted my judgment, because I know the personality of my kids.""

During the formative years of their children's childhoods, Donald Trump was ""on the telephone making the deals,"" she said. She takes ""full credit"" for raising Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, she added.

""He was a loving father, don't get me wrong, and he was a good provider, but he was not the father which would take a stroll and go to the Central Park or go play to baseball with them or something,"" she said, adding, ""It was only until they were about 18-years-old [that] he could communicate with them, because he could start to talk business with them.

""Before, he really didn't know what conversation to strike with the little kids.""

23. 'Every person in America hated him and they loved me'

Ivana Trump

President Trump could have accomplished his political ambitions much earlier had it not been for the scandal that engulfed his marriage to Ivana Trump, she said.

""Donald got [a] letter from President Reagan, and he said, 'You should run for president,' and that was 20 years ago,"" she said. ""And I think he could do it if there would not be a scandal.""

She added, ""You know, because every American woman hated him, and every American hated him. There was no way he could run during the scandal time.""

Ivana Trump was married to Trump from 1977 to 1992, when their marriage dissolved amid revelations that he was having an affair with Marla Maples, who later became his second wife.

Ivana Trump has forgiven her former husband, but said she will never forgive Maples, whose affair with her husband was splashed on the New York tabloids.

""I never accepted her apology,"" Ivana Trump said. ""She ruined my family and my marriage.""

4. 'Opportunity to go and prove myself'

Ivana Trump

When asked whether she believes Donald Trump is sexist, she spoke about her own experience while married to the real estate mogul.

""Donald gave me all the opportunity to go and prove myself,"" she said. ""I built the Commander Hotel. I built the Trump Tower. Then Donald [sent] me to Atlantic City, and I was flying at 8 in the morning after breakfast with the kids to Atlantic City on the helicopter.""

She continued, ""I think that Donald supports the woman. He loves the woman. Always did. He definitely respected women.""

Ivana Trump said she has ""not really"" spoken to the president about the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that was released during the presidential campaign. In the 2005 video, Trump, then the star of NBC's ""The Apprentice,"" brags about his ability to grope women because he's ""a star.""

""He was not really disrespectful. He just jokes. Sometime he said things which are silly,"" she said.

When asked by Robach whether she thought he was joking about grabbing women, Ivana Trump added, ""OK, well, that was one instance, and I just wouldn't, I don't want to go into it.""

5. Future Trump presidencies

Ivana said she could see both her daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her son-in-law, Jared Kushner, becoming future presidents. They serve as senior advisers in the Trump White House.

""I think they both could do it,"" she said of her daughter and Kushner, who moved their three children to Washington, D.C., from New York.

""[The] only thing which I regret [is] that Ivanka moved to Washington, so I don't see the grandkids that often, I don't see her that often,"" she said. ""But everything else they do, it's their destination, you know. They do what they want to do and, like I said, they don't cheat, steal and lie and as long as they do that, it's OK with me.""

Ivana Trump revealed it is her 35-year-old daughter who can best voice a difference of opinion to the president.

""Oh, absolutely. Ivanka is number one,"" she said. ""All my kids are, you know, they're not afraid of him. A lot of people, they're afraid to criticize him and they sort of stay behind. But my kids tell him exactly, you know, how they feel, and you take it or leave it.""

6. Marrying into the Trump family was not intimidating

Ivana Trump

Ivana Trump said she was taken by Donald Trump's looks and his mind when they met in the 1970s.

When it came time to propose, Trump tried to woo her beforehand by warning her of what her life would be without him.

""For months before, you know, he said, 'If you're not going to go marry me, you're going to ruin your life,'"" she recalled.

The couple wed in what Ivana Trump described as a wedding with six of her friends from Montreal, where she lived before the nuptials, and 600 people from New York.

""I did not know anybody,"" she said.

Once she was a Trump, Ivana encountered the patriarch of the family, her husband’s father, real estate developer Fred Trump.

""Fred Trump was [a] really brutal father,"" she said. ""We went to Tavern on the Green for the brunch one Sunday and [Trump’s] father ordered a steak. So all the, you know, the sisters and brothers, they ordered a steak.""

""And I said, 'Waiter, can I have a filet of sole? And Fred looked up at the waitress and, 'No, she's going to have a steak.' I look up at the waiter, I said, 'No, Ivana is going to have a filet of sole,' -- because if I would let him just [roll] right over me, it would be all my life and I would not allowed it.""

7. Donald Trump worried his son could be a 'loser'

When Ivana Trump was pregnant with the couple's first child, she said her husband told her they could not name their son Donald Trump Jr. because of a specific concern.

""I said, 'Why not?'"" she recalled. ""He said, 'How about if he's a loser?'""

She continued, ""So I said, 'This is going to be what it is. I carry my kid for nine months, and this is what's going to be. And the same was with Ivanka. He wanted to call Ivanka Tiffany, because we got the heir rights for the Trump Tower from [luxury retailer] Tiffany.""

Donald and Ivana Trump named their only daughter Ivanka. Donald Trump would go onto have another daughter, named Tiffany, with Maples.

Donald Trump, Jr., now 39, found himself at the center of a political firestorm involving his father's presidency earlier this year when it was revealed that he met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Bonus: Ivana Trump's children and former husband have not read her memoir

Ivana Trump said her three children have not yet read ""Raising Trump,"" though they each contributed writings.The president has also not read the book, she said.

""It's about my life and raising my kids,"" she explained. ""And he's in the book because he was father of the kids, but I did not ask him for permission.""

Two people have died from the fires.

Fourteen fires are burning across eight counties, including Napa, Sonoma and Yuba. Altogether, 57,000 acres have been devastated.

Jeff Chiu/AP

Ken Pimlott, the director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, said the fires started around 10 p.m. local time Sunday.

One person died in Mendocino County, while the second perished in Santa Rosa.

With the flames sweeping through entire communities, some area hospitals have been evacuated. Evacuations were also issued for surrounding counties that are under threat, according to the Napa Valley Sheriff's Office.

Pimlott said firefighters are concentrating on saving lives rather than battling the blazes.

The National Weather Service reported strong winds in the San Francisco Bay Area, intensifying the infernos as they tear through businesses and homes.

The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning for the counties most at risk. The warning means conditions are critical.

Strong winds, relatively low humidity and warm temperatures can lead to extreme weather, according to the National Weather Service.

Cal Fire confirmed that the Tubbs fire in Napa Valley has burned 20,000 acres of land and the Nuns fire in Sonoma has destroyed 300 acres.

Jeff Chiu/AP

The Atlas fire, which is just south of Lake Berryessa in Napa Valley, has scorched 5,000 acres since it started.

The causes of the fires are still under investigation.

TORONTO -- Alexandra Sipos-Kocsis doesn't mean to be difficult.

And yet throughout her life, her unique surname has confounded teachers, telemarketers, airlines and more than a few administrative forms that didn't have room for her 12-character, double-barrelled name.

But Sipos-Kocsis loves it, and when she married, she was determined to keep it.

Scroll down or click here to vote in our poll of the day

""My mother never took my father's last name. I always thought that was cool and independent and feminist,"" says Sipos-Kocsis, pronounced SEE-pose KOE-sis.

""And I liked that I was named after both my parents. That always felt important to me.""

When she had kids, however, she faced a dilemma: A triple-barrelled name with her husband's surname Goldstein seemed clunky, and bestowing only one of her names wasn't an option.

In the end, the 34-year-old dropped both when she named her son and daughter Goldstein -- resorting to a paternal tradition her parents deliberately eschewed.

""There are other things I can pass down for (my kids) that are not just names,"" reasons the Toronto fertility coach. ""And I felt that Goldstein is a family name. Even though it's not from my side, it is our family name.""

The quick death of her parents' progressive gesture seems to be the inevitable fate of a lot of double-barrelled surnames that gained momentum in the '80s and '90s.

Now that those hyphenated children are having offspring of their own, the question of how to preserve both the political spirit that inspired their surnames and the practical concerns of day-to-day life seem at odds.

York University linguistics professor Sheila Embleton says the trend for professional women to keep their maiden name started around the mid-'70s. That was still the case in Canada when she wed in 1981 at age 27, and so she and her husband decided that any daughters would get her name, and any sons would get his.

""Until (our daughter) showed up and then he was kind of upset that his name wouldn't be there,"" chuckles Embleton, who welcomed a girl in 1989. ""So we kind of agreed on Ahrens-Embleton.""

Of course, various forms of the double-barrelled surname have long been standard in many cultures, including Quebec and most Spanish-speaking countries. Generally speaking, the tradition is for the maternal surname to drop when a husband's surname is added, notes Embleton.

In the end it's patriarchal, but the mother's surname does survive one generation longer than most Anglo traditions. Today, more families seem willing to chart their own course.

""Your name was prescribed before,"" says Embleton. ""Now, I think there's a little more fluidity in it.""

That sentiment is what drove Laura Pieterson and Damien Boisvert Neufeld to bestow their two children with the invented surname Pine -- an homage to the fact they met while tree-planting and continue to work in silviculture.

Neufeld recently changed his surname to Pine but is still in the process of converting all of his identification, while Pieterson plans to follow suit once a real estate transaction bearing her current name is complete.

""We wanted to be a family unit, we wanted all to have the same name,"" says the 32-year-old Pieterson, who lives in Cowichan Bay, B.C., about 45 minutes north of Victoria.

""But I didn't see why I should take his name.""

And neither did Neufeld, who says he had little trouble defying paternal traditions, despite his mother's disappointment.

""I kind of like the idea of your identity changing, I like to think that I'm not stuck in a rut my whole life and I'm just one person,"" says Neufeld, whose surname has its own complicated backstory.

The 41-year-old added Neufeld as a kid when he was adopted by his step-dad. Boisvert is his late birth father's name, and the one he'd prefer if forced to pick.

Pine, meanwhile, honours all three surnames between them: it references Boisvert, which means ""green wood"" in French, and is comprised of the first two letters of the other names.

""It's not supposed to be a snub or turning our backs on our heritage,"" says Pieterson. ""We just all wanted the same name and something not too long, something simple.""

Plus, Pieterson and Sipos-Kocsis each say they dug deep into their family lines to find middle names inspired by great-grandparents.

And anyway, Sipos-Kocsis says her surname isn't even original.

Her parents were originally Schwartz and Kepecs -- Jewish names that were changed to appear more Hungarian during the Second World War.

""Family preservation is so much bigger than a name for me,"" says Sipos-Kocsis. ""It's who I am, it's traditions I carry, it's the rituals I have, it's how I celebrate life and how I live my life.""

It's the reason neither say they'd be insulted if their kids choose another name when they get married.

""People should be able to be called what they want to be called and to heck with tradition,"" says Pieterson.",,,

LAS VEGAS -- It was supposed to be a celebration of all the things this city is about, a night many thought would never come.

But the carnage is too fresh, the horror still too real.

The city's first major professional sports team opens at home on the Las Vegas Strip on Tuesday night, a short walk from where a gunman carried out an unthinkable attack that left 58 people dead. Fans are expected to pack the T-Mobile Arena to watch the Vegas Golden Knights against the Arizona Coyotes in a debut more than three years in the making.

Hockey will still be played. But the celebration will have to wait.

""This terrible event has kind of put a damper on opening night,"" Knights owner Bill Foley said. ""We're going to be very respectful and pay tribute to the first responders and victims. That's kind of our job. We're the Las Vegas team and this is going to be the first event following the massacre.""

Las Vegas remains a sombre place, even as tourists continue the never-ending party on the Strip. Hospitals are still caring for victims, some still in critical condition, and the cleanup at the site of the massacre continues.

A hockey game isn't going to suddenly make things better. But there will be prayers for those killed and wounded, and praise for those who went in to try and save them.

Surely a lot of tears, too, because emotions are still very raw.

Then there will be hockey on the highest level, as Las Vegas joins the ranks of cities with major sports franchises for the first time.

""We can do the celebratory activity in our second game on Friday,"" Foley said. ""We just deferred all of that and thought we should just focus on helping the victims any way we can.""

Foley, who earned a fortune in the title insurance business, paid a $500 million expansion fee to the NHL to get the franchise for his newly adopted city. In a place where odds matter, he defied them to land a team and get a piece of the privately funded arena on the Strip that opened just last year.

Some 13,500 people bought season tickets. Hockey fans from around the country are expected to visit throughout the season to watch their favourite teams and enjoy a few of their favourite activities in this adult playground.

Two games into the season, the Golden Knights are a surprising 2-0. They begin play at home under less than ideal conditions, eager to do their part to provide some entertainment to a city still in mourning.

""My prayers go to everyone affected,"" said James Neal, who scored the winning goal in both Golden Knights wins. ""We talked about giving people a smile and something to be happy about and we're doing everything we can to help uplift this city and this community.""

Neal went to the Route 91 Harvest festival concert Friday night and was going to go again the night of the shooting; until he got a text that he had a morning skate the next day. He had friends who were there, so the shooting is very real to him.

Neal was among the players who went to visit first responders. He and teammates who are still trying to find their way around the city also went to the victim's assistance centre to try and offer some comfort to victims and their families.

Small things, yes. But this is a team that from Day 1 has had a laser focus on integrating itself with the local community.

""It was pretty tough on them, a lot of people were still looking for loved ones and friends,"" Foley said about the visits. ""But hockey players are all great guys and they all really wanted to participate.""

Eventually, of course, the shock and horror will fade and hockey will just be hockey again. Thanks to a generous expansion draft, the Golden Knights are expected to be one of the better expansion teams in their first year, though any thoughts of a Stanley Cup being paraded on the Las Vegas Strip are a bit premature.

First, though, they must get through an opening night Tuesday unlike any other.

""It's going to be tough,"" Foley said. ""But we're going to do a good job.""",,,

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Technology now in limited use removes about 90 per cent of carbon dioxide from the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants, but energy experts say cost remains the chief obstacle to bringing the ""clean coal"" touted by President Donald Trump into the mainstream.

They cite recent advances in applying the longstanding technology, despite some earlier setbacks, but say the U.S. power sector needs bigger tax credits or other incentives to close the cost gap for using them.

""What we have now is a public policy challenge, or call it a political challenge if you will, in that next phase which is to deploy this technology more widely and bring the cost down, (which) requires a whole new set of policies that go beyond R&D to actual deployment incentives,"" said Brad Crabtree, vice-president for fossil fuels at the Great Plains Institute.

The U.S. has successfully cut other smokestack pollutants, including sulfur, nitrogen and mercury. But carbon dioxide is a bigger challenge because there is so much of it. Coal- and gas-fired electrical generators produce about 30 per cent of CO2 from human activity. Other industries like cement, steel, and fertilizer manufacturing add another 20 to 25 per cent. Farming and vehicles are also major contributors.

John Thompson of the non-profit Clean Air Task Force said there would be no way to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels without taming carbon emissions. The world has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. Scientists say every fraction of a degree change in average temperatures can lead to noticeable swings in local weather patterns.

""If you don't tackle that you really can't constrain warming on the planet to one-and-a-half to two degrees on anybody's likely scenarios,"" he said.

In Congress, bills that now have 64 bipartisan sponsors would raise carbon-capture tax credits from $10 or $20 per metric ton depending on use to $35 or $50. Advocates want it added to the current tax overhaul proposal.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican and co-sponsor, said carbon capture would help protect the coal industry and expand oil production as well as reduce emissions. As for chances of passage, she said Thursday that it's ""too early in the process to know whether those priorities can advance together or separately.""

The Natural Resources Defence Council, like other environmental groups, first advocates efficient energy use and switching to renewable sources, but regards carbon capture as ""a potentially useful tool in the climate protection toolbox,"" said David Hawkins, director of climate programs.

At federal labs in Morgantown and Pittsburgh, researchers cite one recently successful 13-megawatt pilot project in Colorado and say they are on target for a handful of others by 2020 while reducing the cost of carbon capture from $100 per metric ton to $40. ""We're definitely close,"" said Lynn Brickett, the labs' carbon capture technology manager.

The labs are also identifying methods to inject more liquefied carbon dioxide back into the Earth. That's where the carbon-based coal, oil and natural gas originally came from before they were burned and produced the CO2 in the atmosphere blamed for global warming.

New energy technologies normally take 15 years to move from the laboratory to the outside world, according to the National Energy Technology Laboratory. Its researchers are developing computer models to accelerate that timeline for carbon, engineer David Miller said.

The lab, a division of the U.S. Energy Department, acknowledges routine use would be at least another decade away and historically such advances have taken 20 to 30 years. Meanwhile, more U.S. coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close.

In June, Mississippi Power Co. suspended special carbon-capture efforts at its 582-megawatt Mississippi power plant that first turned coal into gas, which cost more than $7 billion to build, more than double the planned cost. Once regarded as a possible model for ""clean coal,"" it now burns natural gas.

The Petra Nova project outside Houston used a $190 million federal grant toward installing a $1 billion system to capture CO2 from an existing 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant, piping it to a Texas oil field and pumping it underground to boost oil production. Operating since late December, the system is currently ""breaking even,"" NRG Energy spokesman David Knox said.

""We're very interested in the technology, but until the economics work, we're not committed to a second one,"" Knox said.

With underground carbon storage, research began 20 years ago and builds on the practices of the petroleum industry, which uses carbon dioxide to drive more oil from the ground, said Traci Rodosta, the lab's carbon storage technology manager. NETL has regional partnerships across 43 states, small-scale projects that began in 2005 and larger-scale field projects in 2008.

There are ongoing efforts in 30 countries. A Norwegian reservoir under the North Sea has injected more than 16 million metric tons of CO2, Rodosta said. Lab scientists say there have been no major incidents with leaking or seismic activity.",,,

WARNING: This story contains profanity.

Denise Lane searches her mind for fond memories of her son, but she has trouble retrieving them. No Christmases, no birthdays. It's hard to remember the good times.

Instead, her mind turns again and again to the memory of her son at their home one morning in April. He was slouched over on the side of his bed, one leg tucked under the other, his head dropped down on his chest.

Even here, her memory is spotty: screaming for her daughter, hugging her 23-year-old boy, feeling his cold skin. She remembers trying to lay him down to perform CPR, but she couldn't get him flat. She remembers kicking as officers pulled her away. She remembers demanding to see her son one last time as he lay in a body bag in her kitchen.

Shawn Kelly Jr. died of a fentanyl overdose that morning in Innisfil, Ont., about an hour's drive north of Toronto.

South Simcoe police began investigating immediately. Within a few days they arrested one man for trafficking. A few weeks later they arrested another for the same offence.

In late August they lowered the boom, laying manslaughter charges against the pair for Kelly's death.

Lane recalls feeling happy when she learned of the development.

""My son didn't deserve to die, he didn't deserve for these people to sell him this shit and for me to wake up in the morning to find him dead,"" she says. ""Shawny may have held a gun to his own head, but the people that sold it to him are the ones that pulled the trigger.""

Several forces and prosecutors across the country are now laying manslaughter charges against those who allegedly supplied fentanyl to people who overdosed and died.

For South Simcoe police, laying such charges is partly about sending a message to dealers of the powerful opioid.

""We're trying to show that when we have the information, we're going to pursue the people providing this because it's causing death in our communities,"" says Det. Sgt. Brad Reynolds, who oversaw the investigation into Kelly's death.

Once tests came back from the coroner saying Kelly died of a fentanyl overdose, prosecutors suggested police lay the manslaughter charges, he says.

The case is still in its early stages. A lawyer for one of the accused said his client maintains his innocence, while a lawyer for the other accused noted that the details of the case are allegations at this point.

Reynolds says evidence will show Kelly asked specifically for fentanyl that was allegedly provided by the two accused. It wasn't a case of another drug, like cocaine, being tainted by fentanyl, he notes.

""We think it's a fairly well known fact that the ingestion of fentanyl can cause death. They are supplying something they know could cause death to the person purchasing it,"" Reynolds says. ""That's where manslaughter comes in.""

Multiple Ontario forces have reached out to discuss similar cases since South Simcoe police laid the charges, Reynolds says.

In some ways, the approach is a fresh take on an old tactic.

Manslaughter charges against drug dealers came to prominence in the early 1980s when actor John Belushi died in California of a drug overdose. Canadian Cathy Smith was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in a plea deal after being prosecuted for second-degree murder. She injected Belushi with speedballs -- heroin and cocaine -- and it was the heroin that killed him.

Experts say the tactic to charge drug suppliers with manslaughter is not a stretch legally.

In 1993, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld a manslaughter conviction against Marc Creighton who provided and injected cocaine into a woman's arm with her consent. She began convulsing, went into cardiac arrest and choked to death on her own vomit.

""The law is clear that you do incur a liability for death resulting from your distribution of a drug,"" says Alan Young, a York University law professor. ""That's because the mental state fault requirement for manslaughter is very low -- the objective forseeability of bodily harm, not even death.""

Kent Roach, a law professor at the University of Toronto agreed.

""Given that it's pretty notorious what fentanyl does to people, it seems to me like a logical progression,"" he says.

Several police forces are trying the tactic.

Ontario Provincial Police have laid two charges against alleged fentanyl traffickers and are investigating three others. A spokeswoman says the force anticipates more such charges as fentanyl deaths rise.

In Edmonton, police have laid manslaughter charges against two alleged fentanyl suppliers in two separate cases in the past year.

""When a person knowingly distributes a drug that is so lethal, and it results in a person's death, all efforts will be exhausted to identify and hold that person accountable,"" says spokeswoman Noreen Remtulla.

Early in September, Brantford, Ont., police charged a 34-year-old man with manslaughter after alleging he sold powdered fentanyl and cocaine to a 46-year-old man who died of an overdose. In late September, RCMP charged a 32-year-old man with manslaughter after a man died by an overdose of carfentanil, an opioid that is 100 times more potent than fentanyl.

But there's a different approach in Vancouver, a city mired in a fentanyl crisis, where police haven't laid any manslaughter charges against alleged fentanyl dealers.

""This is a complex issue that our investigators have considered at length,"" says Const. Jason Doucette, noting that officers investigate every sudden death in the city and go where the evidence leads them.

""I believe charges and convictions in this area are fairly rare, and are usually only successful when a unique set of circumstances and evidence exist for that particular case.""

At least 2,816 Canadians died from opioid-related causes in 2016 and the country's chief public health officer predicts that number will surpass 3,000 this year.

Back in Innisfil, Kelly's mother says her son -- himself a father of two -- told his parents last March that he was addicted to oxycodone. But he didn't want to kill himself, she says.

""He was going to work the next day, he had two little boys to live for. He was on the right path,"" she said. ""My son turned to the wrong people and he's no longer here.""",,,

WASHINGTON -- In an ironic scheduling twist, the current prime minister and his predecessor will both be in Washington, speaking on the same day, about the same issue: the renegotiation of NAFTA, which enters a high-stakes phase this week.

Old political nemeses Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper might literally cross paths. Harper is scheduled to attend a panel discussion on trade Wednesday afternoon, just as Trudeau is a few blocks away at the White House, discussing thorny trade issues with President Donald Trump.

The former Conservative prime minister is on a panel at an event hosted by Dentons law firm that also features Newt Gingrich, a Trump confidant and former top U.S. lawmaker, and by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Some people in the senior ranks of the Canadian government and at Washington's Canadian embassy were caught off-guard by Harper's itinerary --those contacted by The Canadian Press last week said they were unaware Harper would be there on the same day as Trudeau.

One Liberal joked he'd spent enough time in his life worrying about Harper's plans and didn't intend to fret about them this week.

The law firm timed the event to coincide with the fourth round of NAFTA negotiations, which runs Oct. 11 to 15 in Washington and which are expected see a ratcheting up in intensity as countries begin to broach more difficult issues.

Trudeau touches down in Washington late Tuesday and he's expected to raise the nearly 300 per cent duties on Bombardier planes, and duties on softwood lumber with Trump, but NAFTA will likely dominate.

The countries have encountered difficulties on simpler issues even before the NAFTA negotiations have entered anticipated trouble areas like car parts, dairy and dispute resolution, leading some observers to suggest the talks are in trouble.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, a pro-NAFTA member of Trump's team, has expressed disappointment in the progress so far.

""But we think this is the way these things get going,"" Perdue said at a Washington gathering last week.

""If you've ever watched a boxing match they circle one another for a while. I think we've done circling. So we're gonna lay some things on the table in this next round.""

Canada's lead minister on the NAFTA file said difficult negotiations were to be expected.

""This administration is the most protectionist U.S. administration since the 1930s... Proudly (so),"" Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTV's Question Period over the weekend.

""That certainly poses some difficulties in a free trade negotiation.""

Trudeau will not only be meeting with the president during his U.S. trip but also with key American lawmakers with special power over trade -- including the ability to sink or save an international agreement.

Trudeau will be on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning for a rare meeting between a foreign head of government and the full gathering of the House of Representatives' Ways and Means committee.

That committee and the Senate Finance committee have a unique mandate under the U.S. fast-track law to help American trade negotiators design U.S. positions.

They would also be responsible for shepherding any eventual agreement through votes in Congress.

On top of that, these committees would likely design the response from Congress if Trump tries to cancel NAFTA, which he has repeatedly threatened to do, and some legal scholars argue a full repeal requires congressional approval.

Trudeau will head from Capitol Hill to the White House for a meeting with the president on Wednesday afternoon, as Harper appears at Dentons. Trudeau and Trump are expected to make informal remarks to media but not hold a formal press conference together.

LOS ANGELES -- The Hollywood establishment, slow to react to the initial sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein, began speaking out against him more forcefully Monday after the powerful studio boss was fired by own company.

Among the A-listers weighing in were his longtime allies and beneficiaries Meryl Streep, Judi Dench and director Kevin Smith. They spoke up with a combination of disgust over his alleged behaviour and remorse and defensiveness over their own business entanglements with him.

""He financed the first 14 years of my career,"" Smith, whose movies ""Clerks"" and ""Chasing Amy"" were produced by Weinstein, wrote on Twitter. ""Now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed.""

Weinstein, 65, was fired Sunday by the Weinstein Co., the studio he co-founded, three days after a bombshell New York Times expose alleged decades of crude sexual behaviour on his part toward female employees and actresses, including Ashley Judd. The Times said at least eight settlements had been reached with women.

Streep, who once called Weinstein ""God"" while accepting the Golden Globe for ""The Iron Lady,"" condemned his alleged conduct as ""inexcusable"" while also saying she did not know about it before.

""The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported,"" Streep said in a statement.

Stories of his behaviour, she said, were not universally known in Hollywood.

""Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,"" Streep continued. ""If everybody knew, I don't believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.""

Similarly, Dench, whose awards and nominations have been inextricably linked for two decades to Weinstein, first at his company Miramax and then at the Weinstein Co., said in a statement that she was ""completely unaware"" of the ""horrifying"" offences.

""I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,"" she wrote.

Dench won a best supporting actress Oscar for ""Shakespeare in Love"" and a nomination for ""Philomena.""

In ousting him from the company, the Weinstein board of directors said it was reacting to ""new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days."" It did not elaborate.

A studio insider who was not authorized to discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that the Weinstein Co. plans to change its name.

Also, Weinstein's name will be stripped from the TV series ""Waco"" and ""Yellowstone,"" among other projects.

Actress Lena Dunham tweeted Sunday night, ""Easy to think Weinstein company took swift action but this has actually been the slowest action because they always always knew.""

Under Weinstein's leadership, the Weinstein Co. has been a dominant force at the Oscars. It accomplished the rare feat of winning back-to-back best picture Academy Awards with ""The King's Speech"" and ""The Artist.""

In recent years, however, Weinstein's status has diminished because of money shortages, disappointing box-office returns and executive departures.

His other movie credits over the years include ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The English Patient""

Since the Times article, more accounts of predatory behaviour have followed.

In a HuffPost report, TV anchor Lauren Sivan detailed an alleged 2007 encounter with Weinstein. Sivan, then working at a New York cable channel, said Weinstein cornered her in the hallway of a New York City restaurant closed to the public and masturbated in front of her.

Sivan said she had rejected an attempt by Weinstein to kiss her, and he responded: ""Well, can you just stand there and shut up?""

The swift fall of one of Hollywood's most powerful figures has turned up the pressure on many in the industry to speak out.

""What Harvey Weinstein did was abhorrent. He admits he did it. Why should anyone be silent in their disgust and support for his victims?"" director Judd Apatow said on Twitter.",,,

TORONTO -- Alexandra Sipos-Kocsis doesn't mean to be difficult.

And yet throughout her life, her unique surname has confounded teachers, telemarketers, airlines and more than a few administrative forms that didn't have room for her 12-character, double-barrelled name.

But Sipos-Kocsis loves it, and when she married, she was determined to keep it.

Scroll down or click here to vote in our poll of the day

""My mother never took my father's last name. I always thought that was cool and independent and feminist,"" says Sipos-Kocsis, pronounced SEE-pose KOE-sis.

""And I liked that I was named after both my parents. That always felt important to me.""

When she had kids, however, she faced a dilemma: A triple-barrelled name with her husband's surname Goldstein seemed clunky, and bestowing only one of her names wasn't an option.

In the end, the 34-year-old dropped both when she named her son and daughter Goldstein -- resorting to a paternal tradition her parents deliberately eschewed.

""There are other things I can pass down for (my kids) that are not just names,"" reasons the Toronto fertility coach. ""And I felt that Goldstein is a family name. Even though it's not from my side, it is our family name.""

The quick death of her parents' progressive gesture seems to be the inevitable fate of a lot of double-barrelled surnames that gained momentum in the '80s and '90s.

Now that those hyphenated children are having offspring of their own, the question of how to preserve both the political spirit that inspired their surnames and the practical concerns of day-to-day life seem at odds.

York University linguistics professor Sheila Embleton says the trend for professional women to keep their maiden name started around the mid-'70s. That was still the case in Canada when she wed in 1981 at age 27, and so she and her husband decided that any daughters would get her name, and any sons would get his.

""Until (our daughter) showed up and then he was kind of upset that his name wouldn't be there,"" chuckles Embleton, who welcomed a girl in 1989. ""So we kind of agreed on Ahrens-Embleton.""

Of course, various forms of the double-barrelled surname have long been standard in many cultures, including Quebec and most Spanish-speaking countries. Generally speaking, the tradition is for the maternal surname to drop when a husband's surname is added, notes Embleton.

In the end it's patriarchal, but the mother's surname does survive one generation longer than most Anglo traditions. Today, more families seem willing to chart their own course.

""Your name was prescribed before,"" says Embleton. ""Now, I think there's a little more fluidity in it.""

That sentiment is what drove Laura Pieterson and Damien Boisvert Neufeld to bestow their two children with the invented surname Pine -- an homage to the fact they met while tree-planting and continue to work in silviculture.

Neufeld recently changed his surname to Pine but is still in the process of converting all of his identification, while Pieterson plans to follow suit once a real estate transaction bearing her current name is complete.

""We wanted to be a family unit, we wanted all to have the same name,"" says the 32-year-old Pieterson, who lives in Cowichan Bay, B.C., about 45 minutes north of Victoria.

""But I didn't see why I should take his name.""

And neither did Neufeld, who says he had little trouble defying paternal traditions, despite his mother's disappointment.

""I kind of like the idea of your identity changing, I like to think that I'm not stuck in a rut my whole life and I'm just one person,"" says Neufeld, whose surname has its own complicated backstory.

The 41-year-old added Neufeld as a kid when he was adopted by his step-dad. Boisvert is his late birth father's name, and the one he'd prefer if forced to pick.

Pine, meanwhile, honours all three surnames between them: it references Boisvert, which means ""green wood"" in French, and is comprised of the first two letters of the other names.

""It's not supposed to be a snub or turning our backs on our heritage,"" says Pieterson. ""We just all wanted the same name and something not too long, something simple.""

Plus, Pieterson and Sipos-Kocsis each say they dug deep into their family lines to find middle names inspired by great-grandparents.

And anyway, Sipos-Kocsis says her surname isn't even original.

Her parents were originally Schwartz and Kepecs -- Jewish names that were changed to appear more Hungarian during the Second World War.

""Family preservation is so much bigger than a name for me,"" says Sipos-Kocsis. ""It's who I am, it's traditions I carry, it's the rituals I have, it's how I celebrate life and how I live my life.""

It's the reason neither say they'd be insulted if their kids choose another name when they get married.

""People should be able to be called what they want to be called and to heck with tradition,"" says Pieterson.",,,

HALIFAX -- A Nova Scotia hospital has rewritten waiting time rules and end-of-life protocols in response to the disturbing story of how a 68-year-old man dying from pancreatic cancer languished for six hours in an ER hallway.

A report on the death of Jack Webb says that as of July 1, the Halifax Infirmary requires internal medicine specialists to meet their patients within two hours when transferred to the hospital after being seen by another facility.

Webb's widow, Kim D'Arcy, provided the internal report to The Canadian Press. It outlines changes made by the Nova Scotia Health Authority after the saga of his treatment emerged in late April.

The review that followed a public outcry over his case has also brought changes to training of medical students and some procedures for treating dying patients.

It also says that ""unstable"" patients in ER are to be admitted to the hospital ""after a direct conversation"" between emergency and the senior internist.

Webb was supposed to have been seen by an internal medicine specialist upon arrival at the Infirmary when he was transferred there from a suburban ER.

Instead, nobody was waiting and he lay shivering in a crowded emergency room hallway lineup with his paramedics.

D'Arcy says after his wait, Webb spent time in ER with an intravenous that couldn't pump fluid, and he was later bumped from his private room by another dying patient into a medical teaching unit.

He was also repeatedly asked by various staff if he would agree to a do-not-resuscitate order, even though he hadn't been given any clear information on how long he had to live.

On the last day of his life, after being sent for a scope test, Webb lay in a recovery room and overheard staff yell, ""If he stops breathing, don't resuscitate,"" D'Arcy said.

Under the changes, medical students will be guided in simulated conversations on how to talk to dying patients like Webb about their prognosis. In addition, a written ""goals of care"" form is being introduced that documents the varying types of care patients with terminal diseases want to receive.

Jason MacLean, the president of the Nova Scotia Government and General Employees Union, said the reforms are useful steps, but added: ""Wouldn't you think that's the way it should be? ... They are telling you something that should have been (in place).""

Public records indicate the underlying issues of crowded ERs and proposed solutions have been raised for years before Webb's case highlighted the problems.

For example, the former provincial adviser on emergency care, Dr. John Ross, said in a 2010 report that, ""the emergency department CANNOT be used for ... holding areas for in-patients transferred from other hospitals.""

This is precisely what occurred in Webb's case.

There were also recommendations at the time, accepted by the medical advisory committee of the health authority, that specialists take over care of ER patients within two hours of a consultation showing they needed to be admitted.

Still, D'Arcy said she's pleased some measures are being taken as a result of her husband's death.

""They're putting it in writing and they have people assigned to it now ... so now someone's accountable,"" she said.

She first raised the issue of Webb's care just prior to the recent provincial election campaign, helping draw attention to the problems of hospital crowding in the Nova Scotia Health Authority.

His story began weeks before his Feb. 1 death, when the couple wasn't informed he had just weeks to live after a diagnosis of rapidly spreading pancreatic cancer, and nobody discussed the possibility of palliative care with him.

By mid January Webb was struggling to breathe, leading to his visit to the Cobequid emergency department on the outskirts of Halifax and his transfer to the Halifax Infirmary.

The Infirmary was in the midst of daily special alerts known as ""code census"" where the ER declares it's overcrowded and sends patients into regular wards that may already be struggling to cope.

In the quality review, Webb's case has been formally acknowledged as relevant to a wider ""Right care, right place initiative"" that is currently examining the issue of hospital crowding.

Dr. Mark Taylor, a medical director at the health authority, said in a telephone interview that he's pleased with the steps taken to date as a result of the review in Webb's case.

""It's certainly a step in the right direction,"" he said in a telephone interview.

""I think it is in everyone's best interest, that there be a common understanding of what the expectations are and hopefully that can lead to improved standardized care for a patient.""

A spokesman for the health authority said the numbers of people coming to the hospital's emergency over the summer were roughly the same as last year, though in July they reached an average of 218 people daily at the Halifax Infirmary.

Meanwhile, there has been an increase in bed capacity, he said.

""There was an increase of eight beds for internal medicine in the fall of 2016, to bring the total to 94, but no other changes since,"" wrote John Gillis in an email.

Beds at the Camp Hill hospital that are unused by veterans have been used when required for patients from other Halifax-area hospitals, he said.

Gillis said the changes to internal medicine admissions resulting from the Webb case, along with the return of beds at the Dartmouth General Hospital that were closed due to renovations last year, should improve the flow of patients through the hospital this winter and increase its capacity.

However, MacLean said he remains concerned, as health staff are telling him volumes of patients remain similar, and there are still days when the ERs are overcrowded.

""There's no indication things are getting lighter that we see,"" he said. ""I talked to my members in ER and they say nothing has changed.""",,,

Citing a “source,” The New York Post reported that Bila’s exit had something to do with the way she treated Clinton during the recent interview. Bila asked the former Democratic presidential candidate how she felt about liberals who criticize her new book, “What Happened.” The source told the Post that there were, “a lot of staff who were upset about how that interview was handled.” The Post reported that “The View” executives want Clinton to appear on the show multiple times and “had a lot to say to Jedediah about calming things down” when it came to her treatment of the former secretary of state.

“Her departure had nothing to do with the Hillary Clinton interview. Jedediah asked good questions during that interview, and the producers were pleased with how she handled it,” an ABC spokeswoman told Fox News.

Clinton stopped by “The View” on Wednesday and blamed her Election Day loss on a variety of topics, but Bila stepped in to hold the former First Lady accountable with voters on both sides of the aisle.

“To be fair, it hasn’t just been Republicans who have taken issue with the writing of this book. Some Democrats have come out as well,” Bila said to Clinton when discussing the book. “Former campaign surrogates of yours, former fundraisers, and said, ‘This book puts us in the past and we want to move forward, we want to figure out where to take this party, how to succeed in the future. And this places us in the past.’ How do you respond to Democrats also coming out in criticism of you writing this?”

Clinton fired back, “I think they first should read the book.”

According to an internal memo obtained by the Post, “View” producers told staffers that Bila is leaving to pursue other opportunities. An ABC insider told Fox News that “The View” executives have a short list of possible replacements and a new co-host is expected to be “named soon – likely weeks not months.”

The role of the token conservative on “The View” often becomes somewhat of a punching bag, as the rest of the women on the panel are typically liberal-leaning. Bila has filled the role since Candace Cameron Bure left in December. Nicolle Wallace and Elisabeth Hasselbeck are other co-hosts who have filled the now-vacant conservative seat.

Current co-hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Sunny Hostin, Joy Behar, Paula Faris and Sara Haines will likely be joined soon by a new conservative. “The View” has been plagued with turmoil since it was put under the jurisdiction of ABC’s news division in October 2014. Rosie O’Donnell, Rosie Perez, Michelle Collins and Raven-Symone - in addition to Bila, Bure and Wallace - have left the show since ABC News took over.

ABC declined to comment when reached by Fox News. Bila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",,,

http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/pence-walks-out-nfl-game-and-sports-journalists-loses-their-collective-minds.html,['Peter Heck'],2017-10-09 00:00:00,[],,"Editor's note: The following column first appeared on The Resurgent website.

Vice President Mike Pence has been an Indianapolis Colts fan for quite awhile. He served the state of Indiana in Congress during the record-setting heyday of Peyton Manning. So it was unsurprising to find out that Pence planned to be at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis yesterday when the Colts officially retired Manning’s jersey and inducted him into their Ring of Honor during halftime of their game against the San Francisco 49ers.

But the vice president’s homecoming to honor the legendary quarterback was cut short when 15-20 players for the 49ers decided to disrespect the American flag, continuing their pregame publicity stunt by kneeling. Pence left the game and tweeted out his explanation:

“I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem…While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem.”

The reaction was largely predictable, with fans tired of the political posturing of overpaid sports stars applauding, and social justice warriors condemning. What was extraordinarily funny, however, was the way that the sports media humiliated themselves in responding.

The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

Former CBS Sports writer and current Indy Star sports columnist Gregg Doyel, a card-carrying left-wing activist, immediately registered his disgust by cranking out an article suggesting that, “Mike Pence used the Colts to spray paint Donald Trump’s political graffiti.” His hyperbole got him an invitation to appear on CNN’s ""New Day"" with fellow leftist Chris Cuomo.

He was far from alone in his indignation, though. In fact, the entire Indianapolis Star staff, which has notoriously opposed and besmirched Pence for years, apparently saw their opportunity to issue a collective, coordinated strike.

Opinion chief Tim Swarens pushed out a column accusing Pence of demonstrating a lack of leadership. Sports writer Zac Keefer kept everyone informed how much per hour it cost taxpayers to fly Air Force 2, and whined that the, “Whole thing was planned.” But the most hysterical response went to their colleague Stephen Holder who quoted NFL reporter Mike Freeman’s tweet calling Pence’s action “pre-planned outrage” and “fake outrage,” adding, “Total publicity stunt IMO (in my opinion).”

Wait a minute. Holder (and Keefer, and Doyel), have fallen all over themselves applauding the publicity stunt of players taking a knee during the anthem for weeks now. Why are some publicity stunts more equal than others?

Local radio star Tony Katz, who fills in occasionally for nationally syndicated Dana Loesch, asked Holder to clarify whether it qualifies as a publicity stunt when players kneel. Holder’s response was choice:

“Probably to you, because you either aren’t listening to them or don’t care. Good day.”

Sorry, but that’s just too funny. I’m guessing Holder doesn’t even realize that the exact same thing can be said about his response to Pence: Holder either isn’t listening to Pence when he explains why he left, or he doesn’t care. The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

Keefer, Doyel, and Holder don’t want anyone telling players they have to stand for the anthem. But they’re totally fine with telling the vice president he has to stay for the game. This might be why they write about balls for a living.",,,

General Motors is developing a self-driving pack animal. Correction: self-driving pachyderm.

The SURUS borrows its name from a legendary elephant that helped Hannibal cross the Alps and turns it into an acronym that stands for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure.

It’s a flatbed truck without a cab that’s equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain and fully autonomous driving capability.

GM is pitching the zero-emissions vehicle as both a commercial cargo carrier and military supply truck that can stealthily operate in warzones without putting troops at risk.

The platform features an electric powertrain at each end of the vehicle that gives it four-wheel-drive for off-road capabilities and four-wheel-steering to improve its maneuverability in tight spaces.

A cab for a human driver and passengers can be attached to help lead several of the vehicles wirelessly linked in a virtual train.

Instead of loading it with gear or containers, modules outfitted as mobile hospitals or for other functions can potentially be attached.

GM says SURUS has a range of 400 miles per fill up of the hydrogen tanks built into the chassis, and can be used to generate power and produce water from its exhaust in remote locations.

The project follows the creation of a fuel cell-powered Colorado pickup called the ZH2 that is currently being tested by the U.S. Army’ Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC.)

Fuel cell powertrains are nothing new to General Motors. It's spent billions on them since it unveiled the Autonomy concept in 2002, which was a hydrogen-powered chassis that was envisioned to work with different bodies, much like a passenger car-size version of SURUS.

The vehicle also brings to mind the ‘Autotrucks’ conceptual designer Nick Pugh created for the film ‘Logan’ starring Hugh Jackman.

Pugh’s idea was to separate the drivetrain into independent twin-axle pods that could travel in tandem to a loading area and pick up a shipping container at either end. They were a menacing and memorable element of the blockbuster, which was set in the year 2029.

SURUS could be on the road, or at least lugging stuff around battlefields and worksites sooner than that. General Motors is in talks to provide TARDEC with a SURUS for an evaluation, and is working toward putting autonomous vehicles into production within a couple of years.

The SURUS is making its public debut at the Association of the U.S. Army's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Oct. 9-11.",,,
http://www.foxnews.com/auto/2017/10/06/2018-dodge-challenger-srt-demon-test-drive.html,['Gary Gastelu'],2017-10-06 00:00:00,[],,"There’s no better place to test drive the Dodge Challenger SRT Demon than a dragstrip. And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

General Motors is developing a self-driving pack animal. Correction: self-driving pachyderm.

The SURUS borrows its name from a legendary elephant that helped Hannibal cross the Alps and turns it into an acronym that stands for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure.

It’s a flatbed truck without a cab that’s equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain and fully autonomous driving capability.

GM is pitching the zero-emissions vehicle as both a commercial cargo carrier and military supply truck that can stealthily operate in warzones without putting troops at risk.

The platform features an electric powertrain at each end of the vehicle that gives it four-wheel-drive for off-road capabilities and four-wheel-steering to improve its maneuverability in tight spaces.

A cab for a human driver and passengers can be attached to help lead several of the vehicles wirelessly linked in a virtual train.

Instead of loading it with gear or containers, modules outfitted as mobile hospitals or for other functions can potentially be attached.

GM says SURUS has a range of 400 miles per fill up of the hydrogen tanks built into the chassis, and can be used to generate power and produce water from its exhaust in remote locations.

The project follows the creation of a fuel cell-powered Colorado pickup called the ZH2 that is currently being tested by the U.S. Army’ Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC.)

Fuel cell powertrains are nothing new to General Motors. It's spent billions on them since it unveiled the Autonomy concept in 2002, which was a hydrogen-powered chassis that was envisioned to work with different bodies, much like a passenger car-size version of SURUS.

The vehicle also brings to mind the ‘Autotrucks’ conceptual designer Nick Pugh created for the film ‘Logan’ starring Hugh Jackman.

Pugh’s idea was to separate the drivetrain into independent twin-axle pods that could travel in tandem to a loading area and pick up a shipping container at either end. They were a menacing and memorable element of the blockbuster, which was set in the year 2029.

SURUS could be on the road, or at least lugging stuff around battlefields and worksites sooner than that. General Motors is in talks to provide TARDEC with a SURUS for an evaluation, and is working toward putting autonomous vehicles into production within a couple of years.

Ridiculously awesome, that is.

The muscle car wars have a new heavyweight champion, the Dodge Challenger Hellcat.

The burly cruiser has been redesigned for 2015, and to celebrate, they stuffed the top-of-the-line model with 6.2-liters worth of supercharged V8 that pumps out an absurd 707 hp and is named for a WWII fighter plane. Deservedly so.

Never before has an American production car harnessed so many horses, and the only others in the world that do cost about five times the Challenger’s $60,990 price. That’s a big $15,000 jump from the next most powerful Challenger, the no-slouch 485 hp SRT 392, and indicative of just how special the Hellcat engine is.

Essentially an all-new motor, it has a 2.4-liter supercharger, two cooling systems, two air cooling systems and two air intakes -- including one hidden in the middle of the inside left headlight -- that can gulp up to 30,000 liters of air each minute.

Now, plenty of race and tuning shops will tell you 707 hp is no big deal, they’ve been doing that and more for years. The difference is that the Hellcat is backed by a five-year, 100,000-mile powertrain warranty, just like your Grand Caravan.

It’s a great-looking engine, too, with an iron block and valve covers painted HEMI orange just like in the old days, and that huge supercharger sitting on top of it like a Weber grill. The hood has three shapely openings: a scoop to bring in a cool breeze and two extractors to purge heat and lower the air pressure under it to improve aerodynamic downforce. A NASCAR-grade chin splitter and trunk-mounted spoiler help manage the winds, as well.

The Challenger is anything but subtle, even the rental car-spec V6 model, but these tweaks plus a set of black 20-inch wheels take it to the next level. In the couple of days that I had the car, I didn’t park it once without returning to find someone waiting to chat. And when I stopped by Raceway Park in New Jersey, it couldn’t have gotten more attention if Chris Christie had been behind the wheel, taking Eli Manning and Bruce Springsteen for a spin.

Inside, the coupe gets a much needed update, with a curvy and chrome-trimmed dash, retro-inspired gauges, turned-aluminum inserts and Chrysler’s latest UConnect infotainment system, which is one of the best in the business.

Version Hellcat.2 (I made that up) has a couple of screens specific to the car, including one that lets you adjust the steering, transmission, adaptive suspension and even the engine output to your liking. On days that you’re not feeling frisky, you can turn the motor down to a more pedestrian 500 hp, or use a code to lock it in Valet Mode, which cuts the power even further, forces second gear starts and keeps all the safety systems on full. It’s the automotive equivalent of a chastity belt.

There’s even an icon for Eco Mode. Stop laughing, press it, try not to look to hard at the gas pedal and the Hellcat can squeeze out 22 mpg on the highway, thanks largely to its beefed-up eight-speed automatic transmission. The six-speed manual is good for 21 mpg. Neither is high enough to duck a $1,700 gas-guzzler tax, but if there ever was a car designed to consume petroleum products, this is it.

Keep your foot to the floor and the Hellcat will empty its 18.5-gallon gas tank in just over 12 minutes and melt the rubber off of its supercar-grade Pirelli P Zero tires ($1,988 per set at Tire Rack) even quicker than that. Ease up, let them get some grip, and it takes off quicker than a scalded rhinoceros. Dodge says it’ll do the quarter mile in 11.2 seconds and hit a top speed of 199 mph. Considering that it weighs just a smidge less than 4,500 pounds, that’s one speedy ungulate.

A set of the largest brakes ever used by Dodge does a heroic job of slowing things down, while an epic stability control program delivers quick turn in and gets it through the curves better than expected. That is if you leave that gas pedal alone. Press it too hard, and by that I mean “at all,” and it will kick the tail out, especially if it shifts in the middle of the turn. This can happen when you’re going straight, as well. It may be the only car I’ve ever driven with rear-wheel torque steer.

The tires are 9.5-inches wide and they still don’t have a chance. Dodge decided not to flare the fenders to accommodate more. One of those tuning shops certainly will. Along with plenty of standing burnouts, I did one while cruising along at 30 mph. No clutch drop, because I had the automatic. Just floored it and turned the tires into fog. That’s the kind of power on tap. Later in the day it rained and, let’s just say, things got really interesting.

Anyone who got upset when the Dodge SRT Viper was recently “civilized” should give one of these a shot. Turn off all of those driver aids and it’s a handful of understeer, oversteer and inertia, even in the dry. A challenge, for sure. It’s no sports car, it’s a muscle car to the nth power. On a twisty track it’d be the Death Star battling X-Wings, but give it a clean shot and you’ll suffer the same fate as Alderaan.

It’s tempting to think this is the epitome of American power, except that I’m sure it isn’t. The Challenger SRT Hellcat was the answer to the 662 hp Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, which was the answer to the 580 hp Chevrolet Camaro ZL1. With gas prices what they are today, there’s no reason that trend line won’t continue.

It’s ridiculous, and I’m loving it.

And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed. The Demon Crate comes with a set of rims for a pair.

The first time I gave it a shot, I skipped the TransBrake and used the traditional launch control system to get a feel for things. And oh, how it felt.

You simply press the brake pedal hard, floor the gas, release the brake and become one with the deep bucket seat. I’ve been in quick production cars before, but none prepared me for the violence the Demon took off with. The thunder coming out of the exhaust mixed with the screeching supercharger enhanced the experience in a way the silent electric motors of a ‘Ludicrous’ Tesla never could.

And it pulled all the way down the strip, which I covered in 10.2 seconds at 134 mph. And to think that launch control neuters the car. Using the TransBrake is the way to unleash its full abilities, but you’ll need plenty of your own to go with it.

To engage it, you pull both paddles behind the steering wheel, give it some gas (but not too much) and then, when the screen on the instrument cluster tells you it’s OK, you let one paddle go and take your foot off the brake.

It’ll let you sit there like that for about 15 seconds. You release the other paddle to get moving, and then it’s all you. There’s no traction control in this mode, so you need to modulate the throttle to keep from smoking the tires. It’s easier said than done with all that power, even on a strip prepped with sticky traction compound and rubbered-in. On my first three tries, I botched it pretty good.

I eventually managed to get away cleanly a couple of times, but never did better than the launch control. I’m sure a drag racing regular could.

Jim Wilder, the Demon’s development manager, is one of those. He took me for a run in a two-seat car with front-runners on it and pretty much all I can remember is getting walloped in the back and looking at the sky as we left the line. He may have overseen its development, but the launch control has nothing on him. I was so taken aback by the ride that I spaced out and forgot to check his time. Pride wouldn’t allow me to tell you what it was, anyway.

Dodge isn’t the first to hop up a Hellcat, of course. Plenty of shops have figured out how to get this much power and more out of it. The difference is that the Demon comes with a warranty. Wilder said his team did over 500 quarter-mile runs on a single axle, and more than 900 with the same transmission, and both looked like new when they pulled them out to inspect them. It’s doubtful any Demons will see that much action in the real world.

The Demon starts at $86,090. That’s a lot for a toy, and that’s exactly what it is. But it’s likely a steal at that price.

Dodge is building only 3,300 of them for the U.S. and Canada, and they’ve all been allocated. It did its best to keep dealers from marking them up, but some people are already trying to flip cars they don’t have yet for double what they’re paying, and a few probably will. If not now, then in a few years at one of those collector car auctions on TV.

That is, unless Dodge manages to outdo itself. When the Hellcat came out a few years ago, everyone thought it marked the end of days for the muscle car, and then they went and made the Demon and turned the Hellcat into a commodity. While it is a one-year-and-done model, the Challenger is going to be around at least until 2020, so there’s time for an even more evil encore.

But what the devil would they call it?

General Motors is developing a self-driving pack animal. Correction: self-driving pachyderm.

The SURUS borrows its name from a legendary elephant that helped Hannibal cross the Alps and turns it into an acronym that stands for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure.

It’s a flatbed truck without a cab that’s equipped with a hydrogen fuel cell powertrain and fully autonomous driving capability.

GM is pitching the zero-emissions vehicle as both a commercial cargo carrier and military supply truck that can stealthily operate in warzones without putting troops at risk.

The platform features an electric powertrain at each end of the vehicle that gives it four-wheel-drive for off-road capabilities and four-wheel-steering to improve its maneuverability in tight spaces.

A cab for a human driver and passengers can be attached to help lead several of the vehicles wirelessly linked in a virtual train.

Instead of loading it with gear or containers, modules outfitted as mobile hospitals or for other functions can potentially be attached.

GM says SURUS has a range of 400 miles per fill up of the hydrogen tanks built into the chassis, and can be used to generate power and produce water from its exhaust in remote locations.

The project follows the creation of a fuel cell-powered Colorado pickup called the ZH2 that is currently being tested by the U.S. Army’ Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC.)

Fuel cell powertrains are nothing new to General Motors. It's spent billions on them since it unveiled the Autonomy concept in 2002, which was a hydrogen-powered chassis that was envisioned to work with different bodies, much like a passenger car-size version of SURUS.

The vehicle also brings to mind the ‘Autotrucks’ conceptual designer Nick Pugh created for the film ‘Logan’ starring Hugh Jackman.

Pugh’s idea was to separate the drivetrain into independent twin-axle pods that could travel in tandem to a loading area and pick up a shipping container at either end. They were a menacing and memorable element of the blockbuster, which was set in the year 2029.

SURUS could be on the road, or at least lugging stuff around battlefields and worksites sooner than that. General Motors is in talks to provide TARDEC with a SURUS for an evaluation, and is working toward putting autonomous vehicles into production within a couple of years.

The SURUS is making its public debut at the Association of the U.S. Army's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Oct. 9-11.",,,

The TJ Cruiser is a subcompact-crossover with the functionality of a minivan and the looks of a tough off-road SUV. The TJ roughly stands for ‘Toolbox of Joy.’

About the same length as a CH-R, it features sliding rear doors like a Sienna. Aside from the driver’s, all of the seats fold down to create a hard and flat floor that can fit items up to three meters long and is equipped with multiple tie-down points to secure gear.

The overall vibe is reminiscent of the discontinued Honda Element, but with an even more utilitarian feel.

Under a clamshell hood that’s stylishly attached via a single arm is a hybrid motor unit built around a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that powers either a front- or all-wheel drivetrain.

And there’s no better dragstrip than Atco Dragway in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, a muscle car hotbed and home to the legendary Jersey Devil.

That’s where I had the chance to strap into the driver’s seat and take a Demon for a dozen runs. I should say “the seat,” because it comes with only one, making it the world’s most awesome pizza delivery vehicle.

And it can haul.

The Demon is the most powerful American car ever made. It has a 6.2-liter supercharged V8 that puts out 808 hp and still gets 22 mph on the highway. It’s an update of the Challenger SRT Hellcat’s 707 hp motor, which now seems quaint — even more so if you fit the Demon with the special engine control module, included in a tool-and-parts kit called the Demon Crate, that allows it to run on 100 octane race gas and bumps the power up to 840 hp to go with its 770 lb-ft of torque.

Over half of the Hellcat engine’s components were modified in the, including the block, and a monstrous 2.7-liter supercharger strapped on to the top of it. The Demon’s 8-speed automatic transmission, driveshaft, differential and half shafts are appropriately beefed-up, as well.

There is no manual transmission available, but the automatic is one of the coolest ever made. It’s equipped with a feature called a TransBrake. It’s a drag racing technology that, in this case, engages first and second gears simultaneously to bind the transmission, so you can step on the gas to build up torque in the engine and drivetrain without having to use the brakes, which wouldn’t be able to hold back much of what the Demon dishes out before the tires started spinning. Meanwhile, a torque converter with a high stall speed lets you rev engine even higher than you normally could without moving as you await the green light.

Before we get to that, a few other notes on the Challenger’s transformation from Hellcat to Demon. With the project’s goals being a sub-10-second quarter-mile and the ability to lift the front wheels on launch, the SRT team knew it had to trim a few pounds — 232 pounds, it turns out — from the coupe’s over 2-ton weight.

Eliminating the passenger seat and rear bench (both can be added back in for $1 each) along with the trunk carpet and spare tire was the easy part. Swapping in some lightweight suspension parts and smaller brakes is indicative of the Demon’s drag racing focus — although it retains its computer-controlled shock absorber system and still handles pretty well for a behemoth.

The suspension plays an important role in the Demon’s straight-line speed, too. When you set the car to Drag Mode, it stiffens the rear shocks and softens the fronts to help transfer the weight to the meaty, 12.4-inch wide Nitto drag radials at launch. The result is a car that can cover a quarter mile in 9.96 seconds on premium fuel and 9.65 seconds on race gas in ideal conditions with a set of skinny “front-runner” tires installed.

Henri Michele Piette, 62, is accused of keeping his stepdaughter captive for 19 years after “marrying” her when she was around 11 years old, according to court documents provided to Fox News. His other children told investigators that he began sexually assaulting Rosalynn McGinnis when she was very young, the court documents said.

McGinnis was repeatedly raped, stabbed, choked until unconscious, shot and beaten with baseball bats while she was allegedly held captive by Piette, the Oklahoman reported.

Investigators said McGinnis was taken from a school in Poteau, Okla., by Piette’s son in 1997 after her mother had left Piette, allegedly because he abused her. McGinnis was then introduced to Piette’s other children as “their new mother,” an F.B.I. agent said, according to the Oklahoman.

Piette moved around the U.S. and Mexico with McGinnis, but to make it seem as though they were still in Oklahoma, Piette would drive the young girl to the Sooner State to mail letters, court documents alleged. In June 2016, McGinnis, now 33, as able to escape from a tent in rural Mexico with eight of her nine children, she told People. She went to a U.S. embassy and was able to be brought back to America with her children, according to court documents.

“I knew that if I didn’t get out of there I’d either go insane or I would end up dying and leaving my kids with that man,” McGinnis told People. She added that when she was finally able to contact the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, it felt “so nice to be able to tell somebody the truth.”

MAN WHO FOUND MISSING TEEN GIVES $7G REWARD TO HER

“I was still scared, but it was wonderful not to have to lie anymore,” McGinnis said.

One of McGinnis’ sons previously ran away but has since been reunited with his mother, the Oklahoman reported.

Piette is charged with first-degree rape, two counts of lewd molestation of a child and physical abuse of a child, according to a court affidavit provided to Fox News. Court documents said investigators believe Piette had been in Mexico since McGinnis escaped.

“It is believed that Piette has resided in Mexico and or Central America for a very long time and has deep ties to criminal organizations in Mexico, which can assist him in evading law enforcement,” court documents said. “During the week of September 10th, Piette was contacting persons who aided Rosalynn’s escape from Mexico and threatening these individuals.”

Piette will appear in federal court on Tuesday before he is turned over to state authorities, Wagoner County District Attorney Jack Thorp told Fox News.

CHICK-FIL-A BATHROOM USED IN SEXUAL ASSAULT OF 2-YEAR-OLD, POLICE SAY

A woman who identified herself as McGinnis’ cousin set up a GoFundMe account to help McGinnis and her children with daily expenses, tutoring and a place to live.

People reported that McGinnis is living in the Midwest with her children, who range in ages from 2 to 17 years old, and they are being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder. She told People that she has told her children their father is a rapist and abductor.",,,

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/01/13/trump-washington-dc-hotel-gsa_n_14163374.html?ir=Politics,"['Paul Blumenthal', 'Reporter']",2017-01-13 00:00:00,[],,"WASHINGTON ? When explaining how he would (somewhat) extricate himself from his myriad conflicts of interest this week, President-elect Donald Trump and his tax lawyer completely ignored what would happen to the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. It looks like he also failed to discuss that with the government agency that holds the hotel lease.

Trump’s deal with the General Services Administration to operate a hotel in the Old Post Office building specifically states that the lease cannot be held by an elected official. And the clock is ticking down to Trump’s inauguration.

Yet the GSA released a statement on Wednesday, after the president-elect’s press conference, indicating that it was not aware of his plans for the Trump Organization until he announced them to the public.

This is a legitimate international scandal and they’re not part of the conversation. Procurement law expert Steve Schooner, on the GSA

“GSA understands that an announcement has been made to change the business structure of the Trump Organization,” the agency said in a statement. “We are seeking additional information that explains and describes any new organizational structure as it applies to the Old Post Office lease. Upon receipt, consistent with our treatment of any contract to which we are a party, we will review this new organizational structure and determine its compliance with all the terms and conditions of the lease.”

The agency’s apparent lack of knowledge is “extraordinary,” according to Steven Schooner, a government procurement law professor at George Washington University.

“It does appear that GSA is out of the loop on this,” said Schooner, a former government contracting official at the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget. “This is a legitimate international scandal and they’re not part of the conversation.”

The GSA did not respond to a request for comment.

The lease for the D.C. hotel was signed in 2013 and Trump announced his presidential campaign in June 2015. That means the agency has had nearly two years to come up with a plan on what to do if Trump won the presidency. So far, it has refused to state publicly whether it thinks Trump will be in violation of his lease the moment he takes the oath of office on Jan. 20.

On Wednesday, Trump announced his plans to hand over control of his business to his two adult sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, while still maintaining his ownership stake. Such an arrangement does little to nothing to resolve any conflicts related to the business. Walter Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, called the plan “meaningless” and far short of the steps that every other modern president has taken to eliminate financial conflicts upon taking office.

MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images Eric, Donald and Melania Trump cut the ribbon at the grand opening of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 26, 2016.

The hotel lease with the GSA clearly states, “No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”

Since Trump will keep his ownership in the Trump Organization, he will inevitably remain a beneficiary of the lease.

The GSA has another Trump-related problem looming. As president, Trump can and probably will name a new head of the agency. That person will be in charge of annual lease negotiations with the president’s sons.

“There’s an imbalance of power,” Schooner previously noted to HuffPost. “In a 60-year, complicated contract, we’re going to ask a civil servant at GSA to negotiate annually with the president’s children.”

The fact that the GSA was left out of the loop on Trump’s business plans fits with how the president-elect and his company lawyers have treated the Office of Government Ethics. Shaub has said he lost touch with the Trump team after the election and attempted to get their attention with a stream of tweets calling on the president-elect to fully divest his business holdings.

Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the ranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, told HuffPost that he is “very concerned” in light of the latest GSA statement.

“I think they were reluctant to give a decision early on,” Cummings said. “In other words, before he violates it.”

Cummings added, “We’ll see what happens, I guess, see next Monday after he’s sworn in. I expect that there will be a decision on [Jan. 20].”

The GSA’s current silence on the hypothetical violation of the lease is consistent with its past public assertions.

Back in December, Cummings and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.), ranking Democrat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, sent a letter to the agency asking whether it believed Trump would violate the lease agreement if he did not divest his holdings. The letter, released by Cummings, stated that Michael Gelber, deputy commissioner of the GSA’s Public Buildings Service, had said the new president would indeed be in violation.

The GSA, however, refused to comment, insisting that it could not make any determination until Trump assumed office.

“We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature,” the GSA statement said in December. “In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect’s business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.”",,,

Unfortunately, harmful myths or beliefs may prevent people from speaking up and getting the help they need. We partnered with our friends at Kaiser Permanente to dispel the five most harmful misperceptions that need to change to better manage mental health for ourselves and our loved ones.

1. Mental health issues are caused, at least in part, by a personal weakness or failing.

Like physical health issues, the onset of mental health issues can be linked to many causes that are no fault of the person living with the condition. Causes include traumatic events, chemical imbalances, or genetics, according to the National Alliance of Mental Illness. Because of fluctuations in hormone levels, as many as one in seven women may experience postpartum depression, according to the American Psychological Association.

2. People who experience mental health issues are unpredictable and dangerous.

Mental health conditions are NOT more likely to cause violent behavior. In fact, it is far more likely that people with a serious mental health condition are at risk of being a victim of violence, according to a 2003 study published in the World of Psychiatry. Rather, socio-demographic and socio-economic factors are the major determinants of violence.

3. People who experience mental health issues are “crazy.”

Maintaining mental health is just as important as maintaining physical health. And it should be taken just as seriously.

Mental health conditions are common: The National Alliance on Mental Illness reports that approximately 1 in 5 Americans experiences a mental health issue in any given year.

We have a long way to go as a society in treating mental health with the gravity it deserves, but some of the first steps we must take are removing the stigma surrounding mental illness and understanding mental health more fully. Avoiding the use of derogatory terms for mental health issues is one way to do this.

4. If someone appears productive and high-functioning, they cannot possibly be suffering from a mental health condition.

Just because someone appears to be functioning well in no way lessens the potential seriousness of a mental health condition.

Many people who are suffering from mental health issues can function normally with a proper treatment plan. Others manage to hide their condition (sometimes with profound effort) from co-workers, acquaintances, and even close friends and family members.

Depression is different from normal feelings of sadness because it’s more intense, lasts longer and affects most every aspect of a sufferer’s life. It also includes other symptoms, such as thoughts of self-harm and loss of interest in what were once enjoyable activities.

Assuming mental health conditions are the same thing as having a bad day can lead to embarrassment and shame, which in turn make it much more difficult for people with mental health issues to reach out for help.

If someone you know confides in you that they are struggling, believe them and offer your support. If you yourself are having trouble believing or admitting that you are suffering from a mental health condition, don’t minimize what you are experiencing.

5. Most people with a mental issue or condition can get well on their own without professional help.

Professional help is important and there are evidence-based treatments that work for many of these conditions. For example, according to Mental Health America, more than 80 percent of people treated for depression improve and treatment for panic disorders has up to a 90 percent success rate. The first step is finding help. If you are struggling, there is likely a treatment or combination of treatments that will work for you.

Self-care also can benefit one’s mental health. Activities such as meditation, yoga, exercise, adequate sleep, a healthy diet, and a fulfilling social life can all have a positive effect on one’s physical and psychological state.

However, it is important to remember that many people with mental health issues may be severely depleted of the personal resources required to focus on self-care. It is also possible to do everything “right” and still require additional treatment and help.

If you are struggling with a mental health condition, it is not your fault. It is not a failure or a sign of weakness to seek help. You are not alone, and there is hope.",,,

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2017/10/06/weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegation_n_18207144.html?ir=Media,"['Yashar Ali', 'Freelance Reporter']",2017-10-06 00:00:00,[],,"Harvey Weinstein once trapped a woman in the hallway of a restaurant that was closed to the public and masturbated in front of her until he ejaculated, she says. The accusation comes a day after Weinstein was the subject of a bombshell New York Times report that revealed that he has settled at least eight sexual harassment claims.

The incident took place a decade ago, according to Lauren Sivan, who at the time was a news anchor on a local cable channel in New York, Long Island 12. She says the experience left her shocked, and that while she told friends privately what happened, she remained quiet because she was in a long-term relationship and fearful of the power that Weinstein wielded in the media.

Sivan told HuffPost about the incident with Weinstein in an on-record interview. A list of detailed questions was emailed to a Weinstein Company publicist. While the publicist acknowledged receiving the questions, multiple attempts to get a response were unsuccessful. In a text message, Lisa Bloom, Weinstein’s attorney, said Weinstein was not available for an interview.

The night of the incident started with Sivan meeting Weinstein and others at Cipriani, a well-known Italian restaurant in Manhattan. She later rode with him and others to Socialista, a Cuban-themed club and restaurant in which Weinstein and Giuseppe Cipriani, who was then the head of the Cipriani restaurant empire, were investors. Sivan noted to HuffPost that Weinstein’s car was “stocked full of cases of Diet Coke,” which she said she found to be odd. In a 2001 profile of Weinstein in New York Magazine, journalist David Carr noted that while sitting at a table, Weinstein had “three Diet Cokes on standby in front of him.”

A spokeswoman for Cipriani confirmed that he and Weinstein have been friends for many years but declined to comment further.

HuffPost spoke to a friend of Sivan’s who was with her that night who corroborated details of Sivan’s story prior to and after the incident in the restaurant hallway, and shared additional details about that evening. Sivan’s friend spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity because she wasn’t authorized by her employer to speak to members of the press about any topic.

Sivan recalled that, while at the club, Weinstein asked her to join him on a tour of its restaurant, Cafe Socialista. Sivan said she reluctantly agreed and they went downstairs to the restaurant. Just before Sivan left, the friend told her that if she wasn’t back in 10 minutes, she would come to check on her.

Once Sivan and Weinstein were downstairs they chatted and he showed her the cafe. He then took her to the kitchen (the restaurant was closed by that time), where a couple of staffers were cleaning up. The quiet in the kitchen struck Silvan as odd, but a story published in 2008 said that Cafe Socialista was closing down for a lack of business (while the club was to remain open), possibly explaining why the kitchen wasn’t as populated.

Weinstein then dismissed the two staffers in the kitchen. According to multiple women who spoke to HuffPost on the condition of anonymity who said they had similar experiences with Weinstein, he has started out meetings or interactions with other people in the room and then dismissed them to be alone with women in order to make advances.

Once they left, Sivan says Weinstein leaned in and tried to kiss her. Sivan rejected that attempt and told him she had a long-term boyfriend. Weinstein then said to Sivan, “Well, can you just stand there and shut up.”

At this point, Weinstein and Sivan were in a vestibule between the kitchen and bathrooms. The only way for Sivan to get away from Weinstein required her to get past him and go through the kitchen. Sivan says she was trapped by Weinstein’s body and was intimidated.

Weinstein then proceeded to expose himself to Sivan and began to masturbate. Sivan said she was deeply shocked by Weinstein’s behavior and was frozen and didn’t know what to do or say. The incident in the vestibule didn’t last long. Sivan says Weinstein ejaculated quickly into a potted plant that was in the vestibule and then proceeded to zip up his pants and they walked back into the kitchen.

By the time this occurred, Sivan’s friend had grown concerned by how long Sivan was gone.

The friend began to go downstairs but was stopped by a security guard who told her she was not allowed. She says that she explained the 10-minute limit she gave to Sivan and said, “Do you mean to tell me if she’s in trouble down there, you’re not going to let me in?” The security guard agreed to let the friend down to the cafe.

Once she got downstairs, she met Sivan and Weinstein who were leaving the kitchen.

Sivan and her friend left just after the encounter, and both of them recalled Sivan discussing what had happened as soon as they left Socialista.

Sivan said Weinstein called her office the next day while she was at work. Sivan says Weinstein told her that he “had a great time last night.” Weinstein mentioned that he was going on a foreign trip and asked if Sivan wanted to get together when he got back. Sivan reminded him that she was in a relationship and says she quickly ended the call. She has not interacted with Weinstein since the incident in 2007.

The Weinstein Company announced Friday that Weinstein was going on an indefinite leave pending investigation of the sexual harassment claims by an independent law firm.",,,

Best known for finishing second on “Last Comic Standing” in 2003, the comedian had a successful stand-up career that included several specials on Comedy Central and Netflix.

His publicist, Stacey Pokluda, told HuffPost that May had been battling pneumonia and cancelled a handful of performance dates over the last month in an effort to recover. He died after a cardiac arrest.

“Earlier this morning at a private residence in Las Vegas, his body was discovered,” Pokluda said in a statement. “Two days ago he won the Casino Comedian of the Year at the Global Gaming Expo and had performances throughout the remainder of 2017 as part of his residency at Harrah’s Las Vegas.”

Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee ? but raised in Arkansas ? May’s first break came at age 17, when he won a contest to open for comedian Sam Kinison, his idol. Kinison encouraged May to move to Houston and work on his comedy there. May took the suggestion, eventually graduating from a performing arts high school in the area.

He then moved to Los Angeles, honing his craft until his big break, on the first season of the NBC comedy reality show.

In 2005, May married fellow comedian Lahna Turner, but the couple filed for divorced in 2015. They share two children.

Many of May’s comic contemporaries have expressed their grief on Twitter:

The Oxford University study, which traced the reach of three websites with clear ties to the Russian government, adds a new dimension to revelations of a Kremlin cyber campaign aimed at undermining Americans’ trust in democracy during last year’s U.S. elections and helping Donald Trump win the presidency.

“We’ve found an entire ecosystem of junk news about national security issues that is deliberately crafted for U.S. veterans and active military personnel,” said Philip Howard, a professor of internet studies who led the research. “It’s a complex blend of content with a Russian view of the world – wild rumors and conspiracies.”

This is further evidence of the Kremlin’s holistic effort to try to get inside the minds, computers and communications of our forces to steal information on things such as the locations and deployment schedules of specific military units and to conduct psy-ops against our troops. Mike Carpenter, former senior Pentagon official and Russia specialist

However, the study found that Russia’s communication inroads with the military community on Twitter “are not presently very deep,” and that it has had more success gaining influence through Twitter than Facebook.

The researchers sought to map how social media amplified the impact of these websites that sprang up over the last four years:

–Veteranstoday.com, which in late 2013 began publishing content from New Eastern Outlook, a geopolitical journal of the government-chartered Russian Academy of Sciences.

–Veteransnewsnow.com, a sister site that started posting information from the Moscow think tank Strategic Culture Foundation during the same time period.

–Southfront.org, which was registered in Moscow in 2015 and soon partnered with Veterans Today.

Politico first reported last June about Russia’s recent military targeting, describing how Veterans Today mixed advice for veterans on how to find jobs and pay medical bills with headlines such as “Ukraine’s Ku Klux Klan — NATO’s New Ally.” It said that while the United States confronted Syrian leader Bashar al Assad, a Russian ally, over chemical weapons attacks on Syrian children last spring, the site carried a story headlined: “Proof: Turkey Did 2013 Sarin Attack and Did This One Too.”

Mike Carpenter, a former senior Pentagon official who specialized in issues surrounding Russia, said the three web sites all “appear to be Russian fronts, given the high degree of Russian content.”

“[T]hey bill themselves as providing ‘alternative points of view,’ similar to Russian propaganda channels like RT and Sputnik,” he said.

Facebook disclosed last month that a company tied to a Russian “troll farm,” where operatives use cyber skills to spread misinformation, set up fake accounts that bought 3,000 election-related ads. It said 75 percent of the ads, which the company said may have popped up in the Facebook newsfeeds of as many as 10 million people, focused on divisive issues such as immigration, gun rights and gay rights.

The Kremlin’s global “active measures” campaigns have showered disinformation on democracies around the globe since the Soviet era. But newer social media tools have enabled explosive growth of networks dedicated to distributing false and misleading news.

The Oxford study categorized 12,413 Twitter users and 11,103 Facebook users whose social media messages referred to or carried content from one or more of the Russian-linked websites between April 2 and May 2, 2017. The researchers used sophisticated modeling in an attempt to examine how tweets and “likes” of Facebook posts broadened the effects of junk and phony news on the three sites, sometimes directly connecting the recipients with Russian trolls.

“On Twitter there are significant and persistent interactions between current and former military personnel and a broad network of Russia-focused accounts, conspiracy theory-focused accounts and European right-wing accounts,” the researchers concluded.

The interactions are an indication that the messages are being noticed and may be having some impact.

In the networks reaching vets and active duty troops, the researchers wrote, both liberals and conservatives were drawn to posts on the websites that laid out supposed conspiracies, including some pointed at the U.S. government.

The researchers noted that they couldn’t track all of the relevant content, in part because the limited data publicly available from Twitter and Facebook does not include fake accounts that the two companies detected and closed.

Spokespeople for Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on the study.

Carpenter said that under President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin’s propaganda machine “has become very good at targeting specific demographics and subgroups within American society, with tailored content in order to sow discord and undermine trust in government.”

He said the “information warfare” meshes with Russian “spear phishing attacks” – attempts to compromise the emails of U.S. service members and military contractors.

“This is further evidence of the Kremlin’s holistic effort to try to get inside the minds, computers and communications of our forces to steal information on things such as the locations and deployment schedules of specific military units and to conduct psy-ops (psychological operations) against our troops.”

Howard, who has tracked Russia’s use of social media to circulate propaganda in dozens of countries, and research colleague Bence Kollanyi, wrote in an op ed in the Washington Post on Friday that their studies have been handicapped because of the lack of cooperation from Twitter and Facebook.

“No doubt, Twitter and Facebook have higher-quality data on all this,” they wrote. “They certainly employ some of the best network analysts and data scientists in the world. Yet it has taken an FBI inquiry, congressional investigations, nearly a year of bad press and pressure from outside researchers such as us to dislodge some examples of Russian interference.”

“The next step should be open collaborations that explain network effects and help restore public trust in social media.”

Security Council Thursday gave the go-ahead to Britain and France — backed by the U.S. and at least two Arab nations — to launch airstrikes to enforce a no fly zone over Libya and to protect civilians in rebel-held areas from forces loyal to dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

The resolution authorized the enforcement of a no-fly zone over the embattled North African nation of 6.3 million, a measure designed to ground the aircraft that have given Gadhafi's forces a considerable edge over their ragtag opponents of armed civilians and military defectors.Jubilant crowds in Benghazi, the eastern city of some 1 million people where the rebellion against Gadhafi erupted a month ago, greeted the news with cheers and fireworks.

The U.S., France, Britain — three of the five veto-wielding permanent council members, and seven other countries approved the resolution, which passed by one vote more than was required. China and Russia, the two other permanent members, and three other nations abstained. There were no votes against it.

Airstrikes were expected against dozens of Libyan air defense missile sites to eliminate threats to planes enforcing the no-fly zone.The resolution's key provision also authorized countries enforcing the zone ""to take all necessary measures . . . to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack . . . including Benghazi,"" but it ruled out a foreign occupation force ""of any form on any part of Libyan territory.""

That wording permits airstrikes to prevent Gadhafi's forces from overrunning Benghazi and other cities and towns that rose up in mid-February against the Arab world's longest ruling leader, inspired by the pro-democracy revolts in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt.

The resolution also called for an immediate cease-fire and tightened sanctions against the Libyan regime by expanding an asset freeze that the U.S. has already used to sequester more than $32 billion linked to Gadhafi and his inner circle.

Thousands of people are believed to have been wounded and killed in what has evolved into a civil war that has helped drive up world oil prices. Gadhafi's forces, backed by tanks and aircraft, have retaken since last week all but one rebellious city in western Libya and a series of eastern towns overrun by the rebels, whose leadership is based in Benghazi.

The resolution's passage appeared certain when China and Russia, which initially expressed reservations, agreed to abstain after the language excluding a ""military occupation"" of Libya was inserted.

""Today the Security Council has responded to the Libyan people's cry for help,"" Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the council following the vote.

""Colonel Gadhafi and those who still stand by him continue to grossly and systematically abuse the most fundamental human rights of Libya's people. On March 12, the League of Arab States called on the Security Council to establish a no-fly zone and take other measures to protect civilians,"" she said. ""Today's resolution is a powerful response to that call and to the urgent needs on the ground.""

In a highly unusual move aimed at underscoring the urgency of the issue, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe flew to New York from Paris for the vote.

As the 15-seat council deliberated last-minute changes to the resolution, Gadhafi vowed to unleash a final assault on Benghazi and show ""no mercy"" to his opponents.

""We are coming tonight,"" Gadhafi declared in a state-run radio address greeted by defiant jeers and gunfire volleys from hundreds of people listening in the main square of Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. ""All free people should surround the traitors and attack them to take control.""

Britain and France, along with two unnamed Arab countries, were preparing to enforce the no-fly zone, said a European diplomat, adding that it could take ""between 24 and 48 hours"" for the operation to begin.

At least two Arab nations also agreed to participate, according to the European diplomat and a U.S. official, and discussions were ongoing with other governments in the region.

They declined, however, to identify the Arab countries that would take part. One was believed to be the United Arab Emirates, the federation of pro-West oil-producing sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf.

The U.S. also will participate, but the extent of the American role was still being decided by President Barack Obama, according to the U.S. official who asked not to be further identified in order to talk about the issue.

""This is an ongoing discussion,"" he said.

Speaking at the end of a visit to Tunisia, which borders Libya to the northwest, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that the options under consideration by the U.S. included the use of unmanned drones, bombing Libyan air defenses to help enforce the no-fly zone, and arming the Libyan rebels.

With U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his Republican critics casting him as a big government spender as he prepares to run for re-election, Obama has gone to great lengths to avoid giving the U.S. a leading role in another costly foreign military intervention in a part of the world where anti-American sentiments are already high.

Yet after repeatedly condemning Gadhafi's assaults on peaceful protests that ignited the revolt and demanding that the dictator step down, Obama was under pressure to authorize some form of U.S. participation. Otherwise, he risked being flayed for inaction and timidity by his GOP critics and by the demonstrators he has been praising for their largely peaceful challenge to the ruling order in other Arab nations.

Sens. John McCain, Joe Lieberman and John Kerry issued a joint statement Thursday night supporting the U.N. resolution.

""We must immediately work with our friends in the Arab League and in NATO to enforce this resolution and turn the tide before it is too late,"" the senators said. ""We must also build a bipartisan consensus here at home to support the President in taking the swift and decisive measures necessary to stop Qaddafi.""

Robert E. Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said that Western powers would have little difficulty carrying out airstrikes against Libyan targets.

French jets can fly from bases in France without needing to refuel, Hunter said, and the U.S. military maintains significant air assets in Italy that could help with refueling or surveillance operations.

Britain maintains an airbase on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, while the U.S. also has airbases on the Mediterranean island of Crete and in Turkey. The U.S. also has two helicopter-carrying amphibious assault vessels in the Mediterranean that could participate in humanitarian aid deliveries.

""There's no lack of capacity to do it,"" said Hunter, a senior adviser with the Rand Corporation, a research group. ""It's been a problem of political will.""

Hunter said that he expected Libyan pilots to stop flying missions with the declaration of the no-fly zone. But it wasn't clear if British or French commanders would direct strikes against Libyan air defense systems, as U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said would be required to establish control of Libyan airspace.

One goal of a bombing campaign would be to scare some members of the Libyan military into abandoning Gadhafi, Hunter said. In the early days of the Libyan uprising, at least two Libyan pilots refused orders to fire on protesters and flew their jets to the Mediterranean island of Malta, but since then the military has seemed largely to follow Gadhafi's orders.

""Gadhafi has nothing to live for but to go all out,"" Hunter said. ""One tactic is to create an environment in which others will give up.""

In Benghazi, rebel officials insisted that their ragtag force of civilians and military defectors armed with weapons pilfered from Libyan army bases was holding off an advance by Gadhafi's better-trained and equipped troops on the strategic town of Ajdabiya, 100 miles to the south.Ajdabiya controls two major highways: One leads to Benghazi and other population centers along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Sidra; the second runs inland, straight across the desert to the border with Egypt. By controlling those routes, Gadhafi's forces would cut off the coastal towns and cities and could overrun each one in succession.

Many Benghazi residents dismissed the threat.

""For Benghazi, it is not too late,"" said Mohammed Amer, 46, speaking from one of Benghazi's few operating Internet cafes. ""There is no doubt that the international community's interference will help especially if they bomb his (Gadhafi's) military bases and troop concentrations.""

At the crash site of a war jet that they claimed to have shot down, young rebels cheered, even though it might have been a case of friendly fire. The aircraft had the pre-Gadhafi national flag revived by the rebels painted on its fuselage. Regardless, any sign of victory, even a false one, drew hundreds to the site near Benghazi airport.

Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country and Libya's neighbor to the east, has said it will not participate in military operations or help enforce a no-fly zone. Egypt has hundreds of thousands of citizens in Libya who might face retaliation from the Gadhafi regime and is dealing with political ferment of its own following the ouster last month of longtime president Hosni Mubarak.

The Obama administration's policy toward Libya shifted sharply this week, after the 22-member Arab League endorsed a no-fly zone over Libya, providing important political cover for the White House.

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article177771811.html,['Tim Johnson'],,[],,"As U.S. soldiers Sunday handed out dozens of boxes of emergency food and water rations in this coastal town, a federal relief official pronounced himself satisfied.

“They seem pretty happy right now. I think it’s going great,” said Patrick Hernandez, assistant administrator for field operations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Just a few feet away, Serafin Roman looked through cyclone fencing at the distribution scene and offered a radically different view: “It’s nasty. People are desperate. They got no water.... Some people are starving.”

The scene put a vivid spotlight on the gap between some government views of relief efforts for Hurricane Maria, and a somewhat testier view on the street. In some corners of Puerto Rico, deep into the third week of recovery efforts, a smattering of Puerto Ricans said they feel forgotten and vulnerable. Residents and city officials often tell drastically different stories about the frequency of food distribution.

Responding to the evolving crisis, U.S. military officials spelled out Sunday how they will alter the distribution of food, water and fuel to many of the island’s 78 municipalities, militarizing relief efforts in a significant way as some mayors stumble on the job.

Prior to this weekend, relief supplies were delivered to 10 regional staging areas on the island, and mayors were largely responsible for arranging pick-up and distribution.

But Brig. Gen. Jose J. Reyes, assistant adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard, said in an interview that a new strategy calls for placing 10 to 20 soldiers in each municipality, providing them with vehicles and logistical support, and tasking them with delivering relief to each neighborhood.

“We need to push it directly to the barrio to ensure that everyone’s getting it,” Reyes said. “They will have some vehicles. They will have radio communications as well as logistics support.... They are going to be living there. They are going to be operating 24/7.”

In Puerto Rico’s 10 largest cities, each with a population greater than 150,000 people, city halls will continue to manage distribution, Reyes said, but not so in the smaller towns.

The commander of relief efforts, Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan, acknowledged that distribution of aid on the municipal level has not always gone smoothly.

“We’re relentless in looking for areas that are bottlenecks,” Buchanan said at a San Juan airfield before boarding a helicopter for Aguadilla, some 80 miles to the west of the capital.

“We shouldn’t pretend that this is going to be pain-free,” he said, noting that mayors can feel a variety of constraints in delivering aid, from damaged roads and lack of vehicles to poor communications and large geographical areas with sparse population.

Some anger was palpable Sunday at the relief distribution scene in Aguadilla. But that sentiment of frustration is not uniform. Some municipalities are handling relief efforts much better than other ones. Among the hardest hit areas from the Sept. 20 hurricane, some are so remote that they require ongoing helicopter air-drops of food and water due to impassable roads.

“There are people who live up in the mountainous areas in the central region that are harder to get to, but we’re getting to all of them,” Hernandez, the FEMA official, said. U.S. military teams are “doing a phenomenal job with the road clearance.”

Hernandez downplayed the discontent voiced by some of the residents during Sunday’s relief activities, saying that all disaster survivors want to get their lives back to normal.

“Every survivor in a disaster feels that way,” he said.

Sheila Lenox, 29, said Sunday’s box of food was the first substantial aid she had seen.

“This is the first time here that they come with a nice box full of stuff for us,” said Lenox, who is unemployed. “We’ve been eating what our neighbors give us.”

Asked how she had survived, her partner, Jetson Samot, responded: “Sausage.”

“Sausage and crackers,” Lenox added.

“There’s no way for us to buy anything. The supermarkets, they upped the prices on everything. It’s hard for us to find any food. We have a place to live but we don’t have nothing to nurture our body with,” Lenox said.

Another resident, Carmen Santiago, a 67-year-old retiree, said she wished there was more discipline and logic in distribution to avoid having some residents take too much, and leaving others without.

“They should give a set amount to each apartment,” she said. “That way, no one takes too much. They take just what is due them.”

Told that some residents complained Sunday that it was the first delivery of any food or water to the district, Mayor Carlos Mendez disputed that.

“They’ve received it. I’ve come here three or four times before,” Mendez said.

Mendez said relief got off to a “slow start. But we’re doing good now.”

“Everybody’s thirsty, everybody’s hungry because they don’t get food every single day. But at least we take it to them every four or five days.”",,,
http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article177744986.html#storylink=mainstage,"['Greg Gordon', 'Peter Stone', 'Mcclatchy Washington Bureau']",,[],,"Russia has exploited social media networks to target current and former U.S. military personnel with propaganda, conspiracy theories and other misinformation, achieving “significant and persistent interactions” over Twitter during a one-month period last spring, a British research team found.

The Oxford University study, which traced the reach of three websites with clear ties to the Russian government, adds a new dimension to revelations of a Kremlin cyber campaign aimed at undermining Americans’ trust in democracy during last year’s U.S. elections and helping Donald Trump win the presidency.

“We’ve found an entire ecosystem of junk news about national security issues that is deliberately crafted for U.S. veterans and active military personnel,” said Philip Howard, a professor of internet studies who led the research. “It’s a complex blend of content with a Russian view of the world – wild rumors and conspiracies.”

This is further evidence of the Kremlin’s holistic effort to try to get inside the minds, computers and communications of our forces to steal information on things such as the locations and deployment schedules of specific military units and to conduct psy-ops against our troops. Mike Carpenter, former senior Pentagon official and Russia specialist

However, the study found that Russia’s communication inroads with the military community on Twitter “are not presently very deep,” and that it has had more success gaining influence through Twitter than Facebook.

The researchers sought to map how social media amplified the impact of these websites that sprang up over the last four years:

–Veteranstoday.com, which in late 2013 began publishing content from New Eastern Outlook, a geopolitical journal of the government-chartered Russian Academy of Sciences.

–Veteransnewsnow.com, a sister site that started posting information from the Moscow think tank Strategic Culture Foundation during the same time period.

–Southfront.org, which was registered in Moscow in 2015 and soon partnered with Veterans Today.

Politico first reported last June about Russia’s recent military targeting, describing how Veterans Today mixed advice for veterans on how to find jobs and pay medical bills with headlines such as “Ukraine’s Ku Klux Klan — NATO’s New Ally.” It said that while the United States confronted Syrian leader Bashar al Assad, a Russian ally, over chemical weapons attacks on Syrian children last spring, the site carried a story headlined: “Proof: Turkey Did 2013 Sarin Attack and Did This One Too.”

Mike Carpenter, a former senior Pentagon official who specialized in issues surrounding Russia, said the three web sites all “appear to be Russian fronts, given the high degree of Russian content.”

“[T]hey bill themselves as providing ‘alternative points of view,’ similar to Russian propaganda channels like RT and Sputnik,” he said.

Facebook disclosed last month that a company tied to a Russian “troll farm,” where operatives use cyber skills to spread misinformation, set up fake accounts that bought 3,000 election-related ads. It said 75 percent of the ads, which the company said may have popped up in the Facebook newsfeeds of as many as 10 million people, focused on divisive issues such as immigration, gun rights and gay rights.

The Kremlin’s global “active measures” campaigns have showered disinformation on democracies around the globe since the Soviet era. But newer social media tools have enabled explosive growth of networks dedicated to distributing false and misleading news.

The Oxford study categorized 12,413 Twitter users and 11,103 Facebook users whose social media messages referred to or carried content from one or more of the Russian-linked websites between April 2 and May 2, 2017. The researchers used sophisticated modeling in an attempt to examine how tweets and “likes” of Facebook posts broadened the effects of junk and phony news on the three sites, sometimes directly connecting the recipients with Russian trolls.

“On Twitter there are significant and persistent interactions between current and former military personnel and a broad network of Russia-focused accounts, conspiracy theory-focused accounts and European right-wing accounts,” the researchers concluded.

The interactions are an indication that the messages are being noticed and may be having some impact.

In the networks reaching vets and active duty troops, the researchers wrote, both liberals and conservatives were drawn to posts on the websites that laid out supposed conspiracies, including some pointed at the U.S. government.

The researchers noted that they couldn’t track all of the relevant content, in part because the limited data publicly available from Twitter and Facebook does not include fake accounts that the two companies detected and closed.

Spokespeople for Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on the study.

Carpenter said that under President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin’s propaganda machine “has become very good at targeting specific demographics and subgroups within American society, with tailored content in order to sow discord and undermine trust in government.”

He said the “information warfare” meshes with Russian “spear phishing attacks” – attempts to compromise the emails of U.S. service members and military contractors.

“This is further evidence of the Kremlin’s holistic effort to try to get inside the minds, computers and communications of our forces to steal information on things such as the locations and deployment schedules of specific military units and to conduct psy-ops (psychological operations) against our troops.”

Howard, who has tracked Russia’s use of social media to circulate propaganda in dozens of countries, and research colleague Bence Kollanyi, wrote in an op ed in the Washington Post on Friday that their studies have been handicapped because of the lack of cooperation from Twitter and Facebook.

“No doubt, Twitter and Facebook have higher-quality data on all this,” they wrote. “They certainly employ some of the best network analysts and data scientists in the world. Yet it has taken an FBI inquiry, congressional investigations, nearly a year of bad press and pressure from outside researchers such as us to dislodge some examples of Russian interference.”

“The next step should be open collaborations that explain network effects and help restore public trust in social media.”

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Conroy/AP Michael Conroy/AP

Updated Monday 8:20 a.m. ET

President Trump on Monday defended Vice President Mike Pence's decision to walk out of Sunday's NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers in Indianapolis.

Trump tweeted, ""The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!""

The president's response comes amid suggestions by some media outlets and on social media that Pence's protest was a publicity stunt engineered by Trump.

The original story continues below

Vice President Pence was so offended by kneeling professional football players that he left a game Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.

""I left today's Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,"" Pence, a former governor of Indiana, said in a statement.

""While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem,"" the statement opposing the protest continued. ""I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.""

But first, the moment was commemorated with a photo of himself and second lady Karen Pence while they stood, hand over hearts, for the anthem.

It appears the choice to leave did not belong to Pence or his wife alone. According to Trump, it was his idea.

""I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country,"" Trump tweeted, adding that he was proud of the couple.

Only members of the 49ers knelt for the rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" — a symbol of protest not against the flag or the song but against institutional social injustice and the violence perpetrated by police against black men. Colts players stood, linked arm in arm.

The controversial practice of kneeling during the anthem was started by former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has yet to be signed to a new team after his contract with the 49ers expired last year.

In an on-camera report on Sunday, CBS reporter Jason La Canfora said Kaepernick would stand for the anthem if he was signed to an NFL team.

""He's not planning on kneeling ... and he's planning on standing for the anthem,"" La Canfora said.

But after the story began making headlines, La Canfora backtracked tweeting, ""Standing for Anthem wasn't something that I spoke to Colin about."" He was merely relaying what had already been reported about Kaepernick in other outlets, La Canfora wrote, adding, ""what he would do during the Anthem I do not know.""

Kaepernick has not denied La Canfora's claim outright, but he has been retweeting others who have responded to the CBS sports reporter. Among them is the quarterback's own girlfriend, Nessa Diab, who wrote, ""The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone.""

CNN on YouTube YouTube

Howard Bryant, an ESPN Magazine columnist, also weighed in on Twitter with what he said was confirmation from Kaepernick.

""Just got a message from @Kaepernick7 who says he has not discussed with anyone his plans in the event he is signed by an NFL team,"" Bryant wrote.

The president has been railing against the NFL over the league's tolerance of the sustained demonstration. Trump has repeatedly called on team owners to fire all players who kneel during the national anthem.

At a campaign rally in Alabama last month, Trump shouted, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now'?"" he said to roaring applause.

The statement by the president, and the subsequent Twitter storm he unleashed, renewed a national debate over players' First Amendment rights and also pitted NFL owners and players against the president, inspiring many of them to kneel or link arms in the game that followed.

By walking out over the kneeling, Pence hasn't just stirred the stoked the flames of the controversy, it has also kicked up a new dust storm: criticism over the cost of the vice president's protest of the protest.

Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz was the first to raise the issue.

""Wait,"" Schatz wrote on Twitter. ""This was orchestrated to make a point? That's not an inexpensive thing to do.""",,,

Updated 3:45 p.m. ET Saturday

As the United States grapples with how to contend with North Korea's nuclear weapons program that has been fueling a worsening war of words, the rhetoric took a decisively cooler tone Saturday when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson acknowledged for the first time that the administration is in direct contact with Pyongyang over its missile and nuclear tests, reports The New York Times.

""We have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang. We can talk to them, we do talk to them,"" Tillerson told reporters Saturday in Beijing, according to the pool report.

Tillerson made clear that those talks are not necessarily happening at Pyonyang's highest levels. When asked how he would open a dialogue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Tillerson said, ""We are probing. So stay tuned.""

Later Saturday, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert weighed in, affirming in a statement, ""U.S. diplomats have several open channels in which we can communicate with officials within the North Korean regime.""

She went on to say, ""Despite assurances that the United States is not interested in promoting the collapse of the current regime, pursuing regime change, accelerating reunification of the peninsula or mobilizing forces north of the DMZ, North Korean officials have shown no indication that they are interested in or are ready for talks regarding denuclearization.""

The secretary of state was in Beijing to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders to discuss denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula as well as trade and investment.

Tillerson emphasized that the talks with Pyongyang are not being mediated by China. ""Directly. Our own channels,"" he said.

He did not say whether North Korea is responding to the overtures.

""The whole situation is a bit overheated right now,"" Tillerson said. ""I think everyone would like for it to calm down. I think if North Korea would stop firing all the missiles, that would calm down things a lot.""

Late last week, North Korea suggested it could test a hydrogen bomb in the Pacific. As The Two-Way reported, such a test would combine a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile in an incredibly dangerous union.

The threat followed President Trump's debut address at the United Nations General Assembly earlier this month, when he said, ""if (the U.S.) is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.""

North Korea has already conducted six tests with nuclear weapons and separately an intercontinental ballistic missile test that it said could reach the United States.

The Trump administration has said that if Pyongyang continues to scale up its weapons program, ""all options are on the table,"" although by many accounts an all-out war would be catastrophic.

The Times reports that the Trump administration is now trying out a tactic that the Obama administration used with Iran, which resulted in a nuclear accord: secret back-channel negotiations. Granted it took years of diplomacy to reach a deal.

But Tillerson emphasized Saturday that the situations are different. Tehran had a program that may have led to nuclear weapons. Pyongyang already has them. ""We are not going to put together a nuclear deal in North Korea that is as flimsy as the one in Iran,"" Tillerson said.

His visit to Beijing comes at a time when the ties between the U.S. and China are considered more important than ever, reports The Associated Press. China is seen as a crucial partner to averting war with North Korea and Trump has been pressing Beijing to take stronger economic measures against Pyongyang. In a move in that direction, on Thursday China ordered North Korean-owned businesses on its soil to close in accordance with U.N. sanctions.

On Friday, the White House announced that Trump will travel to five Asian nations, three of which play central roles in the crisis with North Korea: Japan, South Korea and China.

""The President's engagements will strengthen the international resolve to confront the North Korean threat and ensure the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,"" the White House said in a statement.",,,

Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Agostini/AP Evan Agostini/AP

The Swedish Academy has chosen Kazuo Ishiguro as the winner of the Nobel Prize in literature Thursday morning, in an event that began at 7 a.m. ET. You can watch it online.

The academy's citation for Ishiguro said he is a writer ""who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world.""

Ishiguro, 62, is a British novelist who was born in Nagasaki, Japan, and whose family moved to Britain when he was 5. He has said that as a kid, he used TV Westerns — like Bonanza and Wagon Train — to help him learn English.

Ishiguro's most well-known work is likely The Remains of the Day, a 1989 novel about an English household in the 1930s that was later adapted into a feature film.

Ishiguro is also famously adept at working in a variety of genres; his sixth novel, Never Let Me Go, brought elements of science fiction into a story that centers on a private school in the English countryside where, as NPR reported in 2005, ""nothing is as it seems and the horrible truth is slowly revealed.""

After announcing the award, the Swedish Academy's Sarah Danius said of Ishiguro:

""If you mix Jane Austen and Franz Kafka, then you have Kazuo Ishiguro in a nutshell — but you have to add a little bit of Marcel Proust into the mix. And then you stir, but not too much, and then you have his writings. At the same time, he's a writer of great integrity; doesn't look to the side. He's developed an aesthetic universe of his own.""

Ishiguro beat out 194 other candidates — but if you're wondering who those other writers are, you'll have to wait 50 years to find out. That's how long the Swedish Academy waits to reveal that information. In January, the body will release the numbers from the 1967 prize (see the archive).

In 2015, Ishiguro published what was then his first novel in 10 years: The Buried Giant. In it, he focused on an elderly couple's road trip in post-Arthurian England to explore themes of memory and loss — on both personal and societal levels.

Speaking to NPR when The Buried Giant was published, Ishiguro said:

""I did take a creative writing course, yeah, 30 years ago. And it was the first one ever in Britain. And the whole point of it was that there was no teaching. It was 12 months in which to discover whether or not one really was a writer. I went there with no great illusions that I was a writer, but when I arrived I was wanting to be a singer-songwriter. ""I think there's a part of me that's always remained a songwriter, even when I'm writing fiction. And I can see there's a big overlap between the songs I was writing when I was young and the stories I went on to write. Many of the key aspects of what you might call my ""style"" as a novelist, I think, derives from when I was a songwriter.""

The literature Nobel has always been a tough prize to predict. Many were surprised when last year's award was won by Bob Dylan, who became the first person to win who's mainly known as a singer and songwriter.

As of Thursday morning, the betting service Ladbrokes listed the top three bettors' choices as Canadian Margaret Atwood (with 7/2 odds) Kenya's Ngugi Wa Thiong'o (at 4/1) and Japan's Haruki Murakami (5/1).

Those favorites were handicapped by NPR's Lynn Neary on Morning Edition:

Atwood: ""It's been quite a year for Margaret Atwood,"" Lynn says. ""A television adaptation of her novel The Handmaid's Tale was a huge success and the book, first published more than 30 years ago, is back near the top of best-seller lists.""

Murakami: ""Tufts University Professor Hosea Hirata says Murakami has one thing that might be working against him: his popularity. 'His books sell phenomenally, it's like Harry Potter,' Hirata says. Lynn, adds, ""And literature Nobels often go to writers with strong political messages.""

Thiong'o: ""It's been 31 years since a black African writer from sub-Saharan Africa has won the Nobel,"" Lynn says. Imprisoned for a year in 1977, Ngugi later went into exile and has been living in the U.S. since 1989. But [Macalester College professor David Moore] says he has worked to maintain his identity as a Kenyan author

When Dylan won last year, he also became the first American to win since Toni Morrison in 1993.

The Swedish Academy said Dylan was being recognized ""for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition,"" as NPR's Colin Dwyer reported.

The winning writer is chosen by the Nobel Committee for Literature — six people who are elected from the Swedish Academy to serve on the panel for three-year periods. The academy notes that the committee is ""assisted by specially appointed expert advisers.""",,,

Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young are the joint winners of the 2017 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, winning for their discoveries about how internal clocks and biological rhythms govern human life.

The three Americans won ""for their discoveries of molecular mechanisms controlling the circadian rhythm,"" the Nobel Foundation says.

From the Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet, which announced the prize early Monday morning:

""Using fruit flies as a model organism, this year's Nobel laureates isolated a gene that controls the normal daily biological rhythm. They showed that this gene encodes a protein that accumulates in the cell during the night, and is then degraded during the day. Subsequently, they identified additional protein components of this machinery, exposing the mechanism governing the self-sustaining clockwork inside the cell. We now recognize that biological clocks function by the same principles in cells of other multicellular organisms, including humans. ""With exquisite precision, our inner clock adapts our physiology to the dramatically different phases of the day. The clock regulates critical functions such as behavior, hormone levels, sleep, body temperature and metabolism.""

Hall, 72, was born in New York and has worked at institutions from the University of Washington to the California Institute of Technology. For decades, he was on the faculty at Brandeis University in Waltham, west of Boston; more recently, he has been associated with the University of Maine.

Rosbash, 73, was born in Kansas City, Mo., and studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Since 1974, he has been on faculty at Brandeis University in Waltham, Mass.

Young, 68, was born in Miami, Fla., and earned his doctoral degree at the University of Texas in Austin. He then worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford University in Palo Alto before joining the faculty at the Rockefeller University in 1978.

Last year's winner was Japanese biologist Yoshinori Ohsumi of the Tokyo Institute of Technology, who was recognized ""for his discoveries about ""autophagy — a fundamental process cells use to degrade and recycle parts of themselves,"" as NPR's Rob Stein reported.",,,

Updated at 12:30 p.m. ET

The Trump administration will scuttle an Obama-era clean power plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, made the announcement in Hazard, Ky., on Monday, saying the rule hurt coal-fired plants.

""The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy,"" Pruitt said, speaking at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

""That rule really was about picking winners and losers,"" the EPA administrator said, adding that the rule change would be signed on Tuesday.

The announcement had been anticipated. It would eliminate the Clean Power Plan that was put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore never implemented.

A draft document obtained by NPR and other outlets says the administration will also issue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ""in the near future"" to take comments on whether and how it should replace the CPP.

According to The Associated Press, the EPA is ""expected to declare the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet.""

Coal-fired power plants generate roughly 40 percent of the electricity globally, but generate more than 70 percent of the carbon dioxide, according to the International Energy Agency.

The vast majority of scientists worldwide say that carbon dioxide is a leading contributor to climate change. President Trump, however, has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by China to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive, but he also said he had an open mind toward efforts to control it.

In June, Trump announced that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Accord, an international agreement that set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions. At the time, the president said staying in the deal, which is aimed at capping average global temperature increases, ""could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025"" and would cause the loss of close to $3 trillion in GDP.

However, the claims of potential job losses have been disputed by economists and climate scientists.",,,

A few dozen refugees held in offshore detention centers run by Australia have left to be resettled in the U.S.

They are the first of up to 1,250 asylum-seekers the Obama administration agreed to accept in a deal with the Australian government in exchange for Australia accepting refugees from Central America.

It's the same deal that was the subject of a contentious phone call between President Trump and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in January. ""I think it is a horrible deal, a disgusting deal that I would have never made,"" Trump said, according to The Washington Post. ""As far as I am concerned, that is enough Malcom [sic]. I have had it.""

Despite the president's response — and the Trump administration's announcement Wednesday that it plans to lower the total number of refugees that the U.S. will accept next year to 45,000 — the White House appears to be sticking to the agreement with Australia.

""I thank the president and the United States for honoring the deal,"" Turnbull said in a video message last week. ""Around 50 refugees from [Papua New Guinea] and Nauru will be accepted in this first group.""

Between 22 and 25 men left an all-male detention center on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island earlier this week; 27 people, both men and women, left a second camp on the tiny island nation of Nauru on Wednesday.

The refugees hail from countries including Bangladesh, Iran, Sri Lanka, Somalia and Myanmar, according to Australian refugee advocacy group Refugee Action Coalition. ""They are being sent to live (some with relatives) in many different states including, Arizona, Texas, California, Oregon and New York,"" the group said in a statement.

The New York Times reports that a U.S. State Department official ""confirmed that 54 approved refugees would be notified in the coming days and travel to the United States in the coming weeks.""

Australia has a policy of sending asylum-seekers attempting to reach Australia by boat to one of the two detention centers. The policy began under former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in 2013. ""No person, no asylum seeker who attempts to reach Australia by boat can ever be resettled in Australia, even if they are found to be a genuine refugee,"" Reuters correspondent Matt Siegel told NPR last year.

More than 1,700 people are still being held on Manus and Nauru, according to Refugee Action Coalition spokesperson Ian Rintoul.

Detainees on Nauru face ""severe abuse, inhumane treatment, and neglect,"" Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said in 2016. The rights groups said asylum-seekers ""face neglect by health workers,"" are denied medical care, and ""suffer overwhelming despair — self-harm and suicide attempts are frequent.""

A former aid worker told NPR she reported ""abuse and systemic violations of human right[s] to children and families on Nauru.""

Siegel outlined the conditions at the other detention center on Manus Island:

""It's extremely hot. There's no air conditioning. They live often in tents. It's difficult in terms of the confinement, but I think the real concern for people are the conditions, psychologically, that people go through in terms of being indefinitely detained. Some of these people have been in these camps for three, four, five years, and that leads to an enormous level of self-harm, suicide attempts, especially among — and most disturbingly, amongst children and young children.""

The Guardian has reported that Australia's government says it will close the Manus Island camp by the end of October, after Papua New Guinea's Supreme Court called it illegal. But there are no plans to close the facility at Nauru.

The government also says the refugee policy is for humanitarian purposes and that it discourages smugglers and asylum-seekers from trying to reach Australia by boat.

Turnbull added that this resettlement of detainees in the U.S. ""is a one-off. And it's available only to those found to be refugees who are currently in P.N.G. and Nauru. And is of course subject to the United States' own extreme vetting mandated by the president.""

""Anyone who comes by boat will be turned back,"" Turnbull said. ""They will not be settled in Australia and they will not be settled in the United States.""",,,

""No tinc por!"" — I am not afraid — mourners have been chanting in the local Catalan language at vigils and marches across Barcelona, since ISIS killed 16 people in and around the city on Aug. 17 and 18.

But when Spain's king broke royal protocol and joined marchers last weekend in solidarity with the terrorism victims, the tone changed: Residents booed and yelled at him to ""get out!"" and go home to Madrid.

Catalans are using the ""No tinc por"" slogan — and hashtag — to express defiance not only against terrorists but also against the Spanish state.

Separatists rule Spain's northeast region of Catalonia, which has its own language, culture, history and holidays. Last month's ISIS attacks hit during a campaign for independence.

So when Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy arrived in Barcelona several hours after the attacks, he appealed for unity.

""It's important that we're capable of working together — like a true team,"" he told reporters. ""Unity will enable us to wipe out terrorism.""

That infuriated many independence activists, who interpreted Rajoy's comments, and the Spanish king's appearance in Barcelona, as challenges to the independence movement — and to regional officials' authority.

""Right after the attack, a lot of people in the independence movement had this feeling that the attack was being used by the Madrid press and politicians as a way of attacking independence,"" says Liz Castro, an American immigrant to Barcelona and convert to the Catalan independence cause. ""There were immediately editorials that said, 'Catalans must give up this silly game of independence, because this is really serious.' ""

Catalan leaders say they will not give up. They vow to go ahead with a referendum on Oct. 1 and declare independence from Spain if the ""yes"" votes win.

Madrid says the whole thing is unconstitutional.

The terrorist attacks have given Catalan and Spanish politicians one more thing to argue about. They trade barbs daily over which level of government — regional or national — is to blame for failing to detect ISIS militants before it was too late.

In a recent TV interview, when Catalan Interior Minister Joaquim Forn read out the names of the victims, he made a distinction between ""Catalans"" and ""Spanish nationals"" — as though they were already from two different countries.

Meanwhile, rank-and-file police officers are trying to get to the bottom of how a Muslim imam managed to quickly and quietly radicalize 12 local youths into ISIS attackers.

Inspector Albert Oliva, with the Catalan regional police, called the Mossos, says the regional and national forces have been working well together.

""We've actually had good relations between regional and national police forces,"" says Oliva. ""Within 15 minutes of the attack, we'd set up a coordination center together. So to color the police response with controversies and accusations — that's the unfortunate work of politicians and the media.""

Spain has seen this before. Politicians and the media exploited the deadliest Islamist attack in Europe, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which killed nearly 200 people just days before a national election.

The party favored to win, Rajoy's conservative Popular Party, mistakenly blamed the attacks on Basque separatists. So did most conservative newspapers. The public felt duped, and delivered a surprise victory at the polls to the opposition Socialists.

Last month's Catalonia attacks took place six weeks before an independence referendum. This time, it's unclear how voters will react.",,,

Scenes of chaos and violence unfolded in Catalonia as an independence referendum deemed illegal by Madrid devolved quickly on Sunday.

As police followed orders from the central government to put a stop to the vote, they fired rubber bullets at unarmed protesters and smashed through the glass at polling places, reports The Associated Press. Three hundred and thirty-seven people were injured, some seriously, according to Catalonia's government spokesman.

Spain's Interior Ministry said a dozen police officers were injured. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from Barcelona that some people were throwing rocks down at officers from balconies.

Yet the violence came from all directions.

""Horrible scenes,"" Lauren reports. ""Police dragging voters out of polling stations, some by the hair.""

Scuffles erupted as riot police forcefully removed hundreds of would-be voters from polling places across Barcelona, the Catalan capitol, reports AP.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Emilio Morenatti/AP Emilio Morenatti/AP

Nevertheless, many people, managed to successfully cast their ballots across the region after waiting in lines hundreds-of-people-deep, including the elderly and families with small children, says Reuters.

Sunday was a culmination of a decades-long movement in the autonomous region of Catalonia nestled in Spain's northeast corner. Pro-separatists say they deserve self-rule, pointing to their unique history, culture and language. And as a wealthy region, they say Catalans pay an outsize share of taxes to Madrid, while seeing little in return.

Independence supporters knew that Sunday's vote would be much more than a simple exercise in democracy as the stage was set for a show down.

""There will be no referendum on Oct. 1,"" government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo declared on Friday.

After the highest court in Spain had ruled the referendum unconstitutional, the central government sent in thousands of police reinforcements to try to halt it, in part by dismantling needed infrastructure, reports Reuters.

The government said organizers were facing criminal charges and arrest.

And Catalonia's High Court ruled that Google had to delete a smartphone app that the Catalan government was using to spread information about the vote, reports the wire service. Google apparently complied.

Despite the setbacks, pro-separatists forged ahead.

""Everything is prepared at the more than 2,000 voting points so they have ballot boxes and voting slips, and have everything people need to express their opinion,"" Catalan President Carles Puigdemont told the wire service.

Puigdemont cast his vote Sunday in the province of Girona.

Lauren reports that referendum organizers had to deploy creative tactics to skirt authorities. ""The polling station where I am right now, ballot boxes had to be smuggled into the building before dawn in garbage bags so that they weren't confiscated by police.""

Tens of thousands of people registered to spend the night at polling places in defiance of court orders that they be shut down. Organizers told Reuters that even if people were prevented from voting, the mass sleepover would show solidarity in a peaceful resistance.

But as authorities moved in Sunday, there was an apparent divide between the Catalan regional police and national police.

Lauren says when Catalan police arrived Sunday morning to confront parents and teachers camped out at a polling station at a school, ""they didn't lift a finger. In fact, people here applauded them and said those police are on our side."" However, when national police sent in from elsewhere in Spain arrived, the crackdown began.

The vote is largely symbolic, its results having no legal status after being blocked by Spain's constitutional court. But experts say a constitutional crisis may be looming as the rift between Madrid and Catalonia deepens.

""Although the Catalan referendum is considered unconstitutional, the defensive posture adopted by Madrid is only adding more fuel to the fire,"" Stephen Gallo, European Head of FX Strategy at BMO Financial Group tells CNBC. ""Regardless of turnout or the result this weekend, the Catalan referendum is becoming yet another PR disaster for the political establishment in Spain.""

In 2014, Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to break away from Spain in another referendum that the central government had deemed illegal. Madrid did not recognize the results.

Whatever the outcome of Sunday's vote, some pro-separatists sounded resigned to what could be lengthy battle ahead.

""Now we are in front of guns. We are surrounded, it's true,"" said polling volunteer Lluis Rotger on Sunday. ""But I think in the end, we will win. How? I don't know.""",,,

Prosecutors presented new evidence in the case against Danish inventor Peter Madsen on Tuesday, saying the body of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who died on Madsen's personal submarine, was riddled with more than a dozen stab wounds. At the pretrial hearing, prosecutors said police had also found a hard drive in Madsen's laboratory containing images of women who were tortured and murdered.

The revelations marked another unsettling turn in an already gruesome case, which has captivated Denmark and attracted international headlines ever since Wall was first reported missing in mid-August. Last seen alive boarding Madsen's submarine on Aug. 10, Wall was nowhere to be found when that submarine sank and Madsen was rescued the next day. Wall's body, stripped of her head and limbs, washed ashore less than two weeks later.

Detained shortly after he was rescued, Madsen initially maintained he had dropped her off, alive and safe, the night of the same day they set out — only to recant that story later, saying he ""buried her at sea"" after a 155-pound hatch accidentally fell on her head in a ""terrible accident.""

The court has proved skeptical of this defense so far, ordering Madsen's detention extended as the charges against him have escalated from involuntary manslaughter up to the mutilation of a corpse and manslaughter. The latter charge is the ""legal equivalent of murder"" in Denmark, The New York Times explains.

At a pretrial hearing in Copenhagen on Tuesday, Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said the state's case against Madsen has only strengthened in recent weeks.

In addition to the stab wounds on Wall's body — which, according to Reuters, Buch-Jepsen said were inflicted ""around or shortly after her death"" — investigators say they also found Wall's DNA on Madsen's nails, nose and neck. The wire service noted that the cause of Wall's death has not yet been officially determined.

At the same time, prosecutors said police had found footage on a computer in his laboratory that depicts the torture and decapitation of women — videos that appear not to have been produced by Madsen himself but ""which we presume to be real,"" Buch-Jepsen said.

""The videos indicate that one might be interested in fetish, torture and killing,"" he said Tuesday, according to the Danish publication Politiken. ""These are some very serious videos with women recorded abroad.""

Nearly 11 months since the last time Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi spoke publicly, the leader of the Islamic State purportedly broke his silence Thursday. ISIS media released a 46-minute audio message that plays a speech by Baghdadi, according to the militant group.

It remains unclear when the message was recorded.

But its release comes at a troubled time for the Islamic State, whose territorial claims have eroded significantly since Baghdadi was heard from last. The Islamist militants, who once laid claim to a wide expanse of land straddling the border between Iraq and Syria, lost the major Iraqi city of Mosul — where Baghdadi declared the group's caliphate in 2014 — earlier this summer to the Iraqi military. And U.S.-backed rebels are now racing against the Syrian regime to retake the oil-rich province of Deir ez-Zor in Syria. Rebel forces have also pushed progressively deeper into Raqqa, ISIS' so-called capital.

The US.-led coalition has rained down more than 5,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria in August alone.

As NPR's Ruth Sherlock notes, the speech reflects such losses:

""The voice, which sounds like Baghdadi, calls on supporters not to see the loss of territory as a defeat of the group. He tries to energize his faithful, saying the lives of jihadis lost in Mosul and in Raqqa — their stronghold in Syria — should not be in vain.""

The New York Times notes the speech also appeared to make ""indirect references to recent attacks on the Underground in London, in the heart of Barcelona and in Russia.""

In June, the Russian Defense Ministry announced the country may have killed Baghdadi in an airstrike — though Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reportedly acknowledged he had ""no 100 percent confirmation of this information.""

U.S. Gen. Stephen Townsend, commander of the international military coalition against ISIS, later said he did not believe Baghdadi was dead.

""We're looking for him every day,"" Townsend said last month.",,,

Prosecutors presented new evidence in the case against Danish inventor Peter Madsen on Tuesday, saying the body of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who died on Madsen's personal submarine, was riddled with more than a dozen stab wounds. At the pretrial hearing, prosecutors said police had also found a hard drive in Madsen's laboratory containing images of women who were tortured and murdered.

The revelations marked another unsettling turn in an already gruesome case, which has captivated Denmark and attracted international headlines ever since Wall was first reported missing in mid-August. Last seen alive boarding Madsen's submarine on Aug. 10, Wall was nowhere to be found when that submarine sank and Madsen was rescued the next day. Wall's body, stripped of her head and limbs, washed ashore less than two weeks later.

Detained shortly after he was rescued, Madsen initially maintained he had dropped her off, alive and safe, the night of the same day they set out — only to recant that story later, saying he ""buried her at sea"" after a 155-pound hatch accidentally fell on her head in a ""terrible accident.""

The court has proved skeptical of this defense so far, ordering Madsen's detention extended as the charges against him have escalated from involuntary manslaughter up to the mutilation of a corpse and manslaughter. The latter charge is the ""legal equivalent of murder"" in Denmark, The New York Times explains.

At a pretrial hearing in Copenhagen on Tuesday, Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen said the state's case against Madsen has only strengthened in recent weeks.

In addition to the stab wounds on Wall's body — which, according to Reuters, Buch-Jepsen said were inflicted ""around or shortly after her death"" — investigators say they also found Wall's DNA on Madsen's nails, nose and neck. The wire service noted that the cause of Wall's death has not yet been officially determined.

At the same time, prosecutors said police had found footage on a computer in his laboratory that depicts the torture and decapitation of women — videos that appear not to have been produced by Madsen himself but ""which we presume to be real,"" Buch-Jepsen said.

""The videos indicate that one might be interested in fetish, torture and killing,"" he said Tuesday, according to the Danish publication Politiken. ""These are some very serious videos with women recorded abroad.""

But Madsen denied the computer was his, saying it was found in a communal space. ""They are the space laboratory's tools which have been used by everyone in the laboratory,"" Madsen said, as translated by Reuters.

In a few months, AOL Instant Messenger will go the way of such tech touchstones as AltaVista and Netscape. It was 20 years ago that ""AIM"" went online. It quickly exploded in popularity, peaked and then slowly succumbed to competitors.

For many of us, AIM conjures up memories of dial-up modems, the sound of a ""handshake"" and the phrase ""You've Got Mail.""

""AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,"" says Michael Albers, vice president of communications product at Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications that brought AOL and Yahoo together into a single unit earlier this year.

On Twitter, a social media platform that in no small way contributed to AIM's demise, people seemed a bit nostalgic but not terribly surprised.

""You likely remember the CD, your first screenname, your carefully curated away messages, and how you organized your buddy lists,"" Albers says. ""In the late 1990's, the world had never seen anything like it. And it captivated all of us.""

In fact, by 2001, AIM had captivated about 100 million of us worldwide, but as Techcrunch.com writes:

""It battled for supremacy with competitors like ICQ, and messengers from Yahoo and Microsoft MSN. But eventually text messaging, Google's GChat and Facebook took over, while AIM never fully figured out the shift to mobile. That led to AOL's fall from grace, going from being valued at $224 billion in today's money to just $4.4 billion when it was sold to Verizon in 2015. For context on the business AOL let slip away, WhatsApp sold that same year to Facebook for more than $19 billion.""

""We know there are so many loyal fans who have used AIM for decades; and we loved working and building the first chat app of its kind since 1997,"" AOL writes on the AIM help page. ""Our focus will always be on providing the kind of innovative experiences consumers want. We're more excited than ever to focus on building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products.""

If you still have an AIM account, you can keep using it until December 15. After that, you will no longer be able to sign on.",,,

Scenes of chaos and violence unfolded in Catalonia as an independence referendum deemed illegal by Madrid devolved quickly on Sunday.

As police followed orders from the central government to put a stop to the vote, they fired rubber bullets at unarmed protesters and smashed through the glass at polling places, reports The Associated Press. Three hundred and thirty-seven people were injured, some seriously, according to Catalonia's government spokesman.

Spain's Interior Ministry said a dozen police officers were injured. NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from Barcelona that some people were throwing rocks down at officers from balconies.

Yet the violence came from all directions.

""Horrible scenes,"" Lauren reports. ""Police dragging voters out of polling stations, some by the hair.""

Scuffles erupted as riot police forcefully removed hundreds of would-be voters from polling places across Barcelona, the Catalan capitol, reports AP.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Emilio Morenatti/AP Emilio Morenatti/AP

Nevertheless, many people, managed to successfully cast their ballots across the region after waiting in lines hundreds-of-people-deep, including the elderly and families with small children, says Reuters.

Sunday was a culmination of a decades-long movement in the autonomous region of Catalonia nestled in Spain's northeast corner. Pro-separatists say they deserve self-rule, pointing to their unique history, culture and language. And as a wealthy region, they say Catalans pay an outsize share of taxes to Madrid, while seeing little in return.

Independence supporters knew that Sunday's vote would be much more than a simple exercise in democracy as the stage was set for a show down.

""There will be no referendum on Oct. 1,"" government spokesman Inigo Mendez de Vigo declared on Friday.

After the highest court in Spain had ruled the referendum unconstitutional, the central government sent in thousands of police reinforcements to try to halt it, in part by dismantling needed infrastructure, reports Reuters.

The government said organizers were facing criminal charges and arrest.

And Catalonia's High Court ruled that Google had to delete a smartphone app that the Catalan government was using to spread information about the vote, reports the wire service. Google apparently complied.

Despite the setbacks, pro-separatists forged ahead.

""Everything is prepared at the more than 2,000 voting points so they have ballot boxes and voting slips, and have everything people need to express their opinion,"" Catalan President Carles Puigdemont told the wire service.

Puigdemont cast his vote Sunday in the province of Girona.

Lauren reports that referendum organizers had to deploy creative tactics to skirt authorities. ""The polling station where I am right now, ballot boxes had to be smuggled into the building before dawn in garbage bags so that they weren't confiscated by police.""

Tens of thousands of people registered to spend the night at polling places in defiance of court orders that they be shut down. Organizers told Reuters that even if people were prevented from voting, the mass sleepover would show solidarity in a peaceful resistance.

But as authorities moved in Sunday, there was an apparent divide between the Catalan regional police and national police.

Lauren says when Catalan police arrived Sunday morning to confront parents and teachers camped out at a polling station at a school, ""they didn't lift a finger. In fact, people here applauded them and said those police are on our side."" However, when national police sent in from elsewhere in Spain arrived, the crackdown began.

The vote is largely symbolic, its results having no legal status after being blocked by Spain's constitutional court. But experts say a constitutional crisis may be looming as the rift between Madrid and Catalonia deepens.

""Although the Catalan referendum is considered unconstitutional, the defensive posture adopted by Madrid is only adding more fuel to the fire,"" Stephen Gallo, European Head of FX Strategy at BMO Financial Group tells CNBC. ""Regardless of turnout or the result this weekend, the Catalan referendum is becoming yet another PR disaster for the political establishment in Spain.""

In 2014, Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to break away from Spain in another referendum that the central government had deemed illegal. Madrid did not recognize the results.

Whatever the outcome of Sunday's vote, some pro-separatists sounded resigned to what could be lengthy battle ahead.

""Now we are in front of guns. We are surrounded, it's true,"" said polling volunteer Lluis Rotger on Sunday. ""But I think in the end, we will win. How? I don't know.""",,,

Early Wednesday, Spanish police raided government offices in Catalonia and detained at least a dozen separatist leaders — just 10 days before a planned referendum vote on Catalonian independence.

Catalonia, a region in northeast Spain, has its own language and culture. Separatists have long advocated for independence; a vote in 2014 overwhelmingly supported splitting away from Spain, although turnout was low.

Madrid did not recognize that vote, calling it illegal — and considers the upcoming referendum, slated for Oct. 1, to be equally unconstitutional.

According to El Pais, the Spanish Civil Guard raided multiple Catalan government offices, including the headquarters of the region's departments of Economy; Foreign Affairs; and Labor, Social Affairs and Families. The government arrested 14 people, the newspaper reports, and ""among the detained, there are high-ranking officials"" from the Catalan government, including the region's secretary of the economy and secretary of the treasury.

In the wake of the Spanish raids, the regional president of Catalonia was holding an emergency Cabinet meeting, NPR's Lauren Frayer reports from Madrid.

Spanish Civil Guards have already confiscated ballots and told police to block voting stations, Lauren says. Now that they've also detained elected officials, tensions are rising:

""Riots broke out on Barcelona's Ramblas street, outside a government building raided by Spanish Civil Guards. "" 'We will vote!' people chanted. ""Asked about the raids, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told reporters, 'I'm sorry, I hope we don't continue this dynamic. But they must abide by the law.' ""

On Wednesday, Catalan President Carles Puigdemont urged residents in the region to turn out for the Oct. 1 vote.

""We condemn and reject the anti-democratic and totalitarian actions of the Spanish state,"" he said, according to Reuters.

""Let's resist peacefully,"" the president of the Catalan National Assembly tweeted. ""He did not have to wait long,"" the BBC reports. It adds:

""The centre of Barcelona soon became a sea of Catalan flags and the city's renowned football club threw its weight behind the protests, condemning any act that threatened freedom of speech and self-determination.""",,,

In recent years, Spain has had a devastating economic crash, an influx of migrants and corruption scandals that left people fed up with politicians. All these factors might make Spain fertile ground for the sort of right-wing, anti-immigrant political parties gaining ground in other parts of Europe. But unlike much of the continent, Spain has no such far-right movement.

Why?

The answer lies in places like San Cristóbal de los Ángeles, about a half-hour train ride south of Madrid's grand boulevards. It's a warren of drab concrete apartment blocks, with women wearing Muslim headscarves and Africans playing cards in the street. The Madrid suburb is about half-immigrant. Most residents are either retired, unemployed or in the country illegally.

In a bar, white, native-born Spaniards bemoan their barrio's decline. The only local industry was construction, and that collapsed when the crisis hit in 2008. Immigrants have filled cheap, half-built homes.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR Lauren Frayer/NPR

""We used to feel like neighbors. But day by day, I feel like we're strangers,"" says Carmen Acero Rodriguez, 82, who's lived in San Cristóbal ever since she got married 57 years ago. ""So many new people have moved in. The barrio doesn't feel safe anymore.""

Acero Rodriguez says she was recently robbed by a Moroccan immigrant she'd hired to clean her house — though she quickly adds the culprit could just as easily have been Spanish. And it would never occur to her to look to the right wing for solutions or to feel safer.

""I'm a lifelong socialist!"" Acero Rodriguez says proudly. ""Why on earth would any working-class person vote for the right wing?""

In Spain, some of the feelings and frustrations that help feed support to right-wing and populist parties elsewhere in Europe are the same. But the political reaction here is very different.

Picking up her kids from school in San Cristóbal, Maria Ascensión, 42, calls herself ""unemployed and angry."" But she won't take that out on immigrants, she says.

Many of Ascensión's own relatives emigrated from Spain to countries in northern Europe, fleeing the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco, who ruled from 1939 till his death in 1975.

""We had nearly 40 years of a repressive, right-wing dictator. That's why we don't have far-right parties like that of [Marine] Le Pen in France,"" Ascensión says. ""We have nothing so radical.""

Only on the left have radical new political parties flourished in Spain. In last year's national election, the new left-wing party Podemos, led by a 38-year-old former communist with a ponytail, won more than 21 percent of the vote.

Spain is where many Arab and African migrants land when they journey by boat across the Mediterranean to Europe. More than 13,000 migrants arrived in Spain last year — the majority by sea.

Yet the sudden arrival of tens of thousands of foreigners in recent years has not provoked a rise in xenophobic or anti-Muslim feelings, says Carmen González-Enriquez, a social scientist who recently published a research paper for Madrid's Elcano think tank entitled ""The Spanish Exception.""

Spaniards tend to empathize with immigrants because most newcomers, until recently, have come from Latin America or Romania and integrated easily in terms of language, religion and race, Gonzalez-Enriquez says.

And, Ascensión points out, many Spaniards have also been immigrants themselves.

Madrid's City Hall is draped in a ""Refugees Welcome"" banner. And last month, Spain's second city, Barcelona, filled with tens of thousands of demonstrators — marching in favor of accepting even more refugees.

Nobody complains about immigrants being on welfare in Spain, because Spanish government benefits are pretty scant. Unlike in the U.K., for example, there is no housing benefit, child benefit or long-term unemployment benefit in Spain.

Instead, Spaniards value the benefits of EU membership, and they're among the most pro-EU on the continent.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Lauren Frayer/NPR Lauren Frayer/NPR

""The Franco dictatorship left Spain isolated and underdeveloped,"" González-Enriquez says. ""Spaniards felt inferior to the rest of Europe and wanted to join the club — for economic reasons, but also to recover national pride.""

While fear of Islamist terror attacks has become fodder for far-right political parties elsewhere in Europe, seeking to turn people against Muslim immigrants, Spain had a different experience, González-Enriquez says.

The country's Basque separatist group, ETA, killed more than 800 people in Spain from the late 1960s until it declared a cease-fire in 2011. But in all those years, Spaniards never feared or racially profiled all Basques for the actions of a few radicals. Similarly, they're less inclined to turn against Muslim immigrants now, González-Enriquez believes.

In Spain, regional identity — featuring distinct regional languages, holidays and culture — tends to be stronger than nationalist sentiment.

Case in point: When NPR approached 82-year-old Acero Rodriguez in San Cristóbal, she introduced herself as a ""Castilian"" — from central Spain — rather than as Spanish. That kind of regional self-identification helps protect against far-right groups stirring up nationalism across the country, González-Enriquez says.

There is one tiny far-right party in Spain. It was founded about three years ago and is called Vox. It's a Catholic faction that favors a ban on abortion, harsher penalties for ETA terrorists and more centralized power, with less autonomy for the Spanish regions.

In the San Cristóbal bar, NPR asked Acero Rodriguez about it. After all, the elderly are this party's target demographic.

But she said she'd never heard of it — and neither had her husband or a handful of neighbors in the bar.

That may be because in last year's election, Spain's only far-right party got 0.2 percent of the vote.",,,

""No tinc por!"" — I am not afraid — mourners have been chanting in the local Catalan language at vigils and marches across Barcelona, since ISIS killed 16 people in and around the city on Aug. 17 and 18.

But when Spain's king broke royal protocol and joined marchers last weekend in solidarity with the terrorism victims, the tone changed: Residents booed and yelled at him to ""get out!"" and go home to Madrid.

Catalans are using the ""No tinc por"" slogan — and hashtag — to express defiance not only against terrorists but also against the Spanish state.

Separatists rule Spain's northeast region of Catalonia, which has its own language, culture, history and holidays. Last month's ISIS attacks hit during a campaign for independence.

So when Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy arrived in Barcelona several hours after the attacks, he appealed for unity.

""It's important that we're capable of working together — like a true team,"" he told reporters. ""Unity will enable us to wipe out terrorism.""

That infuriated many independence activists, who interpreted Rajoy's comments, and the Spanish king's appearance in Barcelona, as challenges to the independence movement — and to regional officials' authority.

""Right after the attack, a lot of people in the independence movement had this feeling that the attack was being used by the Madrid press and politicians as a way of attacking independence,"" says Liz Castro, an American immigrant to Barcelona and convert to the Catalan independence cause. ""There were immediately editorials that said, 'Catalans must give up this silly game of independence, because this is really serious.' ""

Catalan leaders say they will not give up. They vow to go ahead with a referendum on Oct. 1 and declare independence from Spain if the ""yes"" votes win.

Madrid says the whole thing is unconstitutional.

The terrorist attacks have given Catalan and Spanish politicians one more thing to argue about. They trade barbs daily over which level of government — regional or national — is to blame for failing to detect ISIS militants before it was too late.

In a recent TV interview, when Catalan Interior Minister Joaquim Forn read out the names of the victims, he made a distinction between ""Catalans"" and ""Spanish nationals"" — as though they were already from two different countries.

Meanwhile, rank-and-file police officers are trying to get to the bottom of how a Muslim imam managed to quickly and quietly radicalize 12 local youths into ISIS attackers.

Inspector Albert Oliva, with the Catalan regional police, called the Mossos, says the regional and national forces have been working well together.

""We've actually had good relations between regional and national police forces,"" says Oliva. ""Within 15 minutes of the attack, we'd set up a coordination center together. So to color the police response with controversies and accusations — that's the unfortunate work of politicians and the media.""

Spain has seen this before. Politicians and the media exploited the deadliest Islamist attack in Europe, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, which killed nearly 200 people just days before a national election.

The party favored to win, Rajoy's conservative Popular Party, mistakenly blamed the attacks on Basque separatists. So did most conservative newspapers. The public felt duped, and delivered a surprise victory at the polls to the opposition Socialists.

Last weekend's massacre in Las Vegas is only the latest reminder of the persistent gun violence in the United States. And a new set of statistics on the rates of gun violence unrelated to conflict underscores just how outsize U.S. rates of gun deaths are compared with those in much of the rest of the world.

Take countries with the top indicators of socioeconomic success — income per person and average education level, for instance. The United States ranks ninth in the world among them, bested only by the likes of Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Iceland, Andorra, Canada and Finland.

Those countries all also enjoy low rates of gun violence, but the U.S. has the 31st highest rate in the world: 3.85 deaths due to gun violence per 100,000 people in 2016. That was eight times higher than the rate in Canada, which had .48 deaths per 100,000 people — and 27 times higher than the one in Denmark, which had .14 deaths per 100,000.

The numbers comes from a massive database maintained by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which tracks lives lost in every country, in every year, by every possible cause of death. The figures for 2016 were released just last month. As in previous years, the data paint a fairly rosy picture for much of the world, with deaths due to gun violence rare even in many countries that are extremely poor — such as Bangladesh and Laos, which saw .16 deaths and .13 deaths respectively per 100,000 people.

Prosperous Asian countries such as Singapore and Japan boast the absolute lowest rates, though the United Kingdom and Germany are in almost as good shape.

""It is a little surprising that a country like ours should have this level of gun violence,"" says Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health and epidemiology at the IHME. ""If you compare us to other well-off countries, we really stand out.""

To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States — particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. Mokdad says a major driver is the large presence of gangs and drug trafficking. ""The gangs and drug traffickers fight amongst themselves to get more territory, and they fight the police,"" says Mokdad. And citizens who are not involved are often caught in the crossfire.

Mokdad said drug trafficking may also be a driving factor in two Asian countries that have unusually large rates of violent gun deaths for their region: the Philippines and Thailand.

Loading...

With the casualties due to armed conflicts factored out, even in conflict-ridden regions such as the Middle East, the U.S. rate is worse than in all but one country: Iraq.

Loading...

The U.S. gun violence death rate is also higher than nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including many that are among the world's poorest.

Loading...

One more way to consider this data: The IHME also estimates what it would expect a country's rate of gun violence deaths to be based solely on its socioeconomic status. By that measure, the U.S. should only be seeing .79 deaths per 100,000 people — almost four times less than its actual rate of 3.85 deaths per 100,000.",,,

Most people have had some exposure to mercury. Fish is one source. So are mercury vapors from workplaces and factories. That's what the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say.

At very low levels, the mercury isn't likely a problem (although it's hard to say exactly how low is ""safe."")

But higher levels can cause damage to the kidney, lungs and neurological systems. And for women of childbearing age there's a severe additional risk: mercury levels that exceed the Environmental Protection Agency's ""reference dose"" — the level of daily exposure that the EPA says is unlikely to negatively affect people's health — could damage the fetus that a pregnant woman is carrying, including its kidneys, cardiovascular system and IQ.

And how many women are potentially at risk? That was the question behind a new report: ""Mercury in Women of Childbearing Age in 25 Countries,"" from IPEN, a nonprofit devoted to issues of global health and toxic chemicals, and Biodiversity Research Institute, an ecology research organization. The groups studied 1,044 women from lower-income countries and found that 42 percent had average mercury levels exceeding the EPA reference dose in their hair samples.

The potential harm to the development of the fetal brain is of special concern, says Joseph Graziano, professor of environmental health sciences and pharmacology at Columbia University. ""You get just once chance,"" he says. ""When the damage is done, the damage is done and there's no going back.""

It's likely that human-caused pollution is to blame for these elevated mercury levels.

Women from small-scale gold mining communities had some of the highest rates of mercury in their hair samples. In Indonesia, Kenya and Myanmar more than half of the sampled women from these mining communities exceeded the limit. These operations often extract gold from ores by heating up an alloy containing mercury, creating mercury vapor that can be inhaled. According to researcher Lee Bell, lead author of the IPEN paper, this can put workers at risk and contaminate local waterways.

Diet is another factor. In the Pacific Islands, 86 percent of the women tested had higher levels of mercury in their bodies than the EPA standard. Bell says that in this part of the world, coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources of mercury pollution are likely to blame. It ends up in fish — a staple in the diet of many Pacific Islanders.

The study also looked at an indigenous community on an Alaskan island whose diet is high in sea mammals like walrus and seal. The report found 30 percent of the Alaskan women, who are part of the Yupik indigenous group, exceeded the EPA mercury threshold.

Imogen Ingram is a member of the IPEN Steering Committee and a resident of Cook Islands, one of the places in the South Pacific included in the study. Ingram had her own hair tested while attending an early negotiating committee for the Minamata Convention of Mercury, a worldwide agreement through the U.N. that aims to address the global mercury issue with measures like lowering mercury emissions and better regulating small-scale gold mining. She found that her level of mercury was 2.5 times higher than the EPA threshold.

""I'm glad that I lived to my age without any apparent effects ... I had my son and he had no apparent brain damage either,"" she says. ""But, you do worry about other people. Especially if you're not aware of it."" After she was tested, she later helped collect hair samples of Pacific Island women as part of the IPEN study.

Conventional advice recommends limiting fish consumption, says Ingram, but for communities on small atolls like hers that rely on seafood, that's not always an option. Instead of telling people to stop eating fish, she would rather work to clean up the ocean to make fish safer to eat.

Pamela Miller, co-chair of IPEN who was involved in organizing sample collection in Alaska, says that the marine mammals and fish that are likely contaminated have been in the Alaskan indigenous people's traditional diet for centuries. When it comes to alternatives in rural Alaskan villages, she says, many are cost prohibitive — importing food can be expensive.

Mercury pollution is not a new issue. But in the past 100 years, says Bell, industrial development has boosted levels. According to a 2014 study published in Nature, humans have tripled the amount of mercury in the upper 100 meters of the ocean since the start of the Industrial Revolution.

And mercury doesn't stay put. Bill Pan, assistant professor of global environmental health at Duke University, says ""the problem with the atmospheric release of mercury is that you could have a gold mining operation in Peru or South Asia but it transports over long distances. And when I mean long distances I mean thousands of miles.""

Because the problem now reaches across continents, Miller underscores the importance of global cooperation. ""This is a problem that can't be solved by one location. Mercury is something that's transported across international boundaries,"" she says.

Bell says that the international community has recognized the issue with the Minamata Convention. The convention's first major meeting took place last month in Geneva, Switzerland. So far, the agreement has 128 signatures.",,,

The charity World Vision International is a major provider of disaster relief across the globe. So when Hurricane Harvey hit Texas, the group's office in the United States revved up its fundraising big-time.

""We've raised just under $4 million in cash donations,"" says Drew Clark, senior director of emergencies at World Vision's U.S. office.

Two weeks later Hurricane Irma roared through the Caribbean and Florida. This time World Vision brought in $900,000.

Then came the big earthquake in Mexico that killed more than 340 people. That fundraising appeal netted $150,000. And for Hurricane Maria — which has left many of the 3.4 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico without reliable sources of power, food or even water — World Vision has only taken in about $100,000.

""There is clearly evidence of donor fatigue,"" says Clark. ""There's just a limit to the amount of responses that we can successfully fundraise for.""

Donor fatigue is just one of many ways that organizations and U.S. government agencies that handle disasters are feeling the pressure of a unique pileup of catastrophic events.

""I would say it is somewhat unprecedented,"" says Leisel Talley of the epic cascade of disasters. She is leading the international component of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's response to the hurricanes.

""This year has been particularly challenging.""

Talley says it's not just that the U.S. has been clobbered with three disasters in a row. It's that this happened alongside multiple new crises since August. Besides the Mexico earthquake, there was a landslide killing a thousand people in Sierra Leone. And in Bangladesh, half a million Muslim Rohingya refugees have poured in, fleeing violence in Myanmar.

All this has happened as the world was already grappling with the largest humanitarian crisis since World War II: 20 million people at risk of dying from starvation and disease due to conflicts and drought in Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan and Yemen.

So within the U.S. government it's not just exclusively domestic agencies like FEMA that are in all-hands-on-deck mode right now. At the CDC, where Talley works for a branch that focuses on overseas emergencies, ""we have staff around the world responding.""

Similarly, USAID, the agency that delivers U.S. assistance to poor countries, has deployed six separate disaster response teams — which can consist of as many as several dozen staffers — including teams to help displaced people from Syria and Iraq.

""This is only the second time that we've had six teams mobilized at once,"" notes Alex Mahoney, a top official with the agency's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, or OFDA.

The last time was during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. ""So yes, it's unusual,"" he says.

Both Talley and Mahoney say their respective agencies are equipped to handle this multipronged challenge. USAID's OFDA in particular undertook a major rethink of its staffing expectations in the wake of the Ebola crisis. Jeremy Konyndyk, who headed the office at the time, says the staffing demands of Ebola combined with several other disasters at the time, including the earthquake in Nepal and the Syrian refugee crises, ""stretched OFDA to the breaking point.""

""We didn't drop the ball on it, but it really took everything we had,"" says Konyndyk, who is now a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""We pushed our staff farther and for longer than was sustainable.""

And in the aftermath, he and other officials concluded that this was unlikely to be a one-time occurrence. ""It was very clear that we had to re-examine our assumptions about the levels of deployment that OFDA should be equipped to carry out."" He's confident that the subsequent retooling of staffing arrangements with both full-time personnel and contractors has left OFDA prepared for the current wave of crises.

But Paul Spiegel, who directs the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health, is less optimistic about both the capacity and the commitment of the U.S. government. ""There was already insufficient humanitarian workers to respond given the amount of emergencies,"" he says.

And he believes the funds for emergencies are also insufficient. Last year, he notes, the total amount donated by governments — including the U.S. — for international humanitarian assistance fell 40 percent short of what the United Nations said was needed. President Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2018 would slash U.S. overseas disaster assistance by a third.

Congress has seemed on track to restore those cuts — there's been longstanding bipartisan support for this kind of aid.

""But these are not normal political times,"" says Spiegel. And as the cost mounts for rebuilding on U.S. soil, he worries that consensus for helping out overseas could be one more casualty of this hurricane season.

As for World Vision's Drew Clark, he says the donor fatigue that's hampered his organization's fundraising for victims of Hurricane Irma is already having serious consequences. For now the group has drawn on its reserves to provide basic relief supplies like blankets, tents and cooking materials.

""But there is simply a ceiling to how much money we can divert that way,"" he says. And doing the kind of core work World Vision would normally undertake — for instance rebuilding the water supply and supporting the health sector — is out of the question without a rapid influx of additional funds. If those needs go unaddressed in Puerto Rico, ""what will be happening over the next few months could be a really frightening situation.""",,,

In a wealthy suburb in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, a group of young Pakistanis veered between laughter and distress as they played a board game that echoed their lives in both funny and painful ways.

The name of the game is ""Arranged"" and the goal is to avoid at all costs an arranged marriage – and the matchmaker who sets them up. She's known as Rishta Aunty, slang in Urdu and Hindi for a certain kind of middle-aged, busybody matchmaker who knows all the single men and women.

To stay out of her grasp in the game, you draw cards that tell you how many spaces to move. It'd be a good thing if you get a card that tells you to act scandalously according to the conservative standards of South Asia. Because that would be a dealbreaker.

""You are in the contraceptive aisle of a pharmacy! Run before somebody sees you!"" reads Ahmed. Since tradition has it that women aren't meant to have sex before marriage, shopping for contraception definitely put you on a matchmaker's ""do not match"" list.

""The Aunty moves five spaces away from you,"" Ahmed continues. ""Thank God.""

The inventor of the game is Nashra Balagamwala, 24, who studied game design at Rhode Island School of Design.

One night she began listing the ways she deflected pressure from matchmakers to meet a man. She tried to make herself as ineligible as possible.

She wore a fake wedding ring. She pretended to have a boyfriend. She got a tan, in a country where pale skin is prized.

""I was like, my life has been a struggle to run away from the matchmaker!"" laughed Balagamwala.

And then she had a eureka moment: ""I turned it into a lighthearted game of running away from the matchmaker!""

Lighthearted, yes. But the board game ""Arranged"" is also darkly funny as it skewers the South Asian tradition of arranged marriage.

In Pakistan, the tradition is for parents to put forward a marriage candidate. Their children are expected to agree. The ideal woman is young, pale, slim, meek, educated and moneyed — and from a good family. An ideal man has an MBA and a foreign passport. Marriages fuse families together, not just individuals.

For most women, ""omnipresent in their lives is the expectation that they will get married at a young enough age that they can start having children,"" says Bina Shah, a feminist writer.

Even if women don't want to, ""we have been raised in such a way that we feel obligated to our parents,"" Shah says. ""There's the emotional blackmail: You're going to give me a heart attack! What is the family going to say?""

In the game, while some cards help players evade Rishta Aunty, other cards force them to move closer to her by making them conform to South Asian standards of what makes a good, demure wife. And every player — even the guys — is a potential bride.

""Your rotis are perfectly round,"" read another player, Rabia, referring to homemade flatbread that is a staple of Pakistani meals. The Rishta Aunty — a smiling, rotund cardboard figure of a woman on the game board — inched six spaces closer.

""Oh God!"" she cried, visibly distressed.

""Arranged"" hit a nerve on Kickstarter, where Balagamwala raised $21,788, far more than the $6,000 she sought. It was enough for her to start producing the game. It will go on sale in Pakistan in December.

And there's an unexpected prize for Balagamwala.

When the game makes its debut, she says with a laugh, ""I essentially become the least eligible lady. Now I can go and marry whoever I want!""

What would a Rishta Aunty say to all this?

For 36 years, Mumtaz Qureishi has arranged marriages for the rich and powerful. In her apartment on a recent day, two women who work for her were answering four black landlines and buzzing mobile phones.

They frequently flipped through binders. One was simply titled ""Doctors."" Another was titled ""Overage"" –- it means women over 30. They were crammed with detailed application forms that demand excessive detail: Education. Province. Religious sect. Caste. Employment. Phone number. Marital status: single, divorced or widowed. Father's job. Siblings. Address.

And then: appearance. Qureishi fills that section out herself, grading the women A, B, C.

The As, are white. ""Fair complexion,"" she says. ""Tall, slim, smart,"" she says.

She says its what future mother-in-laws want in a bride — and they usually select women for their sons.

But there's a broader, quiet shift going on in this conservative country. In urban areas of Pakistan, about half all marriages are no longer strictly traditional, says Naeema Saeed, a professor in sociology at Karachi University.

She calls them ""arranged-plus-love.""

Her research showed the trend now is for men and women to meet before they marry.

Then the man asks his parents to set up the match — a nod to tradition without being totally traditional.

The new approach reflects a society where social media is connecting people, where women are studying and working alongside men. Women are earning their own money, empowering them to make more independent decisions, she says.

It's a quiet negotiation, not dramatic change, says Shah, the feminist writer. ""In Pakistan our way of obstacles is not to smash through them but to go around them.""

And even a Risha Aunty can't buck the tide. On a wall of Qureishi's office, there are family wedding photos. She points to her son, beaming beside his wife.

He picked out his own bride — putting his mother out of a job.",,,

African asylum seekers in Italy are becoming artists — and it's not only helping them cope with the trauma they've been through but also introducing their stories to the local community.

In Europe's migration crisis, Italy is ground zero. More than 500,000 migrants have arrived, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, since 2014.

Despite a smaller flow this summer, anti-migrant sentiment is growing.

But in the Umbrian town of Trevi, population 8,372 as of January 1, a project called Make Art Not Walls is helping asylum seekers assimilate.

Municipal authorities have assigned all of the town's 55 African asylum seekers to a former hotel, where for the last several months, a storeroom in the back has been serving as an artists' studio, funded by the Italian charity ARCI.

The Make Art Not Walls project is the brainchild of a longtime Trevi resident, Australian artist Virginia Ryan. With the help of a few other volunteers, Ryan aims to bring out the human potential and restore dignity to people stranded in limbo.

Making art, she tells migrants, is a form of therapy.

""The same courage that you apply to coming through the Sahara, arriving in Libya, getting on the boats, getting here, that courage can be also employed when you take up a pencil and you have a white sheet of paper and manage to make a mark on that,"" she says.

Exuberant, brightly colored paintings line the walls of the studio. Large paper drawings have been rolled up around cardboard tubes — giving the impression of humorous totem poles.

Materials like paper, paints and colored pencils are donated by shops and businesses. Recycled materials are in evidence, including the wood panels on which some art is painted.

Most of the art depicts domestic scenes and portraits. But some budding artists have turned their personal dramas into visual stories.

One of the most accomplished is a nine-panel series by Benjamin Raphael. Before leaving home on his long voyage out of Nigeria, the 26-year-old salesman had never picked up a paint brush.

Pointing to the first panel — in which a young man with a backpack waves goodbye to an older man, representing his uncle — Raphael says: ""This is my voyage, this is the beginning, when I left my country.""

The following panels show a few men crammed into bus, then on a motorcycle, and then piled into a truck, their faces covered with scarves for protection against the desert sand as they cross into Libya.

The fifth panel shows terrified, exhausted men held behind bars by criminal gangs.

""If you are not lucky, you might be caught, maybe by police or a group of bad people, the Libyan people that are bad put you in a cage to demand ransom for your release,"" Raphael says.

After relatives pay a ransom, Raphael explains, the men are packed like sardines into a car trunk and taken to the coast. On the beach, they're told to inflate a rubber dinghy, carry it into the sea, pile in and, in the last panel, sail northward to Europe.

Eight hours after setting to the sea on his own voyage, now committed to canvas, Raphael and his mates were rescued by the Italian Coast Guard. It took him eight months to paint these memories of his voyage.

""It was hard, very painful,"" he says of depicting the journey in art. But, he says ""Virginia told me 'You have to create something for yourself, have to be effective, do something.' That is how it came about.""

In Guinea, Zacob Camara, 29, worked as a mason. His art in the studio depicts colonialism's effect on his homeland.

""We have heroes, people who fought for our liberation,"" Camara says.

He points to his whimsical painting: a man in white on horseback, floating above a yellow desert, two half-moon crescents in the starry sky. It could be a Chagall — transplanted to Africa.

Camara's painting is an attempt to show that during Colonial times, oppressed Africa and Africans had their own heroes — freedom fighters. His painting, he says, is a ""positive"" response to the harm caused by colonialism.

While organizers says they don't have a record of how many locals have seen the art works, about 200 townspeople attended a showing of a documentary on the project called The Art Of Migration at a large church in Trevi on September 16.

Federica di Marco, one of Trevi's residents, says the migrants have given as much to her as she has to them. She's been teaching some of the refugees Italian.

""It's been emotionally draining,"" she says. ""I've connected with their stories, their voyage, their suffering, you live through it all. It's been a very significant experience for me.""

According to Italian law, migrants cannot work while seeking asylum. With no control over their future, the Trevi migrants are grateful for the opportunity to do something with their time and learn new skills.

And who knows, maybe one of them will emerge as the Matisse or Chagall of this African diaspora.",,,

There's a heated battle going on about the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. Nearly 200 scientists signed a letter to the World Health Organization last week, calling for the games to be moved because of the ongoing epidemic of Zika in Brazil.

But many health officials — including those at WHO — say having the games in Rio doesn't pose a big enough threat to warrant moving them.

So who's right?

To figure out whether Zika might be a big problem at the Olympics, there's one key piece of information you need: How many mosquitoes will be in Rio during the games?

That's exactly what epidemiologist Mikkel Quam has been working on. He used a mathematical model — and data from another outbreak in Rio — to estimate the chance spectators and athletes will get a mosquito bite for three weeks in August, when the games take place.



""I was legitimately surprised,"" says Quam, who works at Umea University in Sweden. ""There's very little mosquito activity during the Olympics.""

August is winter in Brazil. It's cooler and drier. So the mosquito population is way down.

Only about 4 percent of fans will get bitten at least once by a mosquito that could carry Zika, Quam estimates. The chance they'll catch Zika is even lower — much, much lower.

""I think we'll get cases but I don't expect many cases,"" Quam says.

It's hard to calculate the exact number. But a preliminary model suggests that, at most, 1 in 31,000 people at the games will get infected with Zika, Quam and his colleagues recently reported.

Officials are expecting around 500,000 spectators and athletes. Then the model predicts, there will be — at most — 16 cases of Zika at the Olympics.

So attendees are much more likely to get the flu or food poisoning at the games than Zika, the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control concluded.

""If I would be an athlete competing, from what I've read, I would be more concerned about the pollution in the water than Zika,"" says Alessandro Vespignani, at Northeastern University in Boston.

But whether the Rio games pose a danger to the world isn't just about the number of Zika cases, Vespignani says. It's also about where those cases go — what's the chance a fan or athlete brings the virus home to a place without Zika and triggers a new outbreak in Africa or Asia — or here in the States?

So Vespignani is working on a computer model for the U.S. government to predict how Zika will spread. Keeping the games in Rio doesn't seem to change the course of the epidemic in his models.

""There are already so many cases around the world that adding a little bit more cases is not going to make a difference at this point,"" Vespignani says.

So there's no reason to move the games because of Zika, he believes.

So far the continental U.S. has had about 600 cases of Zika. They've all come from travelers to other countries. Each year hundreds of millions of Americans travel to countries where Zika is circulating, a recent study found.

""The Olympics would represent less than 0.25 percent of all travel to Zika-affected areas,"" Dr. Thomas Frieden, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's director, said last week to reporters.

So even if the Olympics were called off, ""we'd still be left with 99.75 percent of the risk of Zika continuing to spread,"" Frieden said.

But all these predictions and models are just that — predictions. Like weather predictions, they are often wrong. And they're based on many assumptions, such as the idea that Zika behaves similarly to the way other mosquito-borne viruses do.

""The problem is, we just don't know that,"" says Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University. He's one of the researchers that wrote the letter to WHO, calling for the Olympics to be moved. He says the stakes are too high.

""I think it's ethically dubious to run the Olympics when you've got an epidemic of a virus that we don't understand very well,"" Caplan says.

For instance, scientists still don't know how long Zika can linger in the body or how big of a problem sexual transmission is.

So Caplan says, why not not err on the side of caution — especially considering the devastating effects Zika can have for mothers and their babies.",,,

How do you stop the world's worst cholera epidemic?

One way is to send volunteers door-to-door to tell people how they can avoid the disease and what to do if they suspect an infection.

That's what Faytha Ahmed Farj is doing. A 45-year-old mother of 9, Farj has never held a paying job but she's part of a nationwide campaign of volunteers fighting cholera.

Since April, more than 600,000 cases across Yemen have been reported. There was a time when so many sick people were arriving at the cholera center of Alsadaqah Hospital in southern Yemen that patients had to share beds. Health authorities say the numbers are the highest ever seen in one country. The deputy manager and head of the center, Nahla Arishi, was seeing some 300 people a day.

But the rampant spread of cholera has slowed in the poorest country in the Arabian Peninsula. UNICEF says weekly cases have declined to 35,000 from a high of about 50,000. Nowadays, Arishi sees some 50 patients with signs of cholera in any given day. Humanitarian organizations can take credit for a lot of that success. But so can regular Yemenis like Farj.

She joined the effort after her eldest son caught the illness. She is one of more than 40,000 trained volunteers across the country who have been crisscrossing their cities and villages on foot in the hopes getting out the word on cholera prevention.

Cholera most commonly spreads when a person eats food or drinks water that has been contaminated by feces. It is curable yet can be fatal. And in Yemen, the epidemic stems from the civil war that began in 2014. Years of fighting between the Houthis, an Iranian-backed Shiite group and the Sunni government, along with airstrikes led by Saudi Arabia, have deteriorated the country's infrastructure. Thousands of civil workers stopped receiving salaries. Vital services ceased, like garbage collection and sewage treatment. Millions of Yemenis lack access to clean water, and more than half of their health facilities are shuttered.

By 8 a.m. most mornings, Farj walks down the streets of different neighborhoods in Sanaa, the capital and her home city. Covered in a niqab from head to toe with only her eyes showing, she knocks on doors to houses and teaches the families inside about the simple things they can do to prevent contracting cholera: washing their hands with soap, boiling their water, rinsing off and cooking their vegetables. In one day, she reaches about 25 houses. It's six days a week, at least six hours a day. Not counting weddings and social gatherings where she takes it upon herself to warn people about cholera.

Walking from house to house can be dangerous. Local agreements made between organizations, authorities, tribes and armed groups allow health workers to enter areas with neutrality. But things can still happen. ""There was more than one occasion when clashes erupted between civilians and soldiers while we were doing the house-to-house campaign,"" says Farj, who spoke to NPR through an interpreter via Skype. There are also the airstrikes. ""I hide in one of the houses,"" she says. When the danger passes, she steps outside to go to the next house.

The people on the other side of the door have often seen their loved ones suffer from cholera's telltale symptom — acute, watery diarrhea. One time, Farj walked into a home where three children, a girl and two boys, were showing these signs of cholera. Their mother had thought it was just a common infection. The family also didn't have enough money to buy food, let alone travel to a cholera center to treat their children. Farj notified a charity that transported the children to a health-care center, where all three were treated and cured for cholera.

According to UNICEF, local volunteers in all of Yemen's 22 governorates have reached about 12.5 million people — most of Yemen's households. Some 250,000 children and adults have been treated at the urging of a volunteer and been treated for diarrhea. Farj's son, now 26, also recovered from cholera. ""What makes me continue working is that people need help,"" she says. ""No matter how little it is. With my little volunteer work I hope that I can save lives. But more needs to be done.""

Other kinds of volunteers are helping to hold their country together. ""Health workers, nurses, doctors continue to go on and treat patients without a salary. For me, those are the unsung heroes of this whole crisis,"" says Meritxell Relaño, the UNICEF representative in Yemen who has been working in the country since October 2015.

Relaño recalls a veiled gynecologist in the port city of Hodeidah. The woman was showing her the maternity ward in a hospital where UNICEF was supplying incubators for newborns. The doctor said nothing about being unpaid until Relaño asked. She told Relaño that she couldn't sit at home when her skills were needed. ""She couldn't let those mothers deliver on their own. She couldn't let those children die,"" says Relaño.

It was the same at schools. Unpaid teachers told Relaño that they keep working because when the war ends, they don't want to have a generation of uneducated children.

Yemen is still facing famine, meningitis and other serious health risks. Out of desperation, poor families are marrying off young daughters for the dowry and to have one less mouth to feed. Boys are joining armed groups because it's their families' only source of income at this time. But many Yemenis go on with pride, says Relaño. ""There is always humor, there is always an inshallah, there is always an optimism, there is always the thinking that things will get better.""

Three years ago, we published a story about a small start-up in Kigali, Rwanda's capital, that was seeking to make homes more sanitary by replacing dirt floors with sealed earthen floors, which are up to 80 percent cheaper than concrete. Recognizing that dirt floors can make people sick — insects, parasites, and germs in the dirt cause diarrhea and other diseases — EarthEnable had come up with a low-cost way to create safer floors, trained 20 masons and tested its method in seven Rwandan homes. The group's challenge was to expand its service, maintaining quality while keeping up with demand. What's happened since?



""Where to begin?"" says Gayatri Datar, with a laugh. In three years, the startup this Stanford MBA graduate co-founded has grown fast. It's provided floors to 9,800 people and hired 200 staff, including masons, sales representatives and support staff. It perfected its proprietary, oil-based floor varnish and sealant. Meanwhile, it also expanded its area of service to four districts within Rwanda and expects to start working soon in neighboring Uganda.

About This Series Goats are curious animals and ""Goats and Soda"" is a curious blog. Over the next week, we'll be looking back at some of our favorite stories to see ""whatever happened to ...""

In the first year or so, demand grew fast. Datar and her team had to learn as they went along. ""It helped us maintain our accountability and launched us forward,"" she says.

As early as 2015, she says, EarthEnable was getting 80 to 100 contracts per month. ""It was a lot, really quickly,"" she says.

Datar and her colleagues struggled to keep up. They trained more masons, but the logistics of delivering truckloads of sand, gravel and other earthen flooring materials — not to mention shovels — to multiple sites in rural Rwanda presented a challenge.

They came up with the idea to train customers to prepare their own floors using materials they could obtain from shops stocking the right materials — a do-it-yourself option that would cost less.

The concept started to take off, Datar says, ""but not as we envisioned."" She and her team noticed that these customers began outsourcing the floor-building to masons unaffiliated with EarthEnable. ""People don't really want to build their own floors,"" she says. ""They don't have much time. They're quite busy in rural communities.""

So the group ran with the idea, training and certifying the masons in its flooring practices — and instituting what Datar calls an ""Angie's List model,"" in which customers rate the masons after their work. ""They're held very accountable to customers,"" Datar says.

This decentralized model has become the most popular EarthEnable flooring service, costing about $80 and accounting now for 90 percent of business. But the group still offers full-service floor installation (called ""Damarara"" or ""treat yourself"") for $150 and a DIY ""self-reliance"" option costing about $50. Another model, a variation on the most popular option, would allow customers to use an EarthEnable compactor to prepare and compress the base of their floor and then bring in a mason to finish the job. ""We are constantly pivoting, piloting and innovating,"" Datar says.

The group, which has received support from the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Mulago Foundation, Echoing Green and others, is one of five finalists this month in the Netherlands Postcode Lottery Green Challenge, an annual ""sustainability innovation"" competition with a 500,000-euro prize.

EarthEnable is a hybrid business, incorporated as a nonprofit in the U.S. but operating for-profit in Rwanda. It provides a small number of floors for free when testing new methods or floor colors.

""Treating people as customers and not as beneficiaries has shifted the whole way our business is done,"" Datar says. ""From the customers' perspective, the experience is quite different."" If people were receiving floors for free, she says, ""They would not hold us as accountable for quality.""

A call center and a customer service department provide additional support and have helped EarthEnable gain a reputation as being responsive and quick to fix problems, Datar says.



Last year, the group moved its headquarters out of Kigali and into a village in the rural area it serves, about an hour's drive away. Datar realized it was better to be near customers.

And earlier this year, demand started to emerge in Uganda, Rwanda's neighbor to the north, in a region experiencing infestations of parasitic chigoe fleas known as ""jiggers"" — a notorious problem with dirt floors.

Improving health was the impetus for starting EarthEnable, and the group is gearing up to begin work next year on a formal, randomized controlled study measuring the health effects of its floors in homes that previously would have been impossible to keep clean.

Where can people expect to live the longest?

The answer to that question is usually pretty predictable and often dependent on wealth: People generally live longer in richer countries. Like Japan and Switzerland, where average life expectancies exceed 83 years.

In lower income countries, expected years of life are often far shorter — hovering below 55 in a number of sub-Saharan countries, including Chad, Mozambique and Sierra Leone.

But a recent data-crunch turned up a few surprises about how long people can expect to live in certain places, with some particularly encouraging news coming out of Niger.

Loading...

The West African nation is on the low end of the life expectancy curve: 62 years on average.

Yet according to a new study, the country tops a list of how many years people can expect to live beyond what the country's level of development would predict. Nicaragua is also up there.

So what's the story in Niger?

It starts with early childhood. In 1990, more than one in four children born in the West African country died by age 5.

To keep its little kids alive, the government has set ambitious goals, including a policy instituted in 2006 that offers free health care to women and children. There's also a national program to train more community health workers. As a result, more children are vaccinated for diseases and treated for major childhood killers like diarrhea.

Those steps have made a big difference. By 2012, deaths among young children had fallen to about 13 percent — which probably also explains why people in Niger can now expect to live longer than they used to, says Christopher Murray, a health economist at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle and lead author of the new study.

Niger isn't just doing better than expected. It's also making some of the biggest gains. In the data from 195 countries and territories, Niger came out at the top of a list of places where the gap between expected and measured life expectancies has increased the most over the last few decades.

It's truly an accomplishment. In 1980, people born in Niger could only expect to live to age 39, nearly five years younger than should be expected based on a country at its stage of development. In 2016, life expectancy in Niger was about eight years longer than would be predicted for a country of its wealth.

By analyzing what's happening in Niger and other countries that are making gains in life expectancy, researchers hope to zero in on the kinds of policies that might help extend lives everywhere, Murray says. Countries at the bottom of the list can serve as cautionary tales.

The hope is to ""learn lessons from the places where there's success and from places where, even though we thought we were doing the right thing, are not doing as well as expected,"" he says.

The well-established link between wealth and life expectancy has fueled a search for outliers that do better or worse than expected based on a country's GDP per person, says Richard Feachem, director of the Global Health Group at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved with the new study.

But it's not just money that influences mortality. People also live longer when they have fewer children and when they get more education. To account for those three well-known trends and see what other factors might be influencing life and death, the new study scrapped GDP in favor of a measure called the Sociodemographic Index (SDI), which allowed them to control for wealth as well as fertility and education.

The study was part of the long-term Global Burden of Disease study, an international effort by more than 2,300 researchers to compile data on causes and rates of death around the world.

And that data has yielded a variety of surprises. Low- and middle-income countries that boasted longer lives than their SDI would predict, according to the new study, included Nicaragua, Gambia, Nepal, Ethiopia and Peru.

Ethiopia and Peru were also on the list of countries that have most improved their life expectancies in comparison to SDI predictions, along with the Maldives, Niger and Portugal. The researchers were particularly interested in this most-improved list, because its countries stand to offer the biggest insights which interventions might make a difference. By contrast, countries like Costa Rica that have boasted longer-than-expected life spans for a long time could simply be explained by healthy diets or lifestyles.

On the flip side, people in Greenland, Indonesia and Russia and in parts of the U.S. like Mississippi are among those failing to live as long as they should be.

The study didn't address the reasons for each story of success or struggle. But Murray has some theories: Ethiopia has made major gains in delivering health care to people in remote and rural areas. Peru has put a lot of work into reducing malnutrition and stunting in children. And several African countries, including Botswana, Rwanda and Zimbabwe, have scaled up treatment programs for HIV/AIDS.

In countries that are underperforming, possible explanations include suicide, drug addiction and uncontrolled epidemics of HIV/AIDS.

""We have speculation on this, but there is a lot of further work to be done to start breaking down what the actual policies are"" that have made a difference, Murray says. As common themes emerge, he says, opportunities will open up for countries to apply strategies that are working elsewhere.

In the meantime, the new data revealed other interesting patterns, Murray says, including differences in life expectancies between men and women. Women tend to live longer than men, and the study found that gap becomes bigger with increasing levels of development. But at the highest levels of development, the gap starts to close.

One theory why is that men and women live the most similar lives at the highest levels of development — working the same kinds of stressful jobs and sharing the same vices, like drinking and smoking.

Another important finding from the data offers a positive message, Feachem says: Overall, people are living a lot longer than they used to.

Since 1970, he says, worldwide life expectancy has increased by 14 years, from 58 to 72. And since 1990, the proportion of children who die before their fifth birthday has dropped form nine percent to four percent.

""If you search back through 200,000 years of human history and ask if there is another 40-year period in which we've seen a 14-year gain in life expectancy, the answer would be no,"" Feachem says. ""These are extraordinarily rapid, comprehensive and widespread improvements in human health.""

That makes Niger just one example of how improvements in health can extend lives.

Gerelee Odonchimed was 23 the first time she said the word vagina. It was 2011 and she had recently joined a new women's rights group in the Mongolian capital of Ulaanbaatar. For their initial project, the group decided to stage The Vagina Monologues, a play where women speak about their vaginas.

The topic isn't something Asian and Mongolian women usually talk about, says Zolzaya Batkhuyag, the group's co-founder. So she assigned the women homework. After rehearsal cast members were told to use mirrors to ""say hi to their vaginas."" Six years later, Batkhuyag, who is 34 and speaks fluent English, laughs at the memory: ""Our first project was crazy, so after that nothing is crazy for us.""

Founded by four young lawyers, the group announced their first meeting on Facebook. Back then they called themselves Young Women for Change. They have since dropped the ""young"" to be more inclusive. They now count more than 80 members. Half a dozen of those members met at their new office on a Friday evening in early August. Their 13th floor headquarters in a modern building in Ulaanbaatar is a reminder of how far they have risen in a short time.

Strong women are not new to Mongolia. Unusual for a developing country, Mongolian women are actually better educated than men, accounting for 62 percent of college, university and institute graduates in 2015, according to the National Statistics Office. They have lower rates of unemployment than their male counterparts and on average live 75.1 years — a decade longer than men.

Tim Jenkins, communications officer for United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) Mongolia, remembers the curiosity the group drew several years ago when they produced a large graffiti piece of a woman breaking through chains. Now he sends other young artists to the site to seek inspiration. More recently the organization created a comic book to draw attention to domestic violence, a move timed to coincide with the 2016 revised law that finally made domestic violence a crime. Reliable statistics are hard to obtain, but according to UNFPA an estimated one out of every three Mongolian women suffers from domestic violence.

Growing up in Gobi-Altai Province in the southwest of the country, Odonchimed says she experienced the issue firsthand. In the early 1990s after the collapse of communism, many families suffered in the economic and social chaos. Raised largely by her grandmother, Odonchimed says her father drank and was abusive.

""I think it's the same for most Mongolians,"" says Odonchimed, who is dressed in fashionably ripped jeans and a white button-down shirt. ""Most of them were experiencing domestic violence.""

It was not until after she began studying law and joined Women for Change that Odonchimed talked about her experience. Now in her role as vice director of the organization she is eager to share her story and draw attention to other women's issues, such as body image. When the group decided to recreate classic paintings by photographing women in nude and partially nude poses, she volunteered to pose with a bare back. While Odonchimed enjoys having her photo taken and is slim and young, other models revealed bodies that are not always thought of as beautiful because they are heavier or older. The idea was to show that there is beauty in all body types.

Their innovative projects would not be possible if it weren't for the organizations that came before them, says Batkhuyag. These organizations, established after the democratic revolution in the early 1990s, created the space and environment for the young women behind Women for Change — who, unlike their predecessors, have been exposed to free media, democracy and a variety of cultures. Batkhuyag also credits the media with helping spread the organization's message.

""Because of Facebook or social media, we can spread or disseminate our information to all the young people,"" she says.

Budee Mendbayar decided to join after learning about the organization's Professional Women Leadership Program on Facebook. At university, Mendbayar, now 33, remembers how only the female students were expected to stay after to clean the classroom. Later, when working for the government, she noticed the same trend. Women were always asked to make coffee and tea no matter their position. The men, she says, were never expected to help out.

""I felt it was not right, but it's hard to tell them it is not right because it is already tradition, already accepted culture,"" she says.

Batchimeg Batsuren is more than a decade younger than Budee, just 22, but she too recalls being treated differently because of her sex. As a child she was made to clean up while her brothers went out to play, a role that she was told would prepare her for marriage. She joined Women for Change after reading Sheryl Sandberg's 2013 hit book Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. Dressed in a purple hoodie and jeans, she loves to talk about soccer. In addition to being the group's project officer she coaches a local male soccer team and can frequently be found watching local and international games. People question why a woman is interested in the sport, she says, but she shrugs off the comments.

Bolormaa Mashlai, chairwoman for the non-government organization Women Leader Foundation, belongs to a different generation. Instead of partial nude art photographs, her office features a framed picture of Margaret Thatcher. At 50, Mashlai favors skirt suits and wears her shoulder length hair in a sensible ponytail. Her English is self-taught and heavily accented. In 2005 she became the first head secretary of the newly created National Committee on Gender Equality. She filled the role again from 2012 to 2015. While she appreciates Women for Change, she admits it is not aimed at her generation, which is more conservative and traditional. The current movement is being shaped by women who have been influenced by social media and exposure to other cultures through language and the Internet.

""They have open eyes and are discussing women's right more,"" she says.

In the four years she has been in the country, UNFPA Mongolia representative Naomi Kitahara has also noticed an openness and sense of hope in the younger generation that came of age after the fall of communism.

""They're flexible in their thinking,"" she says. ""They have that energy of trying out new things.""

Mendbayar credits the group itself for part of that confidence. When she lost her government job after the election of a different party, a common occurrence here, she also lost her confidence. The women in the organization helped her gain the confidence she needed to find a new job as a development specialist at a mining company.

""Now I can say, 'Yes, I can do that.' Because even if I fail, I have the community. I have my sisterhood, they can support me,"" she says.

Jenkins, with UNFPA, has met a number of young women that he says have been emboldened by Women for Change's actions: ""Like in every culture, for every women's movement, each generation takes it a step further.""

African asylum seekers in Italy are becoming artists — and it's not only helping them cope with the trauma they've been through but also introducing their stories to the local community.

In Europe's migration crisis, Italy is ground zero. More than 500,000 migrants have arrived, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, since 2014.

Despite a smaller flow this summer, anti-migrant sentiment is growing.

But in the Umbrian town of Trevi, population 8,372 as of January 1, a project called Make Art Not Walls is helping asylum seekers assimilate.

Municipal authorities have assigned all of the town's 55 African asylum seekers to a former hotel, where for the last several months, a storeroom in the back has been serving as an artists' studio, funded by the Italian charity ARCI.

The Make Art Not Walls project is the brainchild of a longtime Trevi resident, Australian artist Virginia Ryan. With the help of a few other volunteers, Ryan aims to bring out the human potential and restore dignity to people stranded in limbo.

Making art, she tells migrants, is a form of therapy.

""The same courage that you apply to coming through the Sahara, arriving in Libya, getting on the boats, getting here, that courage can be also employed when you take up a pencil and you have a white sheet of paper and manage to make a mark on that,"" she says.

Exuberant, brightly colored paintings line the walls of the studio. Large paper drawings have been rolled up around cardboard tubes — giving the impression of humorous totem poles.

Materials like paper, paints and colored pencils are donated by shops and businesses. Recycled materials are in evidence, including the wood panels on which some art is painted.

Most of the art depicts domestic scenes and portraits. But some budding artists have turned their personal dramas into visual stories.

One of the most accomplished is a nine-panel series by Benjamin Raphael. Before leaving home on his long voyage out of Nigeria, the 26-year-old salesman had never picked up a paint brush.

Pointing to the first panel — in which a young man with a backpack waves goodbye to an older man, representing his uncle — Raphael says: ""This is my voyage, this is the beginning, when I left my country.""

The following panels show a few men crammed into bus, then on a motorcycle, and then piled into a truck, their faces covered with scarves for protection against the desert sand as they cross into Libya.

The fifth panel shows terrified, exhausted men held behind bars by criminal gangs.

""If you are not lucky, you might be caught, maybe by police or a group of bad people, the Libyan people that are bad put you in a cage to demand ransom for your release,"" Raphael says.

After relatives pay a ransom, Raphael explains, the men are packed like sardines into a car trunk and taken to the coast. On the beach, they're told to inflate a rubber dinghy, carry it into the sea, pile in and, in the last panel, sail northward to Europe.

Eight hours after setting to the sea on his own voyage, now committed to canvas, Raphael and his mates were rescued by the Italian Coast Guard. It took him eight months to paint these memories of his voyage.

""It was hard, very painful,"" he says of depicting the journey in art. But, he says ""Virginia told me 'You have to create something for yourself, have to be effective, do something.' That is how it came about.""

In Guinea, Zacob Camara, 29, worked as a mason. His art in the studio depicts colonialism's effect on his homeland.

""We have heroes, people who fought for our liberation,"" Camara says.

He points to his whimsical painting: a man in white on horseback, floating above a yellow desert, two half-moon crescents in the starry sky. It could be a Chagall — transplanted to Africa.

Camara's painting is an attempt to show that during Colonial times, oppressed Africa and Africans had their own heroes — freedom fighters. His painting, he says, is a ""positive"" response to the harm caused by colonialism.

While organizers says they don't have a record of how many locals have seen the art works, about 200 townspeople attended a showing of a documentary on the project called The Art Of Migration at a large church in Trevi on September 16.

Federica di Marco, one of Trevi's residents, says the migrants have given as much to her as she has to them. She's been teaching some of the refugees Italian.

""It's been emotionally draining,"" she says. ""I've connected with their stories, their voyage, their suffering, you live through it all. It's been a very significant experience for me.""

According to Italian law, migrants cannot work while seeking asylum. With no control over their future, the Trevi migrants are grateful for the opportunity to do something with their time and learn new skills.

And who knows, maybe one of them will emerge as the Matisse or Chagall of this African diaspora.",,,

In a wealthy suburb in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, a group of young Pakistanis veered between laughter and distress as they played a board game that echoed their lives in both funny and painful ways.

The name of the game is ""Arranged"" and the goal is to avoid at all costs an arranged marriage – and the matchmaker who sets them up. She's known as Rishta Aunty, slang in Urdu and Hindi for a certain kind of middle-aged, busybody matchmaker who knows all the single men and women.

To stay out of her grasp in the game, you draw cards that tell you how many spaces to move. It'd be a good thing if you get a card that tells you to act scandalously according to the conservative standards of South Asia. Because that would be a dealbreaker.

""You are in the contraceptive aisle of a pharmacy! Run before somebody sees you!"" reads Ahmed. Since tradition has it that women aren't meant to have sex before marriage, shopping for contraception definitely put you on a matchmaker's ""do not match"" list.

""The Aunty moves five spaces away from you,"" Ahmed continues. ""Thank God.""

The inventor of the game is Nashra Balagamwala, 24, who studied game design at Rhode Island School of Design.

One night she began listing the ways she deflected pressure from matchmakers to meet a man. She tried to make herself as ineligible as possible.

She wore a fake wedding ring. She pretended to have a boyfriend. She got a tan, in a country where pale skin is prized.

""I was like, my life has been a struggle to run away from the matchmaker!"" laughed Balagamwala.

And then she had a eureka moment: ""I turned it into a lighthearted game of running away from the matchmaker!""

Lighthearted, yes. But the board game ""Arranged"" is also darkly funny as it skewers the South Asian tradition of arranged marriage.

In Pakistan, the tradition is for parents to put forward a marriage candidate. Their children are expected to agree. The ideal woman is young, pale, slim, meek, educated and moneyed — and from a good family. An ideal man has an MBA and a foreign passport. Marriages fuse families together, not just individuals.

For most women, ""omnipresent in their lives is the expectation that they will get married at a young enough age that they can start having children,"" says Bina Shah, a feminist writer.

Even if women don't want to, ""we have been raised in such a way that we feel obligated to our parents,"" Shah says. ""There's the emotional blackmail: You're going to give me a heart attack! What is the family going to say?""

In the game, while some cards help players evade Rishta Aunty, other cards force them to move closer to her by making them conform to South Asian standards of what makes a good, demure wife. And every player — even the guys — is a potential bride.

""Your rotis are perfectly round,"" read another player, Rabia, referring to homemade flatbread that is a staple of Pakistani meals. The Rishta Aunty — a smiling, rotund cardboard figure of a woman on the game board — inched six spaces closer.

""Oh God!"" she cried, visibly distressed.

""Arranged"" hit a nerve on Kickstarter, where Balagamwala raised $21,788, far more than the $6,000 she sought. It was enough for her to start producing the game. It will go on sale in Pakistan in December.

And there's an unexpected prize for Balagamwala.

When the game makes its debut, she says with a laugh, ""I essentially become the least eligible lady. Now I can go and marry whoever I want!""

What would a Rishta Aunty say to all this?

For 36 years, Mumtaz Qureishi has arranged marriages for the rich and powerful. In her apartment on a recent day, two women who work for her were answering four black landlines and buzzing mobile phones.

They frequently flipped through binders. One was simply titled ""Doctors."" Another was titled ""Overage"" –- it means women over 30. They were crammed with detailed application forms that demand excessive detail: Education. Province. Religious sect. Caste. Employment. Phone number. Marital status: single, divorced or widowed. Father's job. Siblings. Address.

And then: appearance. Qureishi fills that section out herself, grading the women A, B, C.

The As, are white. ""Fair complexion,"" she says. ""Tall, slim, smart,"" she says.

She says its what future mother-in-laws want in a bride — and they usually select women for their sons.

But there's a broader, quiet shift going on in this conservative country. In urban areas of Pakistan, about half all marriages are no longer strictly traditional, says Naeema Saeed, a professor in sociology at Karachi University.

She calls them ""arranged-plus-love.""

Her research showed the trend now is for men and women to meet before they marry.

Then the man asks his parents to set up the match — a nod to tradition without being totally traditional.

The new approach reflects a society where social media is connecting people, where women are studying and working alongside men. Women are earning their own money, empowering them to make more independent decisions, she says.

It's a quiet negotiation, not dramatic change, says Shah, the feminist writer. ""In Pakistan our way of obstacles is not to smash through them but to go around them.""

And even a Risha Aunty can't buck the tide. On a wall of Qureishi's office, there are family wedding photos. She points to her son, beaming beside his wife.

He picked out his own bride — putting his mother out of a job.",,,

""Once upon a time, I was a child,"" says Zannah Mustapha. And a fortunate one, at that, adds the 58-year-old Nigerian lawyer.

This is not the case for many young people today in his city of Maiduguri, the capital of Nigeria's Borno State — and the epicenter of the Boko Haram insurgency.

An estimated 1 million kids have been displaced, and too many of them have lost their parents to violence.

Mustapha's response? ""I have to protect them.""

On Monday, Mustapha was honored in Geneva with the U.N. Refugee Agency's Nansen Refugee Award in recognition of the school he founded — which now enrolls 540 needy children from families on both sides of the conflict — and for his ongoing efforts as a mediator.

""The work Mustapha and his team are doing is of the utmost importance, helping to foster peaceful coexistence and rebuild communities in northeastern Nigeria,"" the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a press release.

Mustapha's ability to negotiate with leaders of the Boko Haram terror group has already helped secure the release of 103 kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls. The seeds of these successes were planted a decade ago, when Mustapha created the Future Prowess Islamic Foundation School in February 2007 to serve orphans and the poor. Children from ages 3 to 8 attend.

""What happened is we started teaching in my own house,"" he says. There was just one teacher for that first class of 36 students. They have since gone on to graduate from secondary school and enter university, Mustapha proudly notes.

Initially, Mustapha personally funded the project. He's since turned to additional donors and volunteers to help keep it going.

Demand grew sharply after the 2009 Boko Haram uprising. In the aftermath, Mustapha says, ""children were cast out on the street."" No matter whether they were the kids of Boko Haram fighters, Nigerian security forces or others, their education was at risk.

Mustapha also recognized the needs of women who had been turned into widows.

""When a husband dies, almost all wives are as vulnerable as orphans because they don't have any livelihood,"" he says.

So the scope of the school widened. To ensure kids weren't coming to class on empty stomachs, a free meal program was introduced. Students also started receiving free clothes and health care.

Widows, many of whose children attend the school, were invited to join an associated cooperative that offers free psychotherapy and training programs to help them get back on their feet. They're taught to make products, such as soap, shoes, jewelry, clothes and food, to be sold at local markets. These mothers, and other family members, have played a key role in shaping how Future Prowess operates. All decisions — including what the kids study, wear and eat — are made through a collaborative process.

In the conflict, these families may be on opposing sides, but at the school, there is a single, unified front.

""We put inclusiveness in every aspect of what we do,"" explains Mustapha, who credits this strategy with keeping his students safe.

Although more than half of the schools in Borno have been shuttered, as UNICEF reported last week, Mustapha says there's never been a threat to Future Prowess.

No wonder Mustapha thinks conflict resolution is one of the most important skills in the curriculum. At Future Prowess, he says, kids learn about accommodating others — even if they come from different backgrounds.

""It has greatly enhanced the school, because the children are integrated,"" he adds. To him, it's one big family. ""I feel these students are like my brother's children."" Mustapha has enrolled his own kids at Future Prowess and asks volunteers to do the same.

Despite how much Mustapha has already accomplished, he's hoping to do more. He's recently established another program for teenagers who missed out on the chance to go to school when they were younger.

""What do we do with these students? Put them in primary school? Or secondary school? So now we are trying a livelihood training center,"" he says.

Mustapha has also donated one-third of his family's farmland to displaced people.

""When places were taken over by the insurgents, they had to run, and they came here,"" he says. ""I felt I didn't need that much land for me.""

And as for the $150,000 that comes with his U.N. award? Mustapha is happy to use it to help more children.

Giving away his time and possessions, he says, hasn't been a difficult decision for Mustapha.

""I have seen the extent of the damage — and the magnitude of war,"" he says.

Last weekend's massacre in Las Vegas is only the latest reminder of the persistent gun violence in the United States. And a new set of statistics on the rates of gun violence unrelated to conflict underscores just how outsize U.S. rates of gun deaths are compared with those in much of the rest of the world.

Take countries with the top indicators of socioeconomic success — income per person and average education level, for instance. The United States ranks ninth in the world among them, bested only by the likes of Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Iceland, Andorra, Canada and Finland.

Those countries all also enjoy low rates of gun violence, but the U.S. has the 31st highest rate in the world: 3.85 deaths due to gun violence per 100,000 people in 2016. That was eight times higher than the rate in Canada, which had .48 deaths per 100,000 people — and 27 times higher than the one in Denmark, which had .14 deaths per 100,000.

The numbers comes from a massive database maintained by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which tracks lives lost in every country, in every year, by every possible cause of death. The figures for 2016 were released just last month. As in previous years, the data paint a fairly rosy picture for much of the world, with deaths due to gun violence rare even in many countries that are extremely poor — such as Bangladesh and Laos, which saw .16 deaths and .13 deaths respectively per 100,000 people.

Prosperous Asian countries such as Singapore and Japan boast the absolute lowest rates, though the United Kingdom and Germany are in almost as good shape.

""It is a little surprising that a country like ours should have this level of gun violence,"" says Ali Mokdad, a professor of global health and epidemiology at the IHME. ""If you compare us to other well-off countries, we really stand out.""

Loading...

To be sure, there are quite a few countries where gun violence is a substantially larger problem than in the United States — particularly in Central America and the Caribbean. Mokdad says a major driver is the large presence of gangs and drug trafficking. ""The gangs and drug traffickers fight amongst themselves to get more territory, and they fight the police,"" says Mokdad. And citizens who are not involved are often caught in the crossfire.

Loading...

Mokdad said drug trafficking may also be a driving factor in two Asian countries that have unusually large rates of violent gun deaths for their region: the Philippines and Thailand.

Loading...

With the casualties due to armed conflicts factored out, even in conflict-ridden regions such as the Middle East, the U.S. rate is worse than in all but one country: Iraq.

Loading...

The U.S. gun violence death rate is also higher than nearly all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, including many that are among the world's poorest.

Loading...

One more way to consider this data: The IHME also estimates what it would expect a country's rate of gun violence deaths to be based solely on its socioeconomic status. By that measure, the U.S. should only be seeing .79 deaths per 100,000 people — almost four times less than its actual rate of 3.85 deaths per 100,000.",,,

The Trump administration will scuttle an Obama-era clean power plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, made the announcement in Hazard, Ky., on Monday, saying the rule hurt coal-fired plants.

""The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy,"" Pruitt said, speaking at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

""That rule really was about picking winners and losers,"" the EPA administrator said, adding that the rule change would be signed on Tuesday.

The announcement had been anticipated. It would eliminate the Clean Power Plan that was put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore never implemented.

A draft document obtained by NPR and other outlets says the administration will also issue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ""in the near future"" to take comments on whether and how it should replace the CPP.

According to The Associated Press, the EPA is ""expected to declare the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet.""

Coal-fired power plants generate roughly 40 percent of the electricity globally, but generate more than 70 percent of the carbon dioxide, according to the International Energy Agency.

The vast majority of scientists worldwide say that carbon dioxide is a leading contributor to climate change. President Trump, however, has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by China to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive, but he also said he had an open mind toward efforts to control it.

In June, Trump announced that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Accord, an international agreement that set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions. At the time, the president said staying in the deal, which is aimed at capping average global temperature increases, ""could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025"" and would cause the loss of close to $3 trillion in GDP.

However, the claims of potential job losses have been disputed by economists and climate scientists.",,,

Updated at 1:50 a.m. ET

Hurricane Nate made landfall for the second time early Sunday, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. The National Weather Service said radar data showed it hit near Biloxi, Miss., around 12:30 a.m. local time.

It first made landfall near mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 mph at about 8 p.m. ET Saturday, the National Hurricane Center says.

Earlier in the evening the storm had been gaining strength and speed over the Gulf of Mexico and was expected to make landfall along the central U.S. Gulf Coast as a Category 2.

""It is moving at an extremely fast rate,"" said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards at a briefing Saturday, ""almost unheard of for a storm of this type.""

In its 1 p.m., CT advisory, the National Hurricane Center said the storm was located about 100 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and headed north-northwest at 25 mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph.

""This is a very strong storm,"" Edwards said.

He asked that residents be prepared to ride out the storm by 3 p.m. local time Saturday and to keep off the roads. That was five hours earlier than the time Edwards had requested a day earlier.

A hurricane warning is in effect from Grand Isle near the southern tip of Louisiana stretching to the Alabama-Florida border, including metropolitan New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

""Everybody in this area needs to prepare for hurricane-force winds,"" said Mike Brennan, senior hurricane specialist with the NHC, adding, ""we are very concerned about storm surge.""

A storm surge warning covers much of the region, including around Lake Pontchartrain in the New Orleans area. Forecasters said floodwaters could reach 11 feet above ground level, ""so that is life-threatening,"" Brennan said.

""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,"" the NHC said in its advisory.

Grand Isle is under a mandatory evacuation, as are parts of New Orleans. Other parts of southeastern Louisiana are voluntary evacuation areas. Edwards said emergency shelters are open in every parish where evacuations have been called.

""It is critical that everyone told to evacuate do it now,"" Edwards said at the noon briefing, local time Saturday. He said that three-quarters of hurricane fatalities are caused by water and that motorists could be fooled by deceptively deep water.

A mandatory curfew begins at 7 p.m. Saturday in New Orleans and lasts ""until the risk has passed,"" said the city police department in a statement.

Officials in Mississippi recommended evacuations for all low-lying areas and for people living near waterways and in mobile homes.

Meantime, Hurricane Nate has put the central Gulf economy at a standstill, NPR's Debbie Elliott reports for Weekend All Things Considered.

""Not only are businesses closing and boarding up, but shipping and oil and gas production is halted. The U.S. Coast Guard has closed all the major ports in the region — including New Orleans, Gulfport, Pascagoula, Mobile and Pensacola,"" Debbie says.

The hurricane response team at the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement issued a statement saying that offshore oil and gas operators in the Gulf of Mexico have evacuated platforms and rigs in response to Hurricane Nate. Personnel from some 301 production platforms (40.84 percent of the 737 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico) have been evacuated.

The statement says:

""From operator reports, it is estimated that approximately 92.34 percent of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in, which equates to 1,615,966 barrels of oil per day. It is also estimated that approximately 77.01 percent of the natural gas production, or 2,479.64 million cubic feet per day in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in.""

Facilities will be inspected after the storm has passed.

On Friday, President Trump approved an emergency declaration for Louisiana, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts.

The governors of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have all declared states of emergency ahead of the storm.

""Regardless of where the storm makes actual landfall, we face the possibility of widespread power outages and storm surge flooding,"" Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said in a statement. ""I ask everyone to please have a plan, especially those that live in mobile homes and low-lying areas.""

Earlier in the week, Nate was a weaker tropical storm, but heavy wind and rain and subsequent flooding were blamed for several deaths in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.

In a few months, AOL Instant Messenger will go the way of such tech touchstones as AltaVista and Netscape. It was 20 years ago that ""AIM"" went online. It quickly exploded in popularity, peaked and then slowly succumbed to competitors.

For many of us, AIM conjures up memories of dial-up modems, the sound of a ""handshake"" and the phrase ""You've Got Mail.""

""AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,"" says Michael Albers, vice president of communications product at Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications that brought AOL and Yahoo together into a single unit earlier this year.

On Twitter, a social media platform that in no small way contributed to AIM's demise, people seemed a bit nostalgic but not terribly surprised.

""You likely remember the CD, your first screenname, your carefully curated away messages, and how you organized your buddy lists,"" Albers says. ""In the late 1990's, the world had never seen anything like it. And it captivated all of us.""

In fact, by 2001, AIM had captivated about 100 million of us worldwide, but as Techcrunch.com writes:

""It battled for supremacy with competitors like ICQ, and messengers from Yahoo and Microsoft MSN. But eventually text messaging, Google's GChat and Facebook took over, while AIM never fully figured out the shift to mobile. That led to AOL's fall from grace, going from being valued at $224 billion in today's money to just $4.4 billion when it was sold to Verizon in 2015. For context on the business AOL let slip away, WhatsApp sold that same year to Facebook for more than $19 billion.""

""We know there are so many loyal fans who have used AIM for decades; and we loved working and building the first chat app of its kind since 1997,"" AOL writes on the AIM help page. ""Our focus will always be on providing the kind of innovative experiences consumers want. We're more excited than ever to focus on building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products.""

If you still have an AIM account, you can keep using it until December 15. After that, you will no longer be able to sign on.",,,

Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein is taking a leave of absence from his company following a New York Times story that he sexually harassed female assistants, executives and actresses for decades. The Times report also says Weinstein settled complaints with at least eight women.

Weinstein is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood. He co-founded Miramax, which has produced such Academy Award-winning films as Pulp Fiction, Chicago, The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love. He and his brother, Bob, head The Weinstein Co. Along with movies, the Weinsteins have produced a number of Tony Award-winning shows on Broadway.

Harvey Weinstein is also known for his temper and, the Times story says, his inappropriate behavior toward women has been discussed within his companies for years. The story begins with actress Ashley Judd being invited to what she thought was a business breakfast with Weinstein at the Peninsula Hotel in Los Angeles. Instead, she says, she was sent to his room where he asked her to give him a massage or watch him shower.

""How do I get out of the room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein?"" Judd is quoted as saying in the article.

Weinstein released a statement in response to the allegations. He apologizes for some of his behavior by saying that times have changed since he began in the movie business:

""I came of age in the 60's and 70's, when all the rules about behavior and workplaces were different. That was the culture then. I have since learned it's not an excuse, in the office — or out of it. To anyone. I realized some time ago that I needed to be a better person and my interactions with the people I work with have changed. I appreciate the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.""

At the same time, one of Weinstein's lawyers, Lisa Bloom, released a statement saying ""he denies many of the accusations as patently false.""

Weinstein says he will take time to ""conquer his demons."" He also says he will use the time to fight the National Rifle Association. Weinstein is a longtime donor to Democratic candidates and liberal causes.",,,

The 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry has been awarded to researchers Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson for their work that developed cryo-electron microscopy, which the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences says ""both simplifies and improves the imaging of biomolecules.""

Speaking to the prize committee by phone Wednesday morning, Frank said he had thought the chance of him winning the prestigious honor was ""minuscule.""

He added that cryo-electron microscopy ""is about to completely transform structural biology,"" saying the technology is being taken up by a new generation of medical researchers.

The academy adds that the advance ""has moved biochemistry into a new era"" and provided new ways of seeing complex structures and operations within human cells at a never-before-seen level of resolution.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP/Getty Images

The recent spike in Zika cases hinted at that new era. The Swedish academy noted that the technology was used to create three-dimensional images of the virus and its proteins at atomic resolution — ""and researchers could start searching for potential targets for pharmaceuticals.""

Dubochet is affiliated with the University of Lausanne, in Switzerland; Frank is affiliated with Columbia University in New York; Henderson is affiliated with the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, U.K.

Here's how the Academy describes their accomplishments:

""Electron microscopes were long believed to only be suitable for imaging dead matter, because the powerful electron beam destroys biological material. But in 1990, Richard Henderson succeeded in using an electron microscope to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at atomic resolution. This breakthrough proved the technology's potential. ""Joachim Frank made the technology generally applicable. Between 1975 and 1986 he developed an image processing method in which the electron microscope's fuzzy twodimensional images are analysed and merged to reveal a sharp three-dimensional structure. ""Jacques Dubochet added water to electron microscopy. Liquid water evaporates in the electron microscope's vacuum, which makes the biomolecules collapse. In the early 1980s, Dubochet succeeded in vitrifying water – he cooled water so rapidly that it solidified in its liquid form around a biological sample, allowing the biomolecules to retain their natural shape even in a vacuum.""

With the award, seven Americans have now been honored among the nine researchers who have been recognized so far in the 2017 Nobel season. Toward the end of Wednesday's event, a journalist from Chinese radio asked Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences Secretary General Göran K. Hansson about the prevalence of Americans, and what it says about U.S. research environment and policies.

In his reply, Hansson said:

""The United States has, since the Second World War, allowed scientists to perform fundamental research, to focus on important questions in science — not forcing them to immediate applications, not controlling them in a political way. And that freedom, combined with very good resources, has been very helpful to the United States.""

He added, ""But it's not unique to the United States.""

Tropical Storm Nate was declared a hurricane late Friday night as it continues to make its way toward the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is bracing for a potential direct hit Sunday.

Nate is currently a Category 1 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.

The storm has already unleashed heavy rain and flooding over parts of Central America, where several people have died.

In Nicaragua, the death toll reached at least 11 on Thursday, while thousands of people had to evacuate their homes and several others were reported missing, according to Vice President Rosario Murillo. Nate follows nearly two weeks of heavy rain that has saturated the ground there, reports The Associated Press. Murillo said the recent rainfall is not part of Nate's storm system.

In Costa Rica, officials blamed the storm for at least seven deaths, the AP says. Schools across the country were suspended Thursday because of heavy rainfall.

In Honduras, two young people drowned in a swollen river, and in neighboring El Salvador, a man was killed in a mudslide, reports Reuters.

Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida are at risk. A hurricane warning was issued Friday night for parts of Louisiana, including New Orleans, and stretching east to the Florida-Alabama border.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency Thursday in anticipation of Nate's arrival and is asking President Trump to declare ""a pre-landfall state of emergency.""

At a briefing, Edwards said Louisiana is expected to take a direct hit early Sunday morning, but parts of the state could feel the force of the winds by Saturday evening. Edwards said rainfall could reach 6 inches in some areas, with storm surge of up to 6 feet.

It has been a devastating hurricane season, and Nate is an unwelcome reminder that it is not over yet. The season continues until the end of November.

Louisiana National Guard soldiers have been helping with recovery efforts in Puerto Rico in Hurricane Maria's aftermath. Now more than 1,000 state guardsmen have been mobilized ahead of Nate, some in New Orleans to monitor drainage pumps, which have already undergone damage.

""We don't anticipate that this is going to cause devastating impact to New Orleans or exceed the ability for the pumps or the electrical generation down there to pump out that water,"" Edwards said. But he added, ""I'm not going to tell you I am not concerned.""",,,

But Rogers, a New York City bartender, has also got plenty of flair (not to mention hair!). His goofy contestant intro segments are far from the stiff pose and awkward smile that have become a mainstay of America's Favorite Quiz Show. In one, he pretends to be talking on a phone; in another, he shifts to profile and mimes opening a bottle.

Whenever he gets an answer correct, he breaks into what he describes as ""celebratory histrionics.""

And to top it all off, he bets big!

Some say he's the best thing to happen to the game show since IBM's Watson trounced its human Jeopardy! opponents six years ago. Rogers has even spawned his own trending hashtag, #austinonjeopardy.

""He's got hair; he's got chutzpah. He's got broad-based knowledge,"" Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek says.

Elsewhere, Rogers has been described as a cross between actor Zach Galifianakis and Martin Prince, the teacher's pet character from The Simpsons.

Shorn of his signature mop-top, Rogers told ABC's Good Morning America on Thursday that he doesn't own a television but nonetheless found ways to watch ""hundreds upon hundreds of episodes"" of the game show in preparation for his first appearance.

""I'm not going to say that there's a system or a code, but if you watch enough, you'll start seeing things repeat,"" he says.

Example? ""If it ever says 'sculptor' it's probably going to be Auguste Rodin. If it ever says 'American sculptor,' it'll probably be Alexander Calder. If it ever says 'Romanian poet,' it'll be Eminescu.""

""I have no idea who Eminescu is, but I've seen that come up three times in episodes across the decades,"" he says.

It began with more than 1,500 books.

With all the works submitted by publishers, the judges for this year's National Book Awards have had their hands (and bookshelves) full the past few months. But that daunting number of contenders winnowed further Wednesday, as the National Book Foundation announced the finalists for its literary prize — just five works each in four categories: fiction, nonfiction, poetry and young people's literature.

You can find those shortlists below, paired with links to NPR's previous coverage for readers to get to know those nominees better.

For now, at least, there are two winners whose names we won't have to wait on: Annie Proulx, who has already won a National Book Award for The Shipping News, will be honored this year with the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, the NBF's version of a lifetime achievement award. And Dick Robinson, president and CEO of Scholastic, will be receiving the Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community.

The rest of this year's winners will be announced on Nov. 15 in New York City.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jeff Chiu/AP Jeff Chiu/AP

The Golden State is about to become a ""sanctuary state.""

California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a bill that places sharp limits on how state and local law enforcement agencies can cooperate with federal immigration authorities, placing California squarely and provocatively in conflict with President Trump and his calls to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.

""These are uncertain times for undocumented Californians and their families,"" the governor said in a signing statement that laid out what the measure will – and will not – do. ""This bill strikes a balance that will protect public safety while bringing a measure of comfort to those families who are now living in fear every day.""

The bill, SB 54 by California Senate President pro tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles), takes effect on January 1st, 2018. In broad terms, it extends local ""sanctuary city"" protections for immigrants living in California without legal documentation. (The governor, De León and some of the bill's backers prefer not to use the term ""sanctuary state"" because they argue it has become politically loaded and there is confusion over its precise meaning.)

Specifically, it bans state and local agencies, excluding the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, from enforcing ""holds"" on people in custody. It blocks the deputization of police as immigration agents and bars state and local law enforcement agencies from inquiring into an individual's immigration status.

It also prohibits new or expanded contracts with federal agencies to use California law enforcement facilities as detention centers, although it does not force the termination of existing contracts – including Orange County's $22 million annual contract with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

""The California Values Act won't stop ICE from trolling our streets. It will not provide full sanctuary. But it will put a kink – a large kink – in Trump's perverse and inhumane deportation machine,"" De León said at a news conference Thursday after Governor Brown signed the bill. ""California is building a wall – a wall of justice – against President Trump's xenophobic, racist and ignorant immigration policies.""

But under a deal struck between De León and Brown, an originally wide-ranging bill was narrowed down to address law enforcement concerns. Compared to previous versions, the final measure expands the list of crimes for which law enforcement can choose to notify and transfer someone to immigration authorities.

The agreement allows federal agents to interview people in custody, and state and local agencies can continue to participate in joint task forces with ICE and other federal agencies. The final legislation also drops an earlier provision that would have banned California law enforcement from sharing their databases for immigration enforcement.

The late amendments led California police chiefs to drop their opposition to the bill and shift their positions to neutral. But, along with Republicans, sheriffs remain the measure's leading critics.

""The bill that is in print now is significantly better than what was there,"" Santa Barbara County Sheriff and California State Sheriffs' Association president Bill Brown told Capital Public Radio last month after the deal with the governor was struck. But Sheriff Brown said, as a result of the new law, ""People who are chronic or serial criminals that just haven't risen to a particular level of crime yet are going to go back out into the community, and people are going to be victimized.""

The Trump administration also slammed the bill signing.

""The State of California has now codified a commitment to returning criminal aliens back onto our streets, which undermines public safety, national security, and law enforcement,"" Justice Department spokesman Devin O'Malley said in a statement. ""Given the multiple high-profile incidents that have occurred in California in recent years, it is especially disappointing that state leaders have made it law to limit cooperation between local jurisdictions and immigration authorities attempting to keep Californians safe.""

But Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez, a Los Angeles immigrant who was detained earlier this year while taking his daughters to school, says the governor's action made him very emotional.

""There will be a lot more tranquility in our community,"" Avelica-Gonzalez said at De León's news conference. ""We're gonna be able to take our kids to school, go visit the doctor, go to courts, with the confidence that we won't be detained.""

SB 54 passed both chambers of the California Legislature last month on the final day of session. All but three Democrats supported the bill, while no Republican voted for it.",,,

Enlarge this image toggle caption Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images

A onetime bank teller in Washington, D.C., stole tens of thousands of dollars from a homeless customer who earned money as a street vendor, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.

Phelon Davis, 29, pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court to a charge of interstate transportation of stolen property, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.

Davis was working as a teller at a Wells Fargo branch in the upscale neighborhood of Georgetown, reports The Washington Post. In October 2014, a longtime bank customer, who was not named in court filings, tried to deposit thousands of dollars from a garbage bag into one of his accounts, but the accounts had gone dormant owing to inactivity.

""In reviewing the customer's accounts, Davis noticed that the customer had a surprisingly large balance,"" according to the U.S. attorney's release. Davis instructed the customer to get identification documents and a Social Security card to reactivate the accounts. Davis then used that information to fraudulently open a new account in the customer's name.

Over the course of two years, Davis transferred money to the new account, using ATMs 144 times and withdrawing a total of $185,440. He used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle, taking vacations to Jamaica, Aruba and Mexico, putting a down payment on his home and paying off personal debt.

The customer, having no access to a computer, was not receiving bank statements and knew nothing of the scam, said the Department of Justice.

Court filings do not say how a homeless person would have so much money. ""That's the million-dollar question,"" Bruce Allen Johnson Jr., Davis' attorney, said outside the D.C. courtroom Thursday, reports the Post.

Court documents also do not show how Davis got caught.

The DOJ says under sentencing guidelines, Davis is likely facing 18 to 30 months in prison.",,,

Enlarge this image toggle caption Mike Albans/The Associated Press Mike Albans/The Associated Press

Media titan S.I. Newhouse Jr., who as the longtime chairman of Condé Nast stood at the helm of some of the nation's most prominent magazines, died Sunday at his home in New York.

He was 89.

""Today is a day of emotion, of genuine loss,"" said his family in a statement. ""Si was always the first person to come to the office, arriving well before dawn and bringing to each day a visionary creative spirit coupled with no-nonsense business acumen.""

Newhouse's father, Samuel I. Newhouse bought the media company Condé Nast in 1959 and his son, also known as Si, took over as chairman in 1975. During his tenure he bought and revamped The New Yorker and Details, while also overseeing cultural heavyweights such as Vogue, Vanity Fair, Glamour and GQ, reports The Associated Press.

Condé Nast falls under the umbrella of parent company Advance Publications Inc., a multi billion dollar media conglomerate, owned by Newhouse Jr. and his brother.

""Si and his brother Donald worked in tandem to build a modern media business— its holdings are in magazines, newspapers, and cable television,"" said Condé Nast CEO Bob Sauerberg, ""but Condé Nast was always Si's focus and obsession. He was responsible for its vision, its international expansion, and its modernity,"" Sauerberg said.

The Newhouse brothers built an empire that became one of the biggest privately-held fortunes in the United States, reports The New York Times, with estimates of the family's fortune topping $12 billion.

Newhouse was known for his extravagance, paying his editors generous salaries and shirking budgets, according to the AP.

But it wasn't all glitter and glamour at the publishing house. In 2009, it announced it was folding numerous magazines, including Gourmet — its then-editor Ruch Reichl tweeting, ""We're all stunned, sad."" The company said the cuts were necessary to navigate through the economic downturn and came after consultants spent months studying how Condé Nast could reduce costs.

But Newhouse also had a knack for hiring some of the industry's most influential editors, who became arguably just as famous as the glossy celebs featured on the pages of their magazines, namely Vogue's Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour.

""Si Newhouse was the most extraordinary leader,"" said Wintour in a statement. ""There was nothing showy about the way Si led though. This humble, thoughtful, idiosyncratic man, possibly the least judgmental person I have ever known, preferred family, friends, art, movies, and his beloved pugs over the flashiness of the New York media world.""

Newhouse told the Times in a 1989 interview that he opted to take a backseat to the vision of his editors. ""I flounder when people ask me, 'What would you do?' ""

""We feel almost that whichever way it goes, as long as it doesn't do something absolutely screwy, you can build a magazine around the direction an editor takes,"" Newhouse said.

Born in Staten Island in 1927, the grandson of Russian Jewish immigrants, Newhouse was a lifelong New Yorker, the AP says. He attended high school in the Bronx and dropped out of Syracuse University during his junior year, before working at his father's newspapers.

Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter wrote that Newhouse died in ""the city he was born in and the one that gave foundation to the empire he built. With his passing, at the age of 89, so goes the last of the great visionaries of the magazine business.""

Newhouse leaves behind his wife, Victoria, two sons and a daughter, reports the AP.",,,

Updated 1 p.m. ET Saturday

President Trump heads to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday and, in a series of tweets early Saturday morning, defended his administration's handling of the recovery effort while hitting back at Carmen Yulín Cruz, the mayor of San Juan.

""The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,"" he wrote.

""Such poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They ... want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.""

Trump went on to blame the media, tweeting, ""The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!""

Cruz took to twitter Saturday after Trump made his remarks. ""The goal is one: saving lives. This is the time to show our 'true colors'. We cannot be distracted by anything else,"" Cruz wrote alongside photographs of relief work on the island.

Tensions over Washington's handling of the recovery effort boiled over Friday as a tearful Cruz said at a press conference, ""We are dying here"" and called on President Trump to put someone in charge of the relief effort who ""is up to the task of saving lives.""

Cruz's comments came after Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke told reporters at the White House on Thursday that the administration's response so far ""is a good-news story in terms of our ability to reach people."" She also said the death toll had been low for a storm the size of Hurricane Maria.

""She said that?"" asked an incredulous Cruz during an interview with CNN.

""Maybe from where she's standing it's a good news story. When you're drinking from a creek, it's not a good news story. When you don't have food for a baby, it's not a good news story. ... I'm sorry but that really upsets me and frustrates me,"" Cruz said.

""Damn it, this is not a good-news story. This is a 'people are dying' story. This is a life or death story,"" she added.

At the news conference on Friday, Cruz said, ""I am done being polite. I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell.""

""If we don't get the food and the water into people's hands what we are going to see is something close to a genocide,"" she said.

At a press conference Saturday, Ricardo Rosselló, governor of Puerto Rico, appeared to defend the Trump administration, although Reuters reports he said he had not seen Trump's Saturday tweets. ""Whatever we have asked for this effort, they have delivered,"" Rosselló said.

But he added that more needs to be done: ""If Congress doesn't take action with a significant package, then we are looking at a possible humanitarian crisis.""

Puerto Rico, home to more than 3 million U.S. citizens, has had limited food, bottled water and medical supplies since Hurricane Maria struck nine days ago. Few buildings have generator-supplied electricity, which is dependent on scarce fuel.

As NPR's Greg Allen and Marisa Penaloza have reported, many hospitals are still shut down. Those that are open are operating on just emergency generator power and can offer very limited services. Some communities are still flooded in parts. The distribution of much needed diesel fuel is hampered by a lack of truck drivers.

So far at least 16 have died, according to The Associated Press.

Perhaps in response to Cruz's impatient retort, Secretary Duke followed a tour of the island with a news conference Friday and said, ""Despite working together, I know that the people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands are suffering.""

""The President and I will not be fully satisfied, however, until every Puerto Rican is back home, the power is back on, clean water is fully available, schools and hospitals are fully open, and the Puerto Rican economy is working,"" said Duke.

In remarks to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump also defended his administration's response to the crisis in Puerto Rico.

""Ultimately the government of Puerto Rico will have to work with us to determine how this massive rebuilding effort — it will end up being one of the biggest ever — will be funded and organized, and what we will do with the tremendous amount of existing debt already on the island,"" said Trump.

""We will not rest, however, until the people of Puerto Rico are safe,"" he added.

Trump, in a tweet earlier this week, first linked the expense of the recovery effort with Puerto Rico's inability to repay more than $70 billion in debt owed to Wall Street.

Still, Cruz, in her CNN appearance, left little doubt that she is looking to the White House for help.

""Mr. Trump, I beg you to take charge and save lives,"" she said.

NPR's Mandalit del Barco spoke to 8-year-old Yan Anthony Hernandez, who is staying at a shelter in the city of Aguadilla on Puerto Rico's northwestern coast. The boy had a message for Trump.

But the holder of the longest tongue on a dog (ever) has Mochi licked. Brandy, a boxer, had a tongue measuring nearly 17 inches, or almost a foot and a half, according to Guinness. She died in 2002.

Rickert said she hopes Mochi's moment of fame can inspire others.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images

High-profile lawyer Lisa Bloom has resigned from advising Hollywood studio head Harvey Weinstein, who was recently accused of sexually harassing female employees for decades.

Bloom announced her departure over Twitter on Saturday afternoon, writing, ""I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein. My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.""

Allegations against the movie mogul have been escalating since The New York Times published a story Thursday that he sexually harassed female assistants, executives and actresses — including Ashley Judd — for more than 30 years.

On Friday, television journalist Lauren Sivan reported that Weinstein trapped her in a restaurant hallway and masturbated in front of her in 2007, according to HuffPost.

Bloom has been under fire since the Times dropped the bombshell story chronicling years of alleged predatory behavior by Weinstein and the payouts that followed the allegations.

Prior to her stint as Weinstein's legal counselor on ""gender and power dynamics,"" Bloom had built her career fighting legal battles on behalf of victims of violence and discrimination. She represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, comedian Bill Cosby and President Trump.

On ABC's Good Morning America on Friday, Bloom explained her role with Weinstein. ""See, you have to understand that, yes, I'm here as his adviser,"" she said.

""I'm not defending him in any sexual harassment cases — there aren't any sexual harassment cases. I'm working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, 'I have caused a lot of pain.' ""

She told The New York Times that she ""saw advising Mr. Weinstein as an opportunity, adding that she felt uniquely positioned to work with him,"" adding: ""Here was an opportunity of a guy saying, 'Lisa, what should I do? I have behaved badly.' I'm like, 'Good, I'll tell you what to do. Be honest, be real.' ""

Weinstein, who is co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, announced Friday that he is taking an indefinite leave of absence immediately.

Bloom and Weinstein have had a prior working relationship: His film studio is planning to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012. The projects are based on a pair of books about the teenager, one of which was written by Bloom.",,,

If you're a cat lover, chances are you know what a Maine Coon is. Commonly referred to as ""the gentle giant,"" the Maine Coon is one of the largest and most social domesticated cats.

So not only was the cat's action a surprise, but it was enough for Perry's boss to wonder if he might quit.

But Perry reasoned, ""It certainly wasn't the worst thing that had happened to me. It wasn't enough to scare me away.""

Perry stuck with it for a full week, at the end of which, his boss asked, ""Well, what do you think?""

""I said, 'I love it,' ""Perry recounts.

Since then, Perry says he has groomed more than 30,000 cats — a job he never would have imagined himself doing just a few short years ago when he was making a thriving livelihood in the construction industry.

Back in the early 2000s in Seattle, Wash., where Perry still lives, he was a housing contractor and business was booming. He says that the work could be grueling, but he was young, and the money was good.

""I feel lucky because I am now finally one of those people that — I do what I enjoy for a living and I am able to maintain a decent lifestyle doing it.""

""I think my favorite part of the whole thing was just kind of hanging out with the guys,"" Perry says. ""You made a lot of friends. We were going out to dinner a lot, getting together, going dirt bike riding, everybody had toys. It was a good time to be in construction.""

But then the housing bubble burst.

""I started getting a feeling about 2008. I was saying that this whole housing bubble couldn't last forever. ... This was the beginnings of things starting to take a turn.""

Soon, it was hard for Perry to get jobs.

""I felt like I was working to make about $12 an hour for work that I used to get $50-60 an hour to do. It was very demoralizing,"" Perry says.

In 2011, Perry said he and his business partner decided it was no longer worth the effort scrounging to find work and only landing low-paying jobs. He said they decided to sell off their assets and get out of the industry.

""I just kind of quit everything and for the first two weeks it was absolutely wonderful; no more headaches, no more phone calls,"" Perry says. ""But sitting home and watching TV in your underwear is only fun for so long. I would say week three and week four, I really started to feel like a loser and then I really started thinking hard about what I was going to do next.""

Cat grooming as difficult as construction

The inspiration for Perry's next career move came from an unexpected place—his own cat, a silver Himalayan named Gizmo.

""She was beautiful. She was one of those cats that got by on her looks,"" Perry says. ""One day, my neighbor was changing his motor oil and she decided to take a nap in the used motor oil pan. She was a mess, so I quickly had to find myself a cat groomer. So, I found one, took her in there. They got her all scrubbed up I watched the process and I was fascinated by it.""

Perry said he'd never even heard of cat grooming until that day Gizmo had that strange accident.

When Gizmo died, Perry went in search of a new cat at Seattle Persian and Himalayan Rescue. But instead of a new pet, Perry stumbled across a new hobby. Finding himself unemployed and job hunting with no prospects, Perry volunteered at the Seattle Persian and Himalayan Rescue and started getting some practical experience in cat grooming.

And that's when he said, ""I started to think, 'Hey, maybe I could do this for a living.'""

By the following year, Perry had started his new life as an entry level cat groomer, and he quickly got plenty of experience, helping to groom 12 to 18 cats a day, five days a week.

""It was quite a grueling [pace]. I would say in the time I worked there, I saw 12 people come and go. Out of those 12, I would say eight of them quit either the first day or within the first week.""

But Perry says he was hooked. By 2015 was a co-owner at Cozy Cat Boarding and Grooming in Seattle.

""I've probably groomed over 40,000 cats now. ... It's a lot,"" Perry says. ""You know, a lot of them are the same cats. I wouldn't say that's 40,000 individual cats. That's cats that come in every few months or quarterly so I groom a lot of cats over and over again.""

Perry, 43, believes that most people have a misconception about what cat grooming is all about.

""A lot of people get into it thinking you get to play with kitty cats all day, which in a sense you do, but it's hard work. I would put it right up there with construction as far as the difficulty of the work,"" he says.

Cats feed off of your energy

Perry insists that one must have a special touch to be successful in the cat grooming business.

""Some people have a gentle touch and some people don't,"" he says. ""I just feel very relaxed around cats, you know. I'm not a hippy-dippy type person, but I definitely believe cats feed off of your energy and if you have a positive, quiet energy, I think the cat senses that and it will just make everybody's life much easier.""

One of Perry's favorite things about the job is bathing the cats, and he offers a special tip.

""I like to wrap them in a little microfiber cloth and then we roll them in the beach towel and we make a little purr-ritto,"" he says.

Perry believes he's found his calling in cat grooming.

""I feel lucky because I am now finally one of those people that — I do what I enjoy for a living and I am able to maintain a decent lifestyle doing it.""

As for that age old question some may be asking, ""Well, how do you bathe a cat?""

The short answer Perry says, ""Quickly.""",,,

High-profile Fox News host Eric Bolling has been suspended after HuffPost reported on Friday that he sent unwanted lewd texts with ""an unsolicited photo of male genitalia"" to at least three female colleagues.

Bolling co-hosts The Fox News Specialists, a daily news and talk show and is the sole host of Cashin' In, a national business analysis program, which airs on Saturday mornings.

According to HuffPost, the women are Bolling's current and former Fox colleagues. The online news site reported that it spoke with 14 anonymous sources in reporting these allegations, and that recipients of the lewd photo confirmed its content.

The law firm Paul Weiss is investigating for Fox and parent company 21st Century Fox.

Bolling's attorney, Michael J. Bowe, tells NPR that the allegations are untrue, that he sent no ""unsolicited"" communication — suggesting but not stating there were consensual exchanges.

Bowe sent NPR this statement:

""The anonymous, uncorroborated claims are untrue and terribly unfair. We intend to fully cooperate with the investigation so that it can be concluded and Eric can return to work as quickly as possible.""

Cashin' In was taped Friday morning as usual but was pulled before its scheduled airtime Saturday 11 a.m. once Fox News Channel was made aware of the allegations via the HuffPost story. The show was replaced by an episode of America's News HQ, a live half-hour of news.

Until further notice, rotating substitute hosts will be in place on Specialists (weekdays at 5 p.m.) and Cashin' In.

Bolling's suspension comes in the backdrop of ongoing sexual harassment lawsuits against Fox and the departures of the late Roger Ailes, former host Bill O'Reilly for similar claims, as well as a raft of departures of top executives. And just last Tuesday, a private investigator filed a defamation suit against Fox, accusing the network of falsifying quotes and promoting a story that favors President Trump. Both Fox and the Trump Administration have refuted these claims.

A Fox News spokesperson issued the following statement:

""Eric Bolling has been suspended pending the results of an investigation, which is currently underway.""

Bolling joined Fox in 2008 after a career as a commodities trader. During his tenure there, he's been known to be a vocal supporter of Trump.",,,

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Conroy/AP Michael Conroy/AP

Updated Monday 8:20 a.m. ET

President Trump on Monday defended Vice President Mike Pence's decision to walk out of Sunday's NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers in Indianapolis.

Trump tweeted, ""The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!""

The president's response comes amid suggestions by some media outlets and on social media that Pence's protest was a publicity stunt engineered by Trump.

The original story continues below

Vice President Pence was so offended by kneeling professional football players that he left a game Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.

""I left today's Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,"" Pence, a former governor of Indiana, said in a statement.

""While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem,"" the statement opposing the protest continued. ""I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.""

But first, the moment was commemorated with a photo of himself and second lady Karen Pence while they stood, hand over hearts, for the anthem.

It appears the choice to leave did not belong to Pence or his wife alone. According to Trump, it was his idea.

""I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country,"" Trump tweeted, adding that he was proud of the couple.

Only members of the 49ers knelt for the rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" — a symbol of protest not against the flag or the song but against institutional social injustice and the violence perpetrated by police against black men. Colts players stood, linked arm in arm.

The controversial practice of kneeling during the anthem was started by former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has yet to be signed to a new team after his contract with the 49ers expired last year.

In an on-camera report on Sunday, CBS reporter Jason La Canfora said Kaepernick would stand for the anthem if he was signed to an NFL team.

""He's not planning on kneeling ... and he's planning on standing for the anthem,"" La Canfora said.

But after the story began making headlines, La Canfora backtracked tweeting, ""Standing for Anthem wasn't something that I spoke to Colin about."" He was merely relaying what had already been reported about Kaepernick in other outlets, La Canfora wrote, adding, ""what he would do during the Anthem I do not know.""

Kaepernick has not denied La Canfora's claim outright, but he has been retweeting others who have responded to the CBS sports reporter. Among them is the quarterback's own girlfriend, Nessa Diab, who wrote, ""The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone.""

CNN on YouTube YouTube

Howard Bryant, an ESPN Magazine columnist, also weighed in on Twitter with what he said was confirmation from Kaepernick.

""Just got a message from @Kaepernick7 who says he has not discussed with anyone his plans in the event he is signed by an NFL team,"" Bryant wrote.

The president has been railing against the NFL over the league's tolerance of the sustained demonstration. Trump has repeatedly called on team owners to fire all players who kneel during the national anthem.

At a campaign rally in Alabama last month, Trump shouted, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now'?"" he said to roaring applause.

The statement by the president, and the subsequent Twitter storm he unleashed, renewed a national debate over players' First Amendment rights and also pitted NFL owners and players against the president, inspiring many of them to kneel or link arms in the game that followed.

By walking out over the kneeling, Pence hasn't just stirred the stoked the flames of the controversy, it has also kicked up a new dust storm: criticism over the cost of the vice president's protest of the protest.

Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz was the first to raise the issue.

""Wait,"" Schatz wrote on Twitter. ""This was orchestrated to make a point? That's not an inexpensive thing to do.""",,,

The 71st annual Tony Awards, which recognizes achievements in Broadway productions, will be held Sunday at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Topping the list of nominees this year, with 12 nods, is the hit musical Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812. It's somewhat based on Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace and has been lauded by critics for its diverse casting, wildly innovative set and fresh take on a classic story.

Written by Dave Malloy, who is also its composer and lyricist, The Great Comet of 1812 is lavish in its staging, and its genre-bending music helps whisk audience into the lives of Moscow's aristocracy. The musical chronicles the misadventures of young, beautiful and very naïve Natasha, played by 25-year-old Broadway newcomer Denée Benton, previously known for her role as Ruby Carter in the Emmy-nominated Lifetime series UnREAL.



Natasha travels to Moscow to wait for her fiancé who is away at war. While there, she falls under the sway of an unscrupulous but handsome nobleman who starts an affair with her for the fun of it. Meanwhile, Pierre, a disillusioned aristocrat, played by multiplatinum recording artist Josh Groban, tries to help save her reputation. And yes, there's a comet. Other than that, it's challenging to explain.

Our industry has a lot of power to change that and represent the truth of what actually exists in the world, which is that there are tons of ingénues walking around on the Earth, of every race.

The musical is directed by three-time Obie Award-winning Rachel Chavkin, who's also artistic director of the Team, a Brooklyn-based theater company. Chavkin and Benton are among the key reasons for The Great Comet's breakout success. For their stellar contributions, both women have been nominated for Tony Awards this weekend.

Chavkin and Benton spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about the epic production that is The Great Comet.

Here are interview highlights

On the guiding principle for directing The Great Comet of 1812

Rachel: I mean, the original north star for the whole production was this night that Dave had in Moscow a number of years ago, where he stumbled at this café, Café Margarita, and there was a classical pops trio playing, and he ended up sitting next to the viola. And there were shakers and dumplings and vodka on the tables. So that story was the spirit that Mimi Lien, our incredible set designer, and I took and ran with. And, so it was very much about creating chaos, but also making sure that every moment of the story was as clear as possible. So there's this huge amount of energy in the room.

On whether she ever had a moment of self-doubt in taking in directing a Broadway musical

Rachel: Sure, of course. I mean, I think that the happy thing is because the project has grown so slowly, you know? Our first production was at Ars Nova in 2012, and that was for a room of 87 seats. And the following spring, we got to take it to a theater that we actually built ourselves in a tent for 199 people. And then, two years later, we went to ART, which was an incredible home to us and allowed us to grow it to what it would be like in a more traditional proscenium theater space. And then, we arrived on Broadway.

So I think because we got it to grow so slowly, by the time we got to Broadway, even though it was midday view. ... I've never, ever known a work better than I know this piece, and I've never known something that I have seen and felt be as emotionally and spiritually effective as I think this work is. So, I went into it really trusting my material and trusting my creative team and my cast, and I don't know how we would've done it without that.

On whether when she was growing up she ever thought she'd be playing a rich Russian countess

Denée: I have to say that I'm probably the one person who did. It was always my dream to be in the center of the stage telling those stories, and it's very ambitious that I would get to this place. So, I'm very thankful because Natasha is the type of character I always saw myself in. I heard her song for the first time, I feel like we were kindred spirits. Our souls just really get each other, so I'm thankful to have had people like Dave and Rachel in the room, who were awake enough to see what I had to bring to this character and who allowed me to pour myself into it.

On whether there was a part of her that she had to release to fully embrace this role as a princess

Denée: It's interesting, I think, that a lot of people are still shocked that that's the culture that we still live in. But it is, and I think that our industry has a lot of power to change that and represent the truth of what actually exists in the world, which is that there are tons of ingénues walking around on the Earth, of every race. I think for me, more than having to release those insecurities, I think it helped me embrace parts of myself that I always knew to be true.

And I think that's been the beautiful part of it. And an extra layer of already getting to do a role that I feel I'm so perfect for is also getting to affect this conversation and affect how other black girls see themselves and how other people see them, and what they feel they're capable of.

Oh what she'd like for people to know about this production

Rachel: The world that we have created inside the Imperial Theater is high and low. It's opulent and luscious but deeply funny and raucous and relaxed. And it really is the world that I personally feel like I want to live inside, always. And that spirit of joy and community that the cast creates with the audience. It's an unbelievable amount of energy and integrity, and it makes space for these moments of really quiet grace.

On what she would say to make to make people come see The Great Comet of 1812

Denée: The heart of the show will move you, and it will make you feel connected to humanity, connected to your humanity. There will be tears. There will be laughter. It really, it hits all of the checkmarks for me into the kind of experience I want to have when I spend that money to sit in a Broadway theater for a couple hours.

Updated at 2 p.m. ET

A tropical cyclone in the northwestern Caribbean Sea has been upgraded to a named storm, Tropical Storm Nate. The system is likely to become a hurricane in the next three days and could hit the northern Gulf Coast on Sunday morning, forecasters say.

""Residents along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana through the Florida Panhandle should monitor the progress of this system and heed any advice given by local officials,"" the National Hurricane Center says.

In an update Thursday, the center said, ""Nate is forecast to be near hurricane intensity when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula late Friday, bringing direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall.""

Nate is showing signs of developing an eyewall. It's also expected to strengthen as it moves over warmer waters on its way to the U.S. coast. But at this point, the National Hurricane Center says, ""it is too early to specify the timing, location, or magnitude of these impacts. ""

Nate is currently bringing heavy rainfall to Nicaragua and Honduras, as it scrapes along their coasts on a northwest track toward Cancun. The storm has triggered flood warnings in those areas, along with a hurricane watch in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, from Punta Herrero to Rio Lagartos.

The cyclone has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, and it's moving northwest at 9 mph. That will change later today, the National Hurricane Center says, when Nate takes a more north-northwestward path and also moves at a faster speed.

By Sunday, Nate's sustained winds are expected to reach 75 mph. While that speed is a far cry from the incredible intensity of recent hurricanes such as Irma and Maria, forecasters say people in Nate's path need to be careful of flash floods and mudslides from its heavy rains.

Powerful winds often attract the most attention and concern regarding cyclones. But it's the water — from both storm surges and rainfall — that's often the most deadly component of a tropical system. The hurricane center warns that Nate will bring 15 to 20 inches of rain to Nicaragua — and that a wide area is at risk, with heavy rainfall expected along the Pacific coast of Central America.

The cyclone's predicted path has shifted to the west since the first NHC advisory went out for Nate's system Wednesday morning. It had once been expected to thread the gap between Mexico and Cuba's west coast, and to make a potential landfall in the Florida Panhandle. The storm is now expected to pass over Mexico's tourism-friendly southern coast, with a potential — and subject to change — landfall forecast along the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi.",,,

Updated at 7:20 a.m. ET

The 2017 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for his pioneering work in behavioral economics.

The announcement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm said the 72-year-old Thaler ""has incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. By exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control, he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes,"" the committee said in a statement.

The relatively new field of behavioral economics studies the effects of psychological, social, cognitive and emotional factors on economic decision-making.

""Human behavior is very complex. So, if we want to construct useful models of economic behavior, we have to make simplifications. One such simplification which has been very important in economics is the assumption that humans behave in a fully rational way and make economic decisions in a way as to maximize their own well-being,"" Per Strömberg, chairman of the prize committee, said.

Over time, Strömberg said, researchers have gathered more evidence from psychology on how humans deviate from rational economic decisions. ""Richard Thaler is a pioneer when it comes to incorporating such insights from psychology into economic analysis,"" he said.

""Thanks to his contributions and discoveries, this new field [of behavioral economics] has gone from being sort of a fringe and somewhat controversial part of economics to being a mainstream area of contemporary economic research,"" the chairman of the prize committee said.

Speaking from his home in the United States to a news conference at the Royal Academy, Thaler said he felt the most important impact of his work was ""the recognition that economic agents are human.""

Thaler is the author of the books Nudge and Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics.

Among Thaler's contributions to the field are his ""theory of mental accounting, explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect,"" the Academy said.

One area singled out by the committee is Thaler's work on retirement savings. He was an early proponent of employers automatically enrolling their workers in 401(k) programs. He also developed a ""Save More Tomorrow"" retirement plan that encourages people to put future salary increases toward retirement.

Kenny Malone of NPR's Planet Money says Thaler is ""a bit of a rock star"" in the field of economics.

""In terms of real-world implications, once you start to understand the ways that we are weird, irrational beings, you can structure policies to move people toward the ends that you would want,"" Malone tells Morning Edition.

Thaler made a cameo in the movie The Big Short, where he explained the ""hot-hand fallacy"" about how someone who has experienced success in something involving random chance has a greater chance of further success going forward.

Asked whether he thought that applied to President Trump, Thaler responded with a chuckle, ""I think he would do well to watch that movie.""

When the same Swedish journalist asked what Thaler would do with the 9-million kronor ($1.1 million) monetary portion of the Nobel award, the economist: ""I will say that I will try to spend it as irrationally as possible.""",,,

The Trump administration will scuttle an Obama-era clean power plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, made the announcement in Hazard, Ky., on Monday, saying the rule hurt coal-fired plants.

""The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy,"" Pruitt said, speaking at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

""That rule really was about picking winners and losers,"" the EPA administrator said, adding that the rule change would be signed on Tuesday.

The announcement had been anticipated. It would eliminate the Clean Power Plan that was put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore never implemented.

A draft document obtained by NPR and other outlets says the administration will also issue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ""in the near future"" to take comments on whether and how it should replace the CPP.

According to The Associated Press, the EPA is ""expected to declare the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet.""

Coal-fired power plants generate roughly 40 percent of the electricity globally, but generate more than 70 percent of the carbon dioxide, according to the International Energy Agency.

The vast majority of scientists worldwide say that carbon dioxide is a leading contributor to climate change. President Trump, however, has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by China to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive, but he also said he had an open mind toward efforts to control it.

In June, Trump announced that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Accord, an international agreement that set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions. At the time, the president said staying in the deal, which is aimed at capping average global temperature increases, ""could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025"" and would cause the loss of close to $3 trillion in GDP.

However, the claims of potential job losses have been disputed by economists and climate scientists.",,,

Another Sunday, another Trump Twitter war.

This time, President Trump, who is spending the day at his golf course in Virginia, took aim at retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee.

And Corker fired back.

""It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center,"" Corker wrote. ""Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.""

Later Sunday in a New York Times interview, Corker said Trump was treating the presidency like a reality show, and could set the nation ""on the path to World War III.""

In what has been widely perceived as an effort to save face, Trump claimed that Corker had ""begged"" the president to endorse him for re-election, but that Trump had turned him down. According to the president, that refusal is what ultimately led to the high-ranking senator's September announcement that he would not seek another term.

""Senator Bob Corker 'begged' me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said 'NO' and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement). He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!""

Trump ended the trash-talking with this: ""Hence, I would fully expect Corker to be a negative voice and stand in the way of our great agenda. Didn't have the guts to run!""

Corker, who is chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, has been increasingly critical of the president in recent weeks, publicly airing his frustration with the dysfunction within the White House.

On Wednesday, he said, ""I think Secretary Tillerson, (Defense) Secretary (Jim) Mattis and Chief of Staff (John) Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos.""

And at a marathon Senate Budget Committee hearing this week, Corker expressed a deep disdain for the political theater of the job. ""I have difficulty putting that much energy into discussing this budget document because this is some of the most meaningless work that we do here,"" Corker said with a sigh. ""It has nothing to do with the chairman or the committee. It's a waste of time.""

Shortly after Trump's Sunday morning tweets, Corker's chief of staff, Todd Womack, rebutted the president's claims, The Washington Post reports. Womack says that it was Trump asking for a favor.

The article states: ""Trump called Corker early last week and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection, according to Womack. He said the president also reaffirmed that he would have endorsed Corker had he decided to run again — which, Womack added, was not the first time that Trump had extended such an offer of support.""

Trump's latest feud with Corker comes at an inopportune time for Republicans trying to pass tax legislation. As NPR's Susan Davis reported, Corker could be a bigger threat to the Republican tax bill than the party realizes.

Just like on health care, Republicans can only lose two votes and still pass a tax bill if no Democrats or independents support it. That is why securing Corker's vote is critical.

But Corker has repeatedly said he views the deficit as the biggest threat to the nation.",,,

The board game character, whose name is Rich Uncle Pennybags, was brought to life by Amanda Werner, an arbitration campaign manager for Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, groups that advocate for consumer rights and protections.

Almost immediately, the monocle, mustache, top hat, pillowcase-sized bag of (#fake) Benjamins became a social media sensation.

The most unlikely viewers tuned in to the Senate Banking Committee hearing to watch Werner troll Smith, who was facing a roomful of angry senators after a hack that may have exposed the personal information of more than 145 million people.

People loved it.

""It was a very calculated move,"" said Werner, who prefers the pronouns ""they"" and ""them,"" adding that it was hilarious to watch the scene become a meme in real time.

Werner mugged and preened for the camera and somehow, in a week dominated by sad and distressing news, gave people what they didn't know they wanted: a delightful reprieve.

Here is how Werner staged the viral protest — without getting kicked thrown out of the Capitol.

An alarm and an intern

Werner has attended a slew of Senate hearings and has even provided pro-consumer rights testimony in some cases. That is how the activist knew that getting on TV is all about location — and staying within the camera's frame.

The problem is that seats in the audience tend to fill up quickly, Werner explained.

""Luckily we have a very dedicated intern here,"" Werner said. ""He showed up at 7 a.m. and held a spot in line for me so that we could get that prime seat."" The one directly behind Smith, who was the target of the grilling.

Apparently, the intern was the first person in line.

During the hearing, Werner followed #MonopolyMan's rise to stardom in real time on a phone. Over Twitter, Werner was able to figure out the best angles as their head floated in and out of the camera's view. At one point Werner peered over Smith's shoulder using the monocle to inspect the back of the millionaire's head; at another point they knowingly stroked the perfectly shaped mustache glued to their face.

Honed tone

Werner set out to garner as much publicity as possible for the type of advocacy work Public Citizen does on behalf of consumers.

""We wanted to do something to get people's attention,"" Werner said of the hours-long photobomb, adding that people's eyes tend to glaze over when anyone utters the words ""forced arbitration.""

Knowing that is the catalyst for coming up with creative protest ideas, Werner explained.

They added that given the somber tone of news coverage around the deadly shooting in Las Vegas this week, the goal was to inject a little humor into public discourse.

""I think this week has been a particularly rough week on the American psyche so I think people needed a little bit of levity,"" Werner said.

It certainly inspired tens of thousands of happy face crying emojis on Twitter and on Facebook.

The decision to go the funny route is in stark contrast the health care protests on Sept. 25 during a hearing on the most recent Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Demonstrators began chanting, delaying the start of the hearing. Fifteen people were arrested and charged with disruption of Congress, according to U.S. Capitol Police. Dozens, staging die-ins in the hallway, were arrested and charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding.

""There are a lot of different methods of protest and they all work for different instances,"" Werner said. ""You have to decide which is the best for your particular situation.""

Ultimately, Werner argued, a good protest leads to action. The notoriety is great to call attention to the cause, they said. But Werner added, ""I hope that the effort [Wednesday] will make people not only laugh at the Monopoly Man and retweet these funny pictures but also to call their senators and tell them to vote no on SJ Res 47.""

The bill would overturn a new rule intended to ban financial service providers, including banks and credit card companies, from using mandatory arbitration clauses to resolve their disputes and avoid class action lawsuits.

Fashion statement, not statement statement

There are certain lines that members of the audience at committee hearings cannot cross. They do not appear to be listed on the Capitol Police website, but here are a few guidelines that Werner has collected.

Wearing a costume? That is allowed.

Werner was a little concerned that the Capitol Police would not allow the top hat, but they didn't give it a second look.

In fact, Werner recalls hearing a story about another demonstrator who dressed as Abraham Lincoln, complete with the beard and requisite foot-long stove pipe hat, and legend has it he was allowed to wear it throughout the proceedings.

Holding up a sign? That is against the rules and can get people thrown out.

Werner knew that going in, but that didn't stop them from briefly holding up a yellow ""Get out of jail free"" card that appeared on screen a few times. ""I didn't hold it up long,"" Werner confessed.

""I was a little afraid that as I was wiping my forehead with the $100 bill or doing other things that were calling a lot of attention to myself, that I might get warned,"" they said.

But the only warning Werner received was for holding a giant bag of money on their lap, which they immediately set on the floor.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Conroy/AP Michael Conroy/AP

Updated Monday 8:20 a.m. ET

President Trump on Monday defended Vice President Mike Pence's decision to walk out of Sunday's NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers in Indianapolis.

Trump tweeted, ""The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!""

The president's response comes amid suggestions by some media outlets and on social media that Pence's protest was a publicity stunt engineered by Trump.

The original story continues below

Vice President Pence was so offended by kneeling professional football players that he left a game Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.

""I left today's Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,"" Pence, a former governor of Indiana, said in a statement.

""While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem,"" the statement opposing the protest continued. ""I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.""

But first, the moment was commemorated with a photo of himself and second lady Karen Pence while they stood, hand over hearts, for the anthem.

It appears the choice to leave did not belong to Pence or his wife alone. According to Trump, it was his idea.

""I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country,"" Trump tweeted, adding that he was proud of the couple.

Only members of the 49ers knelt for the rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" — a symbol of protest not against the flag or the song but against institutional social injustice and the violence perpetrated by police against black men. Colts players stood, linked arm in arm.

The controversial practice of kneeling during the anthem was started by former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has yet to be signed to a new team after his contract with the 49ers expired last year.

In an on-camera report on Sunday, CBS reporter Jason La Canfora said Kaepernick would stand for the anthem if he was signed to an NFL team.

""He's not planning on kneeling ... and he's planning on standing for the anthem,"" La Canfora said.

But after the story began making headlines, La Canfora backtracked tweeting, ""Standing for Anthem wasn't something that I spoke to Colin about."" He was merely relaying what had already been reported about Kaepernick in other outlets, La Canfora wrote, adding, ""what he would do during the Anthem I do not know.""

Kaepernick has not denied La Canfora's claim outright, but he has been retweeting others who have responded to the CBS sports reporter. Among them is the quarterback's own girlfriend, Nessa Diab, who wrote, ""The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone.""

CNN on YouTube YouTube

Howard Bryant, an ESPN Magazine columnist, also weighed in on Twitter with what he said was confirmation from Kaepernick.

""Just got a message from @Kaepernick7 who says he has not discussed with anyone his plans in the event he is signed by an NFL team,"" Bryant wrote.

The president has been railing against the NFL over the league's tolerance of the sustained demonstration. Trump has repeatedly called on team owners to fire all players who kneel during the national anthem.

At a campaign rally in Alabama last month, Trump shouted, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now'?"" he said to roaring applause.

The statement by the president, and the subsequent Twitter storm he unleashed, renewed a national debate over players' First Amendment rights and also pitted NFL owners and players against the president, inspiring many of them to kneel or link arms in the game that followed.

By walking out over the kneeling, Pence hasn't just stirred the stoked the flames of the controversy, it has also kicked up a new dust storm: criticism over the cost of the vice president's protest of the protest.

Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz was the first to raise the issue.

""Wait,"" Schatz wrote on Twitter. ""This was orchestrated to make a point? That's not an inexpensive thing to do.""",,,

By an overwhelming 31-1 vote, NFL owners have approved the Raiders' move from Oakland to Las Vegas — though the team will still remain in the Bay Area for at least the 2017 season and possibly longer.

""My father always said, 'the greatness of the Raiders is in its future,' "" Raiders owner Mark Davis said in a statement Monday, ""and the opportunity to build a world-class stadium in the entertainment capital of the world is a significant step toward achieving that greatness.""

The move — whenever it should inevitably take place — will end the Raiders' on-again, off-again relationship with the team's longtime home. Founded in 1960, the Raiders spent their first two decades as a club in Oakland, notching two Super Bowl titles before they left town for Los Angeles in the early 1980s.

That southern sojourn ended in 1995, when the team returned to the waiting embrace of the city it left more than a decade earlier.

But recently, Davis had appeared to be itching to leave the city once more, going in on a bid with the Chargers to move both teams to Los Angeles — a bid that voted down by NFL owners early last year. The Chargers ultimately did complete a deal to move to LA earlier this year, though.

Now, the Raiders will be joining the Vegas Golden Knights — an expansion ice hockey team recently also approved by the NHL — as the shiny new professional franchises in a city that long had none to call its own.

""It truly is an exciting time to be from Las Vegas,"" Golden Knights chairman and CEO said in a statement, according to ESPN. ""There is only a select group of cities in North America that are home to both an NHL and an NFL franchise and Vegas is now one of them. This alone should be a great source of pride for our community and our fans.""

ESPN noted that the Raiders' star quarterback, Derek Carr, tweeted a statement thick with mixed feelings about the move.

Still, Carr and Co. will have a little while longer to get their things packed — likely years, in fact.

As The Wall Street Journal reports, ""The Raiders have previously said they plan to remain in Oakland until at least 2020"" — partly because the stadium the team intends to share with University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is not expected to be ready until then. And The Washington Post points out the Raiders have a lease on their Oakland stadium that gives them one-year term options for the 2017 and 2018 seasons.

The jury's out on how well this long goodbye will play with the team's Bay Area fan base.

""I just hope that in the future, as we play in Oakland this year, that they understand that it wasn't the players, it wasn't the coaches that made this decision. It was me that made it. And if they have anybody to talk to about it, it should be me,"" Davis said at a news conference.

""And I will, in the coming days, try to explain to them what went into making this difficult decision.""",,,

The National Football League announced three changes to the game on Tuesday, but the one getting most of the attention has to do with end zone celebrations.

For years, the league has limited how players could celebrate following touchdowns, and for how long.

The rules have been loosened for the 2017 season — allowing players to again use the football as a prop, celebrate as a group and roll around on the ground if they like.

Fans have long wanted the NFL to lighten up.

Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters that the moniker ""No Fun League"" had been thrown around since he was an intern in the league office.

Celebration Station is a feature of the NFL Network that shows the weekly top NFL end zone celebrations. NFL Network via YouTube

Goodell also said he was looking forward to seeing what players would do with their newfound freedom of expression.

But the league isn't getting carried away, either. It will still penalize any celebration deemed offensive or in bad taste, including those that embarrass opponents or mimic the use of weapons.

Washington's Josh Norman was fined last season for using a bow and arrow gesture.

The Associated Press reports:

""There is no set time limit on how long such celebrations can continue. But the league is placing an emphasis on speeding up the pace of games. The 40-second play clock will begin once an official signals a touchdown and teams will have to snap the ball for their extra-point play by the end of the clock. ""League officials will review celebrations during the preseason and anticipate providing guidance as the regular season progresses. Former player Jon Runyan, who is in charge of on-field disciplinary actions, will decide the fines. Two other former players, Derrick Brooks and James Thrash will hear appeals for players.""

In Chicago for their annual spring meeting, NFL owners also announced changes to the overtime period and the Super Bowl hosting schedule. Owners cut the overtime period from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for all games.

Coaches were concerned that too many players were exhausted and risked injuries at the end of the extra period. The change will include all preseason, regular season and playoff games — postseason games cannot end in ties.

And the league announced a shift to its upcoming Super Bowl hosting schedule. Tampa, Fla., now has the 2021 game. It was originally scheduled to be played in Los Angeles, but construction of the new stadium in Inglewood, Calif., has endured delays because of unusually wet weather.

LA will now host the Super Bowl in 2022.",,,

Updated at 12:31 a.m. ET Tuesday:

The Oakland Raiders scored two touchdown in the fourth quarter to beat the Houston Texans, 27-20, at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City on Monday night.

Both teams grappled with a major challenge: playing at an elevation 2,000 feet higher than the players have ever confronted.

The game is only the second-ever regular-season NFL game in Mexico. The first was in 2005, also at Azteca Stadium — and at the time, set a record for regular-season attendance.

In the decade since, NFL games have been played in Toronto and London, but not at any other international venues.

""This game is the first of a three-year contract for the NFL to play in Mexico City,"" The Associated Press notes, ""and the league would like it to become an annual event"" — just like it is in London.

USA Today notes that the game might be rough on the players. The elevation at Azteca Stadium is some 7,200 feet (compared to the highest NFL stadium, Denver's Sports Authority Field, which is aptly called the Mile High Stadium — at 5,280 feet). And pollution can make the thin air even harder to deal with. Soccer player Eric Wynalda told the newspaper that Azteca was ""the worst place ever to play.""

But at least both teams — equally unfamiliar with the venue — will be on equal footing. And the thin air will make long-distance field goal attempts easier, reports SB Nation.

The game sold out within minutes, and Mexico City residents — famous for their love for fùtbol — have enthusiasm to spare for American football, too. Over at ESPN, Carlos Alvarez Montero documented a few of the game-celebrating getups of Mexican megafans.",,,

For a week, black NFL players have been under an even brighter spotlight than on any given Sunday and while some families are turning away from the game, others are watching closely.

ROBERT SIEGEL, HOST:

For almost two weeks, black players in the National Football League have been under an intense spotlight during the national anthem, some standing, some kneeling and many of them locking arms with their teammates. The silent protests or demonstrations of solidarity have turned off some fans. But as Tonya Mosley of member station KQED in San Francisco reports, many black families are watching closely.

TONYA MOSLEY, BYLINE: There's one thing you should know about Rob Hughes. He's hopelessly devoted to NFL football. His wife, Jwana, jokes it's his first love.

JWANA HUGHES: Eagles. Since I met him, diehard Eagle fan.

MOSLEY: He has the Comcast RedZone deluxe cable package. It gives him access to every game in the country. On a 60-inch television from the comfort of his living room couch, Hughes even checks his fantasy football online during commercial breaks.

ROB HUGHES: If I could have a TV in my bathroom so I wouldn't have to actually miss a second, I would (laughter).

MOSLEY: But things have been a little different this season. Hughes pays more attention to the top of the game, the national anthem, what players are kneeling and what players aren't. As we jump in the car to grab some snacks before his beloved Philly Eagles play the Los Angeles Chargers, Hughes explains how he sometimes puts himself in the players' shoes.

R. HUGHES: Would I kneel? Would I stand? Would I do the patriotic thing, as I was taught?

MOSLEY: He's not sure. He supports a player's right to protest - no question. And he supports that the protest is against police brutality. Last year, he took his 13-year-old son to Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights Camp in Oakland. At the time, Kaepernick was a quarterback for the 49ers, and he was scrutinized for taking the knee throughout the season during the national anthem.

R. HUGHES: It took a whole lot of heart for that dude to do that. I also think to myself, like, I wonder if he thought that all this would come from just that one act.

MOSLEY: Hughes' son Kelby says Kaepernick's camp was life-changing. He learned stuff like how to talk to and deal with law enforcement. But most of all, Kelby says he learned that he has the right to know his rights. Now when he sits to watch football with his dad, he's thinking about a lot more than a touchdown.

KELBY: Every time I see a game, that reminds me of people who have knelt and people who have at least tried to solve our problems in our country.

MOSLEY: Some of the family's friends are boycotting the NFL by not watching the games. They feel Kaepernick hasn't been hired for political reasons. But Hughes doesn't want to do that.

R. HUGHES: You have to also - what? - boycott everybody that supports them. So I've got to boycott Visa. I've got to boycott Pepsi. I've got to boycott all these corporate entities that also do that.

MOSLEY: Other people are boycotting the NFL for allowing the players to protest during the anthem. This frustrates Hughes's wife, Jwana.

J. HUGHES: It's not about the flag. It's about police brutality. That's the way I take it as.

R. HUGHES: Touchdown. Touchdown.

MOSLEY: This week, the Eagles beat the Chargers. Hughes took note during the anthem as the camera focused on Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins raising his fist. For NPR News, I'm Tonya Mosley in San Leandro, Calif.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images

High-profile lawyer Lisa Bloom has resigned from advising Hollywood studio head Harvey Weinstein, who was recently accused of sexually harassing female employees for decades.

Bloom announced her departure over Twitter on Saturday afternoon, writing, ""I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein. My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.""

Allegations against the movie mogul have been escalating since The New York Times published a story Thursday that he sexually harassed female assistants, executives and actresses — including Ashley Judd — for more than 30 years.

On Friday, television journalist Lauren Sivan reported that Weinstein trapped her in a restaurant hallway and masturbated in front of her in 2007, according to HuffPost.

Bloom has been under fire since the Times dropped the bombshell story chronicling years of alleged predatory behavior by Weinstein and the payouts that followed the allegations.

Prior to her stint as Weinstein's legal counselor on ""gender and power dynamics,"" Bloom had built her career fighting legal battles on behalf of victims of violence and discrimination. She represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, comedian Bill Cosby and President Trump.

On ABC's Good Morning America on Friday, Bloom explained her role with Weinstein. ""See, you have to understand that, yes, I'm here as his adviser,"" she said.

""I'm not defending him in any sexual harassment cases — there aren't any sexual harassment cases. I'm working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, 'I have caused a lot of pain.' ""

She told The New York Times that she ""saw advising Mr. Weinstein as an opportunity, adding that she felt uniquely positioned to work with him,"" adding: ""Here was an opportunity of a guy saying, 'Lisa, what should I do? I have behaved badly.' I'm like, 'Good, I'll tell you what to do. Be honest, be real.' ""

Weinstein, who is co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, announced Friday that he is taking an indefinite leave of absence immediately.

Updated at 1:50 a.m. ET

Hurricane Nate made landfall for the second time early Sunday, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph. The National Weather Service said radar data showed it hit near Biloxi, Miss., around 12:30 a.m. local time.

It first made landfall near mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 1 storm with winds of 85 mph at about 8 p.m. ET Saturday, the National Hurricane Center says.

Earlier in the evening the storm had been gaining strength and speed over the Gulf of Mexico and was expected to make landfall along the central U.S. Gulf Coast as a Category 2.

""It is moving at an extremely fast rate,"" said Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards at a briefing Saturday, ""almost unheard of for a storm of this type.""

In its 1 p.m., CT advisory, the National Hurricane Center said the storm was located about 100 miles south of the mouth of the Mississippi River and headed north-northwest at 25 mph. It had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph.

""This is a very strong storm,"" Edwards said.

He asked that residents be prepared to ride out the storm by 3 p.m. local time Saturday and to keep off the roads. That was five hours earlier than the time Edwards had requested a day earlier.

A hurricane warning is in effect from Grand Isle near the southern tip of Louisiana stretching to the Alabama-Florida border, including metropolitan New Orleans and the Mississippi Gulf Coast.

""Everybody in this area needs to prepare for hurricane-force winds,"" said Mike Brennan, senior hurricane specialist with the NHC, adding, ""we are very concerned about storm surge.""

A storm surge warning covers much of the region, including around Lake Pontchartrain in the New Orleans area. Forecasters said floodwaters could reach 11 feet above ground level, ""so that is life-threatening,"" Brennan said.

""The deepest water will occur along the immediate coast near and to the east of the landfall location, where the surge will be accompanied by large and destructive waves,"" the NHC said in its advisory.

Grand Isle is under a mandatory evacuation, as are parts of New Orleans. Other parts of southeastern Louisiana are voluntary evacuation areas. Edwards said emergency shelters are open in every parish where evacuations have been called.

""It is critical that everyone told to evacuate do it now,"" Edwards said at the noon briefing, local time Saturday. He said that three-quarters of hurricane fatalities are caused by water and that motorists could be fooled by deceptively deep water.

A mandatory curfew begins at 7 p.m. Saturday in New Orleans and lasts ""until the risk has passed,"" said the city police department in a statement.

Officials in Mississippi recommended evacuations for all low-lying areas and for people living near waterways and in mobile homes.

Meantime, Hurricane Nate has put the central Gulf economy at a standstill, NPR's Debbie Elliott reports for Weekend All Things Considered.

""Not only are businesses closing and boarding up, but shipping and oil and gas production is halted. The U.S. Coast Guard has closed all the major ports in the region — including New Orleans, Gulfport, Pascagoula, Mobile and Pensacola,"" Debbie says.

The hurricane response team at the federal Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement issued a statement saying that offshore oil and gas operators in the Gulf of Mexico have evacuated platforms and rigs in response to Hurricane Nate. Personnel from some 301 production platforms (40.84 percent of the 737 manned platforms in the Gulf of Mexico) have been evacuated.

The statement says:

""From operator reports, it is estimated that approximately 92.34 percent of the current oil production in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in, which equates to 1,615,966 barrels of oil per day. It is also estimated that approximately 77.01 percent of the natural gas production, or 2,479.64 million cubic feet per day in the Gulf of Mexico has been shut-in.""

Facilities will be inspected after the storm has passed.

On Friday, President Trump approved an emergency declaration for Louisiana, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate relief efforts.

The governors of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have all declared states of emergency ahead of the storm.

""Regardless of where the storm makes actual landfall, we face the possibility of widespread power outages and storm surge flooding,"" Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant said in a statement. ""I ask everyone to please have a plan, especially those that live in mobile homes and low-lying areas.""

Earlier in the week, Nate was a weaker tropical storm, but heavy wind and rain and subsequent flooding were blamed for several deaths in Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras and El Salvador.

A mom of four with a newborn at home, still out on maternity leave. A husband celebrating his anniversary, taking a bullet for his wife.

Fifty-eight people died in the Sunday night attack on a country music concert on the Las Vegas Strip, not counting the shooter, and more than 480 were injured. It was the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

On Thursday the Clark County Coroner released the official list of those who died.

Here is what we know about them.

This post will be updated with further information about the victims as we learn more. Amy Held, Bill Chappell, Camila Domonoske, Emily Sullivan, Laura Roman, Miles Parks, Nurith Aizenman, Rose Friedman and Scott Neuman reported these stories.

Andrea Castilla, 28, Huntington Beach, Calif.

Castilla was in Las Vegas celebrating her 28th birthday, holding hands with her sister, when the chaos began. She died as a result of a gunshot wound to the head, according to her aunt, Marina Parker, who began a GoFundMe page to raise money for funeral services and other family expenses.

After being shot, Castilla was carried over a fence and out of the festival grounds by her boyfriend, sister, and soon-to-be brother-in-law, who turned a barricade gate into a makeshift stretcher, according to ABC News.

Her cousin, Tom Smith, told CNN that spending time with her family was the ""best part of her life.""

But then another round caught Adrian Murfitt in the neck. "" 'Sadly he died in my arms,' Brian MacKinnon wrote."" Adrian Murfitt's mother spoke to Alaska Public Radio, which relays, ""Murfitt's mother, Avonna, described her son as tall, handsome and shy most of the time. He was a big country music fan and went to the festival annually. This year he was celebrating a successful fishing season.""

Lisa Patterson, 46, Lomita, Calif.

Patterson ""was a mom, who worked with her husband in the family hardwood flooring business in Los Angeles,"" North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann reports. ""She also wanted to be a schoolteacher.""

Remembering Lisa Patterson Listen · 1:44 1:44

Brian spoke to Patterson's daughter Amber, 19, a college student.

""She was the most amazing person. She just cared for people and always put other people first,"" Amber Patterson said.

After the shooting, the family went through a long wait to find out if Lisa Patterson was among the hundreds of people who had been taken to Las Vegas hospitals.

""We didn't know where she was. I was expecting to come here and for her to just be injured, but then we found this out, so it was devastating,"" Amber said.

Mann said Amber was wearing her mother's bracelet — part of the personal effects local authorities had given to the family.

""She was the most beautiful individual,"" Amber said, ""and I'm going to try my hardest to be the best daughter she could ever imagine and take care of my family and I hope she knows that.""

Lisa Patterson had been married to her husband, Bob, for 30 years. She had three daughters — the youngest is 8 years old.

Lisa and Bob Patterson were also supporters and volunteers in the Palos Verdes Girls Softball League.

As KPBS reports, a friend of the couple, Andy Tamilin, wrote on a GoFundMe page that Patterson and her husband ""spent endless hours donating their time and energy to help the girls of our community.""

Jennifer Irvine, 42, San Diego, Calif.

Irvine ""ran a family-law and criminal-defense practice out of an office high-rise near San Diego's El Cortez hotel,"" according to KPBS in Los Angeles.

""My good friend, colleague, and business partner Jennifer Irvine was killed by a madman at the festival in Las Vegas,"" San Diego-area attorney Thomas Slattery wrote on Facebook. ""A tragic loss of a kind, generous, and beautiful lady. She will be greatly missed.""

John Phippen, 56, Santa Clarita, Calif.

Phippen was ""a handsome guy with gray hair and a mustache,"" North County Public Radio reporter Brian Mann reports. ""He was at the music festival with his son Travis, an emergency medical technician. They were dancing when one of the bullets struck John in the lower back.""

Travis Phippen was shot in the arm, but he managed to get his dad out of the venue that was under fire, get him into a car and get him to a hospital. But despite Travis Phippen's efforts to control the bleeding and help his father along the way, John Phippen died.

Brian reports of John Phippen:

""He ran a home repair and remodeling company in Valencia. But really he seems to have been a family man. He had six kids. His youngest daughter is just 14 years old. His friend Leah created a fundraising page for the family on the GoFundMe site and she talks about him just being a good guy — someone who liked to go camping, liked a cold beer, was always willing to help out a friend.""

Michelle Vo, 32, Los Angeles

Vo worked for an insurance company in Southern California and lived in Eagle Rock. Her sister, Cathy Vo, told member station KPCC that Michelle Vo had a bubbly personality, a newfound passion for country music and a gift for making friends.

""You instantly loved her, and she could talk to anybody, whoever you were,"" Cathy Vo told KPCC.

Vo had just made a new friend at the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas when the shooting began. That man, Kody Robertson, was the one who called her family to tell them she'd been shot.

The Washington Post's Wesley Lowery reconstructed the events of that night — from the two strangers chatting over beers to a blood-covered Robertson desperately checking hospitals to find where Vo was taken. You can read the full story here.

Charleston Hartfield, 34, Henderson, Nev.

Hartfield, a Las Vegas police officer, was off duty when he attended the Route 91 Harvest music festival and died in the massacre. The city's police force confirmed that one off-duty officer had been killed but did not identify him; a friend of Hartfield's, Troy Rhett, spoke to NPR and confirmed his death.

A 34-year-old military veteran and married father of two, Hartfield was better known to many as Coach Charles or Coach Chucky — he coached youth football for the Henderson Cowboys.

""I think he was every kid's favorite coach,"" Rhett told NPR. Hartfield was a big guy, Rhett said, always positive and always encouraging self-improvement and community service. ""He was a father figure for a lot of the people he interacted with.""

Rhett choked up as he described the number of children who came to a vigil for Hartfield on Monday night. ""It's just indicative of who he was,"" he said. ""The community here at Vegas will never be the same having lost such a bright star.""

Hartfield also wrote and self-published a book, Memoirs Of A Public Servant, about life as a Las Vegas police officer. He wrote in the book that he began talking publicly about community-oriented policing as an accident — a local high school was short on a speaker for an event, and Hartfield agreed to fill the slot. But he discovered he could start meaningful conversations with young people about police use of force and race relations.

In a forward to the book, Hartfield told his fellow police officers that the perception of policing depends on the interactions officers have with the public every day. ""I feel honored that you have allowed me to serve our community side by side with you,"" he wrote to his colleagues.

Rhett knew Hartfield was at the music festival, and texted on Sunday night to ask if he was OK. When he didn't reply, Rhett just assumed that Hartfield was too busy assisting others to respond.

""He'd be the guy that would be helping everybody, saving everyone first, before he would even think of saving himself."" Rhett said. ""He's the best of what we have in society ... as a police officer and a serviceman, and then he volunteered so much of his time to the community. I don't know if you can ask more out of an individual. In the short period of time that he was on this earth, he's done more than most people do in a lifetime.""

Rocio Guillen Rocha, 40, Eastvale, Calif.

Guillen had given birth to her fourth child — a baby boy — just six weeks ago and was still on maternity leave from her job as a manager at a California Pizza Kitchen restaurant.

She and her fiancé, Chris Jaksha, both major country music fans, had traveled from their home in Eastvale to attend Sunday's concert as part of a birthday celebration for one of their friends, Jaksha's sister Nikki Stowers told NPR.

Stowers said that according to her brother, when the shooting began, Guillen was hit in the thigh. Jaksha was able to get Guillen to a hospital with the help of police, but she died soon after arriving.

Now Stowers is caring for the infant, along with the couple's 18-month-old daughter. Guillen's two older boys — one 13, the other 17 — are with Guillen's relatives.

""I don't even know what to say,"" said Stowers, her voice thickening with emotion. ""She was such a great mom. My parents have a house by the river and she loved going out there and taking the kids. Just being a family person. She was that type of mom who just loved holding her kids. And she loved her two older boys so much — just watching them play sports. It's so unfair that she's had her life taken away.""

Jenny Parks, 36, Palmdale, Calif.

Parks was a kindergarten teacher at Anaverde Elementary School, where she'd worked for three years. A representative of the school district confirmed her death to NPR.

""She was always enthusiastic, energetic, committed and dedicated,"" the Westside Union School District said in a statement. Parks was ""so proud to be a teacher,"" the district wrote. ""Her spirit was something to behold. The students who were instructed by her knew what it was to love learning as Jennifer gave them the sense of wonder, curiosity, and excitement about all they did.""

Parks attended the music festival with her husband, Bobby, who was injured but survived. They have two children.

Bobby Parks' uncle, Steven McCarthy, told People Magazine that the Parkses were ""the perfect family."" Jenny was ""absolutely beautiful and very intelligent, had a wonderful sense of humor and was so kind,"" he said.

Angie Gomez, 20, Riverside, Calif.

Gomez, who graduated from Riverside Polytechnic High School in 2015, was an aspiring nurse with a passion for children's theater. Gomez's older sister, Tawny Finn, told NPR that Gomez adored spending time with her family — and loved country music.

""I was 9 when she was born. I just fell in love with her,"" Finn says. ""She was such a good baby. ... She'd barely ever cried but when she did, I'd sing to her and she'd put her ear up to my mouth and just stop crying. She was just so wonderful.""

When she grew up, Gomez was just as sweet. ""There was not a bad bone in her body,"" Finn says. ""My sister was just the greatest person. And I know that seems like something that someone would say ... but she really was the greatest person, with the kindest heart, and her main goal in life was just to make other people happy and take care of them.""

Gomez was at the music festival with her boyfriend, Ethan Sanchez. Gomez rarely went to concerts but wanted to see this one — and Ethan, who wasn't as big a country music fan, went to be with her, Finn says. The two were high school sweethearts with a bright future in front of them.

""She just recently got a job last week as a certified nurse's assistant and she was really excited about that,"" Finn said. ""They had so many plans — when they were going to get married, when they were going to have kids. They were the childhood sweethearts that were going to make it.""

They wanted to be close to the stage for the Jason Aldean concert. That's when the massacre started. The second volley of shots brought Gomez down; she fell into her boyfriend's arms, struggling to breathe. With the help of bystanders, Sanchez carried her to the road. Several cars flew by before a good Samaritan stopped and gave her a ride to the hospital in his Camaro.

But it was too late, Finn says.

""She was my best friend,"" she said. ""It's just going to be hard to live without her.""

Jordan McIldoon, 23, Maple Ridge, Canada

McIldoon was a heavy duty mechanic and ""self-described, cowboy-boot, tattoo-covered redneck who loved the outdoors,"" according to a statement given to the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. by McIldoon's parents, Al and Angela.

He was attending the concert with his girlfriend, but he died holding the hand of a stranger: Heather Gooze, who was working as a bartender at the concert. She told CNN that several men carried a gravely injured McIldoon to the bar area, then ran out to help others who were wounded. Gooze said she kneeled down to take McIldoon's hand and could feel his fingers wrap around hers. ""I felt, like, a squeeze on my fingers and then I just felt the fingers go loose,"" she recalled.

Soon after, McIldoon's cellphone rang — a friend calling to see if he was OK. Gooze told the broadcaster that she answered the call and learned McIldoon's name from the friend. Soon she was also in phone contact with McIldoon's girlfriend, who was in lockdown at a nearby hotel, and his mother back in Canada.

Gooze said she promised them she would stay with his body until authorities came to take him away so that they would know what had happened to him. It took several hours. ""I just sat with him,"" Gooze told CNN. ""I would like to think, if it was me, somebody wouldn't let me sit there alone.""

McIldoon's parents told the CBC that he was their only son. ""We only had one child,"" they said. ""We just don't know what to do.""

Bailey Schweitzer, 20, Bakersfield, Calif.

Schweitzer worked as a receptionist at Infinity Communications, a company serving the cellular industry. Her supervisor, Amie Campbell, confirmed her death to NPR.

""At work we just called her our sunshine,"" Campbell said. ""She just kept a smile on everybody's face and you couldn't have a bad day around her.""

A co-worker, Katelynn Cleveland, told The Californian that Schweitzer had been looking forward to the Route 91 Harvest festival for weeks — and was already starting to plan a trip back to Las Vegas for her 21st birthday in April.

Christopher Roybal, 28, Corona, Calif.

Roybal was a Navy veteran who had served in Afghanistan, NPR's Ina Jaffe reports. His death was confirmed by his mother, Debbie Allen, in a post on Facebook.

""Today is the saddest day of my life,"" Allen wrote. ""My heart is broken in a billion pieces.""

Matthew Austin, who served with Roybal in the Navy, wrote, ""it breaks my heart and infuriates me that a veteran can come home from war unharmed and events like these occur. Shipmate, you were taken much [too] soon.""

The most recent post visible to the public on Roybal's own Facebook account, from July, answers the question, ""What's it like being shot at?""

Roybal described adrenaline, fear and anger. He wrote:

""The anger stays, long after your friends have died, the lives you've taken are buried and your boots are placed neatly in a box in some storage unit. Still covered in the dirt you've refused to wash off for fear of forgetting the most raw emotions you as a human being will ever feel again. ""What's it like to be shot at? It's a nightmare no amount of drugs, no amount of therapy and no amount of drunk talks with your war veteran buddies will ever be able to escape. ""Cheers boys.""

Stacee Etcheber, 50, Novato, Calif.

Etcheber was a hairstylist, a wife, and a mother to two children — a son and daughter ages 10 and 12.

Her husband, Vincent, told NPR that the two of them were standing next to each other at the concert when the first round of shooting began. Vincent, an officer with the San Francisco police, urged his wife to flee as he stayed behind to try to assist.

Asked for the best words to describe Etcheber, Vincent did not hesitate: ""strong person, great mother."" But he said he was not in a state to talk about her in more detail.

Etcheber grew up in Northern California and photos on her Facebook page show her engaged in all manner of outdoor activities — doing a handstand on a beach, getting a kiss from a seal, riding a horse rodeo-style, celebrating with friends on ski slopes, and grinning widely as she hugged her husband and children.

Carrie Barnette, 34, Riverside, Calif.

Barnette reportedly worked at Disney's California Adventure park, at Pacific Wharf Cafe.

Robert Iger, the CEO of Disney, confirmed her death in a tweet, calling her ""a wonderful member of the Disney family"" and describing her death as ""tragic."" Her cousin, Janice Chambers, told the Arizona Republic that Barnette was an ""animal lover"" who was ""always smiling, happy and upbeat.""

Susan Smith, 53, Simi Valley, Calif.

Smith was the office manager at an elementary school in Simi Valley. Jake Finch, a spokeman with the Simi Valley School District, confirmed her death to member station KPCC. KPCC reports:

""'Susan was very patient and kind with the students,' said Finch. 'She always had a smile on her face when you walked into her office. She was also incredibly efficient and skilled at her job. And most importantly, she had a great sense of humor. She was just a really sweet, kind, neat person.'"" Smith, who lived in Simi Valley, had worked for the school district for 16 years, at five different schools. She worked at Vista Fundamental Elementary for the past three years, said Finch. She was married, and was the mother of two adult children.""

Jessica Klymchuk, 34, Canada

Klymchuk worked as a librarian, educational assistant and bus driver at St. Stephen's (Catholic) School in Valleyview, Alberta.

""She leaves to mourn four children who all attend St. Stephen's and her new husband,"" Betty Turpin, superintendent of the Holy Family Catholic Regional Division, said in a message to trustees, according to the CBC. ""She has been an employee of HFCRD for four years. Please keep the staff and students of St. Stephen's and her family in your prayers.""

""The scope of this tragedy is worldwide and we are feeling its impact here at home,"" Turpin wrote.

Rhonda LeRocque, 42, Tewksbury, Mass.

LeRocque reportedly died in a Las Vegas hospital after being removed from the scene of the attack. The Boston Globe reports that she worked for IDEO, a Cambridge design firm.

She is survived by her husband, Jason, and the couple's 6-year-old daughter, both of whom were attending the concert at the time of the attack and neither of whom was injured.

LeRocque's mother, Priscilla Champagne, tells NPR by Facebook Messenger that her daughter was ""a faithful servant of Jehovah"" and that she ""went on missions to help rebuild homes after [Hurricane] Katrina.""

In an emailed statement sent to NPR, an IDEO spokesperson said: ""For ten years she cared for her work family in Cambridge with the same warmth and devotion she showed everyone in her life. She will be deeply missed.""

Quinton Robbins, 20, Henderson, Nev.

Robbins was a student at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who reportedly ""enjoyed hunting, fishing and country music,"" according to The Washington Post.

At least two extended videos on Robbins' Twitter page show him enjoying wakeboarding.

Deseret News says he was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons).

The Post says he was the oldest of three children. It says he was remembered by his grandmother as ""just a jewel.""

In a Facebook post, Robbins' aunt, Kilee Wells Sanders, said her nephew ""was the most kind and loving soul"" with a ""contagious laugh and smile.""

Dana Gardner, 52, Grand Terrace, Calif.

Gardner worked for San Bernardino County for more than 25 years; the county spokesman confirmed her death to member station KPCC.

ABC 7 reports that Gardner was with her daughter Kayla at the time of the shooting and says that Kayla Gardner survived with no injuries.

James ""Sonny"" Melton, 29, Big Sandy, Tenn.

Melton, a registered nurse at the Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tenn., was in the lifesaving business, but his employer confirmed he lost his own life. He was at the concert with his wife, Heather, an orthopedic surgeon, who made it out alive.

""He saved my life,"" Heather Melton told USA Today. ""He grabbed me from behind and started running when I felt him get shot in the back.""

Lisa Romero-Muniz, 48, Gallup, N.M.

Romero-Muniz, a grandmother, worked as a discipline secretary at Hiroshi Miyamura High School in Gallup, N.M.

""She was not only an employee of our school district, but was an incredible loving and sincere friend, mentor and advocate for students,"" Gallup-McKinley County Public Schools Superintendent Mike Hyatt said in a statement.

Sandra Casey, 34, Manhattan Beach, Calif.

Casey also worked in a school; she had been a a special education teacher at Manhattan Beach Middle School in Los Angeles County for the past nine years. The Manhattan Beach Unified School District said Casey was ""loved by students and colleagues alike and will be remembered for her sense of humor, her passion for her work, her devotion to her students, and her commitment to continuing her own learning.""

Matthews emailed school families to say that Casey was among numerous Manhattan Beach high school and middle school employees who were at the concert; the others escaped unharmed.

Rachael Parker, 33, Manhattan Beach, Calif.

Parker was also from Manhattan Beach. She was a 10-year veteran of the city's police department and worked as a records technician.

The 33-year-old ""was shot and ultimately lost her life in the hospital,"" police said in a statement. Parker was among four department employees at the concert; one officer was shot and suffered minor injuries.",,,

toggle caption Oath Inc.

In a few months, AOL Instant Messenger will go the way of such tech touchstones as AltaVista and Netscape. It was 20 years ago that ""AIM"" went online. It quickly exploded in popularity, peaked and then slowly succumbed to competitors.

For many of us, AIM conjures up memories of dial-up modems, the sound of a ""handshake"" and the phrase ""You've Got Mail.""

""AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,"" says Michael Albers, vice president of communications product at Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications that brought AOL and Yahoo together into a single unit earlier this year.

On Twitter, a social media platform that in no small way contributed to AIM's demise, people seemed a bit nostalgic but not terribly surprised.

""You likely remember the CD, your first screenname, your carefully curated away messages, and how you organized your buddy lists,"" Albers says. ""In the late 1990's, the world had never seen anything like it. And it captivated all of us.""

In fact, by 2001, AIM had captivated about 100 million of us worldwide, but as Techcrunch.com writes:

""It battled for supremacy with competitors like ICQ, and messengers from Yahoo and Microsoft MSN. But eventually text messaging, Google's GChat and Facebook took over, while AIM never fully figured out the shift to mobile. That led to AOL's fall from grace, going from being valued at $224 billion in today's money to just $4.4 billion when it was sold to Verizon in 2015. For context on the business AOL let slip away, WhatsApp sold that same year to Facebook for more than $19 billion.""

""We know there are so many loyal fans who have used AIM for decades; and we loved working and building the first chat app of its kind since 1997,"" AOL writes on the AIM help page. ""Our focus will always be on providing the kind of innovative experiences consumers want. We're more excited than ever to focus on building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products.""

If you still have an AIM account, you can keep using it until December 15. After that, you will no longer be able to sign on.",,,

President Trump is expected to explain what ""America First"" means to the United Nations General Assembly, an organization known for putting the world first. Trump speaks to its member nations Tuesday.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And we have this new Russia development just as President Trump is getting ready to address the United Nations General Assembly today. This is his first speech before that body, and this is a chance for world leaders to size him up and for the president to explain his view of America's role in the world. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us. Hey there, Tam.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.

GREENE: So America first. Those are two worlds - two words that I know a lot of world leaders have thought a lot about, and I think they're looking for the president to clarify what he means today, right?

KEITH: And he will. His message is likely to be similar to things that he has said before around the world that America first does not mean America alone, but then he goes on to say that, you know, every country should put their own people first. Then a senior aide who briefed us reporters says that we can expect to hear the president argue that nations putting their own interests first does not mean that they won't also work together, that they will in their own self-interest find a need for global cooperation to counter the world's most pressing issues. Those issues, as President Trump sees them, are aggression from North Korea and Iran and also terrorism. The aide said nations cannot be bystanders to history. Together, responsible nations have an obligation to counter these threats.

GREENE: Well, you talk about North Korea and Iran. This is certainly a setting where the president has an opportunity to really single them out. Do we expect that to happen?

KEITH: Yes. And we also expect him to single-out Venezuela, where the Trump administration has been highly critical of anti-democratic actions by President Maduro there. As for Iran, the aide who briefed us said that the speech would get into one of the greatest threats to the endurance of the status quo in Iran, being the people of Iran itself and their desire to create a future that they want, in theory. The speech will tell us a little more what he means by that. He's also, you know, President Trump has been very critical of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by President Obama but hasn't yet taken action to pull out of it. As for North Korea, the aide who helped write the speech says the president will speak in tough terms about the, quote, ""North Korean menace"" as well as about countries that he says are enabling North Korea.

GREENE: Isn't all of this awkward? I mean, the president giving this big speech at the U.N., which is a body that he has been so critical of?

KEITH: Sort of, yeah. (Laughter). So at one point yesterday, a reporter asked President Trump about his message to the General Assembly, and he said, quote, ""I think the main message is make the United Nations great. Not again. Make the United Nations great.""

GREENE: That's telling.

KEITH: Exactly. He says there's tremendous potential, and he has put a real focus starting yesterday and, well, before that, but here is something he said really putting a focus on his desire for reform at the United Nations.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We must ensure that no one and no member's state shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden. And that's militarily or financially. We also ask that every peacekeeping mission have clearly-defined goals and metrics for evaluating success.

KEITH: And those are common themes. He said much the same thing at NATO.

GREENE: All right. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith getting us ready for the president's speech at the U.N. today. Tam, thanks.

Former President Obama spoke at a Gates Foundation event and delivered a not so thinly veiled message to President Trump about what he sees as America's role in the world.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

Former President Obama has been relatively quiet since President Trump took office, issuing only an occasional statement or tweet. But today he spoke out against intensifying efforts to repeal and replace his signature health care law. And he unmistakably rebuked Trump's remarks from yesterday at the U.N. General Assembly. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith reports.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Barack Obama is still talking about hope and change.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BARACK OBAMA: By just about every measure, America is better, and the world is better than it was 50 years ago, 30 years ago, or even 10 years ago.

KEITH: The former president spoke today at an event focused on global health put on by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The Gates Foundation is among NPR's financial supporters. And while Obama argued for optimism and hard work over cynicism, he was blunt about what he sees as outstanding challenges - economic inequality, climate change, terrorism, extreme poverty, girls denied education.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

OBAMA: The rise of nationalism and xenophobia and a politics that says, it's not we but us and them, a politics that threatens to turn good people away from the kind of collective action that has always driven human progress.

KEITH: In the Trump era, public statements by other leaders are often interpreted as rebukes of the president, and that's sure what it sounded like today as Obama defended global organizations like the United Nations.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

OBAMA: So number one, you have to start with the premise and believe that multilateral institutions and efforts are important. And you don't have to cede all your sovereignty, or it doesn't make you less patriotic to believe that. You just have to have some sense and read.

(LAUGHTER)

KEITH: President Trump used the word sovereign or sovereignty 21 times in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly yesterday, arguing that the U.S. had to put its own interests first. Obama also expressed frustration with the latest congressional effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

OBAMA: It is aggravating. And all of this being done without any demonstrable economic or actuarial or plain common sense rationale - it frustrates. And it's certainly frustrating to have to mobilize a couple of months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents.

KEITH: So it's pretty clear how Obama feels. Tamara Keith, NPR News.

For the second week in a row, the Senate on Thursday voted down proposals to extend the payroll tax holiday through next year. In the case of the Democrats' proposal, Republicans objected to the ""millionaires surtax"" that would be used to pay for it.

Ever since the idea of the surtax was introduced weeks ago, Republicans in Congress have railed against it, arguing that it is a direct hit on small-business owners and other job creators.

The argument is that many small-business owners report company profits on their individual taxes because of the way their businesses are structured. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., says the surtax would hurt their ability to hire.

""It's just intuitive that, you know, if you're somebody who's in business and you get hit with a tax increase, it's going to be that much harder, I think, to make investments that are going to lead to job creation,"" says Thune.

We wanted to talk to business owners who would be affected. So, NPR requested help from numerous Republican congressional offices, including House and Senate leadership. They were unable to produce a single millionaire job creator for us to interview.

So we went to the business groups that have been lobbying against the surtax. Again, three days after putting in a request, none of them was able to find someone for us to talk to. A group called the Tax Relief Coalition said the problem was finding someone willing to talk about their personal taxes on national radio.

So next we put a query on Facebook. And several business owners who said they would be affected by the ""millionaires surtax"" responded.

""It's not in the top 20 things that we think about when we're making a business hire,"" said Ian Yankwitt, who owns Tortoise Investment Management.

Tortoise is a boutique investment firm in White Plains, N.Y. Yankwitt has 10 employees and in recent years has done a lot of hiring.

As a result, Yankwitt says he's had many conversations about hiring, ""both with respect to specific people, with respect to whether we should hire one junior person or two, whether we should hire a senior person.""

He says his ultimate marginal tax rate ""didn't even make it on the agenda.""

Yankwitt says deciding to bring on another employee is all about return on investment. Will adding another person to the payroll make his company more successful?

For Jason Burger, the motivation is similar.

""If my taxes go up, I have slightly less disposable income, yes,"" said Burger, co-owner of CSS International Holdings, a global infrastructure contractor. ""But that has nothing to do with what my business does. What my business does is based on the contracts that it wins and the demand for its services.""

Burger says his Michigan-based company is hiring like crazy, and he'd be perfectly willing to pay the surtax.

""It's only fair that I put back into the system that is the entire reason for my success,"" said Burger.

For the record, both Burger and Yankwitt have made campaign contributions to Democrats in the past, but they say their views on the surtax are about the economics of their businesses and not their politics.

And they're not alone.

""I, like any other American, especially a business owner, I want to make as much money as I can and I want to keep as much money in my pocket as I can, but I also believe in the greater good,"" says Deborah Schwarz, who owns LAC Group, an information management firm with offices nationwide and in London.

Surtax or no, Schwarz says she hopes to keep hiring.

""We're going to keep on writing proposals, going after contracts, hopefully winning them, and when we do we're going to continue to hire people,"" says Schwarz.

All of this contradicts the arguments about job creators being made by Republicans in Congress.

""Those I would say were exceptions to the rule,"" responds Thune. ""I think most small-business owners who are out there right now would argue that raising their taxes has the opposite effect that we would want to have in a down economy.""

But those small-business owners apparently don't want to talk.",,,

President Trump is expected to explain what ""America First"" means to the United Nations General Assembly, an organization known for putting the world first. Trump speaks to its member nations Tuesday.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And we have this new Russia development just as President Trump is getting ready to address the United Nations General Assembly today. This is his first speech before that body, and this is a chance for world leaders to size him up and for the president to explain his view of America's role in the world. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith joins us. Hey there, Tam.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Good morning.

GREENE: So America first. Those are two worlds - two words that I know a lot of world leaders have thought a lot about, and I think they're looking for the president to clarify what he means today, right?

KEITH: And he will. His message is likely to be similar to things that he has said before around the world that America first does not mean America alone, but then he goes on to say that, you know, every country should put their own people first. Then a senior aide who briefed us reporters says that we can expect to hear the president argue that nations putting their own interests first does not mean that they won't also work together, that they will in their own self-interest find a need for global cooperation to counter the world's most pressing issues. Those issues, as President Trump sees them, are aggression from North Korea and Iran and also terrorism. The aide said nations cannot be bystanders to history. Together, responsible nations have an obligation to counter these threats.

GREENE: Well, you talk about North Korea and Iran. This is certainly a setting where the president has an opportunity to really single them out. Do we expect that to happen?

KEITH: Yes. And we also expect him to single-out Venezuela, where the Trump administration has been highly critical of anti-democratic actions by President Maduro there. As for Iran, the aide who briefed us said that the speech would get into one of the greatest threats to the endurance of the status quo in Iran, being the people of Iran itself and their desire to create a future that they want, in theory. The speech will tell us a little more what he means by that. He's also, you know, President Trump has been very critical of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by President Obama but hasn't yet taken action to pull out of it. As for North Korea, the aide who helped write the speech says the president will speak in tough terms about the, quote, ""North Korean menace"" as well as about countries that he says are enabling North Korea.

GREENE: Isn't all of this awkward? I mean, the president giving this big speech at the U.N., which is a body that he has been so critical of?

KEITH: Sort of, yeah. (Laughter). So at one point yesterday, a reporter asked President Trump about his message to the General Assembly, and he said, quote, ""I think the main message is make the United Nations great. Not again. Make the United Nations great.""

GREENE: That's telling.

KEITH: Exactly. He says there's tremendous potential, and he has put a real focus starting yesterday and, well, before that, but here is something he said really putting a focus on his desire for reform at the United Nations.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We must ensure that no one and no member's state shoulders a disproportionate share of the burden. And that's militarily or financially. We also ask that every peacekeeping mission have clearly-defined goals and metrics for evaluating success.

KEITH: And those are common themes. He said much the same thing at NATO.

GREENE: All right. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith getting us ready for the president's speech at the U.N. today. Tam, thanks.

KEITH: You're welcome.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy/for NPR Carol Guzy/for NPR

Every Sunday since Hurricane Maria ripped through Puerto Rico, Ada Reyes and her four children have walked half an hour to church. Down a winding road, dodging fallen trees and debris, they walk past cement houses still bearing flood marks, and finally cross the Vivi — a small river in Utuado, a city in the central mountain region.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy/for NPR Carol Guzy/for NPR

The Iglesia Cristiana Monte Olivar church is small: one room, with a few rows of chairs all facing two podiums up front. There are about 30 people, all standing when we arrive. Two associate pastors offer a prayer and members pray over each other, some in tears and embracing each other as they pray.

It's been a hard few weeks in Utuado. Many roads nearby are still too dangerous to drive because of heavy flooding and strewn debris. Schools remain closed. Businesses that are open, including a Walgreen's and an AutoZone, are powered by generators and have long lines and full parking lots seeding traffic jams.

People here are about to start their third week without electricity or water. Nearly 90 percent of the island is still without power.

Reyes' home suffered some roof damage, which has let in the rain they've been having this past week. Her car fared much worse — it's pinned under a tree, so she's had to go everywhere on foot. Still, she makes the trek to church because it's the highlight of her week.

""It's like my breakthrough,"" she says. ""I feel like nothing's happening around me when I'm here. I forget about everything going on in the street for a little bit, at least. It gives me strength to keep on with my kids and the faith to see what happens.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Carol Guzy/for NPR Carol Guzy/for NPR

Before Maria, the church held several services. But since there's no power, they now hold only one. That service, at 10 a.m. on Sundays, makes it seem like nothing has changed, says Reyes.

An 11-year-old boy sits near her, his Bible snugged into a denim case spread open on his lap. A teenager stands at the podium with her iPhone playing instrumentals; she sings along. She's soon joined by a man playing the guitar. The congregation joins in, singing: ""I hope the Holy Spirit takes care of everything. ... There is nothing that will keep me from worshiping. ... All I need is his presence.""

The church community has come together after hurricanes Maria and Irma, says Carmen Leticia Medina Gonzalez, an associate pastor. During the service, she passes out white envelopes filled with cash — money raised by the congregation for members who are struggling. As people approach the podium to collect, Luis Collazo, sitting in the back, stands up to offer help. He's able to remove debris or clean up a house, he says, turning to address the pews.

He pauses when he sees Wilfredo Gonzalez, who was playing the guitar earlier in the service. Gonzalez is the church's board president. He lost three sisters in the hurricane. All were in their 70s, he says. Two were bedridden.

A few days before the storm, he moved them to a house he thought would be out of the flood zone, but a landslide took them under. For eight days, their bodies were trapped under the debris. He's still waiting for the coroner to properly identify them.

Attending church gives him comfort, he says: ""Here, we are united.""",,,

Puerto Ricans say it's taller than the Statue of Liberty and the largest homage to Christopher Columbus in the world. It's a towering 350-foot-tall statue of the explorer and it's perched on the island's waterfront. While the statue survived Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico more than two weeks ago, the town it resides in wasn't as lucky.

It's tough to do justice to the huge sculpture that towers over Arecibo, a beach town on Puerto Rico's northern coast some 50 miles from the capital San Juan.

The statue sits on a huge base, which is shaped like a ship, and is perched on a grassy hill. A thin-faced Christopher Columbus stands on top. His open right hand juts in the air, his left steadies a huge steering wheel.

This wasn't a very developed part of the northern coast to begin with but since Hurricane Maria hit, there's even less left standing. Just a few restaurants and some battered houses, such as Juan Mena's home, which is right next door to the statue.

""When they inaugurated the 600-ton statue last year we all said, 'Wow.' We've never seen anything this big around here,"" Mena said.

Mena got to ride the elevator up to the ship's observation deck, where he says he could see all the way down the coast. Plans were to develop the area, with hotels, a golf course, even a few zip lines. Maria however blew a huge hole in those plans.

At the gas station down the road, a crew is cleaning up. The front panels of all the pumps are blown off, the station's roof is on its side and twisted metal liters the ground.

Angel Carrion, who is shoveling piles of mud, says he isn't a fan of Columbus. ""He colonized us, so from that point of view I don't like him but that's part of who we are,"" he says.

Carrion is more accepting of the statue — especially since it was bringing in tourists. But Puerto Rico's indigenous people, the Tainos, bitterly objected — citing Columbus's infamous treatment of Indians in Puerto Rico and throughout the Americas.

The sculpture's modern day journey to Arecibo was controversial too. Its Russian creator originally offered it to several U.S. cities but all declined. Puerto Rico accepted but kept the huge bronze pieces in storage, and bouncing between towns for more than a decade.

Ricardo Dominich, an army veteran, says he's thrilled the statue finally landed in Arecibo. He just hopes his town sees better times soon. They still don't have water, electricity or cell service.

""Right now we are in survival mode and you know making do and trying to be with the best of spirits that we have,"" Dominich says.

At least, he says, there's beer in the stores, and he plans to spend Columbus Day drinking a few at the beach with the town's huge statue towering over them.",,,

Enlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images

The Trump administration announced Tuesday it would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in six months if Congress doesn't find a more permanent solution.

Since it was enacted under President Barack Obama, about 800,000 immigrants who were children when they arrived in the U.S. illegally have received protections from the program. They include stay of deportation and the ability to legally work and go to school. In a tweet Tuesday evening, Trump signaled he supports legalizing DACA, saying he would revisit the issue if Congress can't legalize the program.

Here's a look at who will be affected when DACA ends, why the program remains controversial and what happens next:

1. What is DACA?

DACA is the acronym for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program created in 2012 by the Obama administration allowing young people brought to this country illegally by their parents to get a temporary reprieve from deportation and to receive permission to work, study and obtain driver's licenses.

DACA applicants had to be younger than 31 years old when the program began. They also had to prove that they had lived in the United States continuously since June 15, 2007, and that they had arrived in the U.S. before the age of 16.

Those signing up for DACA must show that they have clean criminal records. They have to be enrolled in high school or college, or serve in the military. Their status is renewable every two years.

2. Who are the DREAMers?

There are about 800,000 DACA recipients, also known as DREAMers, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Loading...

Most arrived from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. There are also several thousand from Asia, primarily South Korea and the Philippines. They reside in every state, with the largest concentrations in California (222,795), Texas (124,300), New York (41,970), Illinois (42,376) and Florida (32,795).

Loading...

The term DREAMer is derived from a legislative bill, first introduced in 2001, called the Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act. It has yet to be approved by Congress.

3. Why was DACA created?

Unable to find a legislative remedy to protect minors who were brought to this country through no fault of their own, the Obama administration created the DACA program through executive action in June 2012. Conservatives accused Obama of overstepping his authority, but they brought no legal challenge.

The DREAMers are a highly organized group of young people who argue that, after being raised and educated here in the U.S., they are Americans who only lack legal recognition.

At the time DACA was created, Obama's executive action had strong public support according to a 2012 Pew Research Center survey, which found that 63 percent of those polled approved of the program.

A more recent poll by NBC News/Survey Monkey found that nearly two-thirds of Americans favor allowing the DREAMers to stay in the U.S.

4. Why did Trump end DACA?

During the campaign, Donald Trump railed against illegal immigration and promised to reverse what he called President Obama's ""unconstitutional"" executive actions.

But as president, Trump began backtracking. Early on, he said a decision about the fate of the DREAMers was ""very difficult"" for him, but ""we're going to show great heart."" As recently as last week when he was asked about his impending decision, Trump said ""we love the DREAMers.""

Conservatives, who had anticipated swift action from Trump, repeatedly urged the new president to keep his pledge and ""pull the plug"" on DACA.

In June, 10 Republican attorneys general moved to force Trump's hand. In a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, they threatened to launch a legal challenge against DACA by seeking to amend a lawsuit stalled in federal court. That lawsuit opposed another Obama executive action called DAPA, or Deferred Action for Parents of Americans. (Announced in November 2014, DAPA would have expanded DACA protections to certain undocumented parents whose children are legal residents or citizens of the U.S.)

The Republican attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, gave Trump until today, Sept. 5, to decide DACA's fate.

5. Will the DREAMers be forced to leave?

Not immediately.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, DACA will be phased out, with an official end in six months.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will process all new applications received as of Sept. 5 and then stop accepting applications. DREAMers whose work permits expire before March 5, 2018, can apply for a two-year renewal, but they must meet an upcoming Oct. 5 deadline. The government will not terminate ""previously issued deferred action or revoke Employment Authorization Documents.""

But the announcement by DHS also ends on an ominous (for DREAMers) note: DHS will ""continue to exercise its discretionary authority to terminate or deny deferred action for any reason, at any time, with or without notice.""

The process announced by U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is designed to ""create a time period for Congress to act — should it so choose.""

There is no way of knowing whether Congress will ever come to the DREAMers' rescue and craft a plan that salvages any of the protections brought by DACA. In a statement about DACA, President Trump called on Congress to act, but he did not specifically endorse legislation to preserve it.

It is also not clear that if Congress fails to act, DREAMers immediately would become ripe targets for deportation. In his statement Tuesday, President Trump said, ""I have advised the Department of Homeland Security that DACA recipients are not enforcement priorities unless they are criminals, are involved in criminal activity, or are members of a gang.""

Trump tweeted Tuesday night that he will ""revisit this issue"" if Congress doesn't legalize DACA.

But DACA advocates say they already have documented cases in which DREAMers, with valid DACA protections, were apparently targeted by agents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",,,

Bhí bean chéile Shéamuis, Dolores Mhic Géidigh, agus baill teaghlaigh eile, i láthair ag an ócáid chun glacadh leis an ngradam, chomh maith le Ceannaire Gníomhach an stáisiúin, Gearóid Mac Donncha.

Bhí Séamus ag obair mar Bhainisteoir Réigiúin i nDoirí Beaga nuair a cailleadh go tobann é i mí Iúil 2016. Bhí 28 bliain caite aige ag obair leis an tseirbhís.

Bhí ard-mheas air mar chraoltóir, agus aithne agus ómós ar leith dá chuid oibre mar thráchtaire ar chluichí CLG. Dúirt an tAthair Seán Ó Gallchóir gurb é a bhí mar ghuth Chumann Lúthchleas Gael Dhún na nGall.

Mysterium Spritpreis - so tanken Sie günstig

Einmal voll tanken für einen Euro - der Traum eines jeden Autofahrers. Und er ist seit fast zwanzig Jahren Wirklichkeit: allerdings in Venezuela. Dort wird der Treibstoff zu 90 Prozent vom Staat subventioniert, was dazu führt, dass ein Liter Benzin umgerechnet weniger als zwei Cent kostet. Davon können deutsche Autofahrer nur träumen. Im vergangenen Jahr kostete ein Liter Benzin in Deutschland 1,549 Euro für Super E10 und 1,420 für Diesel. Seit Ende August 2013 müssen mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen in Deutschland ihre aktuellen Preise melden. Wie sich der Spritpreis zusammensetzt, wodurch er beeinflusst wird und wie man die Spritkosten möglichst gering halten kann - das wird im Folgenden kurz und bündig erklärt.

? Wie setzt sich der Benzinpreis zusammen?

Den größten Anteil am Benzinpreis machen Steuern aus, nämliche die Energiesteuer von 65,45 Cent pro Liter sowie die 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer. Hinzu kommt der Produktpreis, der für Europa an der Rohöl-Börse des Hafens in Rotterdam ermittelt wird, wo auch die Preise für Benzin, Diesel und Heizöl festgelegt werden. Des weiteren schlagen die Mineralölgesellschaften und Tankstellen ihre jeweiligen Betriebs- und Lagerkosten auf den Preis auf.

Hier ein Beispiel: Im Januar dieses Jahres kostete ein Liter Benzin für Autofahrer durchschnittlich 151,9 Cent pro Liter. Dieser Betrag setzt sich zusammen aus: 65,45 Cent Energiesteuer, zirka 51 Cent Produktpreis, 24,25 Cent Mehrwertsteuer und rund 11 Cent, die als Deckungsbeitrag bezeichnet werden. In diesen 11 Cent sind unter anderem die Betriebskosten und der Gewinn der Tankstellen enthalten.

? Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die Benzinpreise?

Der Benzinpreis unterliegt laufenden Schwankungen und variiert inzwischen mehrmals täglich. Die Preisentwicklung wird dabei vom Rohölpreis, von der Fördermenge, von der weltweiten Nachfrage, vom Wechselkurs des Euro (denn Rohöl wird in Dollar gehandelt), dem von den Mineralölgesellschaften festgelegten Produktpreis und dazu von globalen, politischen und ökonomischen Entwicklungen beeinflusst.

Steigt der Preis pro Barrel Rohöl (ein Barrel sind exakt 158,987 Liter) auf dem Weltmarkt, steigt auch der Preis des Benzins an den heimischen Tankstellen.

Ein Barrel der für den europäischen Rohölmarkt wichtigen Nordseesorte Brent kostete Anfang 2009 noch 40 Dollar, aktuell sind es rund 90 Dollar.

? Ist der Benzinpreis verantwortlich für steigende Mobilitätskosten?

Nach Angaben des Verbraucherpreisindex des Statistischen Bundesamts stiegen die Preise für die allgemeinen Mobilitätskosten im Zeitraum von 2009 bis 2013 um mehr als zehn Prozent. Dieser Preisanstieg liegt jedoch nicht allein daran, dass im gleichen Zeitraum die Preise für Diesel und Benzin um mehr als 23 Prozent gestiegen sind.

Denn zusätzlich kletterten auch die weiteren Betriebskosten für einen Pkw - etwa Reparaturen, Inspektionen sowie Kfz-Versicherungen - um durchschnittlich jeweils gut acht Prozent. Teurer wurden in diesem Zeitraum zudem Gebrauchtwagen (+0,8%), Neuwagen (+2,8 %) sowie Ersatzteile und Pflegemittel (+5,5%). Insgesamt entfällt etwa ein Drittel der gesamten Betriebskosten eines Pkw auf die Kraftstoffkosten.

? Was kann man tun, um die Spritkosten möglichst gering zu halten?

Den größten Einfluss auf den Spritverbrauch eines Fahrzeugs hat, sofern man die jeweilige Größe und Antriebskonfiguration eines Pkw als gegeben hinnimmt, das Fahrverhalten. Durch eine vorausschauende Fahrweise ohne extreme Beschleunigungen oder Verzögerungen, durch frühzeitiges Schalten in den nächst höheren Gang sowie den zurückhaltenden Einsatz von Nebenverbrauchern, wie etwa der Klimaanlage, können erhebliche Spriteinsparungen realisiert werden.

Darüber hinaus kann auch durch das Tanken zum richtigen Zeitpunkt Geld gespart werden, wie aus einer Langzeitstudie des Automobilclubs ADAC hervor geht. Die niedrigsten Spritpreise an den Tankstellen sind demnach am frühen Abend zwischen 18 und 20 Uhr zu erwarten. Laut der Markttransparenzstelle (MTS) zufolge kann ein Autofahrer in einer Stadt im Schnitt 15 bis 20 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff sparen, wenn er die günstigste Tankstelle zum günstigsten Zeitpunkt des Tages anfährt.

Als Faustregel gilt, dass früh morgens der Sprit am teuersten ist und der Preis im Tagesverlauf eher fällt, da die Tankstellen häufig versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu unterbieten.

In den Nachtstunden wiederum sind die Preise meist hoch, weil einige - vor allem freie - Tankstellen schließen und die durchgehend geöffneten Stationen diese fehlende Konkurrenz meist nutzen, um einen höheren Preis zu verlangen. Was die Wochentage betrifft, so ist der Sonntag eine Ausnahme, denn sonntags sind die Preisschwankungen meist sehr gering.

Generell gilt, dass das Tanken am Sonntagabend nicht so billig und in der Sonntagnacht nicht so teuer ist wie zu den gleichen Zeiten von Montag bis Samstag.

? Woher bezieht Deutschland sein Rohöl?

Nach den Statistiken des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Technologie betrugen die Rohölimporte nach Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren rund 95 Millionen Tonnen (2012: 93,4 Mio. Tonnen). Der Löwenanteil, nämlich 37,1 Prozent des importierten Rohöls, kam aus Russland; die weiteren großen Lieferanten waren Großbritannien (14,2 Prozent), Norwegen (10,0 Prozent), Libyen (9,2 Prozent) und Nigeria (7,1 Prozent). Aus dem Nahen Osten (Saudi-Arabien, Irak, Iran) stammten nach Angaben des Ministeriums im Jahr 2012 lediglich 4,2 Prozent der Rohöl-Gesamteinfuhr.

Mysterium Spritpreis - so tanken Sie günstig

Einmal voll tanken für einen Euro - der Traum eines jeden Autofahrers. Und er ist seit fast zwanzig Jahren Wirklichkeit: allerdings in Venezuela. Dort wird der Treibstoff zu 90 Prozent vom Staat subventioniert, was dazu führt, dass ein Liter Benzin umgerechnet weniger als zwei Cent kostet. Davon können deutsche Autofahrer nur träumen. Im vergangenen Jahr kostete ein Liter Benzin in Deutschland 1,549 Euro für Super E10 und 1,420 für Diesel. Seit Ende August 2013 müssen mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen in Deutschland ihre aktuellen Preise melden. Wie sich der Spritpreis zusammensetzt, wodurch er beeinflusst wird und wie man die Spritkosten möglichst gering halten kann - das wird im Folgenden kurz und bündig erklärt.

? Wie setzt sich der Benzinpreis zusammen?

Den größten Anteil am Benzinpreis machen Steuern aus, nämliche die Energiesteuer von 65,45 Cent pro Liter sowie die 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer. Hinzu kommt der Produktpreis, der für Europa an der Rohöl-Börse des Hafens in Rotterdam ermittelt wird, wo auch die Preise für Benzin, Diesel und Heizöl festgelegt werden. Des weiteren schlagen die Mineralölgesellschaften und Tankstellen ihre jeweiligen Betriebs- und Lagerkosten auf den Preis auf.

Hier ein Beispiel: Im Januar dieses Jahres kostete ein Liter Benzin für Autofahrer durchschnittlich 151,9 Cent pro Liter. Dieser Betrag setzt sich zusammen aus: 65,45 Cent Energiesteuer, zirka 51 Cent Produktpreis, 24,25 Cent Mehrwertsteuer und rund 11 Cent, die als Deckungsbeitrag bezeichnet werden. In diesen 11 Cent sind unter anderem die Betriebskosten und der Gewinn der Tankstellen enthalten.

? Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die Benzinpreise?

Der Benzinpreis unterliegt laufenden Schwankungen und variiert inzwischen mehrmals täglich. Die Preisentwicklung wird dabei vom Rohölpreis, von der Fördermenge, von der weltweiten Nachfrage, vom Wechselkurs des Euro (denn Rohöl wird in Dollar gehandelt), dem von den Mineralölgesellschaften festgelegten Produktpreis und dazu von globalen, politischen und ökonomischen Entwicklungen beeinflusst.

Steigt der Preis pro Barrel Rohöl (ein Barrel sind exakt 158,987 Liter) auf dem Weltmarkt, steigt auch der Preis des Benzins an den heimischen Tankstellen.

Ein Barrel der für den europäischen Rohölmarkt wichtigen Nordseesorte Brent kostete Anfang 2009 noch 40 Dollar, aktuell sind es rund 90 Dollar.

? Ist der Benzinpreis verantwortlich für steigende Mobilitätskosten?

Nach Angaben des Verbraucherpreisindex des Statistischen Bundesamts stiegen die Preise für die allgemeinen Mobilitätskosten im Zeitraum von 2009 bis 2013 um mehr als zehn Prozent. Dieser Preisanstieg liegt jedoch nicht allein daran, dass im gleichen Zeitraum die Preise für Diesel und Benzin um mehr als 23 Prozent gestiegen sind.

Denn zusätzlich kletterten auch die weiteren Betriebskosten für einen Pkw - etwa Reparaturen, Inspektionen sowie Kfz-Versicherungen - um durchschnittlich jeweils gut acht Prozent. Teurer wurden in diesem Zeitraum zudem Gebrauchtwagen (+0,8%), Neuwagen (+2,8 %) sowie Ersatzteile und Pflegemittel (+5,5%). Insgesamt entfällt etwa ein Drittel der gesamten Betriebskosten eines Pkw auf die Kraftstoffkosten.

? Was kann man tun, um die Spritkosten möglichst gering zu halten?

Den größten Einfluss auf den Spritverbrauch eines Fahrzeugs hat, sofern man die jeweilige Größe und Antriebskonfiguration eines Pkw als gegeben hinnimmt, das Fahrverhalten. Durch eine vorausschauende Fahrweise ohne extreme Beschleunigungen oder Verzögerungen, durch frühzeitiges Schalten in den nächst höheren Gang sowie den zurückhaltenden Einsatz von Nebenverbrauchern, wie etwa der Klimaanlage, können erhebliche Spriteinsparungen realisiert werden.

Darüber hinaus kann auch durch das Tanken zum richtigen Zeitpunkt Geld gespart werden, wie aus einer Langzeitstudie des Automobilclubs ADAC hervor geht. Die niedrigsten Spritpreise an den Tankstellen sind demnach am frühen Abend zwischen 18 und 20 Uhr zu erwarten. Laut der Markttransparenzstelle (MTS) zufolge kann ein Autofahrer in einer Stadt im Schnitt 15 bis 20 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff sparen, wenn er die günstigste Tankstelle zum günstigsten Zeitpunkt des Tages anfährt.

Als Faustregel gilt, dass früh morgens der Sprit am teuersten ist und der Preis im Tagesverlauf eher fällt, da die Tankstellen häufig versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu unterbieten.

In den Nachtstunden wiederum sind die Preise meist hoch, weil einige - vor allem freie - Tankstellen schließen und die durchgehend geöffneten Stationen diese fehlende Konkurrenz meist nutzen, um einen höheren Preis zu verlangen. Was die Wochentage betrifft, so ist der Sonntag eine Ausnahme, denn sonntags sind die Preisschwankungen meist sehr gering.

Generell gilt, dass das Tanken am Sonntagabend nicht so billig und in der Sonntagnacht nicht so teuer ist wie zu den gleichen Zeiten von Montag bis Samstag.

? Woher bezieht Deutschland sein Rohöl?

Nach den Statistiken des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Technologie betrugen die Rohölimporte nach Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren rund 95 Millionen Tonnen (2012: 93,4 Mio. Tonnen). Der Löwenanteil, nämlich 37,1 Prozent des importierten Rohöls, kam aus Russland; die weiteren großen Lieferanten waren Großbritannien (14,2 Prozent), Norwegen (10,0 Prozent), Libyen (9,2 Prozent) und Nigeria (7,1 Prozent). Aus dem Nahen Osten (Saudi-Arabien, Irak, Iran) stammten nach Angaben des Ministeriums im Jahr 2012 lediglich 4,2 Prozent der Rohöl-Gesamteinfuhr.

? Lohnen sich Benzinpreis-Apps?

Wer sparen will, muss Preise vergleichen. Wie für zahlreiche Konsumgüter gibt es auch für Treibstoff entsprechende Spritpreisvergleich-Apps für das Smartphone. Angeblich informiert sich jeder vierte Deutsche auf diese Weise über die aktuellen Spritpreise.

In unserem Bußgeldrechner können Sie das Vergehen auswählen und vorab herausfinden, welche Konsequenzen Ihnen drohen.





Seit 1958 landen Verkehrsteilnehmer, die der Straßenverkehrsordnung grob zuwider handeln, im Verkehrszentralregister des Kraftfahrtbundesamtes in Flensburg. Im Zuge einer Reform heißt die Sammelstelle ab 1. Mai 2014 Fahreignungsregister und parallel dazu tritt auch ein neuer Bußgeldkatalog in Kraft.

Die wichtigsten Fragen rund um die Neuordnung beantwortet SPIEGEL ONLINE:

Was ändert sich am Punktesystem?

Ab dem 1. Mai 2014 gilt in Flensburg ein neues Punktesystem. Verstöße werden je nach Schwere künftig nur noch mit 1 bis 3 Punkten geahndet, statt wie bisher mit 1 bis 7 Punkten. Allerdings wird der Führerschein künftig bereits ab 8 Punkten eingezogen, statt wie bisher bei 18 Punkten. Die bereits vorhandenen Punkte werden zum Stichtag 1. Mai umgerechnet, und zwar folgendermaßen: 1 bis 3 ""alte"" Punkte entsprechen künftig 1 Punkt im neuen System, 4 oder 5 Punkte werden zu 2 Punkten, 6 oder 7 Punkte zu 3 Punkten, 8 bis 10 Punkte zu 4 Punkten, 11 bis 13 Punkte zu 5 Punkten, 14 oder 15 Punkte zu 6 Punkten und 16 oder 17 Punkte zu 7 Punkten im neuen System umgerechnet.

Was wird im Verkehrszentralregister eingetragen?

Als Verkehrsteilnehmer erhält man einen Eintrag im neuen Fahreignungsregister in Flensburg, sobald man entweder eine Ordnungswidrigkeit begangen hat, die laut Verkehrsrecht im Bußgeldkatlog nach der neuen Regelung ab dem 1. Mai 2014 mit einem Bußgeld von 60 Euro (derzeit: 40 Euro) oder mehr geahndet wird. In diesem Fall werden automatisch auch ein oder mehrere Punkte eingetragen. Punkte kassiert ebenso, wer eine Straftat in Zusammenhang mit dem Führen eines Kfz begangen und damit die Verkehrssicherheit direkt gefährdet hat. Hierzu zählen beispielsweise das Fahren ohne Fahrerlaubnis, Trunkenheit am Steuer oder Fahrerflucht.

Was wird nach der Reform am 1. Mai 2014 nicht mehr eingetragen?

Entsprechend der Vereinfachung des Punktesystems werden künftig nur noch Verkehrsverstöße im neuen Fahreignungsregister gespeichert, die als gefährlich eingestuft werden. Ordnungswidrigkeiten wie etwa das unerlaubte Befahren einer Umweltzone ziehen künftig keinen Eintrag mehr nach sich. Auch Straftaten wie Beleidigung im Straßenverkehr werden künftig nicht mehr im Register vermerkt.

Damit die nicht mehr eintragungspflichtigen Verstöße nicht als Kavaliersdelikte wahrgenommen werden, wurden die entsprechenden Bußgelder zum Teil drastisch erhöht. Das unberechtigte Befahren einer Umweltzone etwa kostet künftig 80 Euro, das Missachten des Fußgänger-Vorrechts an einem Zebrastreifen 120 Euro (obwohl in beiden Fällen keine Punkte eingetragen werden).

Was bedeutet die Neuerung für bestehende Eintragungen im Register?

Bestehende Verstöße, die nach dem neuen Recht nicht mehr eingetragen würden, werden zum 1. Mai 2014 automatisch gelöscht. Ein Beispiel: Aktuell weist ein Konto 10 Punkte auf, von denen 5 aufgrund von Beleidigung im Straßenverkehr erteilt wurden. Da dieser Tatbestand nach der neuen Regelung nicht mehr eintragungsfähig ist, werden diese Punkte gelöscht und das Konto schrumpft auf 5 Punkte. Diese werden ins neue System umgerechnet und belaufen sich dann noch auf 2 Punkte. Aufgrund dieser Erlassung könnten nach Schätzung des Autoclubs ""Mobil in Deutschland"" von den derzeit rund 9 Millionen eingetragenen Verkehrssündern etwa 1 Million ganz aus der Kartei verschwinden.

Wie viele Punkte gibt es für Verkehrsverstöße?

Derzeit werden für Ordnungswidrigkeiten je nach Schwere 1 bis 4 Punkte und für Straftaten 5 bis 7 Punkte eingetragen. Mit der Neuregelung gelten künftig drei Abstufungen: Einen Punkt gibt es für Ordnungswidrigkeiten, 2 Punkte für grobe Ordnungswidrigkeiten mit Regelfahrverbot sowie für Straftaten ohne Entziehung der Fahrerlaubnis. Eine Straftat mit Entziehung der Fahrerlaubnis wird mit der Eintragung von 3 Punkten geahndet.

Wie erfahre ich meinen Punktestand?

Jeder Autofahrer hat das Recht auf eine kostenlose Auskunft über seinen Punktestand im Fahreignungsregister. Dabei müssen jedoch gewisse Formalitäten beachtet werden. So kann der Antrag ausschließlich schriftlich per Post, nicht aber per Fax gestellt werden. Auch telefonische Auskünfte sind nicht möglich. Das zur Abfrage notwendige Formular gibt es auf der Homepage des Kraftfahrtbundesamtes (KBA). Der Personalausweis muss in Kopie mitgeschickt oder vor Ort vorgezeigt werden. Wer schon einen neuen Personalausweis mit Datenchip hat, kann den Kontostand auch online abfragen.

Wie ändern sich die Tilgungsfristen?

Derzeit bleiben Ordnungswidrigkeiten 2 Jahre, Straftaten 5 Jahre und Straftaten mit Fahrerlaubnisentzug mindestens 10 Jahre eingetragen. Neue Verkehrsverstöße können dabei zur Verlängerung der Eintragungsdauer von bis zu 5 Jahren führen. Die neue Regelung sieht starre Tilgungsfristen vor, die sich nicht durch neue Eintragungen verlängern. Ordnungswidrigkeiten mit einem Punkt bleiben künftig 2,5 Jahre eingetragen. Ordnungswidrigkeiten oder Straftaten die mit 2 Punkten belegt wurden bleiben jeweils 5 Jahre und Straftaten mit 3 Punkten 10 Jahre im Register bestehen.

Ist ein Abbau der Punkte möglich?

Die Möglichkeit, Punkte abzubauen bleibt auch nach neuem Recht bestehen: Bei einem Stand von 1 bis 5 Punkten kann durch die freiwillige Teilnahme an einem etwa 400 ? teuren Fahreignungsseminar 1 Punkt abgebaut werden. Wer noch nach altem Recht ein Aufbauseminar oder eine verkehrspsychologische Schulung freiwillig absolviert hat, dessen Rabatt wird bei der Umstellung der alten Punkte berücksichtigt. Punkte durch eine freiwillige Seminarteilnahme können allerdings nur einmal binnen fünf Jahren abgebaut werden.

Was ändert sich mit dem neuen Bußgeldkatalog?

Das bisherige Bußgeldsystem gehört zu einem der kompliziertesten Bereiche des Straßenverkehrsrechts. Der neue Bußgeldkatalog soll einfacher, gerechter und transparenter werden und dazu auf eine Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit abzielen. Die Eintragungsgrenze für Delikte, die einen Eintrag ins Register und somit auch Punkte nach sich ziehen, wird von 40 Euro auf 60 Euro angehoben.

Welche Verstöße werden mit der Punktereform teurer?

Um möglichst alle Verstöße, die die Verkehrssicherheit stark gefährden, künftig ins Fahreignungsregister eintragen zu können, werden die entsprechenden Bußgelder auf mindestens 60 Euro angehoben. Beispielsweise beim Telefonieren mit dem Mobiltelefon am Steuer, der Verstoß gegen die Winterreifenpflicht oder die Missachtung der Kindersicherungspflicht künftig mit 60 statt bislang mit 40 Euro geahndet. Beim Missachten der Vorfahrt, dem Fahren ohne Zulassung oder einem Versäumnis der Hauptuntersuchung von mehr als 8 Monaten müssen statt bisher 50 dann 70 Euro Bußgeld gezahlt werden.

Bußgelder für überhöhte Geschwindigkeit

Tempoüberschreitungen innerorts von bis zu 20 km/h kosten maximal 35 Euro, ab 21 km/h Überschreitung werden 80 Euro Bußgeld und ein Punkt fällig. Ab 31 km/h zu viel auf dem Tacho steigt das Bußgeld auf 160 Euro, es werden 2 Punkte eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen außerorts bis 20 km/h kosten 30 Euro, ab 21km/h steigt das Bußgeld auf 70 Euro und es wird 1 Punkt eingetragen und ab 41 km/h zu viel werden 160 Euro fällig, zwei Punkte eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Bußgelder für Rotlichtverstöße

Wer bei rot über eine Ampel fährt, zahlt 90 Euro und bekommt 1 Punkt. Steht die Ampel bei Überquerung schon länger als eine Sekunde auf rot, kostet es 200 Euro, 2 Punkte werden eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Bußgelder bei Alkohol oder Drogen am Steuer

Fahren im Rauschzustand wird richtig teuer. Wer sich mit 0,5 Promille oder mehr hinters Lenkrad setzt oder unter Drogeneinfluss ein Auto fährt, muss mit einem Bußgeld von 500 Euro und der Eintragung von 2 Punkten rechnen, dazu kommt noch ein einmonatiges Fahrverbot. Bei Wiederholung in beiden Fällen steigt die Strafe auf 1000 Euro, 2 Punkte und drei Monate Fahrverbot.

Wie und wann kann man Widerspruch einlegen?

Innerhalb von zwei Wochen ab Zustellung kann sowohl gegen einen Bußgeldbescheid als auch gegen einen Strafbefehl Einspruch eingelegt werden. Wird diese Frist nicht beachtet, wird der Bescheid rechtskräftig. Wurde Einspruch eingelegt, entscheidet ein Gericht den Fall - es sei denn, die Behörde gibt dem Einspruch statt oder der Beschuldigte zieht den Einspruch vorher zurück.",,,

Allerdings, beim Verlassen meines Zimmers murmelte er sich in seinen nicht vorhandenen Bart: ""Und dem will ich wirklich mal meine Klinik übergeben?""



Schlimmer war die Affaire mit der Reinemachefrau. Noch in der Schweiz, Samstagsdienst, kaum ""Kundschaft"". Also sortierte ich endlich mal meine Patientenakten in noch zu diktieren, korrekturzulesen und nur noch zu unterschreiben - alle schön gestapelt auf meiner Untersuchungsliege.



Als ich am Montag Morgen mein Zimmer betrat, traf mich beinahe der Schlag, alle Akten lagen zwar noch auf der Liege, aber wieder völlig durcheinander! Die Reinemachefrau hatte die Liege geputzt und die Aktenstapel hatten ihr im Weg gelegen ...



Gut, etwas abgeregt erklärte ich ihr so ruhig wie irgend möglich, dass sie in meinem Zimmer kein einziges Blatt Papier mehr berühren dürfe, solange es nicht im Mülleimer wäre, und selbst wenn es zusammengeknüllt mitten auf dem Fussboden liegen sollte. Aber das war auch der allerletzte Versuch, Ordnung halten zu wollen!",,,

Mysterium Spritpreis - so tanken Sie günstig

Einmal voll tanken für einen Euro - der Traum eines jeden Autofahrers. Und er ist seit fast zwanzig Jahren Wirklichkeit: allerdings in Venezuela. Dort wird der Treibstoff zu 90 Prozent vom Staat subventioniert, was dazu führt, dass ein Liter Benzin umgerechnet weniger als zwei Cent kostet. Davon können deutsche Autofahrer nur träumen. Im vergangenen Jahr kostete ein Liter Benzin in Deutschland 1,549 Euro für Super E10 und 1,420 für Diesel. Seit Ende August 2013 müssen mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen in Deutschland ihre aktuellen Preise melden. Wie sich der Spritpreis zusammensetzt, wodurch er beeinflusst wird und wie man die Spritkosten möglichst gering halten kann - das wird im Folgenden kurz und bündig erklärt.

? Wie setzt sich der Benzinpreis zusammen?

Den größten Anteil am Benzinpreis machen Steuern aus, nämliche die Energiesteuer von 65,45 Cent pro Liter sowie die 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer. Hinzu kommt der Produktpreis, der für Europa an der Rohöl-Börse des Hafens in Rotterdam ermittelt wird, wo auch die Preise für Benzin, Diesel und Heizöl festgelegt werden. Des weiteren schlagen die Mineralölgesellschaften und Tankstellen ihre jeweiligen Betriebs- und Lagerkosten auf den Preis auf.

Hier ein Beispiel: Im Januar dieses Jahres kostete ein Liter Benzin für Autofahrer durchschnittlich 151,9 Cent pro Liter. Dieser Betrag setzt sich zusammen aus: 65,45 Cent Energiesteuer, zirka 51 Cent Produktpreis, 24,25 Cent Mehrwertsteuer und rund 11 Cent, die als Deckungsbeitrag bezeichnet werden. In diesen 11 Cent sind unter anderem die Betriebskosten und der Gewinn der Tankstellen enthalten.

? Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die Benzinpreise?

Der Benzinpreis unterliegt laufenden Schwankungen und variiert inzwischen mehrmals täglich. Die Preisentwicklung wird dabei vom Rohölpreis, von der Fördermenge, von der weltweiten Nachfrage, vom Wechselkurs des Euro (denn Rohöl wird in Dollar gehandelt), dem von den Mineralölgesellschaften festgelegten Produktpreis und dazu von globalen, politischen und ökonomischen Entwicklungen beeinflusst.

Steigt der Preis pro Barrel Rohöl (ein Barrel sind exakt 158,987 Liter) auf dem Weltmarkt, steigt auch der Preis des Benzins an den heimischen Tankstellen.

Ein Barrel der für den europäischen Rohölmarkt wichtigen Nordseesorte Brent kostete Anfang 2009 noch 40 Dollar, aktuell sind es rund 90 Dollar.

? Ist der Benzinpreis verantwortlich für steigende Mobilitätskosten?

Nach Angaben des Verbraucherpreisindex des Statistischen Bundesamts stiegen die Preise für die allgemeinen Mobilitätskosten im Zeitraum von 2009 bis 2013 um mehr als zehn Prozent. Dieser Preisanstieg liegt jedoch nicht allein daran, dass im gleichen Zeitraum die Preise für Diesel und Benzin um mehr als 23 Prozent gestiegen sind.

Denn zusätzlich kletterten auch die weiteren Betriebskosten für einen Pkw - etwa Reparaturen, Inspektionen sowie Kfz-Versicherungen - um durchschnittlich jeweils gut acht Prozent. Teurer wurden in diesem Zeitraum zudem Gebrauchtwagen (+0,8%), Neuwagen (+2,8 %) sowie Ersatzteile und Pflegemittel (+5,5%). Insgesamt entfällt etwa ein Drittel der gesamten Betriebskosten eines Pkw auf die Kraftstoffkosten.

? Was kann man tun, um die Spritkosten möglichst gering zu halten?

Den größten Einfluss auf den Spritverbrauch eines Fahrzeugs hat, sofern man die jeweilige Größe und Antriebskonfiguration eines Pkw als gegeben hinnimmt, das Fahrverhalten. Durch eine vorausschauende Fahrweise ohne extreme Beschleunigungen oder Verzögerungen, durch frühzeitiges Schalten in den nächst höheren Gang sowie den zurückhaltenden Einsatz von Nebenverbrauchern, wie etwa der Klimaanlage, können erhebliche Spriteinsparungen realisiert werden.

Darüber hinaus kann auch durch das Tanken zum richtigen Zeitpunkt Geld gespart werden, wie aus einer Langzeitstudie des Automobilclubs ADAC hervor geht. Die niedrigsten Spritpreise an den Tankstellen sind demnach am frühen Abend zwischen 18 und 20 Uhr zu erwarten. Laut der Markttransparenzstelle (MTS) zufolge kann ein Autofahrer in einer Stadt im Schnitt 15 bis 20 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff sparen, wenn er die günstigste Tankstelle zum günstigsten Zeitpunkt des Tages anfährt.

Als Faustregel gilt, dass früh morgens der Sprit am teuersten ist und der Preis im Tagesverlauf eher fällt, da die Tankstellen häufig versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu unterbieten.

In den Nachtstunden wiederum sind die Preise meist hoch, weil einige - vor allem freie - Tankstellen schließen und die durchgehend geöffneten Stationen diese fehlende Konkurrenz meist nutzen, um einen höheren Preis zu verlangen. Was die Wochentage betrifft, so ist der Sonntag eine Ausnahme, denn sonntags sind die Preisschwankungen meist sehr gering.

Generell gilt, dass das Tanken am Sonntagabend nicht so billig und in der Sonntagnacht nicht so teuer ist wie zu den gleichen Zeiten von Montag bis Samstag.

? Woher bezieht Deutschland sein Rohöl?

Nach den Statistiken des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Technologie betrugen die Rohölimporte nach Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren rund 95 Millionen Tonnen (2012: 93,4 Mio. Tonnen). Der Löwenanteil, nämlich 37,1 Prozent des importierten Rohöls, kam aus Russland; die weiteren großen Lieferanten waren Großbritannien (14,2 Prozent), Norwegen (10,0 Prozent), Libyen (9,2 Prozent) und Nigeria (7,1 Prozent). Aus dem Nahen Osten (Saudi-Arabien, Irak, Iran) stammten nach Angaben des Ministeriums im Jahr 2012 lediglich 4,2 Prozent der Rohöl-Gesamteinfuhr.

? Lohnen sich Benzinpreis-Apps?

Wer sparen will, muss Preise vergleichen. Wie für zahlreiche Konsumgüter gibt es auch für Treibstoff entsprechende Spritpreisvergleich-Apps für das Smartphone. Angeblich informiert sich jeder vierte Deutsche auf diese Weise über die aktuellen Spritpreise.

Doch auch wenn solche Apps eine günstige Tankstelle in der näheren Umgebung anzeigen - der Umweg wegen geringer Preisunterschiede ist nicht immer sinnvoll und wirklich billiger. Ein Beispiel: Beträgt der Unterschied beim Preis pro Liter zweier Tankstellen zwei Cent, bringt das bei einer Tankfüllung von 50 Liter exakt einen Euro Ersparnis. Angenommen, der betankte Wagen verbraucht im Schnitt 6,5 Liter pro 100 Kilometer, ist bei einem Umweg von zehn Kilometern zur billigeren Tankstelle die Ersparnis durch den Mehrverbrauch schon wieder verloren.",,,

Der Blödsinn ist nun mal so. Ich habe mich nicht geirrt und habe es auch geprüft. Im Internet kann man es kaufen. In dem Shopsystem steht bei 1 Stück: 20 USD/Stück und bei 100 Stück sinkt der Preis wegen dem Mengenrabatt auf 0,01 USD/Stück. Dort steht dann nicht der Preis von 10 USD (den man falsch zuordnen könnte) sondern wirklich 0,01 USD. Der Preis ist absoluter Blödsinn, aber es ist Realität. Das ist kein Rechenfehler und hat weder etwas mit Fake-News, noch Populisten oder Dummies zu tun. Vielleicht macht das dieser Hersteller nur als Werbung, um gegen die Konkurrenz in allen Ländern (einschließlich China) zu kämpfen. Damit schafft er alle anderen ab und bleibt als einziger übrig.



Aber das ist nun nicht das erste mal. Bei einem anderen Produkt habe ich es schon im Dezember erfahren müssen. Da kostet ein Produkt in China bisher 30 Euro. Und nun gibt es ein ähnliches Produkt für 1,99 Euro versandkostenfrei aus China.



Andere Produkte, die aus Billigländern kamen, haben üblicherweise 20 bis 30 Euro pro Stück gekostet. Dieser Preis galt auch bei Markenherstellern in China. Nun kommen von anderen Herstellern die ""Kopien"" für 2,80 Euro auch versandkostenfrei über ebay aus China. Und wenn es nach vier Wochen kaputt geht, bekommt man den Ersatz nochmal versandkostenfrei.

http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/service/brutto-netto-rechner-was-von-ihrem-lohn-noch-uebrig-bleibt-a-223811.html,"['Spiegel Online', 'Hamburg']",,[],,"Das Gehalt für den neuen Job hört sich gut an. Doch wie viel Geld bleibt netto davon übrig? Welche Steuerklasse ist die günstigste, wenn beide Ehepartner arbeiten? Und wie wirkt sich ein Kinderfreibetrag aus?

All diese Fragen lassen sich mit dem Brutto-Netto-Rechner beantworten. Tragen Sie einfach Ihren Bruttolohn und Freibetrag ein, wählen Sie Steuerklasse, Bundesland und Krankenkasse. Falls Sie Kinder haben, geben Sie mögliche Kinderfreibeträge an. Je mehr Angaben Sie machen, desto genauer ist das Ergebnis.

In Kooperation mit Steuerfachanwalt Disqué

Brutto-Arbeitslohn Euro (Jahres-)Freibetrag Euro Jahr 2017 2016 2015 2014 Zeitraum Monat Jahr Steuerklasse I II III IV V VI Faktor (nur bei Stk 4) Kirchensteuerpflichtig ja nein Bundesland Baden-Württemberg Bayern Berlin Brandenburg Bremen Hamburg Hessen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Niedersachsen Nordrhein-Westfalen Rheinland-Pfalz Saarland Sachsen Sachsen-Anhalt Schleswig-Holstein Thüringen Krankenkasse Gesetzlich versichert Privat versichert ohne Arbeitgeberzuschuss Privat versichert mit Arbeitgeberzuschuss Arbeitnehmerbeitrag zur privaten Krankenkasse Euro Kassensatz (nur gesetzliche KK) Zusatzbeitragssatz gesetzl. KK Rentenversicherungspflicht ja (West) ja (Ost) nein Kinderfreibeträge 0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 4 4,5 5 5,5 6 Kinder ja nein Geburtsjahr (vierstellig)

Für die Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit der Tabelle sowie des ermittelten Auswertungsergebnisses wird keine Gewährleistung übernommen.

Um den Rechner benutzen zu können, müssen Sie zunächst ihre Lohnsteuerklasse kennen. Hier eine kurze Übersicht, in welche Klasse Sie gehören.

Die Lohnsteuerklasse I gilt für die folgenden Arbeitnehmer:

-Ledige

-Verwitwete ab dem übernächsten Jahr nach dem Tod des Ehepartners oder eingetragenen Lebenspartners

-Geschiedene

-Verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende, die dauernd getrennt leben

-Verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende, deren Ehegatte oder eingetragener Lebenspartner in der Bundesrepublik nur beschränkt steuerpflichtig ist (in der Regel, weil er oder sie nicht in Deutschland lebt)

Die Lohnsteuerklasse II gilt für Alleinerziehende, die die Voraussetzungen der Steuerklasse I erfüllen und die zusätzlich Anspruch auf den Entlastungsbetrag für Alleinerziehende haben.

In die Lohnsteuerklasse III fallen folgende Arbeitnehmer:

-Verheiratete und eingetragene Lebenspartner, die nicht dauernd getrennt leben und nicht die Steuerklasse IV gewählt haben. Der ebenfalls berufstätige Ehepartner oder Lebenspartner erhält dann die Steuerklasse V. Wenn der andere Partner nicht berufstätig oder selbstständig ist, gilt für ihn ebenfalls die Lohnsteuerklasse III.

-Verwitwete bis zum Ende des auf den Tod des Ehegatten/Lebenspartners folgenden Kalenderjahres. Der verstorbene Ehegatte oder Lebenspartner muss zum Zeitpunkt seines Todes unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig gewesen sein. Die Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner dürfen bis zum Zeitpunkt des Todes nicht dauernd getrennt gelebt haben.

In die Lohnsteuerklasse IV fallen verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende Arbeitnehmer, wenn beide Partner unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig sind und nicht dauernd getrennt leben. Wenn allerdings für einen Partner die Steuerklasse III gilt, fällt der andere nicht in Steuerklasse IV, sondern in Steuerklasse V. Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner, die beide berufstätig sind, können die Steuerklasse einmal im Jahr ändern lassen.

Die Steuerklasse V wird angewendet, wenn beide Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner beantragen, den jeweils anderen Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner in die Steuerklasse III einzureihen (siehe oben)

Die Lohnsteuerklasse VI wird in der Regel eingetragen, wenn ein Arbeitnehmer mehr als ein Arbeitsverhältnis hat.

Wie ändern sich Ihre Finanzen, wenn Sie Ihr Leben ändern?

Mit Hilfe dieses Rechners können Sie zum Beispiel schnell und unkompliziert herausfinden, wie sich ein Jobwechsel oder eine Gehaltserhöhung auf Ihr Nettogehalt auswirken. So vermeiden sie Überraschungen, wenn sie dann tatsächlich die ersten neue Gehaltsabrechnung in Händen halten. Auch andere Veränderungen im Leben lassen sich mit Hilfe des Rechners auf ihre finanziellen Auswirkungen hin abklopfen.

Sie wollen heiraten? Dann müssen Sie sich zusammen mit Ihrem Partner überlegen, in welchen Steuerklassen Sie arbeiten wollen: Entweder der eine in III oder der andere in V oder beide in IV. Die Steuerklasse IV für beide Partner ist empfehlenswert, wenn beide ähnlich viel verdienen. Sonst eher die Kombination aus III für den einen Partner und V für den anderen. Die Steuerklassen unterscheiden sich aber nur dadurch, wie viel Steuer monatlich automatisch vom Gehalt abgezogen wird. Wer zu viel gezahlt hat, bekommt das Geld einmal im Jahr nach Abgabe seiner Steuererklärung zurück.

Sie erwarten ein Kind? Dann erhöht sich in der Regel ihr Nettogehalt durch Kinderfreibeträge und ein höheres Kindergeld.

Sie sind vom Glauben abgefallen? Dann können Sie überprüfen, ob die gesparte Kirchensteuer den Verzicht aufs ewige Seelenheil wett machen kann.

Sie erwägen, von der gesetzlichen in die private Krankenkasse wechseln? Wenn sie wissen, welchen Beitragssatz ihre neue Versicherung verlangt, können Sie anhand des Rechners überprüfen, wie sich dadurch ihr Netto-Gehalt verändert.

Allerdings sollten Sie die Frage der richtigen Krankenversicherung auf keinen Fall allein von steuerlichen Erwägungen abhängig machen. Die mögliche Steuerersparnis fällt gering aus gegenüber den gewaltigen Kosten, die eine schlecht gewählte private Krankenversicherung im Laufe der Jahre verursacht. Welche Versicherungen für Sie generell sinnvoll sind, finden Sie in unserem Überblick.

Die allermeisten Möglichkeiten zur Steuerersparnis erschließen sich nur dem, der auch eine Steuererklärung abgibt. Gerade für junge Arbeitnehmer kann das eine ziemliche Herausforderung sein. Eine Hilfestellung finden Sie hier.",,,

Doch wie viel Geld bleibt netto davon übrig? Welche Steuerklasse ist die günstigste, wenn beide Ehepartner arbeiten? Und wie wirkt sich ein Kinderfreibetrag aus?

All diese Fragen lassen sich mit dem Brutto-Netto-Rechner beantworten. Tragen Sie einfach Ihren Bruttolohn und Freibetrag ein, wählen Sie Steuerklasse, Bundesland und Krankenkasse. Falls Sie Kinder haben, geben Sie mögliche Kinderfreibeträge an. Je mehr Angaben Sie machen, desto genauer ist das Ergebnis.

In Kooperation mit Steuerfachanwalt Disqué

Brutto-Arbeitslohn Euro (Jahres-)Freibetrag Euro Jahr 2017 2016 2015 2014 Zeitraum Monat Jahr Steuerklasse I II III IV V VI Faktor (nur bei Stk 4) Kirchensteuerpflichtig ja nein Bundesland Baden-Württemberg Bayern Berlin Brandenburg Bremen Hamburg Hessen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Niedersachsen Nordrhein-Westfalen Rheinland-Pfalz Saarland Sachsen Sachsen-Anhalt Schleswig-Holstein Thüringen Krankenkasse Gesetzlich versichert Privat versichert ohne Arbeitgeberzuschuss Privat versichert mit Arbeitgeberzuschuss Arbeitnehmerbeitrag zur privaten Krankenkasse Euro Kassensatz (nur gesetzliche KK) Zusatzbeitragssatz gesetzl. KK Rentenversicherungspflicht ja (West) ja (Ost) nein Kinderfreibeträge 0 0,5 1 1,5 2 2,5 3 3,5 4 4,5 5 5,5 6 Kinder ja nein Geburtsjahr (vierstellig)

Für die Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit der Tabelle sowie des ermittelten Auswertungsergebnisses wird keine Gewährleistung übernommen.

Um den Rechner benutzen zu können, müssen Sie zunächst ihre Lohnsteuerklasse kennen. Hier eine kurze Übersicht, in welche Klasse Sie gehören.

Die Lohnsteuerklasse I gilt für die folgenden Arbeitnehmer:

-Ledige

-Verwitwete ab dem übernächsten Jahr nach dem Tod des Ehepartners oder eingetragenen Lebenspartners

-Geschiedene

-Verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende, die dauernd getrennt leben

-Verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende, deren Ehegatte oder eingetragener Lebenspartner in der Bundesrepublik nur beschränkt steuerpflichtig ist (in der Regel, weil er oder sie nicht in Deutschland lebt)

Die Lohnsteuerklasse II gilt für Alleinerziehende, die die Voraussetzungen der Steuerklasse I erfüllen und die zusätzlich Anspruch auf den Entlastungsbetrag für Alleinerziehende haben.

In die Lohnsteuerklasse III fallen folgende Arbeitnehmer:

-Verheiratete und eingetragene Lebenspartner, die nicht dauernd getrennt leben und nicht die Steuerklasse IV gewählt haben. Der ebenfalls berufstätige Ehepartner oder Lebenspartner erhält dann die Steuerklasse V. Wenn der andere Partner nicht berufstätig oder selbstständig ist, gilt für ihn ebenfalls die Lohnsteuerklasse III.

-Verwitwete bis zum Ende des auf den Tod des Ehegatten/Lebenspartners folgenden Kalenderjahres. Der verstorbene Ehegatte oder Lebenspartner muss zum Zeitpunkt seines Todes unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig gewesen sein. Die Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner dürfen bis zum Zeitpunkt des Todes nicht dauernd getrennt gelebt haben.

In die Lohnsteuerklasse IV fallen verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende Arbeitnehmer, wenn beide Partner unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig sind und nicht dauernd getrennt leben. Wenn allerdings für einen Partner die Steuerklasse III gilt, fällt der andere nicht in Steuerklasse IV, sondern in Steuerklasse V. Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner, die beide berufstätig sind, können die Steuerklasse einmal im Jahr ändern lassen.

Die Steuerklasse V wird angewendet, wenn beide Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner beantragen, den jeweils anderen Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner in die Steuerklasse III einzureihen (siehe oben)

Die Lohnsteuerklasse VI wird in der Regel eingetragen, wenn ein Arbeitnehmer mehr als ein Arbeitsverhältnis hat.

Wie ändern sich Ihre Finanzen, wenn Sie Ihr Leben ändern?

Mit Hilfe dieses Rechners können Sie zum Beispiel schnell und unkompliziert herausfinden, wie sich ein Jobwechsel oder eine Gehaltserhöhung auf Ihr Nettogehalt auswirken. So vermeiden sie Überraschungen, wenn sie dann tatsächlich die ersten neue Gehaltsabrechnung in Händen halten. Auch andere Veränderungen im Leben lassen sich mit Hilfe des Rechners auf ihre finanziellen Auswirkungen hin abklopfen.

Sie wollen heiraten? Dann müssen Sie sich zusammen mit Ihrem Partner überlegen, in welchen Steuerklassen Sie arbeiten wollen: Entweder der eine in III oder der andere in V oder beide in IV. Die Steuerklasse IV für beide Partner ist empfehlenswert, wenn beide ähnlich viel verdienen. Sonst eher die Kombination aus III für den einen Partner und V für den anderen. Die Steuerklassen unterscheiden sich aber nur dadurch, wie viel Steuer monatlich automatisch vom Gehalt abgezogen wird. Wer zu viel gezahlt hat, bekommt das Geld einmal im Jahr nach Abgabe seiner Steuererklärung zurück.

Sie erwarten ein Kind? Dann erhöht sich in der Regel ihr Nettogehalt durch Kinderfreibeträge und ein höheres Kindergeld.

Sie sind vom Glauben abgefallen? Dann können Sie überprüfen, ob die gesparte Kirchensteuer den Verzicht aufs ewige Seelenheil wett machen kann.

Sie erwägen, von der gesetzlichen in die private Krankenkasse wechseln? Wenn sie wissen, welchen Beitragssatz ihre neue Versicherung verlangt, können Sie anhand des Rechners überprüfen, wie sich dadurch ihr Netto-Gehalt verändert.

Allerdings sollten Sie die Frage der richtigen Krankenversicherung auf keinen Fall allein von steuerlichen Erwägungen abhängig machen. Die mögliche Steuerersparnis fällt gering aus gegenüber den gewaltigen Kosten, die eine schlecht gewählte private Krankenversicherung im Laufe der Jahre verursacht. Welche Versicherungen für Sie generell sinnvoll sind, finden Sie in unserem Überblick.

Die allermeisten Möglichkeiten zur Steuerersparnis erschließen sich nur dem, der auch eine Steuererklärung abgibt. Gerade für junge Arbeitnehmer kann das eine ziemliche Herausforderung sein. Eine Hilfestellung finden Sie hier.",,,

Forderungen nach Herausnahme von Wäldern aus der Bewirtschaftung sind deshalb einfach nur dumm, da umweltschädlich. Ein Wald ist nun mal mehr als nur Produktionsfläche für Holz, er ist Lebensraum für Tiere, andere Pflanzen, sauerstoffspender und Erholungsgebiet. Reine Nutzwälder sind tote Fichtenmonokulturen die alle paar Jahrzehnte komplett abgeholzt werden. Das beste ist ein nachhaltig bewirtschafteter Wald, und ab und zu ein paar Flächen die nicht bewirtschaftet werden schaden nicht wirklich. Unterm Strich ist es für die Natur besser ein paar grüne Inseln übrigzulassen als mit aller Gewalt abzuholzen um CO² einzusparen.

Mysterium Spritpreis - so tanken Sie günstig

Einmal voll tanken für einen Euro - der Traum eines jeden Autofahrers. Und er ist seit fast zwanzig Jahren Wirklichkeit: allerdings in Venezuela. Dort wird der Treibstoff zu 90 Prozent vom Staat subventioniert, was dazu führt, dass ein Liter Benzin umgerechnet weniger als zwei Cent kostet. Davon können deutsche Autofahrer nur träumen. Im vergangenen Jahr kostete ein Liter Benzin in Deutschland 1,549 Euro für Super E10 und 1,420 für Diesel. Seit Ende August 2013 müssen mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen in Deutschland ihre aktuellen Preise melden. Wie sich der Spritpreis zusammensetzt, wodurch er beeinflusst wird und wie man die Spritkosten möglichst gering halten kann - das wird im Folgenden kurz und bündig erklärt.

? Wie setzt sich der Benzinpreis zusammen?

Den größten Anteil am Benzinpreis machen Steuern aus, nämliche die Energiesteuer von 65,45 Cent pro Liter sowie die 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer. Hinzu kommt der Produktpreis, der für Europa an der Rohöl-Börse des Hafens in Rotterdam ermittelt wird, wo auch die Preise für Benzin, Diesel und Heizöl festgelegt werden. Des weiteren schlagen die Mineralölgesellschaften und Tankstellen ihre jeweiligen Betriebs- und Lagerkosten auf den Preis auf.

Hier ein Beispiel: Im Januar dieses Jahres kostete ein Liter Benzin für Autofahrer durchschnittlich 151,9 Cent pro Liter. Dieser Betrag setzt sich zusammen aus: 65,45 Cent Energiesteuer, zirka 51 Cent Produktpreis, 24,25 Cent Mehrwertsteuer und rund 11 Cent, die als Deckungsbeitrag bezeichnet werden. In diesen 11 Cent sind unter anderem die Betriebskosten und der Gewinn der Tankstellen enthalten.

? Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die Benzinpreise?

Der Benzinpreis unterliegt laufenden Schwankungen und variiert inzwischen mehrmals täglich. Die Preisentwicklung wird dabei vom Rohölpreis, von der Fördermenge, von der weltweiten Nachfrage, vom Wechselkurs des Euro (denn Rohöl wird in Dollar gehandelt), dem von den Mineralölgesellschaften festgelegten Produktpreis und dazu von globalen, politischen und ökonomischen Entwicklungen beeinflusst.

Steigt der Preis pro Barrel Rohöl (ein Barrel sind exakt 158,987 Liter) auf dem Weltmarkt, steigt auch der Preis des Benzins an den heimischen Tankstellen.

Ein Barrel der für den europäischen Rohölmarkt wichtigen Nordseesorte Brent kostete Anfang 2009 noch 40 Dollar, aktuell sind es rund 90 Dollar.

? Ist der Benzinpreis verantwortlich für steigende Mobilitätskosten?

Nach Angaben des Verbraucherpreisindex des Statistischen Bundesamts stiegen die Preise für die allgemeinen Mobilitätskosten im Zeitraum von 2009 bis 2013 um mehr als zehn Prozent. Dieser Preisanstieg liegt jedoch nicht allein daran, dass im gleichen Zeitraum die Preise für Diesel und Benzin um mehr als 23 Prozent gestiegen sind.

Denn zusätzlich kletterten auch die weiteren Betriebskosten für einen Pkw - etwa Reparaturen, Inspektionen sowie Kfz-Versicherungen - um durchschnittlich jeweils gut acht Prozent. Teurer wurden in diesem Zeitraum zudem Gebrauchtwagen (+0,8%), Neuwagen (+2,8 %) sowie Ersatzteile und Pflegemittel (+5,5%). Insgesamt entfällt etwa ein Drittel der gesamten Betriebskosten eines Pkw auf die Kraftstoffkosten.

? Was kann man tun, um die Spritkosten möglichst gering zu halten?

Den größten Einfluss auf den Spritverbrauch eines Fahrzeugs hat, sofern man die jeweilige Größe und Antriebskonfiguration eines Pkw als gegeben hinnimmt, das Fahrverhalten. Durch eine vorausschauende Fahrweise ohne extreme Beschleunigungen oder Verzögerungen, durch frühzeitiges Schalten in den nächst höheren Gang sowie den zurückhaltenden Einsatz von Nebenverbrauchern, wie etwa der Klimaanlage, können erhebliche Spriteinsparungen realisiert werden.

Darüber hinaus kann auch durch das Tanken zum richtigen Zeitpunkt Geld gespart werden, wie aus einer Langzeitstudie des Automobilclubs ADAC hervor geht. Die niedrigsten Spritpreise an den Tankstellen sind demnach am frühen Abend zwischen 18 und 20 Uhr zu erwarten. Laut der Markttransparenzstelle (MTS) zufolge kann ein Autofahrer in einer Stadt im Schnitt 15 bis 20 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff sparen, wenn er die günstigste Tankstelle zum günstigsten Zeitpunkt des Tages anfährt.

Als Faustregel gilt, dass früh morgens der Sprit am teuersten ist und der Preis im Tagesverlauf eher fällt, da die Tankstellen häufig versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu unterbieten.

In den Nachtstunden wiederum sind die Preise meist hoch, weil einige - vor allem freie - Tankstellen schließen und die durchgehend geöffneten Stationen diese fehlende Konkurrenz meist nutzen, um einen höheren Preis zu verlangen. Was die Wochentage betrifft, so ist der Sonntag eine Ausnahme, denn sonntags sind die Preisschwankungen meist sehr gering.

Generell gilt, dass das Tanken am Sonntagabend nicht so billig und in der Sonntagnacht nicht so teuer ist wie zu den gleichen Zeiten von Montag bis Samstag.

? Woher bezieht Deutschland sein Rohöl?

Nach den Statistiken des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Technologie betrugen die Rohölimporte nach Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren rund 95 Millionen Tonnen (2012: 93,4 Mio. Tonnen). Der Löwenanteil, nämlich 37,1 Prozent des importierten Rohöls, kam aus Russland; die weiteren großen Lieferanten waren Großbritannien (14,2 Prozent), Norwegen (10,0 Prozent), Libyen (9,2 Prozent) und Nigeria (7,1 Prozent). Aus dem Nahen Osten (Saudi-Arabien, Irak, Iran) stammten nach Angaben des Ministeriums im Jahr 2012 lediglich 4,2 Prozent der Rohöl-Gesamteinfuhr.

? Lohnen sich Benzinpreis-Apps?

Wer sparen will, muss Preise vergleichen. Wie für zahlreiche Konsumgüter gibt es auch für Treibstoff entsprechende Spritpreisvergleich-Apps für das Smartphone. Angeblich informiert sich jeder vierte Deutsche auf diese Weise über die aktuellen Spritpreise.

Doch auch wenn solche Apps eine günstige Tankstelle in der näheren Umgebung anzeigen - der Umweg wegen geringer Preisunterschiede ist nicht immer sinnvoll und wirklich billiger. Ein Beispiel: Beträgt der Unterschied beim Preis pro Liter zweier Tankstellen zwei Cent, bringt das bei einer Tankfüllung von 50 Liter exakt einen Euro Ersparnis. Angenommen, der betankte Wagen verbraucht im Schnitt 6,5 Liter pro 100 Kilometer, ist bei einem Umweg von zehn Kilometern zur billigeren Tankstelle die Ersparnis durch den Mehrverbrauch schon wieder verloren.",,,

Nein, das kann nichts sein. Alle vier bis fünf Jahre darf man seine Stimme abgeben - an wen, wenn einem an jeder Partei manches gefällt und manches nicht? - und gut ist's.



Und dann wundert man sich, warum es immer mehr Nichtwähler gibt und die politischen Ränder immer weiter anwachsen? Mich wundert das nicht im geringsten.

Mysterium Spritpreis - so tanken Sie günstig

Einmal voll tanken für einen Euro - der Traum eines jeden Autofahrers. Und er ist seit fast zwanzig Jahren Wirklichkeit: allerdings in Venezuela. Dort wird der Treibstoff zu 90 Prozent vom Staat subventioniert, was dazu führt, dass ein Liter Benzin umgerechnet weniger als zwei Cent kostet. Davon können deutsche Autofahrer nur träumen. Im vergangenen Jahr kostete ein Liter Benzin in Deutschland 1,549 Euro für Super E10 und 1,420 für Diesel. Seit Ende August 2013 müssen mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen in Deutschland ihre aktuellen Preise melden. Wie sich der Spritpreis zusammensetzt, wodurch er beeinflusst wird und wie man die Spritkosten möglichst gering halten kann - das wird im Folgenden kurz und bündig erklärt.

? Wie setzt sich der Benzinpreis zusammen?

Den größten Anteil am Benzinpreis machen Steuern aus, nämliche die Energiesteuer von 65,45 Cent pro Liter sowie die 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer. Hinzu kommt der Produktpreis, der für Europa an der Rohöl-Börse des Hafens in Rotterdam ermittelt wird, wo auch die Preise für Benzin, Diesel und Heizöl festgelegt werden. Des weiteren schlagen die Mineralölgesellschaften und Tankstellen ihre jeweiligen Betriebs- und Lagerkosten auf den Preis auf.

Hier ein Beispiel: Im Januar dieses Jahres kostete ein Liter Benzin für Autofahrer durchschnittlich 151,9 Cent pro Liter. Dieser Betrag setzt sich zusammen aus: 65,45 Cent Energiesteuer, zirka 51 Cent Produktpreis, 24,25 Cent Mehrwertsteuer und rund 11 Cent, die als Deckungsbeitrag bezeichnet werden. In diesen 11 Cent sind unter anderem die Betriebskosten und der Gewinn der Tankstellen enthalten.

? Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die Benzinpreise?

Der Benzinpreis unterliegt laufenden Schwankungen und variiert inzwischen mehrmals täglich. Die Preisentwicklung wird dabei vom Rohölpreis, von der Fördermenge, von der weltweiten Nachfrage, vom Wechselkurs des Euro (denn Rohöl wird in Dollar gehandelt), dem von den Mineralölgesellschaften festgelegten Produktpreis und dazu von globalen, politischen und ökonomischen Entwicklungen beeinflusst.

Steigt der Preis pro Barrel Rohöl (ein Barrel sind exakt 158,987 Liter) auf dem Weltmarkt, steigt auch der Preis des Benzins an den heimischen Tankstellen.

Ein Barrel der für den europäischen Rohölmarkt wichtigen Nordseesorte Brent kostete Anfang 2009 noch 40 Dollar, aktuell sind es rund 90 Dollar.

? Ist der Benzinpreis verantwortlich für steigende Mobilitätskosten?

Nach Angaben des Verbraucherpreisindex des Statistischen Bundesamts stiegen die Preise für die allgemeinen Mobilitätskosten im Zeitraum von 2009 bis 2013 um mehr als zehn Prozent. Dieser Preisanstieg liegt jedoch nicht allein daran, dass im gleichen Zeitraum die Preise für Diesel und Benzin um mehr als 23 Prozent gestiegen sind.

Denn zusätzlich kletterten auch die weiteren Betriebskosten für einen Pkw - etwa Reparaturen, Inspektionen sowie Kfz-Versicherungen - um durchschnittlich jeweils gut acht Prozent. Teurer wurden in diesem Zeitraum zudem Gebrauchtwagen (+0,8%), Neuwagen (+2,8 %) sowie Ersatzteile und Pflegemittel (+5,5%). Insgesamt entfällt etwa ein Drittel der gesamten Betriebskosten eines Pkw auf die Kraftstoffkosten.

? Was kann man tun, um die Spritkosten möglichst gering zu halten?

Den größten Einfluss auf den Spritverbrauch eines Fahrzeugs hat, sofern man die jeweilige Größe und Antriebskonfiguration eines Pkw als gegeben hinnimmt, das Fahrverhalten. Durch eine vorausschauende Fahrweise ohne extreme Beschleunigungen oder Verzögerungen, durch frühzeitiges Schalten in den nächst höheren Gang sowie den zurückhaltenden Einsatz von Nebenverbrauchern, wie etwa der Klimaanlage, können erhebliche Spriteinsparungen realisiert werden.

Darüber hinaus kann auch durch das Tanken zum richtigen Zeitpunkt Geld gespart werden, wie aus einer Langzeitstudie des Automobilclubs ADAC hervor geht. Die niedrigsten Spritpreise an den Tankstellen sind demnach am frühen Abend zwischen 18 und 20 Uhr zu erwarten. Laut der Markttransparenzstelle (MTS) zufolge kann ein Autofahrer in einer Stadt im Schnitt 15 bis 20 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff sparen, wenn er die günstigste Tankstelle zum günstigsten Zeitpunkt des Tages anfährt.

Als Faustregel gilt, dass früh morgens der Sprit am teuersten ist und der Preis im Tagesverlauf eher fällt, da die Tankstellen häufig versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu unterbieten.

In den Nachtstunden wiederum sind die Preise meist hoch, weil einige - vor allem freie - Tankstellen schließen und die durchgehend geöffneten Stationen diese fehlende Konkurrenz meist nutzen, um einen höheren Preis zu verlangen. Was die Wochentage betrifft, so ist der Sonntag eine Ausnahme, denn sonntags sind die Preisschwankungen meist sehr gering.

Generell gilt, dass das Tanken am Sonntagabend nicht so billig und in der Sonntagnacht nicht so teuer ist wie zu den gleichen Zeiten von Montag bis Samstag.

? Woher bezieht Deutschland sein Rohöl?

Nach den Statistiken des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Technologie betrugen die Rohölimporte nach Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren rund 95 Millionen Tonnen (2012: 93,4 Mio. Tonnen). Der Löwenanteil, nämlich 37,1 Prozent des importierten Rohöls, kam aus Russland; die weiteren großen Lieferanten waren Großbritannien (14,2 Prozent), Norwegen (10,0 Prozent), Libyen (9,2 Prozent) und Nigeria (7,1 Prozent). Aus dem Nahen Osten (Saudi-Arabien, Irak, Iran) stammten nach Angaben des Ministeriums im Jahr 2012 lediglich 4,2 Prozent der Rohöl-Gesamteinfuhr.

? Lohnen sich Benzinpreis-Apps?

Wer sparen will, muss Preise vergleichen. Wie für zahlreiche Konsumgüter gibt es auch für Treibstoff entsprechende Spritpreisvergleich-Apps für das Smartphone. Angeblich informiert sich jeder vierte Deutsche auf diese Weise über die aktuellen Spritpreise.

Doch auch wenn solche Apps eine günstige Tankstelle in der näheren Umgebung anzeigen - der Umweg wegen geringer Preisunterschiede ist nicht immer sinnvoll und wirklich billiger. Ein Beispiel: Beträgt der Unterschied beim Preis pro Liter zweier Tankstellen zwei Cent, bringt das bei einer Tankfüllung von 50 Liter exakt einen Euro Ersparnis. Angenommen, der betankte Wagen verbraucht im Schnitt 6,5 Liter pro 100 Kilometer, ist bei einem Umweg von zehn Kilometern zur billigeren Tankstelle die Ersparnis durch den Mehrverbrauch schon wieder verloren.",,,

-Verheiratete und eingetragene Lebenspartner, die nicht dauernd getrennt leben und nicht die Steuerklasse IV gewählt haben. Der ebenfalls berufstätige Ehepartner oder Lebenspartner erhält dann die Steuerklasse V. Wenn der andere Partner nicht berufstätig oder selbstständig ist, gilt für ihn ebenfalls die Lohnsteuerklasse III.

-Verwitwete bis zum Ende des auf den Tod des Ehegatten/Lebenspartners folgenden Kalenderjahres. Der verstorbene Ehegatte oder Lebenspartner muss zum Zeitpunkt seines Todes unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig gewesen sein. Die Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner dürfen bis zum Zeitpunkt des Todes nicht dauernd getrennt gelebt haben.

In die Lohnsteuerklasse IV fallen verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende Arbeitnehmer, wenn beide Partner unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig sind und nicht dauernd getrennt leben. Wenn allerdings für einen Partner die Steuerklasse III gilt, fällt der andere nicht in Steuerklasse IV, sondern in Steuerklasse V. Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner, die beide berufstätig sind, können die Steuerklasse einmal im Jahr ändern lassen.

Die Steuerklasse V wird angewendet, wenn beide Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner beantragen, den jeweils anderen Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner in die Steuerklasse III einzureihen (siehe oben)

Die Lohnsteuerklasse VI wird in der Regel eingetragen, wenn ein Arbeitnehmer mehr als ein Arbeitsverhältnis hat.

Wie ändern sich Ihre Finanzen, wenn Sie Ihr Leben ändern?

Mit Hilfe dieses Rechners können Sie zum Beispiel schnell und unkompliziert herausfinden, wie sich ein Jobwechsel oder eine Gehaltserhöhung auf Ihr Nettogehalt auswirken. So vermeiden sie Überraschungen, wenn sie dann tatsächlich die ersten neue Gehaltsabrechnung in Händen halten. Auch andere Veränderungen im Leben lassen sich mit Hilfe des Rechners auf ihre finanziellen Auswirkungen hin abklopfen.

Sie wollen heiraten? Dann müssen Sie sich zusammen mit Ihrem Partner überlegen, in welchen Steuerklassen Sie arbeiten wollen: Entweder der eine in III oder der andere in V oder beide in IV. Die Steuerklasse IV für beide Partner ist empfehlenswert, wenn beide ähnlich viel verdienen. Sonst eher die Kombination aus III für den einen Partner und V für den anderen. Die Steuerklassen unterscheiden sich aber nur dadurch, wie viel Steuer monatlich automatisch vom Gehalt abgezogen wird. Wer zu viel gezahlt hat, bekommt das Geld einmal im Jahr nach Abgabe seiner Steuererklärung zurück.

Sie erwarten ein Kind? Dann erhöht sich in der Regel ihr Nettogehalt durch Kinderfreibeträge und ein höheres Kindergeld.

Sie sind vom Glauben abgefallen? Dann können Sie überprüfen, ob die gesparte Kirchensteuer den Verzicht aufs ewige Seelenheil wett machen kann.

Sie erwägen, von der gesetzlichen in die private Krankenkasse wechseln? Wenn sie wissen, welchen Beitragssatz ihre neue Versicherung verlangt, können Sie anhand des Rechners überprüfen, wie sich dadurch ihr Netto-Gehalt verändert.

Allerdings sollten Sie die Frage der richtigen Krankenversicherung auf keinen Fall allein von steuerlichen Erwägungen abhängig machen. Die mögliche Steuerersparnis fällt gering aus gegenüber den gewaltigen Kosten, die eine schlecht gewählte private Krankenversicherung im Laufe der Jahre verursacht. Welche Versicherungen für Sie generell sinnvoll sind, finden Sie in unserem Überblick.

Die allermeisten Möglichkeiten zur Steuerersparnis erschließen sich nur dem, der auch eine Steuererklärung abgibt. Gerade für junge Arbeitnehmer kann das eine ziemliche Herausforderung sein. Eine Hilfestellung finden Sie hier.",,,

Vielleicht deshalb, weil die einen das wollen was die anderen schon haben? Mehr Mitsprache?



Wie schrieb Jakob Augstein in oben verlinkter Kolumne:



""Aus gutem Grund gibt es Parlamente: sie schützen die Demokratie vor dem Volk und das Volk vor sich selbst. Denn beim Volk, das ist eine paradoxe Wahrheit, ist die Demokratie nicht gut aufgehoben.""



Da muss was dran sein, wenn die Rechtspopulisten der Alternative die Forderung nach Volksabstimmungen seit ihrer Gründung in ihrem Forderungskatalog haben. Das kann ja nichts sein.



Nein, das kann nichts sein. Alle vier bis fünf Jahre darf man seine Stimme abgeben - an wen, wenn einem an jeder Partei manches gefällt und manches nicht? - und gut ist's.



Und dann wundert man sich, warum es immer mehr Nichtwähler gibt und die politischen Ränder immer weiter anwachsen? Mich wundert das nicht im geringsten.



Genau so wenig wie es mich wundert warum die politischen Eliten am liebsten eine weitere Zentralisierung und ein weiteres ""Zusammenwachsen"" in der EU hätten. Denn dann würde der Abstand zu den nervigen Bürgern weiter zunehmen. Ein, aus Sicht der Regierenden, durchaus zu begrüßender Vorgang.",,,

In unserem Bußgeldrechner können Sie das Vergehen auswählen und vorab herausfinden, welche Konsequenzen Ihnen drohen.





Seit 1958 landen Verkehrsteilnehmer, die der Straßenverkehrsordnung grob zuwider handeln, im Verkehrszentralregister des Kraftfahrtbundesamtes in Flensburg. Im Zuge einer Reform heißt die Sammelstelle ab 1. Mai 2014 Fahreignungsregister und parallel dazu tritt auch ein neuer Bußgeldkatalog in Kraft.

Die wichtigsten Fragen rund um die Neuordnung beantwortet SPIEGEL ONLINE:

Was ändert sich am Punktesystem?

Ab dem 1. Mai 2014 gilt in Flensburg ein neues Punktesystem. Verstöße werden je nach Schwere künftig nur noch mit 1 bis 3 Punkten geahndet, statt wie bisher mit 1 bis 7 Punkten. Allerdings wird der Führerschein künftig bereits ab 8 Punkten eingezogen, statt wie bisher bei 18 Punkten. Die bereits vorhandenen Punkte werden zum Stichtag 1. Mai umgerechnet, und zwar folgendermaßen: 1 bis 3 ""alte"" Punkte entsprechen künftig 1 Punkt im neuen System, 4 oder 5 Punkte werden zu 2 Punkten, 6 oder 7 Punkte zu 3 Punkten, 8 bis 10 Punkte zu 4 Punkten, 11 bis 13 Punkte zu 5 Punkten, 14 oder 15 Punkte zu 6 Punkten und 16 oder 17 Punkte zu 7 Punkten im neuen System umgerechnet.

Was wird im Verkehrszentralregister eingetragen?

Als Verkehrsteilnehmer erhält man einen Eintrag im neuen Fahreignungsregister in Flensburg, sobald man entweder eine Ordnungswidrigkeit begangen hat, die laut Verkehrsrecht im Bußgeldkatlog nach der neuen Regelung ab dem 1. Mai 2014 mit einem Bußgeld von 60 Euro (derzeit: 40 Euro) oder mehr geahndet wird. In diesem Fall werden automatisch auch ein oder mehrere Punkte eingetragen. Punkte kassiert ebenso, wer eine Straftat in Zusammenhang mit dem Führen eines Kfz begangen und damit die Verkehrssicherheit direkt gefährdet hat. Hierzu zählen beispielsweise das Fahren ohne Fahrerlaubnis, Trunkenheit am Steuer oder Fahrerflucht.

Was wird nach der Reform am 1. Mai 2014 nicht mehr eingetragen?

Entsprechend der Vereinfachung des Punktesystems werden künftig nur noch Verkehrsverstöße im neuen Fahreignungsregister gespeichert, die als gefährlich eingestuft werden. Ordnungswidrigkeiten wie etwa das unerlaubte Befahren einer Umweltzone ziehen künftig keinen Eintrag mehr nach sich. Auch Straftaten wie Beleidigung im Straßenverkehr werden künftig nicht mehr im Register vermerkt.

Damit die nicht mehr eintragungspflichtigen Verstöße nicht als Kavaliersdelikte wahrgenommen werden, wurden die entsprechenden Bußgelder zum Teil drastisch erhöht. Das unberechtigte Befahren einer Umweltzone etwa kostet künftig 80 Euro, das Missachten des Fußgänger-Vorrechts an einem Zebrastreifen 120 Euro (obwohl in beiden Fällen keine Punkte eingetragen werden).

Was bedeutet die Neuerung für bestehende Eintragungen im Register?

Bestehende Verstöße, die nach dem neuen Recht nicht mehr eingetragen würden, werden zum 1. Mai 2014 automatisch gelöscht. Ein Beispiel: Aktuell weist ein Konto 10 Punkte auf, von denen 5 aufgrund von Beleidigung im Straßenverkehr erteilt wurden. Da dieser Tatbestand nach der neuen Regelung nicht mehr eintragungsfähig ist, werden diese Punkte gelöscht und das Konto schrumpft auf 5 Punkte. Diese werden ins neue System umgerechnet und belaufen sich dann noch auf 2 Punkte. Aufgrund dieser Erlassung könnten nach Schätzung des Autoclubs ""Mobil in Deutschland"" von den derzeit rund 9 Millionen eingetragenen Verkehrssündern etwa 1 Million ganz aus der Kartei verschwinden.

Wie viele Punkte gibt es für Verkehrsverstöße?

Derzeit werden für Ordnungswidrigkeiten je nach Schwere 1 bis 4 Punkte und für Straftaten 5 bis 7 Punkte eingetragen. Mit der Neuregelung gelten künftig drei Abstufungen: Einen Punkt gibt es für Ordnungswidrigkeiten, 2 Punkte für grobe Ordnungswidrigkeiten mit Regelfahrverbot sowie für Straftaten ohne Entziehung der Fahrerlaubnis. Eine Straftat mit Entziehung der Fahrerlaubnis wird mit der Eintragung von 3 Punkten geahndet.

Wie erfahre ich meinen Punktestand?

Jeder Autofahrer hat das Recht auf eine kostenlose Auskunft über seinen Punktestand im Fahreignungsregister. Dabei müssen jedoch gewisse Formalitäten beachtet werden. So kann der Antrag ausschließlich schriftlich per Post, nicht aber per Fax gestellt werden. Auch telefonische Auskünfte sind nicht möglich. Das zur Abfrage notwendige Formular gibt es auf der Homepage des Kraftfahrtbundesamtes (KBA). Der Personalausweis muss in Kopie mitgeschickt oder vor Ort vorgezeigt werden. Wer schon einen neuen Personalausweis mit Datenchip hat, kann den Kontostand auch online abfragen.

Wie ändern sich die Tilgungsfristen?

Derzeit bleiben Ordnungswidrigkeiten 2 Jahre, Straftaten 5 Jahre und Straftaten mit Fahrerlaubnisentzug mindestens 10 Jahre eingetragen. Neue Verkehrsverstöße können dabei zur Verlängerung der Eintragungsdauer von bis zu 5 Jahren führen. Die neue Regelung sieht starre Tilgungsfristen vor, die sich nicht durch neue Eintragungen verlängern. Ordnungswidrigkeiten mit einem Punkt bleiben künftig 2,5 Jahre eingetragen. Ordnungswidrigkeiten oder Straftaten die mit 2 Punkten belegt wurden bleiben jeweils 5 Jahre und Straftaten mit 3 Punkten 10 Jahre im Register bestehen.

Ist ein Abbau der Punkte möglich?

Die Möglichkeit, Punkte abzubauen bleibt auch nach neuem Recht bestehen: Bei einem Stand von 1 bis 5 Punkten kann durch die freiwillige Teilnahme an einem etwa 400 ? teuren Fahreignungsseminar 1 Punkt abgebaut werden. Wer noch nach altem Recht ein Aufbauseminar oder eine verkehrspsychologische Schulung freiwillig absolviert hat, dessen Rabatt wird bei der Umstellung der alten Punkte berücksichtigt. Punkte durch eine freiwillige Seminarteilnahme können allerdings nur einmal binnen fünf Jahren abgebaut werden.

Was ändert sich mit dem neuen Bußgeldkatalog?

Das bisherige Bußgeldsystem gehört zu einem der kompliziertesten Bereiche des Straßenverkehrsrechts. Der neue Bußgeldkatalog soll einfacher, gerechter und transparenter werden und dazu auf eine Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit abzielen. Die Eintragungsgrenze für Delikte, die einen Eintrag ins Register und somit auch Punkte nach sich ziehen, wird von 40 Euro auf 60 Euro angehoben.

Welche Verstöße werden mit der Punktereform teurer?

Um möglichst alle Verstöße, die die Verkehrssicherheit stark gefährden, künftig ins Fahreignungsregister eintragen zu können, werden die entsprechenden Bußgelder auf mindestens 60 Euro angehoben. Beispielsweise beim Telefonieren mit dem Mobiltelefon am Steuer, der Verstoß gegen die Winterreifenpflicht oder die Missachtung der Kindersicherungspflicht künftig mit 60 statt bislang mit 40 Euro geahndet. Beim Missachten der Vorfahrt, dem Fahren ohne Zulassung oder einem Versäumnis der Hauptuntersuchung von mehr als 8 Monaten müssen statt bisher 50 dann 70 Euro Bußgeld gezahlt werden.

Bußgelder für überhöhte Geschwindigkeit

Tempoüberschreitungen innerorts von bis zu 20 km/h kosten maximal 35 Euro, ab 21 km/h Überschreitung werden 80 Euro Bußgeld und ein Punkt fällig. Ab 31 km/h zu viel auf dem Tacho steigt das Bußgeld auf 160 Euro, es werden 2 Punkte eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen außerorts bis 20 km/h kosten 30 Euro, ab 21km/h steigt das Bußgeld auf 70 Euro und es wird 1 Punkt eingetragen und ab 41 km/h zu viel werden 160 Euro fällig, zwei Punkte eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Bußgelder für Rotlichtverstöße

Wer bei rot über eine Ampel fährt, zahlt 90 Euro und bekommt 1 Punkt. Steht die Ampel bei Überquerung schon länger als eine Sekunde auf rot, kostet es 200 Euro, 2 Punkte werden eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Bußgelder bei Alkohol oder Drogen am Steuer

Fahren im Rauschzustand wird richtig teuer. Wer sich mit 0,5 Promille oder mehr hinters Lenkrad setzt oder unter Drogeneinfluss ein Auto fährt, muss mit einem Bußgeld von 500 Euro und der Eintragung von 2 Punkten rechnen, dazu kommt noch ein einmonatiges Fahrverbot. Bei Wiederholung in beiden Fällen steigt die Strafe auf 1000 Euro, 2 Punkte und drei Monate Fahrverbot.

Wie und wann kann man Widerspruch einlegen?

Innerhalb von zwei Wochen ab Zustellung kann sowohl gegen einen Bußgeldbescheid als auch gegen einen Strafbefehl Einspruch eingelegt werden. Wird diese Frist nicht beachtet, wird der Bescheid rechtskräftig. Wurde Einspruch eingelegt, entscheidet ein Gericht den Fall - es sei denn, die Behörde gibt dem Einspruch statt oder der Beschuldigte zieht den Einspruch vorher zurück.",,,

Mysterium Spritpreis - so tanken Sie günstig

Einmal voll tanken für einen Euro - der Traum eines jeden Autofahrers. Und er ist seit fast zwanzig Jahren Wirklichkeit: allerdings in Venezuela. Dort wird der Treibstoff zu 90 Prozent vom Staat subventioniert, was dazu führt, dass ein Liter Benzin umgerechnet weniger als zwei Cent kostet. Davon können deutsche Autofahrer nur träumen. Im vergangenen Jahr kostete ein Liter Benzin in Deutschland 1,549 Euro für Super E10 und 1,420 für Diesel. Seit Ende August 2013 müssen mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen in Deutschland ihre aktuellen Preise melden. Wie sich der Spritpreis zusammensetzt, wodurch er beeinflusst wird und wie man die Spritkosten möglichst gering halten kann - das wird im Folgenden kurz und bündig erklärt.

? Wie setzt sich der Benzinpreis zusammen?

Den größten Anteil am Benzinpreis machen Steuern aus, nämliche die Energiesteuer von 65,45 Cent pro Liter sowie die 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer. Hinzu kommt der Produktpreis, der für Europa an der Rohöl-Börse des Hafens in Rotterdam ermittelt wird, wo auch die Preise für Benzin, Diesel und Heizöl festgelegt werden. Des weiteren schlagen die Mineralölgesellschaften und Tankstellen ihre jeweiligen Betriebs- und Lagerkosten auf den Preis auf.

Hier ein Beispiel: Im Januar dieses Jahres kostete ein Liter Benzin für Autofahrer durchschnittlich 151,9 Cent pro Liter. Dieser Betrag setzt sich zusammen aus: 65,45 Cent Energiesteuer, zirka 51 Cent Produktpreis, 24,25 Cent Mehrwertsteuer und rund 11 Cent, die als Deckungsbeitrag bezeichnet werden. In diesen 11 Cent sind unter anderem die Betriebskosten und der Gewinn der Tankstellen enthalten.

? Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die Benzinpreise?

Der Benzinpreis unterliegt laufenden Schwankungen und variiert inzwischen mehrmals täglich. Die Preisentwicklung wird dabei vom Rohölpreis, von der Fördermenge, von der weltweiten Nachfrage, vom Wechselkurs des Euro (denn Rohöl wird in Dollar gehandelt), dem von den Mineralölgesellschaften festgelegten Produktpreis und dazu von globalen, politischen und ökonomischen Entwicklungen beeinflusst.

Steigt der Preis pro Barrel Rohöl (ein Barrel sind exakt 158,987 Liter) auf dem Weltmarkt, steigt auch der Preis des Benzins an den heimischen Tankstellen.

Ein Barrel der für den europäischen Rohölmarkt wichtigen Nordseesorte Brent kostete Anfang 2009 noch 40 Dollar, aktuell sind es rund 90 Dollar.

? Ist der Benzinpreis verantwortlich für steigende Mobilitätskosten?

Nach Angaben des Verbraucherpreisindex des Statistischen Bundesamts stiegen die Preise für die allgemeinen Mobilitätskosten im Zeitraum von 2009 bis 2013 um mehr als zehn Prozent. Dieser Preisanstieg liegt jedoch nicht allein daran, dass im gleichen Zeitraum die Preise für Diesel und Benzin um mehr als 23 Prozent gestiegen sind.

Denn zusätzlich kletterten auch die weiteren Betriebskosten für einen Pkw - etwa Reparaturen, Inspektionen sowie Kfz-Versicherungen - um durchschnittlich jeweils gut acht Prozent. Teurer wurden in diesem Zeitraum zudem Gebrauchtwagen (+0,8%), Neuwagen (+2,8 %) sowie Ersatzteile und Pflegemittel (+5,5%). Insgesamt entfällt etwa ein Drittel der gesamten Betriebskosten eines Pkw auf die Kraftstoffkosten.

? Was kann man tun, um die Spritkosten möglichst gering zu halten?

Den größten Einfluss auf den Spritverbrauch eines Fahrzeugs hat, sofern man die jeweilige Größe und Antriebskonfiguration eines Pkw als gegeben hinnimmt, das Fahrverhalten. Durch eine vorausschauende Fahrweise ohne extreme Beschleunigungen oder Verzögerungen, durch frühzeitiges Schalten in den nächst höheren Gang sowie den zurückhaltenden Einsatz von Nebenverbrauchern, wie etwa der Klimaanlage, können erhebliche Spriteinsparungen realisiert werden.

Darüber hinaus kann auch durch das Tanken zum richtigen Zeitpunkt Geld gespart werden, wie aus einer Langzeitstudie des Automobilclubs ADAC hervor geht. Die niedrigsten Spritpreise an den Tankstellen sind demnach am frühen Abend zwischen 18 und 20 Uhr zu erwarten. Laut der Markttransparenzstelle (MTS) zufolge kann ein Autofahrer in einer Stadt im Schnitt 15 bis 20 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff sparen, wenn er die günstigste Tankstelle zum günstigsten Zeitpunkt des Tages anfährt.

Als Faustregel gilt, dass früh morgens der Sprit am teuersten ist und der Preis im Tagesverlauf eher fällt, da die Tankstellen häufig versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu unterbieten.

In den Nachtstunden wiederum sind die Preise meist hoch, weil einige - vor allem freie - Tankstellen schließen und die durchgehend geöffneten Stationen diese fehlende Konkurrenz meist nutzen, um einen höheren Preis zu verlangen. Was die Wochentage betrifft, so ist der Sonntag eine Ausnahme, denn sonntags sind die Preisschwankungen meist sehr gering.

Generell gilt, dass das Tanken am Sonntagabend nicht so billig und in der Sonntagnacht nicht so teuer ist wie zu den gleichen Zeiten von Montag bis Samstag.

? Woher bezieht Deutschland sein Rohöl?

Nach den Statistiken des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Technologie betrugen die Rohölimporte nach Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren rund 95 Millionen Tonnen (2012: 93,4 Mio. Tonnen). Der Löwenanteil, nämlich 37,1 Prozent des importierten Rohöls, kam aus Russland; die weiteren großen Lieferanten waren Großbritannien (14,2 Prozent), Norwegen (10,0 Prozent), Libyen (9,2 Prozent) und Nigeria (7,1 Prozent). Aus dem Nahen Osten (Saudi-Arabien, Irak, Iran) stammten nach Angaben des Ministeriums im Jahr 2012 lediglich 4,2 Prozent der Rohöl-Gesamteinfuhr.

? Lohnen sich Benzinpreis-Apps?

Wer sparen will, muss Preise vergleichen. Wie für zahlreiche Konsumgüter gibt es auch für Treibstoff entsprechende Spritpreisvergleich-Apps für das Smartphone. Angeblich informiert sich jeder vierte Deutsche auf diese Weise über die aktuellen Spritpreise.

Doch auch wenn solche Apps eine günstige Tankstelle in der näheren Umgebung anzeigen - der Umweg wegen geringer Preisunterschiede ist nicht immer sinnvoll und wirklich billiger. Ein Beispiel: Beträgt der Unterschied beim Preis pro Liter zweier Tankstellen zwei Cent, bringt das bei einer Tankfüllung von 50 Liter exakt einen Euro Ersparnis. Angenommen, der betankte Wagen verbraucht im Schnitt 6,5 Liter pro 100 Kilometer, ist bei einem Umweg von zehn Kilometern zur billigeren Tankstelle die Ersparnis durch den Mehrverbrauch schon wieder verloren.",,,

Daran erkennt man die Unfähigkeit dieses Hobbykochs, dass immerzu die saisonalen Produkte ignoriert werden. Kann natürlich auch sein, dass er einfach nicht mit frischen Kürbissen oder Waldpilzen umgehen kann. Das kann er möglicherweise, aber er wird den Kürbis und die Pilze im Frühling zubereiten. Jetzt im Herbst kann das ja jeder. ;)

Schade, weil mal wieder eine gute Rezeptidee flöten gegangen ist: Lachs mit Mango und Kichererbsen ist eine schöne, ungewöhnliche Kombination. Spargel, Radieschen und rohe Zwiebel sind überflüssig oder übertönen alles andere. Die Zwiebel kann schön durchgeschmort werden, zuletzt gibt man die Mango zum Aufwärmen dazu, Chili und Knoblauch werden in dem Öl durchgegart und heraus genommen, in dem man dann den Lachs brät.

Die Kichererbsen würde ich mit der Gabel zum Teil zerdrücken, dann nehmen sie besser die anderen Aromen auf und kullern nicht von der Gabel. Die Radieschen... wenn man die frische Schärfe möchte, wie wär´s mit dem frischen Rettich von neulich, fein geraspelt? Ein paar Radieschenschnitze fallen aber geschmacklich aus der Kombination heraus.

Oben drüber würde ich allerhand Kräuter streuen ... Koriander, Petersilie und Dill, und ein Spritzer frische Zitrone zum Beispiel.

Die Gartengurke passt dann wieder gut und kann das Knackige beisteuern.

Schwupps, hat man eine eher warme als kalte Mahlzeit und kann sich beim Einkauf im viel beschworenen Asia-Markt mal Gedanken machen, wie das wohl schmecken würde, wenn man statt der Dosen-Kokosnuss eine der frischen Kokosnüsse verwenden würde... Die Milch für die Sauce und das weiche Fleisch herausgeschabt, frisch und zart zu den festen Kichererbsen und knackigen Gurken...

As the excitement starts to build ahead of the United Nations General Assembly’s annual high-level session – which sees Heads of State and Government and top ministers from nearly all Member States gather in New York to weigh in on the vital issues of the day – Secretary-General António Guterres sat down with UN News to talk about the role of the 72-year-old Organization in a world that is facing more challenges than ever.

Mr. Guterres, the Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, and the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, took up his post on 1 January this year. He has consistently pushed for, among others, increased diplomacy on nettlesome global issues, broad adherence to the aims of the landmark Paris climate accord, wider engagement with the world’s youth and dedicated efforts to ensure gender parity across the UN system.

Saying that the UN “must be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace,” the Secretary-General discusses how he is working with the international community to make parties to conflict see that “nobody is winning” in today’s devastating wars; to spotlight the links between climate change and sustainable development to ensure a globalized world that “leaves no one behind;” and to follow through on his deep belief that an equitable presence of both male and female colleagues makes organizations work better.

UN News: Mr. Secretary-General, with the new session of the General Assembly and its high-level debate coming up, what is the role of multilateralism in today’s world and what are you going to do to try to strengthen this role?

Secretary-General: We live in a world with global problems – climate change, terrorism, inequality – and there is no way we can solve [them] on a country-by-country basis. We see, more and more, that only global solutions can address global problems. And for global solutions to be possible, we need to have mechanisms of governance allowing countries to come together and manage together the problems of our times.

VIDEO: Secretary-General António Guterres talks with UN News about issues such as climate change, terrorism and inequality, as well as the role of the 72-year-old Organization.

And so multilateral organizations – like the UN, but also like many others… the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, regional organizations like the European Union, the African Union… they’re all essential to allow us to face the very dramatic challenges that are today threatening humankind.

UN News: With all of the challenges facing the world right now – terrorism, extremism, the refugee crisis – what’s your vision for the role the UN should be playing in today’s world?

The UN must, first of all, be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace

Secretary-General: The UN must, first of all, be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace and we are doing everything we can, facing all the crises that we have – from Mali to South Sudan to Libya to Central African Republic to Syria to Afghanistan to Somalia – to do everything we can to convince the parties to those conflicts and those that have leverage, that support the parties to the conflict, we are doing everything we can to convince them that these are wars that nobody is winning; everybody’s losing.

And it is absolutely essential that they forget their differences, their contradictions of interests and that they really come together to put an end to these tragic series of crises, violence and conflicts. Because these conflicts are also becoming more and more interlinked and more linked to global terrorism.

So we need to fight terrorists where they are, but we need to address the root causes of terrorism. That means solving conflicts, and at the same time, building cohesive societies where people can feel they belong, where they don’t feel discriminated [against] and respect human rights, to make sure that terrorist organizations have more and more difficulties recruiting people.

Youth unemployment, for instance. Youth unemployment in certain parts of the world is one of the most dramatic problems that facilitate the work of terrorist organizations recruiting people that have no future. So we need – in sustainable development, in human rights and in a peace and security approach – to combine all the UN instruments in order to be able to defeat terrorism.

UN News: We see the effects of climate change around the world. What’s your message to everyone involved – governments, civil society, citizens – about the phenomenon and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?

Secretary-General: First of all, climate change today is undeniable. I just came from my country, Portugal, where we are having a huge drought in the south. We’re seeing forest fires multiplying terribly. In the United States, as in Portugal and other parts of the world, we are seeing heat waves, we are seeing dramatic floods – Sierra Leone, India, Nepal – we always had floods in the past but now natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more intense and with more devastating consequences. We see deserts progressing. We see glaciers diminishing. We see the sea levels starting to rise. So it is clearly a threat to us all.

Second, to fight it we have today an important instrument – the Paris Agreement. We need to make sure that all countries commit themselves to that [accord]. And wherever countries are not able to do so at the government level, that the societies, the business communities, the cities, are able to lead the process and in this way, we can be able to meet the Paris Agreement, but with an increased ambition because Paris is not enough to be able to contain global warming at the level that is acceptable.

We need to see that there is a clear link between climate change and development

At the same time, we need to see that there is a clear link between climate change and development, and the sustainability of development. So, the 2030 Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, are the global programme accepted by all Member States to have a fair globalization. A globalization that leaves no one behind. Contrary to what has happened in the recent past where we see so many regions that are dramatically, negatively impacted by technological progress or globalization.

We need to make sure that globalization that has brought enormous advantages for humankind, that it leaves no one behind. That there is inclusivity and that there is sustainability for our children and our grandchildren also to benefit from what we are achieving today.

UN News: A question dear to me – gender parity. You promised gender parity, and to strengthen gender parity within the UN system when you assumed office. Looking back at these past months, are you satisfied with what the progress so far? And what are your plans?

Secretary-General: I’ve appointed members of the Senior Management Group, which is the top level of the United Nations, between appointments and the renewal of mandates we have done it with 19 women and 17 men, which means parity has been taken very seriously by me in the decisions I can make. And we will have, at the end of my mandate – this is a very strong commitment – at the level of the Assistant Secretaries-General and Under-Secretaries-General across the board, all over the Organization, full parity.

The Secretary-General speaks to journalists at a press encounter at UN Headquarters in August 2017. UN Photo/Mark Garten

We just approved a road map for parity that we will now submit to Member States in the areas where Member States need to take decisions aiming at reaching in 2023 in a majority of the areas of the UN, but for some that have more specific difficulties: in 2028, full parity for international staff across the board. So this is a strong commitment. And it’s not because this idea is now very much in the public debate. It’s because it’s my deep belief that organizations work much better when there is an equitable presence of both male and female colleagues.

UN News: In your youth, you stood up for the principles you believed in. What would you say to young people in today’s world who want to do something against racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and discrimination?

It’s my deep belief that organizations work much better when there is an equitable presence of both male and female colleagues

Secretary-General: I think that young people are exactly my hope because young people are much more cosmopolitan. They are much less prone to these irrational approaches of nationalism, of xenophobia, racism; they understand diversity is a richness; it’s not a threat. I hope that young people will push their societies, their communities, their governments to understand that they need to have policies of social cohesion, they need to have policies that allow for everyone to feel that his or her identity is respected but, at the same time, that they belong to the community as a whole.

UN News: People want to know you on the personal level. So I have a few questions to try to do that. You are a fan of history. Who are your favourite historic figures?

Secretary-General: Well I had two personalities that had a very, very important influence on my political life, both ideologically and in relation to the political attitude, political behaviour. One, in my youth, Olof Palme. Another, in the maturity of my life, Nelson Mandela. I think they correspond to a fantastic combination: on one side, the policies that are at the same time clearly oriented for equality, for a progressive view of the world, equality between people, equality between societies.

Olof Palme has made a fantastic contribution to the development of a progressive vision of his country and of international relations. And then Nelson Mandela is the very symbol of forgiveness, tolerance and the capacity to rebuild a society that was so deeply and so tragically divided.

UN News: Who is your favourite author and what is your favourite book?

Secretary-General: I am, as you said, a compulsive reader of history. There are two history authors that I really consider the best I’ve read. One is French, Georges Duby. He was an excellent medievalist. The other is British, A.J.P Taylor. But of course, I am Portuguese; I come from a country of poets. There is a Portuguese poet that I consider absolutely unique: Fernando Pessoa.

UN News: With all your responsibilities as the head of an Organization that people look up to for solutions in a complicated world, what do you do to de-stress? What do you do for fun?

Secretary-General: Well, I like music a lot. So I [listen to] music at home. I go to concerts, operas frequently. I am very fond of contemporary art, so here in New York is the best place in the world – the galleries in Chelsea and other parts, contemporary exhibitions in the different museums.

And at the same time, I love to travel – and to go and try to discover either aspects of cultural heritage or landscapes that are unusual, or to have contact with people that are different and can enrich us. So I would say these are probably the areas where I try to use my spare time to my own benefit.",,,

As the excitement starts to build ahead of the United Nations General Assembly’s annual high-level session – which sees Heads of State and Government and top ministers from nearly all Member States gather in New York to weigh in on the vital issues of the day – Secretary-General António Guterres sat down with UN News to talk about the role of the 72-year-old Organization in a world that is facing more challenges than ever.

Mr. Guterres, the Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, and the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, took up his post on 1 January this year. He has consistently pushed for, among others, increased diplomacy on nettlesome global issues, broad adherence to the aims of the landmark Paris climate accord, wider engagement with the world’s youth and dedicated efforts to ensure gender parity across the UN system.

Saying that the UN “must be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace,” the Secretary-General discusses how he is working with the international community to make parties to conflict see that “nobody is winning” in today’s devastating wars; to spotlight the links between climate change and sustainable development to ensure a globalized world that “leaves no one behind;” and to follow through on his deep belief that an equitable presence of both male and female colleagues makes organizations work better.

UN News: Mr. Secretary-General, with the new session of the General Assembly and its high-level debate coming up, what is the role of multilateralism in today’s world and what are you going to do to try to strengthen this role?

Secretary-General: We live in a world with global problems – climate change, terrorism, inequality – and there is no way we can solve [them] on a country-by-country basis. We see, more and more, that only global solutions can address global problems.
