http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/jeff-sessions-consulted-christian-legal-group-religious-freedom/story?id=50336322,"['Abc News', 'More Pete']",,[],,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions consulted Alliance Defending Freedom, a legal advocacy group that champions conservative Christian causes, ahead of issuing controversial guidance to government agencies and departments on Friday about how to interpret federal religious liberty protections.

Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a group whose stated mission is to “keep the doors open for the Gospel by advocating for religious liberty, the sanctity of life, and marriage and family,” hailed Sessions’ announcement, while a number of leading LGBT advocacy groups condemned the move for effectively offering a religious exemption for sexual orientation discrimination.

In a call with reporters, ADF CEO Michael Farris confirmed to ABC News that Sessions met with the group during a series of so-called “listening sessions” convened by the Attorney General, who says he was “seeking suggestions regarding the areas of federal protection for religious liberty most in need of clarification or guidance.”

Farris, who took over as CEO and general counsel of ADF in January, also lauded President Donald Trump for fulfilling a campaign promise.

“I commend the president for taking another step to honor his campaign promise to make religious liberty his ‘first priority’ by directing the Department of Justice to issue this guidance, which simply directs the federal government to adhere to its legal and constitutional obligation to respect existing religious freedom protections,” wrote Farris in a statement.

The Department of Justice did not respond to requests to release a list of the individuals and groups Sessions met with during his “listening sessions.”

ADF was founded in 1994 by a group of leading Christian evangelical leaders, including James Dobson of Focus on the Family, Bill Bright of Campus Crusade for Christ and Larry Burkett of Crown Financial Ministries. Since then, ADF has established itself as a leading litigation and appellate advocacy group for Christian right causes, including opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage, and social conservatives hail the group as champions of religious freedom.

Societal gains by LGBT people have long been in the group’s sights, however. Alan Sears, ADF’s longtime president, CEO and general counsel, cowrote a book in 2003 called ""The Homosexual Agenda: Exposing the Principal Threat to Religious Liberty Today,"" in which he argued that the repeal of anti-sodomy laws would lead to a roll back of ""laws against pedophilia, sex between close relatives, polygamy, bestiality and all other distortions and violations of God’s plan.”

ADF lawyers have argued several cases before the Supreme Court and are currently representing Colorado baker Jack Phillips, who is challenging the state’s nondiscrimination protections after he was found in violation of the law for refusing to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple in 2012. The U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to review the Phillips case. In a recent appearance on ABC’s “The View,” Phillips defended his actions: “I don’t believe that Jesus would have made a cake, if he would have been the baker,” he said.

The progressive Southern Poverty Law Center added ADF in 2016 to its “designated hate group” list, which includes a number of right-wing evangelical organizations, for what SPLC calls its “anti-LGBT ideology.” The SPLC said ADF “works to develop ‘religious liberty’ legislation and case law that will allow the denial of good and services to LGBT people on the basis of religion” and “has supported the recminalization of homosexuality in the U.S. and criminalization abroad.”

ADF has repeatedly disputed the Southern Poverty Law Center’s “hate group” designation as “a lie” and criticized news organizations, including ABC News, who make reference to it.

The group also has powerful conservative allies willing to come to their defense. Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, criticized ABC News for its coverage of the group in July, after ABC News reported that Sessions delivered a closed-door address to the group at their Summit on Religious Liberty in California, where he suggested, according to a text of the speech later published by the conservative website The Federalist, religion was “under attack.”

The SPLC, meanwhile, which has monitored hate groups throughout the United States for decades, continues to stand by its label, telling ABC News it’s “rightfully earned.”

On Friday, Sessions outlined 20 broad “principles” designed to ensure that “to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law, religious observance and practice should be accommodated in all government activity,” including a decree that “a governmental action substantially burdens an exercise of religion … if it compels an act inconsistent with that observance or practice, or substantially pressures the adherent to modify such observance or practice.”

For several leading LGBT advocates, the new guidance was an alarming effort to undermine sexual orientation discrimination protections, under the guise of affirming religious liberty, that could have far-reaching implications.

Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin and the first openly gay U.S. Senator, told ABC News that today’s guidance could pave the way for discrimination of vulnerable populations.

“I support religious freedom and the freedom of full equality for every American,” Baldwin said in a statement. “A license to discriminate goes against our core American values and I fear that the guidance the Justice Department issued today is not designed to help agencies comply with the law, but rather to give them greater leeway to condone discrimination against LGBTQ people, women and others.”

According to Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin, the new guidance makes millions of Americans vulnerable to discrimination.

“Today the Trump-Pence administration launched an all-out assault on LGBTQ people, women and other minority communities by unleashing a sweeping license to discriminate,” said Griffin in a statement. “This blatant attempt to further Donald Trump’s cynical and hateful agenda will enable systematic, government-wide discrimination that will have a devastating impact on LGBTQ people and their families.”

Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, argued that the new guidance rests on a misinterpretation of religious liberty.

“Today’s guidance by Jeff Sessions proves this Administration will do anything possible to categorize LGBTQ Americans as second-class citizens who are not equal under the law,” said Ellis in a statement. “Freedom of religion is paramount to our nation’s success, but does give people the right to impose their beliefs on others, to harm other, or to discriminate. Nothing could be more un-American and unholy that using religion to justify harm and discrimination to others.”

For David Dinielli, the deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center’s LGBT Rights Project, the ADF’s apparent relationship with Sessions is a troubling sign of the group’s growing influence in the new administration.

“The fact that the ADF has confirmed it has participated in a listening session is further proof that extremists have infiltrated the highest echelons of power in this administration, even the Attorney General who is tasked with protecting the civil rights of all Americans,” Dinielli told ABC News. “I’m not certain who came up with the invitation list to these listening sessions, but I can assure you it did not include groups who provide services to those who will be directly affected by this new guidance.”"

http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trump-challenges-iran-nuclear-deal-tehran-worry-50372161,['Abc News'],,[],,"As U.S. President Donald Trump threatens the Iran nuclear deal, those living in Tehran feel that an accord they have yet to benefit from may already be doomed, hardening their skepticism about America.

Trump is set to deliver a speech on Iran this week in which he is expected to decline to certify Iran's compliance in the landmark 2015 agreement, referring it to Congress, and perhaps targeting the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard with new sanctions.

In the streets of the Iranian capital on Monday, The Associated Press spoke to a series of people about the nuclear deal: students and teachers, young and old, men in fashionable clothes and women in chadors.

Nearly all had the same concerns: Benefits from the 2015 accord have yet to reach Iran's 80 million people despite its government signing billion-dollar airplane deals. Inflation remains high, job opportunities stay low.

They also said Trump's threats fall in line with what Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have warned: Americans can't be trusted. That feeling has unified hard-liners supporting Iran's clerically overseen government, as well as reformists seeking to change it.

""I have not seen any benefit from the deal, so what is Trump going to add to nothing?"" asked Gholamreza Haeri, a 21-year-old architecture student. ""Is he going to add zero to zero?""

The faith of the average Iranian has eroded over time in the nuclear deal, which saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. It was sealed in July 2015 after 18 months of negotiations by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council — the U.S., Britain, China, France and Russia — as well as Germany.

In September 2015, a telephone survey by the Toronto-based opinion research firm IranPoll for the University of Maryland found 45 percent of 1,000 Iranians said they were not confident the U.S. would live up to its obligations in the nuclear deal. By September 2017, an IranPoll telephone survey of 700 urban Iranians found 77 percent were not confident. The margins of error for the polls were 3.1 percentage points and 3.7 percentage points respectively.

""The trend has continuously been increasing,"" said Amir Farmanesh, the president and CEO of IranPoll.

That suspicion extended to Tehran's streets Monday. Bahram Safari, a 39-year-old junior high school teacher, said he initially supported the nuclear deal but slowly became disenchanted by Trump's constant attacks. Safari pointed to comments by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who repeatedly called the Americans untrustworthy during the negotiations.

""During the nuclear talks, I was wondering why the supreme leader was saying so, now I understand that he was right,"" Safari said. ""Americans are not loyal to their signatures.""

Ashkan Ashtari, a 30-year-old electronics importer, said breaching the deal will be problematic for both sides.

""Iranians are worried about a breach of the nuclear deal because Iran has kept with all of its commitments and has been loyal to the agreement,"" he said. ""Chances are that the U.S. president will break his country's commitment, as he has done so before.""

For Iranians, they still do not have access to international credit cards. While Iranian banks have reconnected to the SWIFT network, which allows for international wire transfers, many complain they still don't have access to global financial markets.

""I know that under the deal, Western banks were supposed to enter Iranian market, but they have not come in practice,"" said 31-year-old Zohreh Lavasani, who works at a private bank. ""So I do not expect the new move by Trump can lead to a meaningful change.""

Iran's stock market dropped 1.2 percent in the last week as the price of hard currencies like dollars and euros edged up against the Iranian rial.

Mehdi Abedi, a 30-year-old tire dealer, said despite the challenges, Iran could handle facing more U.S. sanctions.

""The world community is not just America. Iran can still continue its dealings with other countries,"" he said. ""We have been at odds with the United States for about 40 years now and have managed to survive despite conflicts.""

Also on Monday, Gen. Mohammad Ali Jafari, the top commander of the Revolutionary Guard, said in a statement that Iranian officials will have a ""unified"" approach toward the U.S. threats, the official IRNA news agency reported.

""Rest assured Mr. Trump that we (the Guard), foreign ministry and administration are united and our hearts are synchronized,"" the report quoted Jafari as saying.

Some people continue to hold out hope for the nuclear deal. On Sunday, the German Embassy in Tehran put a placard on its wall saying: ""Yes to Barjam"" — nuclear deal in Farsi. Germany was involved in negotiating the agreement.

""I still want the deal to remain in place and both sides remain faithful to it so that we can finally see its positive impact on the lives of the people,"" said Hassan Aghaei, a 23-year-old street food vendor.

But some saw fault in both sides.

""Iran's actions have probably provoked America, such as testing missiles and similar things,"" said Mehdi Shakeri, 42, who imports and sells car parts. ""Iran could have dealt with Trump more cautiously because he is a radical leader and many of his actions are not always based on logic. Perhaps if Iran had not made Trump sensitive toward itself, we would not be in the situation we are today.""

Longtime allies, the suspensions are the latest barb in a steady decline in relations over the last couple of years, at a time when both face dangerous new threats.

The U.S. was first to halt visas, releasing a statement on Twitter Sunday that said the U.S. has been “forced” to reassess Turkey’s “commitment ... to the security of U.S. Mission facilities and personnel.”

“In order to minimize the number of visitors to our Embassy and Consulates while this assessment proceeds, effective immediately we have suspended all nonimmigrant visa services at all U.S. diplomatic facilities in Turkey,” they said.

Statement from the U.S. Mission to Turkey pic.twitter.com/RjTU3BfSXZ — US Embassy Turkey (@USEmbassyTurkey) October 8, 2017

The announcement came just three days after Turkey charged a Turkish national who worked at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul, although the State Department didn’t explicitly link the two.

The man, identified as Metin Topuz, is charged for alleged ties to the Gulenist movement -- followers of Fetullah Gulen, a Turkish preacher who is a legal permanent resident in exile in the U.S. and is blamed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for a failed coup attempt last summer. Gulen has denied involvement, but Erdogan has cracked down on Gulen’s supporters, other political opponents and journalists since then.

The U.S., however, has called any charges against Topuz “wholly without merit” and “deeply” disturbing, according to a statement from the U.S. mission. “We are in contact with law enforcement to determine the reason for that arrest,” a State Department official added last week.

This is the U.S.’s second local employee to be arrested this year, after Hamza Ulucay was arrested in March, reportedly for ties to the Kurdish terror group the PKK. An employee of the U.S. consulate in Adana, he is still being detained by Turkish authorities.

Turkey said neither men had diplomatic immunity as Turkish citizens and dismissed the condemnations from the U.S.

But hours after the U.S. made the announcement about visas, Turkey tweeted their own message Sunday, seeming to echo much of the language.

“Recent Events have forced the Turkish Government to reassess the commitment of the Government of the U.S. to the security of the Turkish Mission facilities and personnel,” the statement read in part.

“In order to minimize the number of visitors to our diplomatic and consular missions in the U.S. while this assessment proceeds, effective immediately we have suspended all visa services regarding the U.S. citizens at our diplomatic and consular missions in the U.S.,” it added.

The bickering comes at a particularly fraught moment between the U.S. and its key NATO ally where America has an airbase vital to the fight against ISIS and home to a stockpile of 50 nuclear bombs.

Turkey has been incensed and increasingly willing to lash out over America’s support for Kurdish groups in Iraq and Syria who are fighting ISIS. The U.S. won’t abandon them because they are the strongest fighting forces, although like Turkey, America has labeled the Kurdish separatist group within Turkey’s borders, the PKK, a terrorist group.

In the face of America’s support, Turkey has grown increasingly closer to Iran, which has its own Kurdish population seeking independence that it wants to suppress. Erdogan appeared alongside Ayatollah Khomeini last week, denouncing the referendum by the Kurds in Iraq.

Turkey’s cooperation is also crucial for the U.S. as it tries to interdict Westerners traveling in and out of Syria to fight with ISIS and al Qaeda’s affiliate, especially as ISIS crumbles on the battlefield and many of those foreign fighters are fleeing. That cooperation could now be jeopardized."

A Virginia Republican who is also an Iraq War veteran serving in Congress cautions that in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre it's important to maintain ""clarity through the emotional chaos.""

Reps. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., and Scott Taylor, R-Va., sat down with ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz for a rare bipartisan conversation on how Congress should respond to the mass shooting a week ago in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead.

Moulton, who served four tours in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer, said stricter firearms laws can reduce gun violence while adhering to the Constitution.

""I've seen the effects of gun violence firsthand in Iraq, and I know that it has no place at our schools, on our streets, at our concerts,"" he said.

""You can have restrictions on guns under the Second Amendment,"" Moulton said to Taylor. ""I mean, a great way to protect your family's home, as you know as a Navy SEAL, would be to have some land mines out in front and have some grenades stockpiled. But we don't allow that in our community ... We don't allow families to own tanks. So we have reasonable restrictions that are perfectly respectful of the Second Amendment, and we know from experience that restrictions like this, that commonsense reforms will help.""

But Taylor, who served as a Navy SEAL sniper in Iraq, said there is ""a very high bar"" to taking away people's Second Amendment rights.

""When you have a situation that happened, which was tragic, traumatic and everyone feels the same emotion ... it's up to leaders like us to have or to see clarity through the emotional chaos and to understand that it is a high, very high bar to be able to take some folks' rights away, to try to enact policies that take their rights away but not really do anything,"" he said.

""I'm not willing to impede on people's rights based upon your political desires, I'm just not,"" Taylor added.

ABC News

The two congressmen agreed, however, that they may be able to find common ground on limitations on bump stocks, a weapons modifier that allows semi-automatic weapons to fire faster.

Taylor agreed with Moulton that it's reasonable to restrict bump stocks and other devices capable of turning semiautomatic weapons into automatic weapons.

Still, the Virginia Republican said, even with such restrictions people who want to convert their semiautomatic firearms would find a way to do so.

""You can create a law that says, 'OK, you can't modify your semiautomatic to automatic,' which is already illegal, right? But you know as well as I do that it's not that hard to figure out. If you want to figure it out and you're, you know, you're a little bit crafty, you can do it,"" Taylor said.

The two lawmakers agreed that more conversations are needed on how to address gun violence.

""I hope that this conversation will continue,"" Moulton said. ""It took some courage for Scott to show up here, especially as a Republican, because a lot of Republicans are not willing to have this conversation, and I'm willing to sit down as a Democrat and be reasonable. But these are the conversations that we should be having in Congress to protect the American people.""

Taylor responded, ""I'm more than willing to sit down and have conversations to figure out how we, how we can help out. But the action that we take should be reasonable and common sense, of course. And it shouldn't unnecessarily infringe on people's constitutional rights.""

""I enjoyed the conversation, and I look forward to having a lot more,"" Taylor added."

Here are some of the latest details:

Security guard shot before concert shooting began

On Monday, Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo announced a change to the sequence of events that occurred on Oct. 1, saying a security guard who encountered Paddock was actually shot at 9:59 p.m. local time, minutes before the 64-year-old unleashed a hail of gunfire on unsuspecting concertgoers.

Previously, authorities had said that the security guard, Jesus Campos, was shot after Paddock had opened fire on the crowd below.

Lombardo said Campos immediately reported to hotel security that he had been shot. However, responding officers did not know Campos had been shot until they arrived on the 32nd floor and encountered him, Lombardo said.

It's unclear what ultimately led Paddock to stop shooting at the people below. Officials had originally thought that Campos distracted him.

More vigils

At least 200 mourners came out to the elementary school attended by the late Nicol Kimura in Placentia, California, where they lit candles and held photos this weekend depicting happier times for a woman whose smiles and cowboy boots radiated.

She was one of the 58 people slain by Paddock's bullets.

Kimura, 38, according to The Associated Press, worked at a California tax agency, and had made the trip to the three-day Route 91 Harvest country music festival with a group of friends who call themselves ""framily.""

Dozens also came out along the Huntington Pier in California to remember the lives lost.

Some of the bereaved were at that Route 91 Harvest concert in Las Vegas when gunshots rang out.

Second search conducted

After questioning Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, federal agents returned to Paddock's three-bedroom home resting on a cul-de-sac inside a sleepy retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada.

They breached the boarded-up garage days after Las Vegas cops first searched the home shortly after the rampage and confirmed they pulled 19 guns and several pounds of potentially explosive materials.

The return to the residence that Paddock purchased back in early 2015 was reportedly for ""re-documenting and rechecking,"" local police Chief Troy Tanner, who tagged along with the FBI agents to serve the search warrant.

A note containing handwritten numbers for wind, trajectory and distance was discovered by Paddock's body inside the Mandalay Bay room.

The details of the note were first reported by CBS’ “60 Minutes.”

Killer's brother in Las Vegas

Stephen Paddock's younger brother, Eric Paddock, arrived in Las Vegas Sunday to aid authorities in their investigation.

“I’m here to help them move forward with their investigation,” Eric Paddock, 57, told The Las Vegas Review-Journal Sunday outside his hotel. “I want to help them understand what they’re seeing.”

Eric Paddock had spoken to ABC News after the bloodshed, saying he was “dumbstruck” by the news and compared discovering his brother had committed the killings to being “crushed by an asteroid.”

“We have no idea how or why this happened,” he said. “As far as we know, Steve was perfectly fine.”

He added that his brother wasn't one to harbor any strong political, extremist or religious beliefs.

So far, no extreme group ties

While ISIS came forward claiming responsibility for the attack shortly after the death toll rose, the FBI has not uncovered connections between the suspect and any foreign terrorist groups.

“The FBI stated there is no apparent tie to international terrorism,” one senior official told ABC News. “Perhaps ISIS is just trying to take credit.”

Employee comes forward

Lisa Crawford spoke to ""Good Morning America"" Monday about working as Stephen Paddock's property manager from 2006 to 2012 in Texas.

She recalled him as generous to his tenants.

“He actually cared about everybody,” Crawford said. ""He tried to make people happy; he tried to make people care and I don't know what happened to him.""

Stephen Paddock's girlfriend

Marylou Danley was questioned by authorities and privately told her family she has a ""clean conscience.”

When her boyfriend fired bullets at thousands of unarmed concertgoers, Danley was in the Philippines ""to see family and friends,"" she said in a statement.

Stephen Paddock had apparently purchased her airfare to the Philippines and then wired her money to purchase a house for herself and her family.

The move made her ""grateful, but worried,"" thinking that Stephen Paddock was breaking up with her, she said in her statement.

Through her attorney Matthew Lombard, Danley said she never foresaw ""something horrible like this was going to happen,"" and described the shooter as a ""kind, caring man.""

She added that she had planned to be with him in the future.

""I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together with him,"" she said in the statement."

But at Monday's announcement, Pruitt said the regulation picked ""winners and losers,"" echoing comments from Trump and other officials that environmental regulations eliminated jobs in businesses like the coal industry.

""When you think about the Clean Power Plan, it wasn't about regulating to make things regular,"" Pruitt said. ""It was truly about regulating to pick winners and losers, and they interpreted the best system of emission reduction is generating electricity not using fossil fuels.""

Trump called for a review of the Clean Power Plan in an executive order signed in March to reverse what he has called government overreach that hurt the economy.

""Perhaps no single regulation threatens our miners, energy companies and workers more than this crushing attack on American industry,"" Trump said in March, referring to the Clean Power Plan.

Even the ones that required me to travel. Because heck, who doesn’t love an excuse to get on a plane and go somewhere for a party?

I’ll tell you who: Moms.

Since my daughter was born four years ago, I have RSVP’d “Can’t make it” to six different weddings. And three of those were weddings for some of my very closest friends. Unfortunately, they all required expensive travel. And one was actually a kid-free wedding.

Sorry (okay, not sorry), but I’m a single mom, and especially in that kid-free wedding scenario, there was just no way that was going to work. I don’t have family nearby I can leave my kiddo with, which would have meant either begging friends to take my then-2-year-old for a few days, or bringing her with me and hiring a stranger to babysit her there. And that extra hassle would have been on top of the $2,000+ in airfare and $500+ on hotel accommodations. All so that I could go to a wedding where a friend —- who I do dearly love and miss terribly, for the record —- would have had 200 other guests she would also have been spending her time catching up with.

So nope, I couldn’t do it. There was just no way I could justify spending that kind of a money on a trip that would have involved so much hassle and so little actual quality time with the person I was traveling to see.

Mom’s Viral Post Sums Up the “Glorious Mess” of Parenthood — and How to Rise Above It

I Have Four Kids, But Having “Just” One at Home Is Killing Me

If I’m being honest, I haven’t always had the money to spend on these weddings even if there was more quality time involved. Because, motherhood.

Part of this is on me. I’m the one who is a bit of a nomad and has made friends who are also a bit nomadic themselves, leaving me with invites to weddings all over the country. But you want to know a secret? I’ve even bailed on weddings for acquaintances right here in my hometown. Because while I technically could have brought my kiddo with me, trying to manage her unpredictable toddler behavior at a wedding attended by a bunch of people I didn’t know super well did not sound like a fun way to spend one of our coveted weekend days. And hiring a sitter would have meant giving up one of my rare sitter nights just to watch someone I knew and liked, but wasn’t super close to, say “I do.”

Call me selfish, but I’d rather use that sitter for a girl’s night out and some quality time with the close friends I otherwise don’t get to see enough of.

A few weeks ago though, I did drag my daughter along to the first and only wedding she’s ever attended. We had to travel to Seattle, but I have other close friends there as well — so we made a week of that wedding trip, and even got two extra days of quality time in with the bride and groom before the rest of their guests arrived. That quality time with both them and my other friends absolutely made the trip worth it in my mind.

But the wedding itself was a reminder of why I’ve said “no” more often than not to these invites.

Don’t get me wrong: I had a great time, and my daughter had a blast being the life of the party. But you know what? I spent so much time turning her into a princess that I had only 15 minutes to get ready myself. She got extra pouty and fidgety as we waited in our seats for the wedding to begin. And we had to spend the reception cocktail hour back in our room cleaning up her dress, because she was devastated when it got mud on it. I couldn’t really have adult conversations, because I was too focused on her most of the time. She wasn’t digging any of the fancy foods we were served for dinner, and struggled with understanding that the bride and groom could not make her their sole focus once the meal was over. After all, they had spent days doting on her, shouldn’t she still be by their side for every second of their wedding celebration as well?

Of course not. But you try explaining that to a 4-year-old who thinks her auntie and uncle hung the moon.

Once the dancing started, her smile returned. But around 9 PM, she started fading (and misbehaving as a result). We had to say our goodnights just as the party was getting to the good part — the drinking and dancing and reminiscing that I used to love most about weddings.

So yes, we had a good time. And I was thankful to be there for one of my best friends in this world. But … having a kid changes things. And weddings aren’t quite the same when you have them to think about. (I mean, I didn’t even have more than a single glass of wine!)

So friends, don’t take it personally if I have to send my regrets to your wedding invite. The truth is, I’m much more frugal with both my time and my money these days. And if your wedding requires travel, is kid-free, or is going to be attended by a bunch of people I really don’t know that well, there’s a strong chance I won’t be able to make it.

I’ll still be celebrating you in spirit, though. And keeping all my missed weddings in mind when my own day comes.

http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/gaza-hamas-levels-ancient-treasure-50318775,['Abc News'],,[],,"Palestinian and French archaeologists began excavating Gaza's earliest archaeological site nearly 20 years ago, unearthing what they believe is a rare 4,500-year-old Bronze Age settlement.

But over protests that grew recently, Gaza's Hamas rulers have systematically destroyed the work since seizing power a decade ago, allowing the flattening of this hill on the southern tip of Gaza City to make way for construction projects, and later military bases. In its newest project, Hamas-supported bulldozers are flattening the last remnants of excavation.

""There is a clear destruction of a very important archaeological site,"" said Palestinian archaeology and history professor Mouin Sadeq, who led three excavations at the site along with French archaeologist Pierre de Miroschedji after its accidental discovery in 1998. ""I don't know why the destruction of the site was approved.""

Tel Es-Sakan (hill of ash) was the largest Canaanite city between Palestine and Egypt, according to Sadeq. It was named after the great amount of ash found during the excavations, which suggests the settlement was burnt either naturally or in a war.

Archaeologists found the 10-hectare (25-acre) hill to be hiding a fortified settlement built centuries before pharaonic rule in Egypt, and 1,000 years before the pyramids. But the excavations stopped in 2002 due to security concerns.

When calls on Hamas to stop the recent flattening intensified last month, the nearest available expert to gain access to Gaza was Jean-Baptiste Humbert, a Jerusalem-based archaeologist at the Ecole Biblique and who had excavated other sites in Gaza.

""Today the complete southern facade of the Tel is erased,"" said Humbert. In previous years, faces and ramparts on other sides were also destroyed. ""Now it is destroyed all around,"" he said.

It's among the earliest sites indicating the emergence of the ""urban society"" concept in the Near East, when communities were transforming from farming villages around 4,000 BC, and it was on trade routes between Egypt and the Levant, according to Humbert.

Humbert shared an aerial photo from 2000 showing patterns of walls from atop the mound. The area ""was the first city of Palestine to have a city wall,"" he said. Now, ""the field work you see in the photo is totally destroyed.""

Gaza is home to numerous ancient treasures, but politics have long complicated archaeological work.

The French excavations stopped in 2002 because of a Palestinian uprising in which protesters violently clashed with Israeli troops around the nearby Netzarim settlement. Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005. But Hamas, shunned by the West as a terrorist group, won elections and eventually drove out the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in 2007. The excavations never resumed.

Unlike more extreme Islamic groups, Hamas has not deliberately destroyed antiquities for ideological reasons.

But with little open space in Gaza, a fast-growing population and an economy stifled by Israeli and Egyptian blockades, Hamas officials say they have no choice but to develop the area, making archaeology a low priority.

But the group has also seized ancient sites to build military training camps, including the 3,000-year-old Anthedon Harbor, parts of which were bulldozed in 2013.

In 2009 and 2012, the expansion of universities destroyed the western and northern facades of Tel El-Sakan. People displaced during three wars between Hamas and Israel set up temporary dwellings on the eastern side.

The southern front remained, but Hamas says it needs the land to compensate some of its senior employees, who have only received partial salaries from the cash-strapped group.

When the bulldozer work started in early August, the Hamas-run Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities appealed for help. Humbert rushed to Gaza, and with the help of colleagues from Gaza's Islamic University, he succeeded in stopping the work for two weeks while the ministry and Hamas' Land Authority worked to settle the dispute.

Jamal Abu Rida, the ministry's director of antiquities, said Tel Es-Sakan is a protected archaeological site, but that his ministry could not stop the more powerful Land Authority from destroying another 1.2 hectares (three acres).

The work resumed last week. Bulldozers loaded a truck with soil that contained fragments of jars. When the workers saw Associated Press cameras, they quickly left the scene.

Abu Rida said they recovered an early Bronze Age jar from the site during the most recent leveling. Fadel al-Outul a Gaza archaeologist, salvaged fragments that he used to reassemble two thirds of another jar. He also found a flint knife blade.

Junaid Sorosh-Wali, an official with the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, inspected the damage at the site Tuesday after the bulldozers left.

What happened was ""disastrous for the archaeology and cultural heritage in Palestine,"" he said. He said UNESCO had raised concerns with ""the relevant authorities.""

Amateur videos showed ramparts crumbling under the bulldozer's treads. The rampart of the southern facade was also uncovered and is slated for destruction.

Dozens of ancient sites have been found in Gaza, and excavations have revealed temples, monasteries, palaces, churches and mosques and mosaics. But most of the sites have been lost to urban sprawl and looting. UNESCO is struggling to preserve some of remaining ones.

In 2016, the remains of a Byzantine church were discovered in Gaza, but authorities are believed to have destroyed them. And in 2014, a rare Apollo statue went missing and is believed to be held by a militant group.

At St. Hilarion monastery in the central Gaza Strip, which spans from the late Roman Empire to the Islamic Umayyad period, a breach in the fence suggested looters were trying to get in. Private construction is taking place next door. Someone recently dumped brick debris in the site from over the fence.

The birthplace one of the 4th century founders of Christian monasticism still has the clear remnants of a baptism hall, a church and an atrium.

Sorosh-Wali, the UNESCO official, said it is among around a dozen locations in the West Bank and Gaza that the Palestinian Authority wants to be listed as a UNESCO ""world heritage"" sites."

""What storm, Mr. President?"" one reporter shouted.

""You'll find out,"" the president said.

Trump was equally coy on Friday in the Oval Office when he was asked again about the remark after he signed a proclamation about National Manufacturing Day.

""You'll find out,"" he said, after winking. ""We'll see.""

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that the president was not making a joke and that it continues to be the desire of the administration not to divulge the potential for military action, whether planned or not.

""I think you can take the president protecting the American people always extremely serious,"" she said, without offering further explanation for Trump's words. She did push back on the theory that he was ""messing with the press.""

""I think we have some serious world issues here,"" continued Sanders later in the briefing. ""I think that North Korea, Iran both continue to be bad actors and the president is somebody who's going to always look for ways to protect Americans and he's not going to dictate what those actions may look like.""

Prior to his Thursday evening comments, Trump said the group of military leaders would discuss the most pressing issues facing the country, including North Korea and Iran.

Trump said ""tremendous progress"" had been made with ISIS, adding, ""I guess the media's going to be finding out about that over the next short period of time.""

He also said Iran should not be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons.

And of North Korea he said, ""We cannot allow this dictatorship to threaten our nation or allies with unimaginable loss of life,"" adding that his administration will ""do what we must do to prevent that from happening and it will be done, if necessary. Believe me."""

A harvest moon, which happens when a full moon rises close to the fall equinox, appears larger and more orange than usual. It rises about 20 minutes earlier, which decreases the time between sunset and moonrise, according to NASA. The early rise gives it the special color because there is more clouds and dust in the sky.

(AP) -- For No. 5 Maryland, beating Miami was easy compared to the task of celebrating another milestone by Crystal Langhorne. Langhorne scored 19 points to become the first to reach 2,000 for the Maryland women, and the Terrapins cruised to their school-record 16th home win of the season Thursday night, 90-50. Langhorne, a 6-foot-2 senior center, started the game needing only 2 points to reach 2,000. She got it on her first shot, a 16-footer behind the foul line with 25 seconds elapsed. After the game, Langhorne was presented the game ball by coach Brenda Frese. The Terrapins then awkwardly attempted to hoist Langhorne on their shoulders at midcourt. They managed to get her airborne, but her position atop the shoulders of backup forward Jade Perry was precarious at best. ""I don't know what they were thinking,"" Langhorne said. ""But it was fun."" Langhorne already owns the school rebounding record, male or female, with 1,111. Juan Dixon is the school leader in scoring with 2,269, one of five men with at least 2,000 points. Langhorne isn't the only person helping rewrite the Maryland women's record book. Kristi Toliver had 10 assists, giving her 508 for her career, second on school list. ""The team that I'm playing with, and their ability to score, makes my job so much easier,"" said Toliver, a junior guard. Marah Strickland scored 14 and Laura Harper had 13 to help Maryland improve to 16-0 at home. The Terps (23-2, 7-1 ACC) had an easy time of it after playing two straight double-overtime games, a win over Georgia Tech and a loss at North Carolina. ""To be able to have a convincing win like tonight says a lot about our character,"" Frese said. Maurita Reid led Miami (8-13, 1-5) with 15 points. The Hurricanes have lost four straight, and this was by far their most lopsided defeat of the season. But it wasn't nearly as bad as the 111-53 thrashing they absorbed against Maryland in January 2007. Miami coach Katie Meier had a feeling the Hurricanes were in trouble when she learned that Maryland lost at North Carolina on Saturday. ""That was a great response by Maryland. I wasn't happy playing them coming off a loss like that,"" Meier said. ""I also knew they wanted to get the ball inside because we have a problem defending that. So I was a little bit leery at the start of the game."" Her fear was justified. Miami kept up early, but Maryland took control by asserting itself in the paint. After the Hurricanes pulled in a tie at 14, Langhorne scored seven points and Perry made two layups in a 16-4 run that made it 30-18. At that point, Langhorne had half her team's points and was 9-for-9 at the foul line. ""Their talent was overwhelming, and our response, I did not think was tough enough,"" Meier said. Miami closed to 34-23 before backup guard Kat Lyons drilled a 3-pointer, Marissa Coleman scored five straight points and Harper added a follow-shot in a 10-0 run to end the half. The run continued after halftime. Layups by Langhorne and Harper made it 48-25 before Epiphany Woodson made a basket to end Miami's scoreless drought at 6 minutes, 26 seconds."

A boy tore through the aisles of Target, marveling at toys he never knew existed. A teen walked onto a stage and watched the stunned expressions of celebrity judges as he wowed ""America's Got Talent.""

Caroline, Cole, Christian. All had mere glimmers of vision and were destined to lose even that because of an inherited eye disease with no treatment or cure.

Until now.

On Thursday, U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisers will consider whether to recommend approval of a gene therapy that improved vision for these three youths and some others with hereditary blindness.

It would be the first gene therapy in the U.S. for an inherited disease, and the first in which a corrective gene is given directly to a patient. Only one gene therapy is sold in the U.S. now, a cancer treatment approved in August that engineers patients' blood cells in the lab.

A HEARING LIKE NO OTHER

Children, parents, doctors and scientists will tell the FDA panel what it's like to lack and then gain one of our most primal senses.

Cole Carper, an 11-year-old boy who got the therapy when he was 8, describes how sight changed what he knew of the world. When he returned to his home in Little Rock, Arkansas, after treatment, ""I looked up and said, 'What are those light things?' And my mom said, 'Those are stars.'""

His sister, 13-year-old Caroline Carper, treated when she was 10, said that afterward, ""I saw snow falling and rain falling. I was completely surprised. I thought of water on the ground or snow on the ground. I never thought of it falling,"" because the sky was something she couldn't see, along with other things like her mother's smile.

The treatment , Luxturna, is made by Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics. It does not give 20-20 vision or work for everyone, but a company-funded study found it improved vision for nearly all of those given it and seemed safe. The company's Nasdaq ticker symbol is ONCE, for how often it hopes the therapy is needed.

""It's exciting"" and in some cases might be a cure, although how long the benefits last isn't known, said Dr. Paul Yang, an eye specialist at Oregon Health & Science University who is testing gene therapies for other companies. ""There's nothing else for these kids.""

HOW IT WORKS

The therapy has wider implications but was tested for Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA, caused by flaws in a gene called RPE65. Those with it can't make a protein needed by the retina , tissue at the back of the eye that converts light into signals to the brain that lets us see. People often see only bright light and blurry shapes and eventually lose all sight.

Parents are carriers of the flawed gene and it can lurk undetected for generations, suddenly emerging when an unlucky combination gives a child two copies of it.

""It's usually a surprise that they have a blind child,"" said Dr. Jean Bennett, a University of Pennsylvania researcher who with her husband, Dr. Albert Maguire, led testing at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. The couple designed an obstacle course to test vision after treatment, and the FDA accepted it as a valid measure of success.

""The maze was actually Al's idea. I put it together first in our driveway,"" using white tiles with arrows, foam rolls and cones, and black spaces to simulate holes that kids should avoid, Bennett said.

Maguire did many of the 45-minute operations to deliver the gene therapy; the rest were done at the University of Iowa. It involves puncturing the white part of the eye and injecting a modified virus that contains the corrective gene into the retina. Benefits appear within a month.

RESULTS

Eighteen of 20 treated study participants improved on the mobility maze a year later, and 13 passed the test at the lowest light level. None in a comparison group of nine patients did. That group was allowed to get the therapy after waiting one year, so in all, 29 were treated, plus more in earlier studies. The two who did not improve may not have had enough healthy retinal cells to respond to treatment; one improved on other tests and another stopped deteriorating.

About half of those treated were able to read three or more additional lines on an eye chart, but the variability between the groups was too big to be sure, statistically, that they were different on this measure.

Many are no longer legally blind and gained independence.

""There were children who were able to move from a Braille classroom to a sighted classroom. One person who had never worked was able to get a job,"" said Dr. Katherine High, president of Spark Therapeutics and the scientist who pioneered the therapy when previously at the children's hospital.

There were two serious side effects, both deemed unrelated to the gene therapy itself. One was due to a drug given afterward and another was a complication of the surgery.

""WHOA, MOM, WHAT IS THAT?""

Ashley Carper recalled when her children were diagnosed with the disease.

""The doctor came out with tears in his eyes. He said it was the same condition and they will be blind, and nothing could be done. Nothing.""

Cole and Caroline used canes and went to a school for the blind.

""Cole played football but he played center,"" and just stood on the field after the snap to the quarterback because he couldn't see well enough to do more, his mother said.

Ten years ago, she went to a support group conference and happened to sit next to Bennett. It took two years for gene testing to determine whether the Carper kids would qualify for the study, and insurance wouldn't pay because there was no established treatment. A Dallas hospital picked up the tab.

Finally, the siblings were enrolled in the study, but they landed in the comparison group so they had to wait a year to be treated. About a week after Cole's treatment, they went shopping at Target.

""When we got to the Nerf aisle I was like, 'Whoa, mom, what is THAT? Can I get this? Can I get that? Because I had never seen what that stuff looked like,"" Cole said.

Caroline has had her own delights.

""Oh yikes, colors. Colors are super fun,"" she said. ""And the sunshine is blinding.""

SEEING GOLD

For Christian Guardino, a senior at Patchogue-Medford High School on Long Island, the most remarkable part about performing on ""America's Got Talent"" a day before his 17th birthday earlier this year wasn't winning the golden buzzer that showered gold confetti on him and sent him into further competition. It was seeing the confetti thanks to his gene therapy several years ago.

""I walked out on that stage all by myself,"" he said. ""I saw the judges. It was incredible.""

His mother, Beth Guardino, said the judges didn't know about Christian's blindness and gene therapy until after his audition.

Before treatment, ""it was dark, life without light,"" Christian said. ""I found a way to work through it, to cope with it, and that was music.""

Since treatment, ""I've been able to see the most incredible things. I'm able to see stars, I'm able to see fireworks, snow falling,"" he said. His favorite? ""The moon. Most definitely. I'm a huge astronomy fan.""

NEXT STEPS

The FDA must decide by Jan. 18 whether to approve Luxturna. What it might cost is a worry. One gene therapy sold in Europe cost $1 million and was used by only one or two people; another has had few takers.

Spark's chief executive, Jeff Marrazzo, would not give an estimate for cost, which companies usually announce only after approval. Some rare disease treatments run a quarter to three-quarters of a million dollars a year. Spark has talked with insurers and ""there is a clear path for it to be reimbursed one time per eye,"" he said.

More than 260 genes can cause inherited retinal disorders, affecting 3 million worldwide. RPE65 mutations can cause other vision diseases besides LCA, so if the treatment is approved, it should be for people with the flawed gene rather than a specific disease, said Dr. Eric Pierce at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts Eye and Ear, who was involved in its early testing.

Laura Manfre founded Sofia Sees Hope, a group named for her 14-year-old daughter, Sofia Priebe, who has LCA but not the gene Luxturna targets. The Connecticut woman will represent families at the FDA hearing.

Sofia said she longs for a therapy that would let her ""drive a car, walk into a room and be able to identify my friends, to be able to do my own makeup and to read a book in print ... and see the night sky.""

Those are just a few of the revelations Ivana Trump, 68, made in a sit-down interview with ABC News’ Amy Robach to promote her new memoir, “Raising Trump.”

Ivana Trump said she speaks to her former husband about once every two weeks, and she has a ""direct number"" to the White House.

""I [don't] really want to call him there, because Melania is there,"" she said, referring to first lady Melania Trump. ""And I don't want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that, because I'm basically first Trump wife. OK? I'm first lady.""

In response to the interview, a spokesperson for Melania Trump told ABC News the first lady is ""honored by her role.""

""Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President,"" the spokesperson said, referring to the couple's son. ""She loves living in Washington, D.C., and is honored by her role as First Lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books. There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex. Unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise. ""

Ivana Trump's book, set to be released Tuesday, documents Trump’s journey from growing up under Communist rule in the former Czechoslovakia to marrying a future U.S. president and raising their three children together -- Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump.

Ivana Trump

Below are seven key revelations about Trump’s life as a mother and the first of President Trump’s three wives.

1. 'I would hate Washington'

Rose Hartman/Getty Images

Ivana Trump said she has no desire to change places with Melania Trump.

""I think for her to be in Washington must be terrible,"" Ivana Trump said of the first lady. ""It's better her than me. I would hate Washington.""

She continued, ""Would I straighten up the White House in 14 days? Absolutely. Can I give the speech for 45 minutes without [a] teleprompter? Absolutely. Can I read a contract? Can I negotiate? Can I entertain? Absolutely. But I would not really like to be there. I like my freedom.""

She said that keeping her freedom also meant declining when the president of the Czech Republic wanted her to be the U.S. ambassador.

When asked by Robach what President Trump said about the offer, Ivana Trump replied, ""Well, Donald called me and he said, 'If you want to take the position, I [will] give it to you.' I said, 'Donald, no. I want my freedom.'""

Speaking of her advice for his presidency, Ivana Trump said, ""Sometimes I tell him to just, not to speak that much, and tweet are the tweets. I don't disagree with him because he has so much press against him, so if he says something his words are going to be twisted immediately.""

""If he tweets, the whole world can really get his mind and what is his in mind, and he can tell it in his own words.""

2. 'I was in charge'

When Donald and Ivana Trump divorced in 1992, she told him that when it came to raising their three children together, ""There can be only one chef in the kitchen.""

""I would go and call Donald, I said, 'Ivanka is going to Chapin, or she's going to go to the Georgetown University. Eric is going to go to Hill School,' and he said, 'OK,'"" she recalled. ""I was in charge.""

Ivana Trump

Ivana Trump

She continued, ""I just told him where they're going to go, and he said, 'OK.' He trusted my judgment, because I know the personality of my kids.""

During the formative years of their children's childhoods, Donald Trump was ""on the telephone making the deals,"" she said. She takes ""full credit"" for raising Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka, she added.

""He was a loving father, don't get me wrong, and he was a good provider, but he was not the father which would take a stroll and go to the Central Park or go play to baseball with them or something,"" she said, adding, ""It was only until they were about 18-years-old [that] he could communicate with them, because he could start to talk business with them.

""Before, he really didn't know what conversation to strike with the little kids.""

23. 'Every person in America hated him and they loved me'

Ivana Trump

President Trump could have accomplished his political ambitions much earlier had it not been for the scandal that engulfed his marriage to Ivana Trump, she said.

""Donald got [a] letter from President Reagan, and he said, 'You should run for president,' and that was 20 years ago,"" she said. ""And I think he could do it if there would not be a scandal.""

She added, ""You know, because every American woman hated him, and every American hated him. There was no way he could run during the scandal time.""

Ivana Trump was married to Trump from 1977 to 1992, when their marriage dissolved amid revelations that he was having an affair with Marla Maples, who later became his second wife.

Ivana Trump has forgiven her former husband, but said she will never forgive Maples, whose affair with her husband was splashed on the New York tabloids.

""I never accepted her apology,"" Ivana Trump said. ""She ruined my family and my marriage.""

4. 'Opportunity to go and prove myself'

Ivana Trump

When asked whether she believes Donald Trump is sexist, she spoke about her own experience while married to the real estate mogul.

""Donald gave me all the opportunity to go and prove myself,"" she said. ""I built the Commander Hotel. I built the Trump Tower. Then Donald [sent] me to Atlantic City, and I was flying at 8 in the morning after breakfast with the kids to Atlantic City on the helicopter.""

She continued, ""I think that Donald supports the woman. He loves the woman. Always did. He definitely respected women.""

Ivana Trump said she has ""not really"" spoken to the president about the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that was released during the presidential campaign. In the 2005 video, Trump, then the star of NBC's ""The Apprentice,"" brags about his ability to grope women because he's ""a star.""

""He was not really disrespectful. He just jokes. Sometime he said things which are silly,"" she said.

When asked by Robach whether she thought he was joking about grabbing women, Ivana Trump added, ""OK, well, that was one instance, and I just wouldn't, I don't want to go into it.""

5. Future Trump presidencies

Ivana said she could see both her daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her son-in-law, Jared Kushner, becoming future presidents. They serve as senior advisers in the Trump White House.

""I think they both could do it,"" she said of her daughter and Kushner, who moved their three children to Washington, D.C., from New York.

""[The] only thing which I regret [is] that Ivanka moved to Washington, so I don't see the grandkids that often, I don't see her that often,"" she said. ""But everything else they do, it's their destination, you know. They do what they want to do and, like I said, they don't cheat, steal and lie and as long as they do that, it's OK with me.""

Ivana Trump revealed it is her 35-year-old daughter who can best voice a difference of opinion to the president.

""Oh, absolutely. Ivanka is number one,"" she said. ""All my kids are, you know, they're not afraid of him. A lot of people, they're afraid to criticize him and they sort of stay behind. But my kids tell him exactly, you know, how they feel, and you take it or leave it.""

6. Marrying into the Trump family was not intimidating

Ivana Trump

Ivana Trump said she was taken by Donald Trump's looks and his mind when they met in the 1970s.

When it came time to propose, Trump tried to woo her beforehand by warning her of what her life would be without him.

""For months before, you know, he said, 'If you're not going to go marry me, you're going to ruin your life,'"" she recalled.

The couple wed in what Ivana Trump described as a wedding with six of her friends from Montreal, where she lived before the nuptials, and 600 people from New York.

""I did not know anybody,"" she said.

Once she was a Trump, Ivana encountered the patriarch of the family, her husband’s father, real estate developer Fred Trump.

""Fred Trump was [a] really brutal father,"" she said. ""We went to Tavern on the Green for the brunch one Sunday and [Trump’s] father ordered a steak. So all the, you know, the sisters and brothers, they ordered a steak.""

""And I said, 'Waiter, can I have a filet of sole? And Fred looked up at the waitress and, 'No, she's going to have a steak.' I look up at the waiter, I said, 'No, Ivana is going to have a filet of sole,' -- because if I would let him just [roll] right over me, it would be all my life and I would not allowed it.""

7. Donald Trump worried his son could be a 'loser'

When Ivana Trump was pregnant with the couple's first child, she said her husband told her they could not name their son Donald Trump Jr. because of a specific concern.

""I said, 'Why not?'"" she recalled. ""He said, 'How about if he's a loser?'""

She continued, ""So I said, 'This is going to be what it is. I carry my kid for nine months, and this is what's going to be. And the same was with Ivanka. He wanted to call Ivanka Tiffany, because we got the heir rights for the Trump Tower from [luxury retailer] Tiffany.""

Donald and Ivana Trump named their only daughter Ivanka. Donald Trump would go onto have another daughter, named Tiffany, with Maples.

Donald Trump, Jr., now 39, found himself at the center of a political firestorm involving his father's presidency earlier this year when it was revealed that he met with a Russian lawyer during the 2016 presidential campaign.

Bonus: Ivana Trump's children and former husband have not read her memoir

Ivana Trump said her three children have not yet read ""Raising Trump,"" though they each contributed writings.The president has also not read the book, she said.

""It's about my life and raising my kids,"" she explained. ""And he's in the book because he was father of the kids, but I did not ask him for permission.""

Travelers often dismiss cruising as loud and tacky, sleepy and staid, or totally divorced from their destinations. If that’s your take on it, you may be surprised to learn that the cruise industry is in fact fairly diverse, and there are all types of sailings -- from refined trips with nary a poolside DJ in sight, to immersive journeys that offer deep-dives into destinations, to adventure voyages where you’ll find yourself in a kayak more than a lounge chair. Here’s a look at a few of the common gripes we hear about cruise travel, and the ships that offer the perfect rebuttal.

Oyster.com Your gripe: Cruise travel is noisy, gaudy, and unrefined Your antidote: Cunard’s Queen Victoria

For some travelers, doing the Macarena poolside to thumping beats is akin to hell on the high seas. If you’re among them, and fear cruising is too loud and gaudy for you, allow us to introduce you to Cunard’s Queen Victoria. This ship represents a bygone area of ocean liners that some falsely believe disappeared with the Titanic. Activities here are also a throwback to the glamor of sailing’s yesteryear: ballroom dancing, shuffleboard and croquet. And passengers enthusiastically embrace the dress code for dinner. Despite its retro appeal, Queen Victoria isn’t an aging antique. It received a $40 million revamp in 2017.

Oyster.com Your gripe: Cruise travel just scratches the surface Your antidote: Viking Star

On some ships, passengers merely get a speedy glance at a port -- if they disembark at all -- before sailing on to the next spot without getting a real sense of the places they’re visiting. Viking Star represents the very opposite of this. Shore excursions are an essential part of each sailing, so much so that they’re included in the base rates. The result? This ship draws explorers looking to get to know destinations on a deeper level. And even onboard the Viking Star, passengers are treated to the line’s enrichment programming with lectures and destination talks that add another level of history and culture to each visit. Consider it a mini version of a junior year studying abroad.

Oyster.com Your gripe: Cruise travel is no-action loafing by the pool Your antidote: UnCruise’s Safari Voyager

The name should tip you off to the fact that UnCruise is a 180-degree turn from most cruise associations. There’s no loud, resort-at-sea vibe, no pool, and no stuffy formal dining room. Instead, the ship is stocked with wetsuits, snorkel gear and kayaks, all with the aim of getting passengers off the vessel and out on adventures. In many ways, Safari Voyager isn’t a cruise so much as a guided nature tour giving access to hideaways where guests can do jungle hikes, go bird-watching, meet local tribes, and enjoy any number of bucket-list experiences. The ship’s EZ Dock also allows passengers to disembark straight into the water for a quick swim or snorkel.

Oyster.com Your gripe: Cruise travel dumps you in a faraway port Your antidote: Uniworld’s Joie de Vivre

One trend in the cruise world is mega-ships. These ginormous vessels often boast a capacity of 6,000 or more. And while they can definitely bring the fun, they can’t park in some of the world’s smaller ports. Case in point: Most mainstream cruise ships pull up to Le Havre when “Paris” is on their itinerary, although the capital is about a two-and-a-half-hour drive away from the port. But this is not the case with Uniworld’s Joie de Vivre. This nimble super-yacht can slip right into the actual port in Paris, a 20-minute walk from the Eiffel Tower. On top of that, this 128-passenger ship offers an intimate, boutique hotel vibe and tres chic decor. French films, Champagne receptions, and caviar tastings are regular occurrences, too."
http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/study-great-white-sharks-swimming-farther-deeper-50317790,['Abc News'],,[],,"The movements of great white sharks in the Pacific and Indian oceans have long been the subject of academic study, but new research is just starting to shed light on the behavior of their Atlantic Ocean counterparts.

Researchers in Massachusetts say white sharks appear to venture offshore farther, with more frequency and at greater depths than previously known in the Atlantic.

Some of the 32 sharks tracked between 2009 and 2014 ended up as far east as the Azores, the Portuguese island chain located more than 2,300 miles (3,701 kilometers) from Cape Cod, where most of the animals were initially outfitted with satellite tags.

They also were found to make frequent deep dives — as far down as 3,700 feet (1,127 meters) — and spend more time at those dark depths than previous studies in the Atlantic suggest.

The team, which included scientists from the state Division of Marine Fisheries, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had its findings published last week in Marine Ecology Progress Series, a prominent scientific journal.

""Everything we knew previously indicated that the white shark in the Atlantic is more coastally-oriented, moving north-to-south and remaining on the continental shelf,"" explained Gregory Skomal, the study's lead author. ""So what we're now describing is this other component, this offshore movement into open ocean.""

Skomal says the work has implications for shark conservation efforts since it extends the known habitat for these ancient predators. White sharks are not considered endangered or threatened, but it's illegal to hunt them in U.S. waters.

""You've got U.S. protection within 200 miles of shore, but you have sharks clearly leaving that protection that are vulnerable to harvest,"" Skomal said. ""We need to engage other countries fishing in these waters to talk about putting similar protections in place.""

The research is exciting because it represents the ""first real insights into the movement patterns of white sharks"" in the northern part of the Atlantic, says Tobey Curtis, a Massachusetts-based shark researcher for the National Marine Fisheries Service who was not involved with the study.

""Prior to this, we were only able to piece together information about their distribution from widely scattered reports from fishermen, scientists and the public,"" he said. ""Having tracks of individual sharks really helps fill in the gaps, and provides a more complete picture of white shark movements and migrations.""

The study seems to hew closely to what's been observed of white sharks in other oceans — that juveniles tend to stay in the relatively shallower waters of the continental shelf where food sources abound, while adults are more apt to venture into open ocean, observes Christopher Lowe, a shark researcher at California State University in Long Beach also not involved with the research.

Indeed, most of the tagged sharks in the Atlantic study generally followed a north-south migration along the Eastern Seaboard.

They headed to Newfoundland and New England waters in the summer, then down south to the Carolinas and even the Bahamas for the winter.

Lowe says it remains to be seen what impact continued growth of white shark populations in the Atlantic has on these habits, or whether climate change is playing a role.

Another key question is finding out what these sharks are actually doing so far offshore.

Researchers in northern California suggest offshore movements are for mating, a ritual that has never been observed among white sharks. But Skomal and his team believe the animals are more likely foraging — it's just not immediately obvious what they're feeding on.

""That's the great mystery right now,"" he said.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-hard-line-immigration-policies-price-daca-50363642,['Abc News'],,[],,"President Donald Trump's long list of immigration demands has landed with a thud among lawmakers hopeful for a deal to protect hundreds of thousands of young immigrants from deportation.

The list of demands released late Sunday includes funding for a southern border wall and a crackdown on so-called sanctuary cities — items that are cheered by the president's most loyal supporters, but are non-starters among Democrats and could divide Republicans, who will have to come together on any deal.

The demands have left pro-immigration activists alarmed. And some are scratching their heads, given that the president appeared to sign off on a more palatable deal with Democrats just weeks ago.

""To stall the progress that Democrats and Republicans have been fostering in giving permanent relief to more than 800,000 DREAMers is sabotage,"" said U.S. Rep. Ra?l Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat and frequent Trump critic.

House and Senate leaders on both sides of the aisle have said they want to find a legislative solution to extend protections first granted under former President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. Trump announced last month that he was phasing out DACA, but gave Congress six months to act before recipients' work permits begin to expire.

Trump suggested at the time that he was eager for a deal, telling reporters, ""I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly.""

Days later, he appeared to reach the broad outlines of an agreement with the House and Senate's top Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, in which the president would be open to extended DACA protections in exchange for a package of border security measures.

While Trump made clear that he still expected funding for his border wall, he said repeatedly that the funding could come later, in separate legislation.

In a joint statement Sunday night, Pelosi and Schumer said Trump could not ""be serious about"" the plan the White House had unveiled, which includes not only the wall, but dozens of other controversial measures, including a crackdown on unaccompanied immigrant minors and a complete overhaul of the legal immigration system.

Some of those who hope to see DACA protections extended said they remain optimistic the president will show flexibility, treating the priorities as a policy wish-list and starting point for negotiation.

Others see the demands as part of a plot orchestrated by Trump's chief policy adviser, Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner, to derail any chance of a DACA deal.

""I don't think President Trump wants to be the president who deports 700,000 young people,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, who described the list as a ""big torpedo"" to bipartisan negotiations already under way.

""I think the president's staff have led him into a corner,"" Noorani said, predicting the president would ""not be happy when he realizes it.""

But one person familiar with the president's thinking said the list was intended to make clear that Trump is no longer interested in forging a DACA deal, the same message sent by a White House official's insistence Sunday that any path to citizenship for DACA recipients was off the table.

After backing an establishment Senate candidate who lost by 10 points in an Alabama special election last month, the president is working to please his base supporters, signing a new religious liberty executive order and broadcasting his intention to decertify the Iran nuclear deal.

""The president has made clear he wants Congress to act and pass responsible immigration reform in conjunction with any legislation related to DACA, which will include legal authorities to close border security loopholes, restoring interior enforcement, and reforming the legal immigration system,"" said White House spokeswoman Kelly Love.

Presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway told Fox News the president was ""open to a deal"" on DACA but only ""along with all these other critical functions.""

""You know for years, this country, including Capitol Hill and the swamp, they've always asked: what more can we do for the illegal immigrant, what's fair to the illegal immigrant? This president is asking: what's fair to America? What's fair to the American worker? What's fair to the American community?"" she said.

Both Democrats and Republicans have pointed to a hoped-for year-end package of spending bills as the likely vehicle to tackle immigration issues, including any potential DACA deal.

Democratic votes will be required to enact the year-end measure, but many Democrats have said they won't support any legislation that doesn't address DACA recipients, raising the possibility of a government shutdown just before Christmas.

Controversy over border wall funding already meant the year-end package would be difficult. But one potential opening is that the White House has been willing in the past to accept border fencing and other security steps that fall short of Trump's vision for a wall along the entire length of the border.

Either way, Trump's zig-zagging seemed likely to erode the trust that will likely be required to seal any agreement.

Rep. Luis Guti?rrez, D-Ill., said that, after Sunday, the president should not be considered a reliable negotiating partner. ""Any decision the president makes one day is likely to be completely reversed another, depending on which extremist adviser he is listening to that day,"" he said.

Still others, including Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., applauded the measures, calling the president ""spot on.""

House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows said: ""We look forward to the administration's insistence on these principles in any deal that is signed into law. """
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bob-corker-senator-speaking-trump/story?id=40287649,"['Abc News', 'More Ali']",,[],,"Name: Robert ""Bob"" Phillips Corker Jr.

Party: Republican

Date of Birth: August 24, 1952

Age: 63

What he does now: U.S. senator from Tennessee, chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

What he used to do: According to The Associated Press, Corker worked as a construction superintendent before starting his own construction company, Bencor. He sold the construction arm of his company in 1990 as he began acquiring real estate. He purchased in 1999 two of the largest real estate companies in Chattanooga, making him the largest private landowner in Hamilton County. He sold most of his properties early in 2006. Corker founded the nonprofit Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprises, which helps families obtain low-interest loans. He was appointed commissioner in 1995 of the Tennessee Department of Finance and Administration, and he was elected Chattanooga mayor in 2001. Corker was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006.

Hometown: Chattanooga, Tennessee (although he was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina)

Family tree: Corker and his wife of 29 years, Elizabeth, have two daughters, Emily and Julia. When it was revealed that Corker failed to disclose millions of dollars in shares in a small Tennessee real estate firm, a pair of the purchases were made in his daughters’ names, and he bought stock in the company, CBL, 25 times using accounts in his wife and daughters’ names, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Key life/career moments:

Corker started his own construction company with $8,000 in 1978. The firm, Bencor, began to land large contracts in the Chattanooga area and was operating in 18 states by the mid-1980s. Corker sold the company in 1990 and acquired two real estate companies in 1999. He was inducted into the University of Chattanooga’s Entrepreneurship Hall of Fame in 2005.

Corker was the only Republican to win election to the U.S. Senate in 2006.

His race against Democrat Harold Ford came under scrutiny after the Republican National Committee released an ad that critics claimed was racially tinged. It featured a white woman with blond hair and bare shoulders looking suggestively into the camera and saying, ""Harold, call me."" Corker’s campaign called the ad ""tacky"" and said they were pleased when it was taken off the air.

In 2010, he made headlines for accusing President Obama of ""duplicity"" during a private lunch meeting at the Capitol along with his fellow Republican senators, accusing him of undermining his efforts to craft a bipartisan financial regulation bill. ""I told him I thought there was a degree of audacity in him even showing up today after what happened with financial regulation,"" he said. ""I just wanted him to tell me how, when he wakes up in the morning, comes over to a luncheon like ours today, how does he reconcile that duplicity?""

Corker burnished his bipartisan credentials with a bill that allowed both houses of Congress to vote for resolutions either approving or disapproving the Iran nuclear agreement. But a September 2015 resolution of disapproval vote in the Senate failed to advance. The House also voted, but those votes were meaningless because President Obama had enough support to ensure the deal would survive.

What you might not know about him:

A millionaire, Corker now donates his entire Senate paycheck to charity

He was named one of Time Magazine's ""100 Most Influential People"" of 2015, with his fellow Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander writing a profile calling him ""the pragmatist of Congress."" ""He is a conservative who prizes results over speeches. He is unafraid to challenge President [Barack] Obama and unafraid to work with him.... If he is not president himself, Corker is an obvious choice for Secretary of State or Treasury,"" Alexander wrote.

His campaign biography said he took a job picking trash at age 13 and through his teen years bagged ice, worked at Western Auto and ""put in long hours as a construction laborer.""

The campaign website also says he was inspired to begin his non-profit, Chattanooga Neighborhood Enterprise, after a mission trip with his church to Haiti in his late 20s.

What he has said about Trump:

Dec. 8, 2015, Commercial Appeal: ""These recent comments are completely counter to the values and principles of our great nation."" [on Muslim ban]

May 6, 2016 USA Today: ""I think he is well aware now that he has to move into a period of really laying out more substantial policies and certainly as he evolves, to the extent we can be helpful and flesh those out, we are more than glad to do so... What I hear in what he's saying ... is more of a George H.W. Bush view of the world. I hear him embracing more of a James Baker view of the world, and a larger degree of realism is making its way into his thinking, and I very much appreciate that.""

May 23, 2016 CNN: ""The fact that he challenging some of the status quo, it is causing these countries to think a little bit differently about the U.S. I say that in a positive way.""

June 5, 2016 ABC: ""I think that he's going to have to change. I’m not talking about him necessarily changing his views, but I think that he’s moving into a different phase, he's talking to the right people.” When asked whether he would help facilitate Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslim immigrants, Corker said, as he has before, ""I would not support it."" Corker also said that he did not ""condone"" Trump's comments about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel being unfit to hear a case against Trump University because of his Mexican heritage.""

Oct. 9, 2016: “These comments are obviously very inappropriate and offensive and his apology was absolutely necessary."" [on Trump's 2005 comments about women captured in a behind-the-scenes ""Access Hollywood"" video]

May 2, 2017 ABC: ""I'm not sure that sometimes the president takes into account what his words mean in other places around the world,"" said Corker about Trump's invitation to Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte to visit the White House. ""I think the president sometimes is being conversational and trying to show an openness and I think as time goes on he'll understand the gravity of actually having people come to the White House like that… [Duterte] is certainly not on the list of people that I would want to be one of the first people to come visit.""

Aug. 17, 2017 ABC News: ""The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate that he needs to be successful,"" said Corker about Trump in the aftermath of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

Oct. 9, 2017 Twitter: ""It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.""."
http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/chemist-kim-14-times-lethal-dosage-vx-face-50383012,['Abc News'],,[],,"The estranged half brother of North Korea's leader had about 1.4 times the lethal dosage of VX nerve agent on his face after he was attacked at a Malaysian airport, a government chemist testified Tuesday.

Pure VX was found on Kim Jong Nam's face, in his eye and in his blood plasma, Raja Subramaniam, who heads the Center of Chemical Weapons Analysis laboratory, said at the murder trial of two women accused of smearing the chemical weapon on Kim in the brazen assassination in February.

VX and related products were also detected on the clothes both women wore the day of the attack. The trial on Monday had temporarily moved to a high-security laboratory for the judge, attorneys and the defendants to examine the clothing before they were officially accepted as evidence.

Resuming his testimony Tuesday, Raja described the lethal potential of VX. He said animal studies showed the lethal dosage is 0.142 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, and that 50 percent of the tested population will die when exposed to this dosage on their skin.

Raja estimated the concentrate on Kim's facial skin was 0.2 milligram per kilogram of body weight.

Asked if this amount was enough to kill him, Raja said: ""I can't give a direct answer on this. Based on concentrate estimate, it is about 1.4 times the lethal dosage.""

He acknowledged that more of the poison might be needed to kill a heavier person but had no data on it.

He said the VX concentrate in Kim's eye was estimated at only 0.03 milligrams per kilogram of his body weight, but that correlated to VX penetrating faster through the eye than through the skin. VX was also found on the collar and sleeves of his blazer, probably because Kim wiped his face on his blazer after the attack, Raja said.

Asked why traces of VX was also detected on fingernail clippings of Vietnamese suspect Doan Thi Huong but not on Indonesian Siti Aisyah, Raja said it was likely that Huong didn't decontaminate herself properly. He said VX can be removed fully by washing and scrubbing the palm within 15 minutes of exposure.

Aisyah and Huong pleaded not guilty at the start of the trial last week to murder charges that carry a mandatory death sentence if they are convicted.

Raja's finding of VX on the women's clothing and Huong's fingernails was the first evidence linking VX to the two suspects. Their attorneys have said the women were duped by suspected North Korean agents into believing they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden camera TV show.

Under cross-examination, Raja said it wasn't possible that the VX used to kill Kim was a ""binary"" concoction of two non-fatal elements as high temperature would be required to create VX.

He agreed with the defense's assertion that actual VX could have been smuggled into Malaysia or a non-fatal compound could have been smuggled into the country and mixed with sulphur, another non-toxic element, to create VX in a clandestine laboratory.

Raja also said he discarded samples of clothing that were cut and tested for VX under the standard operating procedure recommended by the Organization of Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The defense lawyer had questioned why the samples were not kept for verification by the court.

One item where Raja detected VX was not officially admitted as evidence in the case: the blazer Kim was wearing when he was attacked. Raja testified it was not available because police told him to return Kim's personal belongings, including his blazer, bag and chains, to North Korea.

He also said his findings identifying VX and detecting it on the various items admitted as evidence were not sent to laboratories abroad for verification.

Prosecutors have said they will present airport security videos this week that show the two women carrying out the attack and indicate they knew they were handling poison.

""We have an uphill battle in this case. We are the underdogs. They have the upper hand but we have our own strategy,"" prosecutor Wan Shaharuddin Wan Ladin told reporters later.

VX is banned by an international treaty as a weapon of mass destruction but is believed to be part of North Korea's chemical weapons arsenal.

Kim was the eldest son in the current generation of North Korea's dynastic rulers but lived in virtual exile as an apparent family outcast. North Korea experts say he may have been killed because he was perceived as a threat to the nation's current leader, Kim Jong Un.

An airport security video reviewed by The Associated Press on Monday shows what may be Kim's final recorded moments of life after he fell perilously ill at the Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13. The video shows Kim apparently unconscious on a gurney and being given oxygen by medical attendants waiting for an elevator to take him to an ambulance.

The scene in the video appears almost casual, in contrast to the dramatic news of his death once it was made public.

The video was first broadcast late Sunday by Japan's Fuji TV."

Unusual red and black sand beaches, top-notch local wineries and excellent tavernas serving up fresh fish and fava also await, whether you choose to arrive by ferry (high-speed and slow options are both available) or plane.

Weeks after he hit puberty, Chris said Corcoran took him over to his apartment before one of their troop meetings and said, “Hey, I got some beer in the fridge for you. Help yourself.”

“Then he breaks out a stash of porn,” Chris said. “Then one thing led to another, but at that point, you know, I was 11 and essentially intoxicated … not knowing what to do, what was happening to my body.”

“I was literally frozen,” he continued. “I just couldn’t move.”

Chris, now an adult, said he is finally sharing his story publically, two decades later. His adulthood, he said, is plagued by depression, anxiety and anger.

“I’ve had this kind of whirlwind of mess throughout my adult life,” he said. “I’m still dealing with this, like it happened yesterday.”

Chris, along with two other former Boy Scouts who also allege Corcoran abused them, have filed a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America, saying the organization did not do enough to prevent the sexual abuse.

“Who's the only guy in the troop without a kid there ... and then look at his interaction with the kids,” Chris said. “If you knew there was a problem like this and someone was down there with knowledge of what ‘grooming’ looks like you're going to spot it in five minutes. They chose not to do this.”

Chris said there was no escaping the abuse and eventually, he said, he was spending hours at a time with Corcoran.

The abuse, he said, even continued on troop outings, including a group ski trip. Chris has a photo from that trip that shows an unidentified adult man in his underwater sitting next to him.

“Those are his boxers,” Chris said, pointing to the man in the photo. “So at what point does someone say, ‘Hey there's a problem here.’ How does someone not realize that there's an issue?”

He said Corcoran openly provided young scouts with alcohol, adding that on some of their away trips, “he literally turned it into a booze fest.”

In one instance, Chris said an adult friend of Corcoran’s allegedly witnessed the sexual abuse, catching him and Corcoran together, and confronted Corcoran about it.

“Steve told me he played it off,” Chris said. “He said, ‘You need to be more careful in the future,’ and that friend just disappeared out of the troop ... He didn’t like to do what normal people would do and call the police.”

Chris said the abuse finally ended when he was 16 years old, but by then, his former Scout leader had become a family friend and was even a guest at his wedding.

“I can’t believe the guy made it at my wedding,” Chris said. “Unfortunately, I originally left them off the list for the wedding, and my wife asked me, ‘What about him?’ And I remember I didn't have an answer to say no. Like how could I? At the time I couldn't justify saying no without telling the truth.”

Chris’s wife Tina said she had no idea the pain Chris said he suffered as a child and that Chris opened up to her about it when they were almost six years into their marriage.

“He said, ‘Steve abused me,’ and that was it,” Tina said. “It was like a one statement: ‘Steve abused me.' I mean I had no clue, no earthly idea.”

After he told her, Tina said she then started to notice the pain on Chris’s face in their wedding photos taken with Corcoran.

Chris said he also finally confided in his attorney at the time.

“I broke down in absolute tears and I just told him,” he said. “I told him exactly what happened.”

In a statement to ABC News, The Boy Scouts of America said the organization is “outraged there have been times when Scouts were abused and we sincerely apologize to victims and their families... in the many years since these alleged actions occurred, we have continued to evaluate and strengthen our efforts to protect youth.”

Attorney Bruce Nagel, who represents Chris in his civil suit against the organization, said they hope their lawsuit will “bring to light that this is an epidemic throughout the United States.”

“People need to be educated, that there is sexual abuse going on through the United States in the Boy Scouts,” Nagel added.

Corcoran’s attorney maintains that his client is innocent of the abuse allegations. But in a separate case, Corcoran, now 49, was found guilty of possession of child pornography. In June, he was sentenced to seven years in prison.

If he could say anything to Corcoran now, Chris said he would ask him “why me?”

“For some reason he chose me,” Chris continued. “I don’t know.”

This is not the first time The Boy Scouts of America have been accused of harboring abusers in its ranks of scout leaders.

In 2010, a Portland, Oregon, jury awarded former scout Kerry Lewis almost $20 million in damages for the sexual abuse he said he suffered in the ‘80s by former assistant Scoutmaster Timur Dykes.

Lewis’ attorneys successfully argued that at the time the Boy Scouts of America knew Dykes had a history of child molestation. Dykes, who eventually served prison time for charges related to sex with minors, admitted as early as 1983 that he had molested 17 boys.

""If you put the interests of your organization ahead of the safety of children, the guardians of our community's safety, which we call juries, will hold you accountable,"" said Kelly Clark, one of Lewis’ attorneys.

The month-long trial also revealed the Scouts kept secret files of alleged child molesters for decades.

The Los Angeles Times spent a year creating a database of the Boy Scouts files. Reporter Kim Christensen led the newspaper’s investigation.

“The perversion files, which is a term used internally by the Boy Scouts, are about 5,000 files of alleged and in some cases proven sexual abuse in the Boy Scouts,” Christensen said. “The whole idea of the perversion files with the scouts was they were intended to keep abusive scout leaders from rejoining after they’d been found out.”

According to the L.A. Times analysis, the alleged abuse occurred throughout the country and followed a similar pattern.

“The abusive scout leaders would often groom the kids,” he said. “You know, buy them alcohol, show them porn, take them to ball games just to kind of bring them into their confidence, into their sphere, and then the abuse would start.”

The newspaper said that in many cases, the Boy Scouts did not report the alleged abuser to authorities, leaving the alleged victims to suffer in secret.

“It’s a lifelong scarring thing for a lot of these kids,” Christensen said. “Some of these guys say, ‘It’s something I’ve been dealing with by myself for 40 years.’”

The Boy Scouts of America says it has since implemented new policies including criminal background checks for adult leaders, requiring two or more adults to be present at all times during scouting activities, prompt mandatory reporting of any allegation or suspicion of abuse, and a help line to report suspected abuse.

As for Chris, he is trying to move forward. He and Tina are expecting their second child in November – a boy. Both said they would never allow their son to enter Boy Scouts. Chris said intense therapy and the support of his wife is helping him heal.

“If and when he wants to tell me more than he already has, he will,” Tina said. “But he just needs someone to take care of him.”"
http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/growing-democrat-red-state-texas-republican-blue-state/story?id=50128969,"['Abc News', 'Emily Taguchi', 'Lauren Effron', 'More Lauren']",,[],,"Most Americans today believe our country is deeply politically divided and politically active, and it has even trickled down into elementary schools.

“People have punched me in the face before” for supporting President Donald Trump, said 8-year-old Satya, whose parents are Republicans, voted for Trump and who live in California, a traditionally deep blue state. Satya said she has even lost friends over it.

Similarly, in Texas, a traditionally red state, another 8-year-old named Zoe whose mother is Democrats said, “My friend Matthew, he was worried about his grandparents getting deported when Donald Trump became the president.”

“Nightline” spoke to three mothers who are who are Democrats living in Texas and three mothers who are Republicans living in California, all of whom said their kids received backlash at school and from friends for their families’ political beliefs.

“Oh, people say, ‘You’re bad because you like Donald Trump and I wanted Hillary,’ and they get mad at me,” said Kieran, a 9-year-old living in Los Angeles County.

Veronica Penrod, a Democrat living in Texas, said after the election, kids at her child’s school were going around saying “build the wall.” She added that her family is concerned that her being a Democrat means she doesn’t have a relationship with God.

Over in Los Angeles County, California, Republican women were feeling similarly shamed for their beliefs. A group of them meet in a private Facebook group to chat about their support for Trump since the election in a “safe space,” as one mom put it. The mothers “Nightline” spoke to in California asked that their last names not be used.

One mother named Elizabeth said some people in the Facebook group are in the entertainment industry or are business owners and said, “people can’t be out about [their support for Trump] because it could jeopardize their career.”

Elizabeth’s 11-year-old son Dwight said, “I wore a Trump shirt to school, and everyone got all mad at me.”

When President Barack Obama was elected, Dwight said, “We didn’t go out on the street and protest, and break things down and burn things, we kept quiet for eight years so why can’t the Democrats just let us have our fun.”

“Nightline” first met Dwight and his mother at PolitiCon earlier this summer, a convention in Los Angeles. “We went because Dwight wanted to go,” Elizabeth said.

Dwight said he voted for Trump in his school’s mock election and he said when he told his friends who he voted for, he was called “a disgrace.”

“And I was like, ‘Well I should have my own political beliefs,’” he said. “And I don’t harass you for liking Obama.”

Another California Republican mom named Amy said “people on the left” in their area are “very vocal” about their opinions, “but when I’m vocal about my opinions, I am racist, I’m intolerant.”

Amy said she tells her children not to talk about politics or talk about the fact their parents voted for Trump when they are at school.

Carrie, Satya’s mother, said her daughter told her that girls at school were telling her that “Trump grabs women,” a loose reference to the infamous 2005 “Hollywood Access” tape were Trump could be heard making lewd comments about women.

“She comes home and she tells me this stuff and I said, ‘Honey, it’s much more complicated than that,’” Carrie said.

“We live in this bubble, in L.A.,” Amy added.

“It’s not a friendly environment,” Carrie agreed, adding that she had a “Jail Hillary” sticker on her car and that “did not go well.”

Los Angeles County voted 72 percent for Hillary Clinton and 22.5 percent for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. But despite differences, all three California mothers said the animosity they have received had “never been this bad.”

“And the issues have never been this critical,” Carrie said. “We have never had the level of national security threat, and he [Trump] has been very productive, the economy, the stock market, jobs.”

“We end up with a country where people are just too scared to get involved and fix what’s really wrong,” she added.

The Democratic families in Texas disagree on that point—they are active in the Tarrant County Democratic Women’s group which has experienced unprecedented growth since Donald Trump was elected. They routinely protest and participate in human rights-oriented marches.

Vanessa Adia, a teacher and a mother of two, seemed hopeful that there are opportunities to bridge the political divide. She is a Democrat running in the Texas 12th Congressional district against a 20-year Republican incumbent. She says she wants to enter political office because “who is going to fight for my children… and my students?”

One of the things every mom shares, Adia continued, is they want to know their children are safe when they leave the house.

“Those are values that every single parent has in common and I think that’s generally a good starting point when we’re talking with people,” Adia said.

Similarly, the Republican moms in California say despite differences over the major issues, there are things all moms have in common.

And again, kids learn from their parents. Little Zoe is the daughter of retired U.S. Army veteran Brittney Power, who says she voted for Hillary Clinton.

“My mom talked to me about [Trump] and she was like, ‘He doesn’t like gay people, he doesn’t like all sorts of stuff, and it made me realize Donald Trump was a bad person,” Zoe said.

Leah Payne, the president of the Tarrant County Democratic Women’s Club, still has her “Texans for Hillary” sign out on her lawn, as well as a rainbow American flag and a homemade, bright pink Planned Parenthood wreath featuring various forms of contraception.

Payne said there is a group of people in the Ft. Worth area who are talking about trying to get local Democrats and Republicans in the same room together so they can hash out some of these issues.

When asked why she wouldn’t move to a more liberal area like Los Angeles, Payne said, it’s “because I feel I’ve got to do this work.”

“If I’m not here to have these conversations then who will,” she added.

And the way to move forward, according to Leah Payne, is for everyone to “be adults.”

“We have to have conversations that are hard to have,” Payne said.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-alliance-powerful-republican-senator-broke-verbal-warfare/story?id=50367683,"['Abc News', 'More Mariam']",,[],,"President Donald Trump’s war of words with a powerful Republican senator escalated over the weekend, with the president attacking Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee in a series of tweets and culminating in a bombshell interview in which the GOP lawmaker said Trump was setting the U.S. on a “path to World War III.”

Just last year, Trump and Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, were allies.

Corker, who was a real estate developer as Trump is, rallied with Trump during the presidential campaign and endorsed him for the GOP nomination ahead of the Republican National Convention.

“The reason you love him so much is because he loves you,” Corker told a crowd at a North Carolina rally prior to the convention. “He loves you, and he wants the best for you.”

The senator added, ""It says a lot about a person to meet their family, spend time with their kids, if you will, and to be around the people that have worked in the Trump organization for 25 and 30 years, to see the respect they have for the person they have worked with … to see how he treats people around him.

Trump returned the praise, calling Corker “a great friend of mine, somebody respected by everybody.”

Corker was at one point even considered as a potential running mate for Trump.

He didn't seem interested, however, telling The Washington Post, “There are people far more suited for being a candidate for vice president, and I think I’m far more suited for other types of things.”

Two days after Trump won the presidential election in November, Corker told ABC News that he was ""excited about the opportunity that awaits President-elect Trump, Congress, and the American people.""

By August of this year, however, Corker had some critical words after the president seemed to suggest a moral equivalence between white nationalists and counterprotesters in the wake of deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.

The president denounced ""hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.""

Corker said Trump was ""helping inspire divisions"" in the nation because that ""generates support"" from his political base.

Trump ""has not demonstrated that he understands the character of this nation,"" the Republican senator said. ""The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate that he needs to be successful.""

Corker called for ""radical changes"" from the White House.

The following month, though, the Tennessee lawmaker again heaped praise on Trump the day after his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 19.

“President Trump sent a very clear signal yesterday about what America stands for and who and what the world must stand against,” said Corker. “After years of ambiguous messaging, the president’s direct approach was a welcomed change, and I shared that with him when we spoke this morning.”

But last week, following a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had allegedly referred to the president months before as a ""moron,"" Corker praised Tillerson along with Defense Secretary James Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly.

""I think Sec. Tillerson, Sec. Mattis, and Chief of Staff Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos,” Corker said Wednesday.

Things got more heated from there.

Trump used Twitter on Sunday morning to slam the Tennessee senator, whose second term in the Senate ends next year and who has said he won't run for a third term.

The president claimed in his tweets that Corker decided not to run again after Trump said he wouldn't endorse him and that the senator had wanted the post of secretary of state.

Corker responded sharply, tweeting, ""It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center.""

It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017

And, in a later statement to ABC News, the senator's chief of staff, Todd Womack, disputed the president's tweeted claims.

""The president called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times,"" Womack said.

In a subsequent interview Sunday with The New York Times, Corker said Trump was behaving as if he was on “a reality show,” had undermined diplomacy with his tweets and could put the U.S. “on the path to World War III.”

Corker will be in office until his term ends in early January 2019. Despite his decision against running for reelection, he could be a crucial vote in the Senate over the next 15 months on issues such as tax reform.

“I've provided the entertainment for all of you because I’m willing to say things that are on people's minds,” Corker said in an interview with ABC News in September, a day after he announced that he would not seek reelection.

“I’m frank and I’ve been that way because I’ve never thought about a future election. It’s always been about trying to make something happen,” he said.

At least 10 people have died from the blazes, with hundreds of structures scorched and thousands forced to evacuate. The fires began around 10 p.m. local time Sunday night, said Ken Pimlott, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire).

By Monday afternoon, nearly 90,000 acres burned and the flames threatened the large city of Anaheim.

Here’s how the weather conditions fueled a fast-moving fire and destruction from north to south.

California wildfires and weather

In northern California, strong, northeasterly gusts paired with low humidity in the morning. The gusts facilitated a quick spread of the fire.

In southern California, a Santa Ana wind event fueled the fires. October is peak time for Santa Ana winds, which create high pressure over the Great Basin and low pressure off the coast, allowing for very strong offshore winds. October is traditionally the worst time to fight fires in California, Pimlott said this the morning.

Today, gusts reached up to 70 miles per hour in some high elevation areas in southern California.

This, paired with the dry conditions brought about by low humidity, created critical fire danger.

California Gov. Jerry Brown stressed the danger of these simultaneous conditions in a press conference this morning.

“This is really serious. It’s moving fast. The heat, the lack of humidity and the winds are all driving a very dangerous situation and making it worse,” Brown said.

There is good news, however -- because though the winds flared this morning, they’re now likely to weaken. The worst of the winds passed earlier today in both northern and southern California."
http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/engineers-lives-lost-mexico-quake-saved-50383365,['Abc News'],,[],,"Nearly two-thirds of the buildings that collapsed in Mexico City's monstrous earthquake last month were built using a construction method that is now forbidden in seismic hotspots in the United States, Chile and New Zealand, according to new data compiled by a team of structural engineers at Stanford University.

The suspect building technique called flat slab — in which floors are supported only by concrete columns — caused 61 percent of the building collapses in last month's magnitude 7.1 quake, which killed 369 people and blanketed tree-lined avenues in rubble.

Now, several prominent engineers say some of those structure failures could have been prevented and lives could have been saved had Mexico City officials only gone forward with a proposal to forbid that type of construction when they toughened building codes after the 1985 earthquake in Mexico's capital.

""We have known for 30 years that this system killed lots of people, so why are we still using it?"" asked Eduardo Miranda, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford and global expert on earthquake-resistant design who compiled the data obtained by The Associated Press. ""The right decision after '85 would have been to completely ban this kind of construction. We could have saved lives.""

Anahi Abadia and her husband were among the fortunate: they were in Home Depot when the earthquake hit, shaking the store so fiercely the structure screeched. Minutes later, a text came in from their neighbor: The elegant apartment they had purchased only six months earlier had collapsed, rendering their new home a pile of crushed concrete.

Two women working in Abadia's trendy apartment building died on Sept. 19 when the structure collapsed after a corner column failed, and the flat-slab structure pancaked, Miranda said.

The concrete slabs used to build floors and ceilings can be cast to include some rebar for reinforcement, and give builders greater flexibility in room layout and allow for higher ceilings.

But in an earthquake, without reinforced concrete walls or lateral bracing to resist forces pushing structures sideways, buildings with that design can move too much. The columns, and connections between the slabs and columns, can easily break, prompting collapse, as was the case at a school where 26 people died, most of them children.

But at Abadia's building, the construction method was only the start of the problems: The units were designed by an architect whose license lapsed, and approved in a borough where auditors previously found illegal construction occurred unchecked.

Experts concur that the devastation caused by last month's earthquake in the city of 8.9 million people could have been much worse had the building codes not been so strong, but it also has forced an uncomfortable conversation about their shortcomings. Now, as experts race to toughen standards to retrofit hundreds of damaged buildings, they are grappling with the reality that corruption has allowed hundreds of structures to be built outside the rules atop the soft soils of Mexico City's ancient lakebed.

In the crisis following the 1985 quake, a group of academics, building officials and engineers drafted emergency recommendations to strengthen Mexico City's seismic codes, which were swiftly passed into law.

Some architects and builders were opposed to an outright ban on flat slab construction, said Miranda, who wrote reports that informed the committee.

""There were lots of builders and owners who were not going to be happy that you just stopped their construction,"" said Miranda, who later served on Mexico's code committee in the 1990s, and on committees funded by the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""These things start as technical conversations but then you run into policy and politics.""

The new codes allowed flat slab construction if developers designed the building to be seismically stronger than structures with beams or concrete walls.

Authorities did not pay enough attention to evaluating if existing flat slab structures needed a seismic retrofit, Miranda said.

""It would have been better to have insisted very much about not using flat slab,"" said Roberto Meli, a renowned structural engineer who served on the code committee in 1985, and went on to head the federal Center for Disaster Protection founded after that quake.

The new codes gave more responsibility to a network of private engineers who are hired and paid by developers, and who submit structural plans to borough authorities. In practice, that means private engineers — not government experts — vet projects' structural safety, and corruption can intervene.

""Corruption can come in many forms, from the moment someone accepts a bribe to when someone falsifies documents, or fails to present the right structural plans to borough authorities,"" said Renato Berron, head of the Institute for the Security of Constructions of Mexico City, a city agency.

In recent decades, middle-class enclaves close to the city's center have experienced vertiginous growth, and many unpermitted helipads and illegal, multi-floor garages have sprouted up between historic homes. In the last 15 years, residents of Abadia's Benito Juarez borough and two others nearby have sent in the highest number of complaints about land-use violations to a city watchdog agency.

Now, those same boroughs are home to dozens of damaged buildings, according to data from the Mexican Society of Structural Engineering. Miranda, whose team compiled the data on the 44 collapses through in-person visits and detailed structural analysis, estimates that hundreds of damaged buildings were built with flat slab systems, including some built relatively recently.

Meli said he and the committee will seek to strengthen retrofitting standards first, and by early next year may reexamine flat slab, although he is not convinced prohibiting the method outright would have worked.

Abadia said she hopes shoddy builders will be held responsible.

""A new building should not fall down,"" she said.

Beckham was injured Sunday while trying to make a catch in the fourth quarter of a 27-22 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. He left the field on a cart.

""I spoke to him after the game,"" coach Ben McAdoo said on his Monday conference call. ""It's a sad situation.""

McAdoo wasn't sure if there were any long-term consequences from the injury.

Beckham left the field Sunday in tears and with a towel over his face in obvious pain. He underwent further tests Monday morning that validated the original belief that surgery was necessary.

He was carted off the field Sunday after he suffered the injury with four minutes remaining in the loss, which dropped the Giants to 0-5. He had gone up for a catch and fell awkwardly to the ground, and Chargers players immediately called for medical help.

""I knew it was bad,"" Giants tight end Evan Engram said.

Beckham had five catches for 97 yards and a touchdown against the Chargers. His season ends with 25 catches, 302 yards and three touchdowns.

It will be the first time in his four professional seasons that Beckham didn't reach at least 90 catches, 1,300 yards and 10 touchdowns.

Beckham wasn't the only Giants receiver to receive bad news on Sunday. Dwayne Harris fractured his foot and will undergo season-ending surgery Tuesday.

Both Beckham and Harris were placed on injured reserve Monday.

Brandon Marshall and Sterling Shepard also injured their ankles. The Giants declared Shepard as day to day while Marshall continued to undergo tests Monday to determine the severity of his injury.

Short on healthy wide receivers -- the Giants finished Sunday with Roger Lewis?as the last-man standing -- they re-signed Tavarres King and elevated rookie Travis Rudolph from the practice squad on Monday. The Giants are added wide receiver Darius Powe to the practice squad.

King has spent most of the past three years with the Giants and scored a 41-yard touchdown in their playoff loss last season to the Green Bay Packers. Powe spent last season on the practice squad and was released this summer in part because of a hamstring injury.

""We have a bunch of guys who were nicked up in the ballgame at the receiver spot and we have some guys on the practice squad, some guys on the roster that we bump them up, give them opportunities. Next man up,"" McAdoo said. ""They well-deserved the opportunities. You hate to see it like this, but it's a part of the game.""

The short-handed Giants play Sunday night in Denver potentially without their top three receivers. The Broncos have the league's top-ranked defense."

Newlyweds Jessica and Aaron Bairos were both born on April 28, 1990, in Morton Hospital in Taunton, Massachusetts.

“We still laugh about it every birthday,” Jessica Bairos, 27, told ABC News.

Imagemakers, New Bedford, Mass.

According to their local paper’s birth announcements, they were the only babies born at the hospital that Saturday – Jessica Gomes, her maiden name, to parents Bradford and Maria Gomes, and Aaron Bairos, to parents Ernesto and Idelta Bairos.

Jessica and Aaron Bairos

The two moms vaguely remember saying hello to each other that day, with no clue what destiny had in store for their children.

“It sounds silly but both of our families are Portuguese, and when you’re Portuguese, you know everyone around you,” Jessica Bairos said with a laugh. “When his mom went into labor, she saw my mom and they remember saying ‘hi’ to each other casually.”

Jessica Bairos

Aaron Bairos

Jessica Bairos' family took a photo of her in the hospital's nursery the day she was born and there is a baby boy in the background. They've long suspected it must be Aaron Bairos, but the image is too blurry to know for sure.

""That’s the whole mystery,"" said Aaron Bairos. ""There were obviously only two babies born in the hospital on that day, and there’s a baby in the background. But the face is blurry because the focus is on Jess. The inside joke is that's probably me, but there’s no way to prove that.""

Jessica and Aaron Bairos

The bride and groom didn’t know each other until mutual friends introduced them in high school. Jessica Bairos lived in Taunton until she was 10, but then moved to a neighboring town. They never went to the same school.

“We all went out, and it was history from there,” said Aaron Bairos.

Imagemakers, New Bedford, Mass.

They wed on Sept. 9 in Taunton, sealing the idea they were born, quite literally, to be together.

“The coincidence of this happening, the more I think of it, is pretty weird,” said the groom. “If somebody told me that this was their story, I’d be like, ‘This is really freaking cool.’”

Imagemakers, New Bedford, Mass.

The Bairos have been together for nine years, so sharing a birthday isn’t new to them, but they said they are enjoying everyone’s reactions to their unique story.

“It’s unbelievable. We can’t believe it,” the bride said of their overnight fame. “It’s something so personal to us that we’ve always joked about. It’s a good memory for us to one day tell the kids.”"

Paddock, the lone suspect according to Las Vegas police, killed himself in the hotel suite he had rented on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino as police closed in on his location. With Paddock’s death, any clear answer for why he opened fire on the festival and killed 58 people and wounded 489 others may be lost.

Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo, the public face of the investigation, has had few answers for why Paddock committed the crime. Authorities did not hold a press conference on Thursday, the first day since Sunday that one wasn’t held.

By Friday, although investigators had followed a thousand leads, there was still ""no clear motive or reason why"" Paddock carried out the mass shooting, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said in a press conference this afternoon.

""All the rumor and speculation has not been helpful to our investigation, McMahill said, adding that the police department ""will not stop"" its efforts to determine the motivation behind the attack.

While investigating Paddock and his motives, authorities are ""looking at every aspect from birth to death in this case,"" McMahill said.

The FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit is doing a workup and profile of Paddock. So far, they're ""baffled,"" according to officials briefed on the investigation.

Paddock reported a reported $5 million in earnings in 2015 -- most of it from gambling, according to investigators who have reviewed his financial records.

A pill bottle with a prescription for Valium in Paddock's name was also found, according to officials briefed on the investigation. McMahill could not confirm any medication Paddock was taking, but said investigators are looking into any mental and physical health issues he may have had.

While searching Paddock's hotel room, investigators also found a charger that doesn't work with his phone, the officials said. Investigators are unclear as to whether it was left by a previous guest, or if Paddock may have grabbed the wrong one at his home.

Officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News on Friday that Paddock brought some tools and metal bars with him to the hotel, which he later used to block access to the 32nd floor hallway from the stairwell.

When he would call room service to order food, the officials said, Paddock would act like he was speaking to others in the room with him, acting like he was checking orders with other people and asking what they wanted. Investigators do not believe he had company at those times, the said. They believe he either was experiencing schizophrenia, or intentionally trying to make room service believe he was not alone.

The police department and the FBI have started a campaign seeking information on events leading up to the incident, FBI Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse said in the press conference.

""There are still a number of people out there that know something looked out of place, McMahill said, instructing members of the public to call 1-800-CALL-FBI.

""1 October"" has become the official title of the mass shooting for investigators, Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak said.

Sunday's attack was in stark contrast to recent mass shootings, which have had motives surface soon afterward. Omar Mateen, who killed 49 people at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida in June 2016, called police to confess to being an ISIS sympathizer while still in the club. When Nidal Hassan shot and killed 13 people at Fort Hood in 2009, authorities were already aware he had reached out to radical clerics in the Middle East. Dylann Roof walked into a church in Columbia, South Carolina in December 2016 and killed nine people, only after telling friends he planned to kill people and posting a manifesto espousing white supremacy.

The investigation into Paddock so far has had no such crystallizing context.

Lombardo has said investigators are looking at a computer and multiple electronic devices found in the suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel. Authorities have also removed evidence from homes Paddock owned in Mesquite and Reno, Nevada. There have not been any revelations so far.

Authorities also found a note in Paddock's hotel room, but said it was not a suicide note. The note had numbers written on it, but the meaning of the numbers is unknown, a spokesperson for the police department said Friday.

Police say there is no question the attack was ""meticulously planned,"" as Lombardo described it. The shooter brought 10 pieces of luggage filled with weapons -- 24 guns, many of them rifles, and thousands of rounds of ammunition -- up to his hotel room.

Paddock is believed to have fired on the concert from inside the room -- not by sticking his gun out of the broken window, according to officials briefed on the investigation. By keeping his gun inside a darkened room, given the hotel’s mirrored exterior, it would be difficult for people to have seen the rifles’ muzzle flashes.

Experts say the weapons found in his hotel suite are high-end and high-powered, the kind used by U.S. special forces and commandos. Officials tell ABC News some of the ammo was bought by Paddock under a different name, leading to speculation of a possible accomplice.

Authorities have not been able to locate an accomplice after reviewing surveillance video from the Mandalay Bay hotel, but are confident that there was not another shooter in the room, McMahill said. Police are still investigating whether anyone else knew about the plot.

Lombardo said on Wednesday Paddock may have had help and that he planned to escape the scene, but provided no further details on either piece of information.

Authorities' best hopes seemed to be pinned on the girlfriend of Paddock, Marilou Danley, who was in the Philippines at the time of the shooting. Danley returned to the U.S. on Tuesday night and began speaking with the FBI on Wednesday. However, she has told authorities she had no idea Paddock was planning an attack, and her lawyer read a statement saying she knew him as ""a kind, caring man.""

A few months before the shooting, however, Paddock and Danley’s relationship at least appeared to be on solid ground.

Danley accompanied Paddock to a Reno car dealership in August, where Paddock purchased a vehicle with a check for $14,411. When Danley went on a test drive, she told a saleswoman that Paddock had saved her from a troubled marriage.

“She said she had a bad relationship prior to him,” the saleswoman told ABC News. “And how he had turned her life around. Really helped her out.”

Paddock bought Danley a plane ticket to her native Philippines and wired her $100,000, according to authorities. However, she's said she thought the dual purchases were a context to breaking up with her.

Danley continues to cooperate fully with authorities. She was still a considered a person of interest as of Friday, McMahill said.

FBI agents and police say they are skeptical of Danley’s claims that she knew nothing about the plans of her longtime boyfriend Stephen Paddock, but a family friend who visited them in Nevada say that could well be true.

Adam LeFerve told an Australian TV station he spent a week with the couple in Nevada in 2015, staying with them in a luxury casino suite, and later at his home.

“It’s not what I saw as a loving, caring relationship,” he said.

Less than 24 hours after the attack, Eric Paddock, Stephen's brother, told reporters outside his home that his brother had no connection to political or religious groups, and no obvious motives.

Officials say Las Vegas prostitutes have provided perhaps the most telling profile of Paddock, known by them as a regular customer, who was a cheap man who didn’t display emotion.

About the only clues into a reason for the attack center around Paddock's mental state. A person briefed on findings from the investigation told ABC News' Brian Ross that Paddock's mental state was deteriorating in the months prior to the attack, including weight gain, an increasingly slovenly appearance and an obsession with Danley's ex-husband.

The biggest revelations on Thursday into the investigation spoke more to the planning by Paddock than his motive. Officials briefed on the investigation told ABC News that Paddock had booked hotel rooms in Chicago in early August, coinciding with Lollapalooza, the massive annual music festival held in Grant Park that attracts hundreds of thousands of people, including this year one of former president Barack Obama’s daughters.

A source with the Chicago Police Department confirmed to ABC News that Paddock had reservations at The Blackstone Hotel, across from the park, though the hotel said no one with the name Paddock had stayed in their hotel in August.

A source also indicated to ABC News that Paddock had searched for hotels around Fenway Park in Boston, but there was no indication he had traveled there.

Meanwhile, the FBI is warning law enforcement partners of a potential threat to New York City's Times Square. According to a situational information report issued by the FBI and obtained by ABC News, an Instagram user on Wednesday afternoon posted, ""I'm a Syrian refugee and I'm going to do something big in New York on Friday."" The user also wrote, ""I'm going to make the Las Vegas attack look small on Friday at Times Square.""

However, the FBI and the New York City Police Department do not believe the threat is credible, after the FBI was able to trace the IP addresses associated with the Instagram posts to South Africa.

""The NYPD is aware of this online threat,"" police said in a statement Friday. ""It is very common to receive these types of postings in the aftermath of significant events throughout the world. There is no reason to believe this threat has any particular credibility. We have significant regular security resources in Times Square and continuously monitor the threat levels in this area.""

http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/uae-official-urges-qatar-give-world-cup-end-50362729,['Abc News'],,[],,"A top Emirati security official has said the only way for ""Qatar's crisis"" to end is if Doha gave up hosting the 2022 FIFA World Cup, his comments coming amid the ongoing diplomatic dispute between the energy-rich nation and four Arab countries.

Dubai security Lt. Gen. Dhahi Khalfan, known for being outspoken on Twitter, later wrote Monday his ""personal analysis"" of what he described as the financial pressure Doha faces in hosting the games had been misunderstood.

But his remarks came as lobbying firms backed by the four nations opposing Qatar in the diplomatic dispute increasingly target the upcoming soccer competition in their criticism.

The tournament has not come up in the demands previously made by the boycotting countries, though losing the World Cup would represent a bitter defeat for the tiny peninsular nation that's pushed itself onto the world stage with its bid and its Al-Jazeera satellite news network.

Qatari officials did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. However, the 2022 tournament's head in Qatar told The Associated Press on Friday the boycott poses ""no risk"" to the competition being held.

Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates all cut diplomatic ties and began a boycott of Qatar on June 5 , in part over allegations that Doha supports extremists and has overly warm ties to Iran.

Qatar has long denied funding extremists and restored full diplomatic ties to Iran amid the dispute. Doha shares a massive offshore natural gas field with Iran that makes its citizens incredibly wealthy.

On Sunday night, Khalfan targeted the FIFA tournament in his tweets.

""If the World Cup leaves Qatar, Qatar's crisis will be over ... because the crisis is created to get away from it,"" he wrote.

He added: ""The cost is bigger than what the Hamadein have planned,"" likely referring to Qatar's former ruling emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and former Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani. Some believe both still wield influence within Qatar's current government now ruled by the former emir's son, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

Khalfan, who previously has written controversy-catching tweets about Israel and U.S. President Donald Trump, also wrote that Qatar ""is no longer our concern,"" suggesting media in the boycotting countries dial back their coverage of the dispute.

By Monday night, Khalfan returned to Twitter to write that his tweets were his ""personal analysis.""

""I said Qatar is faking a crisis and claims it's besieged so it could get away from the burdens of building expensive sports facilities for the World Cup,"" he tweeted.

""That's why Qatar isn't ready and can't host the next World Cup,"" he added.

As the crisis has dragged on despite mediation by Kuwait, the United States and European nations, Qatar's opponents have begun targeting its hosting of the FIFA cup. They've pointed to allegations of corruption surrounding Qatar's winning bid, as well as the conditions that laborers working in Qatar face in building infrastructure for the games.

While FIFA ethics investigators found that the Qataris used a full range of lavishly funded state and sports agencies to win the 2010 vote to host the tournament, authorities concluded there was no ""evidence of any improper activity by the bid team.""

When Qatar's sole land border with Saudi Arabia was closed and sea traffic cut off by the boycott, World Cup organizers were forced to instigate a ""Plan B,"" including bringing in supplies from Turkey.

Asked about Khalfan's comments, FIFA said Monday: ""We do not comment on speculation.""

Hassan al-Thawadi, Qatar World Cup supreme committee secretary-general, told the AP on Friday that the project remained on time despite that.

""We are aiming to make sure that this World Cup leaves a legacy for the people of the Middle East (and) is an opportunity to transform our region towards a sustainable and stable future,"" he said.

http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democrats-donating-past-contributions-harvey-weinstein/story?id=50330448,"['Abc News', 'Alexander Mallin', 'More Ali', 'More Alexander']",,[],,"The developing sexual harassment and misconduct allegations against Harvey Weinstein has put a spotlight on Democrats now faced with questions about the Hollywood producer's deep involvement in supporting liberal politicians and causes. Weinstein's lawyer has said many of the specific allegations are false, but Weinstein has generally apologized for past misconduct.

At least eight Democratic senators have donated or vowed to donate away contributions Weinstein provided in past campaigns following the publishing of a New York Times investigation into three decades of allegations against Weinstein by current and former employees.

A spokesperson for New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker's campaign said it is donating the $7800 received in the past from Weinstein to the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault, a nonprofit charity organization. A spokesperson for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren similarly said she has donated the $5,000 she received from Weinstein in 2012 to charity.

New York Sen. Chuck Schumer's spokesman Matt House said Schumer is donating a total of $14,200 in past contributions to several charities supporting women.

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s senior adviser Glen Caplin told ABC News she is donating $11,800 she received from Weinstein in cycles prior to 2016 to the Rape Abuse Incest National Network.

Caplin additionally went after ""right-wing activists"" who have since seized on the story to attack Democrats.

“Kirsten invites the right-wing activists using this terrible story as a political tool to join her in actually working to combat sexual assault and sexual harassment in our society,"" Caplin said. ""They can start by endorsing her bipartisan legislation to end sexual violence on college campuses and in our military.”

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel hit Democrats who had yet to donate away Weinstein's money in a statement Friday afternoon.

""During three-decades worth of sexual harassment allegations, Harvey Weinstein lined the pockets of Democrats to the tune of three-quarters of a million dollars,"" McDaniel said. ""If Democrats and the DNC truly stand up for women like they say they do, then returning this dirty money should be a no-brainer.""

Donald Trump Jr. also took to social media calling for the president's former campaign rival to disavow Weinstein, evoking language used by his father's opponents following the release of an Access Hollywood tape in which Donald Trump is heard bragging about groping women.

Will She/they all Disavow? Embattled Hollywood Producer Harvey Weinstein Raised Big Bucks For Hillary Clinton & Dems https://t.co/6PHQaAQFNm — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 6, 2017

In a statement Friday afternoon, the DNC called the accusations against Weinstein ""deeply troubling"" and said it would donate ""over $30,000 in contributions from Weinstein"" to Democratic-aligned groups EMILY’s List, Emerge America and Higher Heights.

""The Democratic party condemns all forms of sexual harassment and assault,"" DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement. ""We hope that Republicans will do the same as we mark one year since the release of a tape showing President Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women followed by more than a dozen women who came forward to detail similar experiences of assault and harassment.""

Former President Barack Obama's office told ABC News it has ""no comment on the matter"" when asked about Weinstein's role as a bundler for Obama and his daughter Malia Obama interning for Weinstein's company in New York last year.

According to the campaign finance transparency site OpenSecrets, Weinstein donated $2700 directly to Hillary Clinton in November of 2016 and another $2700 in May of 2015. He also threw a fundraiser for her on June 20, 2016, in Manhattan, in which attendees contributed more than $33,400 to attend, per a Clinton aide.

ABC News has reached out to Clinton’s publisher for comment but has not yet received a response.

Weinstein said in a statement obtained by ABC News that he has ""caused a lot of pain"" and that he is taking a leave of absence from his company, during which time he said he will dedicate himself to working against the National Rifle Association.

""I so respect all women and regret what happened. I hope that my actions will speak louder than words and that one day we will all be able to earn their trust and sit down together with [attorney] Lisa [Bloom] to learn more. Jay Z wrote in [his song] '4:44' 'I'm not the man I thought I was and I better be that man for my children.' The same is true for me. I want a second chance in the community but I know I've got work to do to earn it.""

Weinstein has hired Hulk Hogan's lawyer, Charles Harder, who won the former wrestler a $140 million-dollar verdict against Gawker that was later settled for $31 million. Harder told ABC News in a statement that the Times' report on Weinstein is ""saturated with false and defamatory statements"" about his client and that he is preparing a lawsuit against the newspaper.

The New York Times told ABC News that it is ""confident in the accuracy"" of the reporting."

Twenty presidential candidates are vying for a majority in the first round of elections, while nearly 1,000 candidates from 26 parties fight for 73 seats in the House of Representatives.

Last Thursday, the New York Times published a report alleging that several women, including actress Ashley Judd, accused Weinstein of sexual harassment and/or unwanted physical contact over the past few decades.

Though the producer immediately apologized for misconduct and announced that he planned to take a leave of absence from work while he bettered himself, on Sunday night, the board of The Weinstein Company voted to terminate him permanently.

Weinstein, 64, issued a mea culpa last week, and wrote in a statement that he ""respect[s] all women and regret[s] what happened.""

""I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them,"" he added.

However, his attorney Charles Harder stated to ABC News at the time that the Times article was ""saturated with false and defamatory statements,"" and as a result, he was preparing a lawsuit against the newspaper. Any proceeds made as a result of the lawsuit would be donated to women's charities, Harder added.

Streep, who said that Weinstein ""was exasperating but respectful"" toward her professionally, claimed that in spite of reports, ""not everybody knew"" about his inappropriate behavior. She was unaware of the many allegations made against him, she added.

“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes,"" she said. ""The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”

Streep collaborated with Weinstein on films including ""August: Osage County"" and ""The Iron Lady."" She earned Oscar nominations for both.

The allegations made against Weinstein have been met with varied responses from the entertainment community. Late-night hosts were criticized for not mentioning the allegations in their monologues last week and ""Saturday Night Live"" executive producer Lorne Michaels came under fire for omitting the storyline from last weekend's episode. The Huffington Post also noted that stars including Gwyneth Paltrow and Quentin Tarantino, both of whom have worked with Weinstein for many years, have also remained silent.

However, others have been outspoken with their criticism. Director Kevin Smith said he was ""ashamed"" that Weinstein financed ""the first 14 years of my career,"" and Dame Judi Dench released a statement, calling the allegations ""horrifying.""

“Whilst there is no doubt that Harvey Weinstein has helped and championed my film career for the past 20 years, I was completely unaware of these offences which are, of course, horrifying,"" she said, according to People. ""I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered, and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out.""

A representative for Weinstein did not respond to ABC News' request for comment."

In the wake of Hurricane Maria, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pledged to send a ""connectivity team"" to help restore communications in ravaged Puerto Rico. Google parent company Alphabet offered to send its Wi-Fi balloons. They were among several tech companies proposing disaster response ideas, most aimed at getting phone and internet service up and running.

Some of these plans, of course, are more aspirational than others.

BATTERY POWER

Tesla CEO Elon Musk often takes to Twitter to mull over ideas, but on Friday his musings about sending his company's solar-powered batteries to help restore Puerto Rico's power attracted the attention of the island's governor.

""Let's talk,"" said Gov. Ricardo Rossello in a Friday tweet .

Musk agreed. Hours later, he announced he was delaying the unveiling of Tesla's new semi-truck and diverting resources, in part to ""increase battery production for Puerto Rico and other affected areas.""

The need for help in restoring power and communication after Hurricane Maria is great: The Puerto Rican energy authority reported Saturday that about 88 percent of the island is still without power. The Federal Communications Commission said Saturday that 82 percent of cell sites remain out in Puerto Rico; 58 percent are out of service in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

The FCC's daily status report also shows significant wireline, TV and radio outages remain in both U.S. territories. The agency formed a task force this week and approved an advance of $77 million to support carriers working to restore telecommunications services.

VAGUE PROMISES

But many offers of help from big companies remain somewhat vague. Google parent company Alphabet has proposed launching balloons over the island to bring Wi-Fi service to hard-to-reach places, as it has in other parts of the world.

The FCC announced Saturday that it's approved an experimental license for Project Loon to operate in Puerto Rico. But that doesn't mean it will able to get them in the air anytime soon.

""We're grateful for the support of the FCC and the Puerto Rican authorities as we work hard to see if it's possible to use Loon balloons to bring emergency connectivity to the island during this time of need,"" said Libby Leahy, a spokesman for Alphabet's X division.

But there are limitations, she said Saturday.

""To deliver signal to people's devices, Loon needs be integrated with a telco partner's network — the balloons can't do it alone,"" she said, adding that the company is ""making solid progress on this next step.""

COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS

Cisco Systems has sent a tactical team and says it is working with local government, emergency responders and service providers to facilitate restoration and recovery efforts. The company, along with Microsoft and others, backs the NetHope consortium, which specializes in setting up post-disaster communication networks and has field teams now operating in Puerto Rico and several other Caribbean islands.

""Communication is critical during a disaster,"" Zuckerberg said after the hurricane hit, announcing that employees from his company's connectivity team — the same group working to build high-altitude drones that can beam internet service down to Earth — were heading to Puerto Rico. But with its aircraft still in the testing phase, the company said Friday that the engineers it's sent to Puerto Rico are focused on providing support to NetHope's teams.

SMALLER ORGANIZATIONS

Much of the ground work is being spearheaded by nonprofit organizations and small firms with expertise in rural or emergency communications.

Lexington, Massachusetts-based Vanu Inc., which sets up wireless communications networks in rural parts of the United States, Africa and India, is sending dozens of its small, solar-powered cellular base stations to volunteer crews on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Aid workers are pairing Vanu's devices with other technology, such as inflatable satellite antennas.

After setting up a network on the island of Vieques, off the main island of Puerto Rico, one team watched from a roof as local residents started getting text alerts from family members who had been trying to get in touch.

""They noticed everyone in the plaza pulling their phones out,"" said CEO Vanu Bose. ""You don't have to announce you've lit up coverage. People know right away."""
http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/taiwan-leader-protect-regional-stability-amid-china-tension-50383364,['Abc News'],,[],,"Taiwan's independence-leaning government will defend the self-governing island's freedoms and democratic system amid heightened tensions with rival China, President Tsai Ing-wen said Tuesday.

In an annual National Day address, Tsai also repeated her positions that Taiwan would continue to extend ""goodwill"" to China, and would neither buckle under Beijing's pressure nor go down an adversarial path.

China cut off contact with Tsai's government shortly after her inauguration last year and has refused to renew contact until she endorses Beijing's view that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory. Beijing threatens to use force to seize control of the island and has steadily increased diplomatic and economic pressure on Taipei over the last year and a half.

""We remain committed to maintaining peace and stability both in the Taiwan Strait and across the region,"" Tsai said, according to an official English translation released by her office.

""Meanwhile, we will continue to safeguard Taiwan's freedom, democracy and way of life, as well as ensure the Taiwanese people's right to decide our own future,"" she told a crowd of citizens and foreign dignitaries gathered outside the Presidential Office Building in central Taipei.

""And the right of the people of Taiwan to choose their own future will not be affected,"" she said.

Oct. 10 marks the 1911 founding of the Republic of China, which once ruled on the mainland but was forced to retreat to Taiwan in 1949 after Mao Zedong's Communists swept to power amid civil war against Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists.

Under Tsai's Nationalist predecessor, Ma Ying-jeou, the sides signed a series of agreements promoting trade and tourism, while sidestepping tricky political issues. China insists that was only possible because Ma endorsed Beijing's ""one-China principle,"" which it says underpins all dealings with the Taiwanese government bodies.

Tsai has called for a continuation of contacts and talks between the two sides, while setting aside their political differences.

""As I have stated on many occasions, our goodwill will not change, our commitments will not change, we will not revert to the old path of confrontation, and we will not bow to pressure,"" Tsai said in her speech. ""This has been my consistent position on cross-strait relations.""

While China had no immediate response to the speech, analyst Raymond Wu in Taipei said he doubted Beijing would be mollified.

""I'll guarantee you the official response (from China), whether it comes today or tomorrow, will be that 'no matter how you decorate it, you will have to go back to the one-China principle,'"" said Wu, managing director of e-telligence, a political risk consultancy.

Tsai, who has sought to bolster Taiwan's domestic arms industry, devoted much of her speech to the importance of military preparedness, along with moves to raise government efficiency and stimulate the island's high-tech economy.

""We must strengthen our military capabilities,"" she said. ""Faced with the growing demands of modern warfare, we must ensure that our new-generation military focuses not on quantity, but quality.""

In 2015, Tsai's Democratic Progressive Party said its defense policies would generate revenues of up to $13.2 billion and create 8,000 jobs.

Tsai, who won election by a landslide in January last year, also pledged efforts to ""find Taiwan's place in the new international order,"" including renewed outreach to countries in Southeast Asia that have drawn increasingly close to Beijing.

Following Panama's decision in June to break diplomatic relations in favor of China, Taiwan has just 20 remaining official allies, and there are constant fears that more could switch recognition to Beijing.

Tsai said Taiwan would step up economic relations with 10 Southeast Asian countries and another eight Asian-Pacific nations that her government considers prime economic development partners. Taiwan calls that mission its ""New Southbound Policy.""

To increase its influence around Asia, Taiwan is promoting Taiping Island, a disputed South China Sea islet, as a base for regional humanitarian aid, Tsai said. China and Vietnam also claim the tiny islet under Taiwan's control. Rescue crews on the island have previously helped Vietnamese sailors caught in storms.

Tsai said Taiwan plans to open a greenhouse gas monitoring station in the Pratas Islands, another South China Sea chain. She also said Taiwan has started helping Southeast Asian countries fight dengue fever."

What happened to the calm part? The storms have begun, and just might spill over into real wars before they're done. Sen. Bob Corker’s public feud with President Trump is no mere war of words, even in the Trumpian insult era. Corker is blowing the lid off of months of private frustrations and worries, harbored by erstwhile allies of the president, that the commander-in-chief is reckless, dishonest and could put the nation ""on the path to World War III,"" as Corker told The New York Times’ Jonathan Martin. ""He would have to concern anyone who cares about our nation,"" Corker said. Combine that with the tensions between Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Trump and Chief of Staff John Kelly, and this has far bigger consequences than your typical Twitter feud. Just words? Perhaps. But they are words that are spurring confrontation with a nuclear-armed North Korea, and more words will come this week that could lead Iran to restart its own nuclear program. Corker’s reference to the White House as an ""adult day care center"" suggests that grown-ups are ultimately in charge. This may be the week that tests that proposition, and sorts out high-level presidential strategy from absolute and dangerous recklessness.

Deal or no deal?

Does the president even want a deal? Issues that affect the nation and the world do not get solved in a vacuum, and the Trump White House should know that by now. President Trump may have wanted some help from Sen. Chuck Schumer on health care Saturday. But the hardline immigration demands laid out by the Trump administration Sunday would seem to blow up any preliminary deal reached across the aisle just a few weeks ago. The list of immigration policies the White House put out last night might not be surprising, considering the president's campaign promises and the views of some on his own staff. But the proposals are non-starters to Democrats who had hoped to find a middle ground to take care of so-called Dreamers. The vast majority of Americans support a right to residency for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children. Eighty-six percent of Americans, including three-quarters of Republicans, support that proposition, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. If the White House wants some wins, a deal to help those 800,000 young immigrants in the DACA program could be an easy get, ABC NEWS' MARYALICE PARKS writes.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW TODAY

Explosive feud: Retiring Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told The New York Times Trump is treating the White House like a ""reality show,"" and that his threats to other countries could set us ""on the path to World War III."" ""I don’t know why the president tweets out things that are not true,"" he said.





Does he want a deal? The Trump administration sent Congress a list of ""immigration policy priorities to be met for any deal to protect Dreamers. The wish list, sent along with a formal letter to congressional leaders Sunday night, would increase immigration enforcement, reduce legal immigration and call for building a wall.

Officials with the California Highway Patrol described one of the dead as an elderly woman who was blind and hard of hearing, according to ABC's San Francisco station KGO. The woman was found dead in the driveway of her home in Santa Rosa, Sonoma County, according to the officials, who suspected that she may have been trying to escape the flames when she she died.

Details on the other victims have not been released yet.

Two of the largest blazes, dubbed the Tubbs and Atlas Fires by authorities, burned a combined 52,000 acres of land in Sonoma and Napa counties.

In Anaheim, 1,000 firefighters were mobilized to fight a blaze that burned an estimated 6,000 acres and destroyed at least 24 homes and businesses. At least 3,000 residents were evacuated in and around Anaheim and more than 5,000 structures were threatened by the flames.

http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/white-house-plans-order-expand-health-care-options-50363336,['Abc News'],,[],,"The White House is finalizing an executive order that would expand health plans offered by associations to allow individuals to pool together and buy insurance outside their states, a unilateral move that follows failed efforts by Congress to overhaul the health care system.

President Donald Trump has long asserted that selling insurance across state lines would trigger competition that brings down premiums for people buying their own policies. Experts say that's not guaranteed, partly because health insurance reflects local medical costs, which vary widely around the country.

Moreover, White House actions may come too late to have much impact on premiums for 2018.

Trump was expected to sign the executive order next week, likely on Thursday, a senior administration official said Sunday.

Under the president's executive action, membership groups could sponsor insurance plans that cost less because — for example — they wouldn't have to offer the full menu of benefits required under the Affordable Care Act, also called ""Obamacare."" It's unclear how the White House plans to overcome opposition from state insurance regulators, who see that as an end-run to avoid standards.

""There are likely to be legal challenges that could slow this effort down,"" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.

Similar alternatives have been promoted by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican holdout during the health care debate. Senate leaders didn't bring the latest GOP health care bill to a vote because they lacked the votes to pass it.

Association plans ""kind of went away with the ACA, and now the idea seems to be to re-create them,"" said Jeff Smedsrud, a health insurance marketing entrepreneur. ""It's not clear what they would really look like.""

Smedsrud said a different option also under consideration by the White House, to loosen restrictions on ""short term"" insurance plans, could be a safety valve for some consumers.

Those plans generally have limited benefits and remain in force for less than a year. During the Obama administration, the availability of short-term coverage was restricted. One of Smedsrud's companies sells short-term plans.

Others warned that over time the White House order could undermine state insurance markets created under Obama's law, by siphoning off healthy people to plans with lower premiums and skinnier benefits.

The order was being drafted as Trump expressed his willingness to work with Democrats on health care after Republicans were unable to approve legislation that would have repealed and replaced ""Obamacare.""

The president said Saturday that he had spoken to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to see if Democrats would want to collaborate with him on improving health care. He told reporters before departing for a North Carolina fundraiser that he was willing to consider a ""temporary deal"" and referred to a popular Republican proposal that would have the federal government turn over money for health care directly to states in the form of block grants.

Schumer said through a spokesman Saturday that Trump ""wanted to make another run at 'repeal and replace' and I told the president that's off the table."" Schumer said if Trump ""wants to work together to improve the existing health care system, we Democrats are open to his suggestions.""

It was unclear if the expected White House order could lead to changes sweeping enough and quick enough to help several million consumers exposed to higher premiums next year for their individual health insurance plans.

It typically takes government agencies several months to carry out presidential directives, since they generally must follow a notice-and-comment process. Sign-up season for individual health insurance starts Nov. 1 and ends Dec. 15.

""Whether this executive order could impact the 2018 market is yet to be seen, since the health plans have created and priced their 2018 products already, and open enrollment begins in just three weeks,"" said health industry consultant Robert Laszewski.

While nearly 9 million consumers who receive tax credits under the Obama-era law are protected from higher premiums, about 6.7 million other customers with individual coverage get no subsidies and will bear the full brunt of cost increases that reach well into the double digits in many states.

Many in this group are solid middle-class, including self-employed business people and early retirees. Cutting premiums for them has been a longstanding Republican political promise.

""If the question is, is the president interested in working with Democrats to repeal and replace — that would be our language — the answer is yes,"" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said during an interview with NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ''The Democrats would use a different word for that, but the president wants to get something done."""

http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/massive-wave-butterflies-lights-denver-weather-radar-50306191,['Abc News'],,[],,"A lacy, cloud-like pattern drifting across a Denver-area radar screen turned out to be a 70-mile-wide (110-kilometer) wave of butterflies, forecasters say.

Paul Schlatter of the National Weather Service said he first thought flocks of birds were making the pattern he saw on the radar Tuesday, but the cloud was headed northwest with the wind, and migrating birds would be southbound in October.

He asked birdwatchers on social media what it might be, and by Wednesday had his answer: People reported seeing a loosely spaced net of painted lady butterflies drifting with the wind across the area.

Schlatter said the colors on the radar image are a result of the butterflies' shape and direction, not their own colors.

Midwestern radar stations occasionally pick up butterflies, but Schlatter believes it's a first for Denver.

An unusually large number of painted ladies, which are sometimes mistaken for monarch butterflies, has descended on Colorado's Front Range in recent weeks, feeding on flowers and sometimes flying together in what seem like clouds.

Sarah Garrett, a lepidopterist at the Butterfly Pavilion in Westminster, Colorado, said people from as far away as the Dakotas have called to report seeing the butterflies, whose population typically surges with plentiful flowers.

Research on the painted ladies in North America is limited, but scientists believe they migrate to the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico in the fall. In Europe, studies using radio tracking have shown they migrate south from Europe to Africa in the fall and return in the spring. Studies also show that monarch butterflies often use wind to their advantage and glide on currents for periods of time, Garrett said."
http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/puerto-rico-slum-transformed-despacito-seeks-revive-50371682,['Abc News'],,[],,"Hope had come in with a song for La Perla, a seaside slum that had long been notorious as a violent enclave that served as Puerto Rico's biggest distribution point for heroin.

The sound of clicking cameras and excited chatter had begun to break the morning silence. Tourists rambled through the narrow streets lined with brightly painted homes. Restaurants and other shops were popping up, catering to tourists drawn by the setting for the video of the worldwide hit song ""Despacito,"" which had been viewed billions of times since its release in January.

Then Hurricane Maria hit, ripping away power lines, water service, rooftops and even the newly installed banners that directed tourists to spots shown in the famed video.

With tourism to Puerto Rico as a whole abruptly halted, the only visitors to La Perla since the Sept. 20 storm have been people like the U.S. National Park Service workers who came to distribute bottles of water.

""Right now we're all mired in a depression,"" said Carmen Perez, a 77-year-old retiree who joined dozens of other La Perla residents with outstretched arms to receive the donated water.

One of the businesses that had boomed since ""Despacito,"" the La Garita restaurant, lost all four concrete walls to the hurricane, leaving only the kitchen standing.

""People didn't use to fit in here,"" said owner Ibilson Morales as he gestured toward the largely vacant spot where his restaurant once stood. ""This used to be the most visited neighborhood in Puerto Rico.""

La Perla is a sort of scenic shantytown of about 350 people that emerged more than a century ago on a narrow strip of Atlantic shoreline between the crashing waves and the towering walls of Old San Juan. Few outsiders ventured through the handful of entrances to the place, nor were they welcome. At one spot, a wooden sign proclaimed: ""Not open to visitors. Do not enter.""

""Before, people were very afraid,"" said Angel Antonio Lopez, a 77-year-old La Perla resident.

The neighborhood's dark reputation was stoked by an old video showing a drug dealer run up to another during the day and shoot him several times point-blank in the head. A self-described hit man turned federal witness said the bodies of many people killed in La Perla were tossed into the sea so sharks would eat them.

A bright yellow line painted on one of its narrow streets served as a boundary between rival drug dealers, some of whom used poisonous frogs to protect their drug stashes.

Much of the criminal activity was shut down when hundreds of agents from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration raided the slum in 2011 and arrested dozens of people, including a well-known community leader, who was later convicted.

Government and private-sector initiatives were launched to try to clean the place up. A new bakery was built, and houses were painted bright colors.

Then came ""Despacito.""

Puerto Rican singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee chose the slum as a backdrop for their video, which YouTube said attracted a record 3 billion views, and tourists began to pour in, greeted by welcoming calls from a bar owner and by a street vendor offering fried snacks and cold beers.

Many people in La Perla had hoped the transformation would help secure the community's future and protect it from real estate interests who have long eyed the seaside neighborhood as a prime spot for redevelopment.

The newfound vibrancy even prompted a visit by the island's tourism secretary, Jose Izquierdo.

""No one had given La Perla a chance,"" he said. ""The song has helped break down the community's stereotypes and given the people of La Perla a chance to organize themselves and take advantage of this historic opportunity.""

Among those hoping the opportunity returns is 26-year-old Yentil Ramirez, who had guided visitors on newly organized tours of the neighborhood.

""We have faith that they'll come down again like they used to before,"" she said, adding that Fonsi visited La Perla to distribute aid in recent days and promised to return to help with reconstruction efforts.

Fonsi has become the new face of Puerto Rico's government tourism company, getting $700,000 as part of a deal in which the agency acquired rights to use the song. Tourism officials said searches for Puerto Rico on booking sites had increased as much as 45 percent in the months before the hurricane — a spike they attributed to the song's popularity.

Now, the people flying into Puerto Rico are mostly volunteers, rescue crews and government officials helping to rebuild an island devastated by a Category 4 storm.

Tourism officials recently met with La Perla local leader Yashira Gomez, a daughter of the community leader arrested by the DEA in 2011. They asked her how long she thought it would take before La Perla could welcome tourists again.

""We told them to give us a month or two, that we were going to rise up again,"" Gomez said. ""We are looking for any kind of help ... so that tourists can come back and see that La Perla is still pretty, that it's on its feet and that we're working hard to make it shine like before."""

Can farming and food production be made less damaging to the planet?

A big meeting in London will look at how reforms could help halt species extinction, meet climate goals, limit the spread of antibiotic resistance and improve animal welfare.

The organisers of the Extinction and Livestock Conference say diverse interests will be represented.

They include multinational food corporations, native breed farmers, neurologists and naturalists.

McDonalds, Tesco and Compass will be rubbing shoulders with those from the Sustainable Food Trust, Quorn and WWF. The 500 delegates come from more than 30 countries.

Their wide interests illustrate the complex and difficult issues arising from global livestock production.

'Catastrophic impacts'

The two-day conference is being organised by Compassion in World Farming (CiWF).

The campaigning organisation warns that ""there will be catastrophic impacts for life on Earth unless there is a global move away from intensive farming"".

The world is on track to lose two-thirds of its wildlife by the end of this decade, largely because habitats have been destroyed to produce food for humans.

There has been a rise in so-called ""superbugs"" linked to the use of antibiotics in farmed animals. And methane emissions from livestock have made a significant contribution to climate change.

CiWF CEO Philip Lymbery said: ""Livestock production, the environment, wildlife conservation and human health are all interlinked, so it's vital that experts from each of these fields work together to come up with practical solutions to stop this before it's too late.""

CiWF believes that there should be a total rethink of food and farming policies, enshrined in the framework of a UN Convention.

The aim would be to properly integrate objectives such as food security, climate change, animal welfare and human health - so one isn't pursued at the expense of the other.

Mr Lymbery added: ""Many people are aware that wild animals such as penguins, elephants and jaguars are threatened by extinction. However, few know that livestock production, fuelled by consumer demand for cheap meat, is one of the biggest drivers of species extinction and biodiversity loss on the planet.""

Image copyright CiWF Image caption Future farming must work with Nature, not against it, says Philip Lymbery

Award-winning writer and activist Raj Patel from the University of Texas is speaking at the conference.

He said: ""The footprint of global agriculture is vast. Industrial agriculture is absolutely responsible for driving deforestation, absolutely responsible for pushing industrial monoculture, and that means it is responsible for species loss.

""We're losing species we have never heard of, those we've yet to put a name to and industrial agriculture is very much at the spear-tip of that. Conferences are for forging the alliances and building the movement that will change the world.""

Also attending is Martin Palmer, secretary-general of the Alliance of Religions and Conservation.

He said: ""Our current food system is not about a healthy, sustainable world of food but about excess, greed and foolishness disguised as 'market forces'.

""It treats the natural world not as something we are part of and therefore should treasure, but as a larder we can raid and somehow hope it gets filled again.

""But the truth is, it won't! As a result of this conference I would hope that all the key players - including the great faiths - would find a place at the table and together, each in their own distinctive way, will be able to inspire and guide us towards a better, fairer world."""

May promises to tackle racial disparity

An ""unprecedented"" government audit has shown how people of different races are treated by public services. It finds that black Caribbean pupils are being permanently excluded from school three times as often as white British pupils, and that unemployment among black, Asian and other ethnic minorities is almost double that among white British adults.

Prime Minister Theresa May will say later that institutions must ""explain or change"" the differences, with the audit meaning that those who allowed disparities to continue have ""nowhere to hide"". The Equality and Human Rights Commission called for a ""coherent race equality strategy"" from ministers.

The many uses of captured CO2

By Gabriella Mulligan, technology of business reporter

When you tuck yourself into bed tonight - curling up on your memory-foam mattress and fluffy pillows - consider this: you could be helping to reduce climate change. This is because CO2 can now be captured from the air and stored in a range of everyday items in your home and on the street. It can be used to make plastics for a whole host of things: the insulation in your fridge-freezer; the paint on your car; the soles of your shoes; and the binding of that new book you haven't read yet. Even the concrete your street is made of could contain captured CO2.

Pagan said that from the moment he was charged, he intended to plead guilty. His expectation was that the case would be resolved by Christmas or early in the new year.

But the case went through multiple delays and postponements — and all the while, Pagan had to remain silent, on his lawyer’s advice (although some brief quotes did make it into a Toronto Sun story early on). It was a kind of purgatory.

In the weeks after leaving Postmedia, Pagan cobbled together some work. He had already been doing part-time shifts at a landscape supply yard, and his boss, eager to help him out, gave him more hours.

Pagan also started delivering pizza for Domino’s.

He continued to play hockey in the evenings, and in March, he started full-time work as a recycling attendant for a third-party contractor at an industrial site.

He felt he couldn’t really move on with his life and career until he knew his legal fate. Friends and family talked about Pagan’s sharp humour, but I saw no real evidence of it. He was unfailingly kind, but more than anything, Pagan exuded a wariness.

Mike Pagan said the incident has changed his brother.

“You don’t like to talk about this stuff because it does kind of choke me up, but he lost his confidence,” he said. “For a while, he didn’t want to go out in public because he was ‘that guy,’ and he thought everyone recognized him as ‘that guy.’”

Ken Pagan admitted that since the beer toss, he has felt uneasy in larger groups of people he doesn’t know and often finds himself wondering what — if anything — they know about his past.

In May, he pleaded guilty to mischief. The Crown was seeking a conviction on the basis of “denunciation and deterrence,” which carries a sentence of up to two years in prison.

During the sentencing on June 28, Pagan’s lawyer argued that the act had been completely out of character and that he had already suffered enough. Then Pagan went in front of the judge to read his apology, the first time he had spoken in public since the incident.

“I am truly sorry, and I am working hard to be the best person I can be.”

He did so with a slight tremor in his voice and hands.

Acknowledging that he was “lucky” that “nobody was injured” in the incident, Pagan said, “I have been a passionate baseball fan since getting hooked as an eight-year-old in the summer of 1983, and I am fully aware of the disgrace I brought to the game.”

He concluded by saying, “I am truly sorry, and I am working hard to be the best person I can be.”

Ironically, the online shaming actually worked in Pagan’s favour. Acknowledging the public humiliation he had endured, the judge gave Pagan a discharge conditional on a year of probation. In that time, Pagan will have to perform 100 hours of community service and will be banned from all MLB stadiums.

Some commentators have speculated that the reaction to Pagan’s action was part of a broader strategy of deterrence to rein in bad fan behaviour at MLB games.

(Evan Mitsui/CBC)

In recent years, there have been other high-profile examples of belligerence, such as in Game 5 of the 2015 American League Division Series — i.e. the Bautista bat-flip game — in which a young child was reportedly hit by a beer can in the seats behind home plate.

There have also been reports of racial taunting of opposing players. In May, officials at Fenway Park in Boston permanently banned a fan for using a racial slur in the stadium.

The Blue Jays organization refused to comment further on the Pagan incident. MLB wouldn’t agree to an interview, either, but in an email statement, spokesman Michael Teevan said, “We prioritize the safety of our on-field personnel and the fans who visit our ballparks, and we hope that deterrents will prevent such episodes in the future.”

* * *

The incident in October obviously threw Pagan’s life into turmoil, but he’s in a good place now. For one thing, he has full-time work, having recently taken a salaried position as a janitorial supervisor at his recycling job.

“I think there are people out there who think I have been sitting on a couch for nine months or gone into hiding and my life is destroyed. In fact, my life has been close to normal,” he said.

“I am a busy guy with some positive things happening, so my life may have been impacted by social media, but it hasn't been ruined.”

And then there’s his relationship with baseball itself. You would assume that for someone so enamoured of the game, being banned from MLB would be crushing. But Pagan is sanguine about it.

Sitting next to Kantautas in his backyard on a warm July evening, he said he felt the ban was “pretty appropriate” and that he had “no issues” with it.

“Would you even want to go to a baseball game in the next year?” Kantautas asked him. “I’d be scared for you, that someone would recognize you and do something stupid.” Pagan silently concurred.

He may be barred from big-league games, but Pagan said there’s an upshot to his new circumstances: He has more time for amateur baseball. He plays with or assists local teams most nights of the week.

One recent evening, he provided an extra hand to the Burlington Bulls, an under-21 team.

While the young men showed off their cocky athleticism and repertoire of wisecracks, Pagan moved almost silently among them. Decked out in a ballcap and “Burlington Baseball” hoodie, he hit ground balls for the fielders and helped chalk the baselines during practice. During the game, he coached baserunners and marked the lineup card.

Between innings, Pagan spoke repeatedly about the “great atmosphere.” The comment seemed banal at first, but it distilled his reverence for the sport, down to the most mundane detail.

That reverence is apparent anytime he’s near the field: He can’t stop smiling.

Despite everything, Pagan still loves the sport.

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. -- Technology now in limited use removes about 90 per cent of carbon dioxide from the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants, but energy experts say cost remains the chief obstacle to bringing the ""clean coal"" touted by President Donald Trump into the mainstream.

They cite recent advances in applying the longstanding technology, despite some earlier setbacks, but say the U.S. power sector needs bigger tax credits or other incentives to close the cost gap for using them.

""What we have now is a public policy challenge, or call it a political challenge if you will, in that next phase which is to deploy this technology more widely and bring the cost down, (which) requires a whole new set of policies that go beyond R&D to actual deployment incentives,"" said Brad Crabtree, vice-president for fossil fuels at the Great Plains Institute.

The U.S. has successfully cut other smokestack pollutants, including sulfur, nitrogen and mercury. But carbon dioxide is a bigger challenge because there is so much of it. Coal- and gas-fired electrical generators produce about 30 per cent of CO2 from human activity. Other industries like cement, steel and fertilizer manufacturing add another 20 to 25 per cent. Farming and vehicles are also major contributors.

John Thompson of the non-profit Clean Air Task Force said there would be no way to limit the rise in global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels without taming carbon emissions. The world has already warmed about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. Scientists say every fraction of a degree change in average temperatures can lead to noticeable swings in local weather patterns.

""If you don't tackle that you really can't constrain warming on the planet to one-and-a-half to two degrees on anybody's likely scenarios,"" he said.

In Congress, bills that now have 64 bipartisan sponsors would raise carbon-capture tax credits from $10 or $20 per metric ton depending on use to $35 or $50. Advocates want it added to the current tax overhaul proposal.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican and co-sponsor, said carbon capture would help protect the coal industry and expand oil production as well as reduce emissions. As for chances of passage, she said Thursday that it's ""too early in the process to know whether those priorities can advance together or separately.""

The Natural Resources Defence Council, like other environmental groups, first advocates efficient energy use and switching to renewable sources, but regards carbon capture as ""a potentially useful tool in the climate protection toolbox,"" said David Hawkins, director of climate programs.

At federal labs in Morgantown and Pittsburgh, researchers cite one recently successful 13-megawatt pilot project in Colorado and say they are on target for a handful of others by 2020 while reducing the cost of carbon capture from $100 per metric ton to $40. ""We're definitely close,"" said Lynn Brickett, the labs' carbon capture technology manager.

The labs are also identifying methods to inject more liquefied carbon dioxide back into the Earth. That's where the carbon-based coal, oil and natural gas originally came from before they were burned and produced the CO2 in the atmosphere blamed for global warming.

New energy technologies normally take 15 years to move from the laboratory to the outside world, according to the National Energy Technology Laboratory. Its researchers are developing computer models to accelerate that timeline for carbon, engineer David Miller said.

The lab, a division of the U.S. Energy Department, acknowledges routine use would be at least another decade away and historically such advances have taken 20 to 30 years. Meanwhile, more U.S. coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close.

In June, Mississippi Power Co. suspended special carbon-capture efforts at its 582-megawatt Mississippi power plant that first turned coal into gas, which cost more than $7 billion to build, more than double the planned cost. Once regarded as a possible model for ""clean coal,"" it now burns natural gas.

The Petra Nova project outside Houston used a $190 million federal grant toward installing a $1 billion system to capture CO2 from an existing 600-megawatt coal-fired power plant, piping it to a Texas oil field and pumping it underground to boost oil production. Operating since late December, the system is currently ""breaking even,"" NRG Energy spokesman David Knox said.

""We're very interested in the technology, but until the economics work, we're not committed to a second one,"" Knox said.

With underground carbon storage, research began 20 years ago and builds on the practices of the petroleum industry, which uses carbon dioxide to drive more oil from the ground, said Traci Rodosta, the lab's carbon storage technology manager. NETL has regional partnerships across 43 states, small-scale projects that began in 2005 and larger-scale field projects in 2008.

There are ongoing efforts in 30 countries. A Norwegian reservoir under the North Sea has injected more than 16 million metric tons of CO2, Rodosta said. Lab scientists say there have been no major incidents with leaking or seismic activity."

NEW YORK -- If in a movie, Harvey Weinstein would probably cut the scenes of sexual harassment that have been described against him. They're too cliche.

The hotel room seductions, the massage requests, the coercive suggestions. They are, as the Los Angeles Times editorial board called them, ""classics of the genre."" The encounters depict a Hollywood culture immediately recognizable, one where power-broker sleaziness is an accepted and acknowledged part of the business.

Hollywood now finds itself in a crisis not just because one of its most prominent moguls has been disgraced and fired from the company he co-founded, but because the allegations against him describe a dark underbelly of the movie business rarely scrutinized outside the industry. It's a moment of reckoning for a Hollywood that has faced increasing scrutiny over its treatment of women, from pay equality to fair employment opportunity behind the camera.

Weinstein's ouster may have been a long time coming, with allegations going back to 1990. (Weinstein is yet to respond to directly though on Thursday he apologized for the pain he's caused.) But by apparently bringing down such a pivotal figure -- the kind that has long been considered untouchable because of industry and legal might -- many see a watershed moment for the industry.

""There is a tectonic shift going on with people having the courage to say, 'No more,""' said Melissa Silverstein, the founder and publisher of Women and Hollywood, an influential blog that advocates for gender equality in Hollywood. ""The climate about the conversation in gender in Hollywood has clearly shifted in recent years.""

""There's no going back anymore,"" added Silverstein.

The movie business has found it increasingly difficult to shy away from questions about how it treats women. Studies have shown year after year how few female directors are hired for major productions. Just four per cent of the top movies at the box office in 2016 were directed by women, according to the University of California's Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism. The disparity prompted a federal investigation by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

A pay gap, too, has been brought to the forefront by vocal stars like Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone. The best-paid stars, the majority of the executive jobs and most of the filmmakers remain overwhelmingly male in Hollywood.

Such a male-dominated culture could have contributed to the conditions that allowed the alleged incidents involving Weinstein to occur, and to remain quiet.

""It's been an open secret,"" said Greta Gerwig, who makes her directorial debut in the upcoming ""Lady Bird."" ""It just makes me really sad and it makes me really depressed but not surprised. What can you say? I really admire Ashley Judd. It's scary to do.""

On Thursday, The New York Times reported that Weinstein reached settlements with at least eight women over sexual harassment allegations. Judd also described an incident two decades ago in which she said Weinstein invited her to his hotel room, greeted her wearing a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she would watch him shower.

In the aftermath of the expose, many have voiced their support for Judd and other alleged victims. On Monday, some of the actresses who have frequently starred in and won awards in Weinstein's movies spoke up, including Meryl Streep and Judi Dench.

""One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew,"" said Streep, who called Weinstein's behaviour ""inexcusable."" ""Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn't know about these other offences.""

Patricia Arquette, Lena Dunham, Mark Ruffalo, Brie Larson, Kevin Smith, Judd Apatow, Julianne Moore and many others have voiced their support for the women involved. But among Weinstein's associates, the majority of responders have been women. Others, including Lena Dunham in an op-ed piece for The New York Times, have implored a stronger reaction from male stars and industry leaders.

""The reason I am zeroing in on the men is that they have the least to lose and the most power to shift the narrative, and are probably not dealing with the same level of collective and personal trauma around these allegations,"" Dunham wrote.

If this is to be a turning point for Hollywood, more must be done, Rose McGowan told The Hollywood Reporter. The Times reported that McGowan settled with Weinstein in 1997 after an incident in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival. Last year, McGowan said on Twitter that she was raped by a studio boss whom she declined to name.

""Men in Hollywood need to change ASAP,"" McGowan said on Sunday. ""Hollywood's power is dying because society has changed and grown, and yet Hollywood male behaviour has not. It is so not a good look.""

It's been an especially bad look lately for realms of the movie business both high and low. In August, allegations of sexual assault led to the exits of two high-ranking executives at Los Angeles' independent film venue Cinefamily. Last month, the Alamo Drafthouse underwent a scandal of its own, severing ties with Fantastic Fest co-founder Harry Knowles and contributor Devin Faraci over sexual harassment allegations.

Amazon also launched not one but two investigations into Amazon Studios head Roy Price for saying unwanted sexual remarks to ""The Man in the High Castle"" producer Isa Hackett. Kim Masters, editor-at-large for The Hollywood Reporter, was among those who investigated the incident. Price, she noted, hired the same legal team as Weinstein.

""There's been a kind of moment in the industry where more and more women are coming forward and therefore more and more men who may be aware that they haven't behaved properly are obviously going to be anxious,"" said Masters. ""This stirs up the resentment of women who put up with this in the past and felt powerless to act. Maybe now they feel more emboldened."""

RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carlos Nuzman, who headed the Rio de Janeiro Olympics, will remain in prison under a judge's order issued on Monday.

Nuzman was arrested last week and held temporarily in an investigation into a vote-buying scheme to win the rights to host the 2016 Olympics in Rio.

The judge's order changed Nuzman's status from temporary detention to preventative detention. Nuzman's lawyer, Nelio Machado, said there was no timeframe for Nuzman's release from jail.

Brazilian and French authorities say Nuzman was a key figure in channeling at least $2 million to Lamine Diack, a former International Olympic Committee member from Senegal who helped sway votes for Rio.

Nuzman's detention is the latest blow to last year's Olympics, which were troubled throughout with sluggish ticket sales, budget cuts, and a debt that required a government bailout to hold the Paralympics. Many sports venues built for the games are vacant.

The IOC suspended Nuzman last week from his role as an IOC honorary member. It also suspended the Brazilian Olympic Committee, which was headed by Nuzman.

The 75-year-old Nuzman was also removed from his role on an IOC advisory commission organizing the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

Investigators have said they identified 16 gold bars, weighing 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) each, located in a depository and reported to belong to Nuzman. Their value on the market is about $750,000.

""While Olympic medallists chased their dreams of gold medals, leaders of the Brazilian Olympic Committee stashed their gold in Switzerland,"" prosecutor Fabiana Schenider said last week.

Authorities said Nuzman was arrested because he tried to hamper the investigation by regularizing assets likely gained with illicit money.

Nuzman was originally questioned in September. About two weeks after, investigators said he amended his tax declaration to add about $600,000 in income.

Nuzman has also stepped away from the presidency of the Rio organizing committee, which had a $3 billion budget to run last year's Olympics. The local organizing committee still owes creditors about 100 million Brazilian reals ($30 million).

The IOC last week also suspended the organizing committee. The committee has sought IOC help to pay off some of the debt.

The organizing committee is scheduled to meet next week to choose a new president, which may help lift the suspension.

The Brazilian Olympic Committee is meeting this week to name a replacement for Nuzman."

WASHINGTON -- In an ironic scheduling twist, the current prime minister and his predecessor will both be in Washington, speaking on the same day, about the same issue: the renegotiation of NAFTA, which enters a high-stakes phase this week.

Old political nemeses Justin Trudeau and Stephen Harper might literally cross paths. Harper is scheduled to attend a panel discussion on trade Wednesday afternoon, just as Trudeau is a few blocks away at the White House, discussing thorny trade issues with President Donald Trump.

The former Conservative prime minister is on a panel at an event hosted by Dentons law firm that also features Newt Gingrich, a Trump confidant and former top U.S. lawmaker, and a separate appearance by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.

Some people in the senior ranks of the Canadian government and at Washington's Canadian embassy were caught off-guard by Harper's itinerary --those contacted by The Canadian Press last week said they were unaware Harper would be there on the same day as Trudeau.

One Liberal joked he'd spent enough time in his life worrying about Harper's plans and didn't intend to fret about them this week.

The law firm timed the event to coincide with the fourth round of NAFTA negotiations, which runs Oct. 11 to 15 in Washington and which are expected see a ratcheting up in intensity as countries begin to broach more difficult issues.

Trudeau touches down in Washington late Tuesday and he's expected to raise the nearly 300 per cent duties on Bombardier planes, and duties on softwood lumber with Trump, but NAFTA will likely dominate.

The countries have encountered difficulties on simpler issues even before the NAFTA negotiations have entered anticipated trouble areas like car parts, dairy and dispute resolution, leading some observers to suggest the talks are in trouble.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, a pro-NAFTA member of Trump's team, has expressed disappointment in the progress so far.

""But we think this is the way these things get going,"" Perdue said at a Washington gathering last week.

""If you've ever watched a boxing match they circle one another for a while. I think we've done circling. So we're gonna lay some things on the table in this next round.""

Canada's lead minister on the NAFTA file said difficult negotiations were to be expected.

""This administration is the most protectionist U.S. administration since the 1930s... Proudly (so),"" Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told CTV's Question Period over the weekend.

""That certainly poses some difficulties in a free trade negotiation.""

Trudeau will not only be meeting with the president during his U.S. trip but also with key American lawmakers with special power over trade -- including the ability to sink or save an international agreement.

Trudeau will be on Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning for a rare meeting between a foreign head of government and the full gathering of the House of Representatives' Ways and Means committee.

That committee and the Senate Finance committee have a unique mandate under the U.S. fast-track law to help American trade negotiators design U.S. positions.

They would also be responsible for shepherding any eventual agreement through votes in Congress.

On top of that, these committees would likely design the response from Congress if Trump tries to cancel NAFTA, which he has repeatedly threatened to do, and some legal scholars argue a full repeal requires congressional approval.

Trudeau will head from Capitol Hill to the White House for a meeting with the president on Wednesday afternoon, as Harper appears at Dentons. Trudeau and Trump are expected to make informal remarks to media but not hold a formal press conference together.

Trudeau leaves Washington on Thursday for Mexico, where he meets with President Enrique Pena Nieto."

WASHINGTON -- Some dirty old birds are helping scientists better understand one of the more baffling climate change mysteries.

University of Chicago researchers Shane DuBay and Carl Fuldner examined 1,347 dead birds in museums in Chicago, Detroit and Pittsburgh, comparing birds from the 1900s and 1910s to birds from decades later.

The difference was black and white.

Feathers of birds in the 1900s were blacker than birds just 20 or 30 years later, suggesting that there was more soot in the atmosphere than scientists originally thought, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

This is important because scientists believe soot, also called black carbon, has an important role in climate change. They know it traps heat, but scientists haven't been able to study it well because it doesn't stay in the atmosphere long.

""The problem previously is that there was no way to characterize the particles from this early industrial era,"" Fuldner said. ""You can't look at the soot particles coming out of the 1910 manufacturing plant in Joliet, Illinois.""

Black carbon in the air comes from inefficient burning of fossil fuels, especially coal. Some recent studies call it the second most potent greenhouse ""molecule"" -- because unlike the most important, carbon dioxide, it is a solid, not a gas.

The black carbon coating the birds stuffed long ago now give scientists a better record, showing past pollution may have been underestimated, Fuldner and DuBay said. Black carbon emissions dropped around 1930 as homes turned away from coal for heat. Coal was used more and more for manufacturing and electric power, but that produces less soot than burning it in homes for heat, they said.

The study is fascinating to experts who are trying to predict future warming from black carbon.

Some scientists say reducing black carbon emissions may be an easier way to fight climate change than by just reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

Other scientists say the impacts of the study on projections for future warming would likely be modest -- at best -- in part because black carbon stays in the atmosphere for such a short time."

The pulse-pounding action of an NHL game can elevate a fan's heart rate to the same levels achieved during vigorous exercise, and may pose a health risk to patients with cardiovascular issues, according to a new study of Montreal Canadiens fans watching the sport.

The study, which was conducted by researchers in Montreal and two high school students, found that spectators' heart rates increase by 110 per cent when watching a live hockey game, and 75 per cent when watching a game on television.

That intensity is equivalent to vigorous and moderate exercise, respectively, and can place substantial stress on the cardiovascular system among vulnerable patients, the authors suggest.

Overall, watching hockey was found to elevate a healthy person's heart rate by an average of 92 per cent.

The study was the brainchild of high school students Roxana Barin, 14, and Leia Khairy, 13, whose father is one of the authors.

The girls told CTV News that both of them play competitive sports, and started wondering whether the spectators at their games, including their parents, experience heart stress during intense moments.

""We see our parents and they stress so much on the field,"" Barin said. ""So we wanted to see, watching a game, how much that affected them.""

Senior study investigator Dr. Paul Khairy, a professor at the University of Montreal's Montreal Heart Institute, said he thought the girls had ""an excellent idea.""

""The girls demonstrated that it is exciting to watch the Montreal Canadiens,"" he told CTV News. ""That the heart rate response is an impressive heart rate response, especially at a live game that is equivalent to vigorous physical activity and these types of heart rate responses do carry the potential in people who are at risk who are otherwise susceptible.""

Twenty adult Montreal Canadiens fans wore heart rate monitors for the study, with half of them watching the games at home and the other half watching live at the Bell Centre.

Most of the adults were healthy, although one had hypertension, one had Crohn's disease and one had mild asthma. Base heart rates were established beforehand, and the subjects were also given a simple questionnaire asking about their health and level of fandom. The testing was administered by high school students from Royal West Academy in Montreal.

According to the results, heart rates spike during high-intensity moments for or against the individual's favourite team, such as during a scoring chance, a powerplay or an overtime period. Fandom and the final result of the game were found to have little impact on heart rate.

""If someone has a known cardiac disease, it is always prudent to ensure with a person's physicians that they are on optimal therapy to protect themselves against risks such as watching hockey games and other risks in daily life,"" Dr. Khairy said.

But he added that people shouldn't be discouraged from ""enjoying life"" and watching their favourite sports teams.

The findings are published in the October 5 edition of the Canadian Journal of Cardiology, along with an editorial by doctors David D. Waters and Stanley Nattel, who were not part of the investigation.

Waters and Nattel credit the study authors with pointing out the largely unaddressed risk factor that watching hockey might pose to heart patients.

""At-risk patients should be warned about potential CV symptoms,"" the authors write.

They also offer a tongue-in-cheek evaluation of the risks posed by a potential Stanley Cup win for the Toronto Maple Leafs or the Montreal Canadiens. However, their conclusions fall short in suggesting that ""that risk does not seem imminent,"" as they appear to have overlooked the presence of Auston Matthews on the Leafs' roster.

OTTAWA -- Federal lawyers have racked up a legal bill of more than $2.36 million fighting a group of women who allegedly were wrongly denied sickness benefits while they were on maternity leave.

The costs, revealed in an access to information request filed by The Canadian Press, show the Justice Department added about $300,000 to its bill between early 2016 and last June to fight a case the Liberals once vowed to drop.

That brings the total federal bill on the case to more than $2.5 million when factoring in previously released costs from a second department involved in the litigation.

Jennifer McCrea, the woman at the centre of the case, and her lawyer wonder why the government can't end their case when it settled with former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr for $10.5 million and offered up to $750 million to victims of the 60s Scoop, where Indigenous children were taken from their homes and placed with non-native families.

""It's the only right thing to do and I believe in the strength of our case,"" said lawyer Stephen Moreau.

""I have yet to see a reason why they wouldn't come through on this promise, other than the fact that they're taking a long time. That's the only thing that gives me some pause.""

McCrea said she hasn't given up hope the Liberals will settle, as the party promised at the end of the 2015 election, but admits it may finally mean getting their day in court.

""I'm upset that this is taking so long,"" she said.

""I'm in too deep and too long to give up on it, so absolutely we intend to continue the fight. It's just very slow and painful.""

It was two years ago this weekend, just over a week before voting day, that the NDP and Liberals vowed to immediately drop opposition to the case if either became government.

Instead, Moreau said, the Liberals, like the previous Conservative government, continue to fight every element of the case.

McCrea has been brushed off by ministers and local MPs, with all saying they couldn't comment because the matter was before courts.

""That's all that they'll tell me,"" McCrea said.

A spokesman for Social Development Minister Jean-Yves Duclos said it would be inappropriate to comment on the case because it is in Federal Court.

""The minister is sympathetic to the challenges faced by women who were diagnosed with cancer while receiving parental benefits. EI claimants who fall ill or are injured during their parental benefits claim are now able to access sickness benefits,"" Mathieu Filion said.

Parliament decided in 2002 to allow those who were diagnosed with cancer, for instance, to access 15 extra weeks of employment insurance payments in addition to a year's worth of maternity leave benefits.

McCrea was diagnosed with breast cancer in July 2011, while she was on maternity leave with her youngest son, Logan, who was eight months old at the time.

She had a double mastectomy in August 2011 and was deemed cancer-free shortly afterwards.

But she was denied sickness benefits. Her claim alleges thousands of others were also denied between 2002 and 2013 -- when the Tories further clarified the law -- although the exact number of women affected isn't clear because it would require searching through millions of paper EI files.

Federal lawyers are now looking to limit the potential number of additional women who may be part of the $450-million class-action lawsuit in the latest procedural wrangling. A hearing about whether to expand the definition of who is part of the class action is scheduled for early January."

Erica Werner, The Associated Press





WASHINGTON -- U.S. Sen. Bob Corker is hardly the only Republican lawmaker raising dark concerns about harm U.S. President Donald Trump might cause the U.S. and the world. But he's one of the few willing to air those worries in public.

Most GOP senators were silent Monday, a day after Corker charged that the White House was an ""adult day care"" and Trump could set the nation ""on the path to World War III.""

The only senator who publicly hinted at similar concerns was Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who said both Trump and Corker should ""cool it.""

""And I think it would help if the president would be the first to cool it,"" he added.

Tennessee's Corker, with his Twitter broadsides and an explosive weekend New York Times interview, gave voice to concerns that circulate widely on Capitol Hill about an unpredictable president whose tendency to personalize every issue creates risks for the GOP agenda. But Trump's enduring popularity with a segment of the GOP base serves as a political muzzle that keeps most elected Republicans from saying anything similar, even those who believe it to be true.

Grassley, who won't be up for re-election until 2022, responded bluntly when asked about the situation.

""I don't see how it's productive, and I think that two words would kind of answer your question from my point of view: Cool it,"" he said. ""I think it would be better if we stuck to the issues and leave personalities out of it.""

A few other Republican senators who provided public views Monday avoided aligning themselves with Corker.

""You'll have to ask Sen. Corker what led him to make that statement. I haven't made that statement,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said of Corker's suggestion that Trump could take the country into another world war.

Sen. Jeff Flake has been outspoken in his criticism of Trump, who's attacked him in return. But the Arizona Republican was restrained during a joint interview with Rubio after a re-election fundraiser in Scottsdale.

""Any of us who've worked with Sen. Corker know that he speaks his mind,"" Flake said, demurring on whether he shares Corker's view that the White House has become an ""adult day care centre.""

""I agree with him on some things, I've supported a lot of his agenda, some things I've disagreed with and continue to do so,"" Flake said of Trump.

The Associated Press sought to contact all 52 Republican senators Monday for their response to Corker's comments and ask whether they believe Trump is fit for office, a question Corker declined to answer in the Times interview. With the Senate on recess this week and many offices closed for Columbus Day, the inquiries elicited few responses, and those who did largely declined comment.

Corker offered no solution to the problem he identified so graphically. Trump is the president, and few doubt that he will remain so, despite constitutional provisions for impeachment or for the vice-president to take over if the commander in chief cannot discharge his duties.

Moreover, Republicans' political fortunes remain tied to the president's. They need his signature if they are to rescue a flagging agenda and pass a tax overhaul, a goal many believe is imperative if the GOP is to retain control of Congress in next year's midterm elections. So unlike Corker, who recently announced he is not running for re-election in Tennessee, even GOP Trump critics will continue to mute their concerns about his behaviour and try to work with the administration.

""Sen. Corker, who's been a strong supporter of the president in the past, is essentially saying the emperor has no clothes,"" said Michael Steel, who served as spokesman to former House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio.

But, Steel added: ""The president was elected under our constitutional system and that's where we stand. Congressional leaders are going to continue concentrating on doing everything they can to get big things done for the American people, and they hope to have as much support from the administration as possible.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the target of Trump attacks after the Senate's failure to pass health care legislation, didn't directly answer when asked at an event in Hazard, Kentucky, whether he shared Corker's sentiments.

""Sen. Corker is a valuable member of the Senate Republican caucus and he's also on the Budget Committee and a particularly important player as we move to the floor on the budget next week,"" McConnell said.

His comments underscored what has frustrated Republicans most about the Trump-Corker feud, which burst open Sunday when Trump began tweeting, inaccurately, that Corker had begged for his endorsement and decided not to run for re-election when Trump turned him down. Trump will need Corker if he is to get big tax changes through the Senate, where the narrow GOP majority was unable to pass McConnell's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And Corker also figures to be a key player if Trump moves as expected to unwind the Iran nuclear deal.

Vice-President Mike Pence, in a statement that never mentioned Corker, praised the president for ""achieving real results on the international stage. While critics engage in empty rhetoric and baseless attacks.""

Republicans do frequently complain about Trump's attacks on fellow Republicans like McConnell, his failure to stay focused on his legislative agenda and his tendency to make demands on Congress and then blame lawmakers for poor results. But those GOP comments are nothing like Corker's apocalyptic statements.

For House Republicans, who face voters every two years and largely represent conservative districts where support for the president remains strong, there's even less incentive to turn against the commander in chief. Sixty-eight per cent of Republican voters approve of Trump, though that's down from 80 per cent in March, according to a recent AP-NORC poll.

Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, criticized Corker, saying he finds ""those type of comments to not be appropriate especially coming from the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and certainly not in keeping with what I know of the way that things are conducted in the West Wing, having been there multiple times.""

""It's really easy to be bold when you're not coming back,"" Meadows added of Corker.

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/09/operation-bible-smuggling-how-christian-texts-infiltrate-north-korea.html,['Hollie Mckay'],2017-10-09 00:00:00,[],,"On the nights when the winds are light and the skies are dark, hundreds of helium-filled balloons are sent up and away from multiple points in South Korea, destined a few miles away and into North Korea. Only these are no ordinary balloons — they are considered “Bible Balloons,” adorned with the Words of God printed in Korean or flash drives featuring the entire texts of the Testament.

It is one of the few creative — and inherently dangerous — ways bibles are smuggled into the oppressive dictatorship in the hopes that impoverished North Koreans will know that they aren’t forgotten. Other activists, such as American pastor Eric Foley, have opted for a much larger hydrogen-fueled 40-foot balloon brimming with bibles and testimonials. These are then dropped into rural areas with the help of GPS technology, in the hopes that even just one will be picked up.

“Growth in Christianity does not happen in waves but always one at a time,” Foley — CEO of Voice of the Martyrs Korea — told Fox News.

Nonetheless, the regime is well aware of the biblical balloons — which have been at the center point of bible smuggling since the 90’s — and if the endeavor to shoot them down fails, anyone spotted collecting the contents is immediately arrested. These days, flash drives, SD cards, leaflets and photos featuring the strictly outlawed religious texts are also disseminated not only from balloons but also through the use of large drones — and more and more, bibles are being disseminated in electronic rather than print form.

Such smuggling programs generate little funding or support from outside governments, and are generally left up to missionaries, nongovernmental organizations and activists.

“It is becoming too dangerous and bulky to bring in hard copy bibles,” one Korean source familiar with the operations said. “Over the past 10 years, there has been a growing demand for ‘outside’ information — whether religious or secular.”

But still, there are on the on-foot actors.

“The bibles are printed in another country, and then secretly taken and distributed in North Korea, usually a few at a time,” Vernon Brewer, founder and president of Christian humanitarian organization World Help, told Fox News. “The people who smuggle bibles have to be extremely careful, changing their route and taking other precautions to avoid getting caught.”

According to Brewer, once those bibles are inside, they are passed along through trusted believers, and he and his organization send a couple of different sizes — but the most popular versions are the small New Testaments.

“This is because they fit in the palm of your hand and can easily be exchanged during a handshake or left in strategic locations for people to find,” he continued.

HOW TO SUCCESSFULLY SUE ISIS, HEZBOLLAH OR THE REGIMES OF IRAN, SYRIA AND NORTH KOREA

NORTH KOREA: HOW CHRISTIANS SURVIVE IN THE WORLD'S MOST ANTI-CHRISTIAN NATION

Another smuggling method in is via the occasional — and lawbreaking — tourist. Although any visitors to the hermit kingdom are rigorously warned by external tour companies to take in absolutely no religious texts or symbols and refrain from any type of discussion on it that could be interpreted as proselytizing, some still take the risk. And pay the price.

Just ask Ohio native, Jeffrey Fowle. A devout Christian and father of three, the perpetually curious 58-year-old journeyed to North Korea on an organized tour in 2014, and was detained after deliberately concealing a Bible under a trash can in the men’s room of a Pyongyang nightclub. He had hoped the bootlegged bible — which contained his name and family photographs — would make its way to someone in the underground Christian community.

Three years later, in May of this year, his release was finally secured by U.S officials.

Fowle is one of the lucky ones. Religious freedom is written into the country’s constitution, but the reality on the ground paints a much different picture. For the vast majority of trapped Christians inside the brutal dictatorship, the consequence is life in a labor camp or a public execution by firing squad. Their relatives too are often subject to callous retribution.

“The North Korean regime’s legitimacy and claim to power flow out of the idea that Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il and now Kim Jong Un are divine beings. North Korean children are taught to pray before a meal, ‘Thank you Father Kim Il Sung for our food,’” Todd Nettleton of Voice of Martyrs Radio pointed out. “They sing praise choruses to the Kims. It is very much a religion. So what makes the regime and the government so upset about a North Korean being a Christian is not just that they are following a different religion, or even that they are following a ‘Western’ religion. What those Christians are doing literally undermines the very veracity of the North Korean regime. If Jesus is Lord, then Kim Jong Un can’t be.”

Furthermore, Christian North Korean defectors in the border areas of South Korea broadcast gospels on an almost daily basis. Roughly 20 percent of the 25 million North Korean population own a radio — an illicit item — and many will risk their own lives to tune in.

“Radio, just as in the days of the Cold War, remains an incredibly useful tool to inject truth and the Gospel into North Korea,” said Jeff King, president of advocacy group International Christian Concern. “And we remain an ardent supporter of pushing Christian content into North Korea through radio and other means.”

But despite the harsh penalties that come with praising anyone of any belief system outside the Kims, there is a sense that an ascending number of North Koreans are turning to Christianity.

“The church is growing at a faster rate in North Korea than in South Korea, where the church has declined in membership every year since 1991,” Foley observed.

According to the prominent pastor, the uptick in the North is mainly due to the covert network of North Korean Christians, rather than religious advocates from the outside.

“The reason why is that the work of missionaries on the North Korea/China border is easily infiltrated and neutralized by North Korean state security agents, but the work of underground North Korean Christians has continued faithfully for more than three generations,” he explained. “They don’t smuggle large numbers of bibles into North Korea, but instead, certain members of the underground church carry Bibles across the border one at a time, often in the form of MP3 players.”

These Christians are native North Koreans who are given permission to travel to China on relative visas or work visas. Some have established relationships with border guards who accept bribe money — and are under close and careful surveillance themselves — who turn a blind-eye to the illegal material being brought back in, while others have it carefully concealed from all.

Ben Gabriel, Initiative Director for the missionary Alpha Relief, noted that the regime likely knows exactly when and how the bible smuggling is happening, but also knows there is only so much that can be done to stop it.

“North Korea no longer has an iron grip on the spread of information in the country,” he added. “The Christian message has a strong appeal to people trapped in that kind of system. If you’ve given your life over to Christ, no one can take it from you. That is true freedom. It is freedom from fear.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/10/fbi-cites-black-extremists-as-new-domestic-terrorist-threat.html,['Elizabeth Llorente'],2017-10-10 00:00:00,[],,"The 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has spawned a violent domestic threat from “black identity extremists” who have stepped up attacks on police, according to an explosive new report by the FBI’s counterterrorism division.

The warning, first reported by Foreign Policy magazine, says that “it is very likely BIEs proactively target police and openly identify and justify their actions with social-political agendas commensurate with their perceived injustices against African Americans ...”

Brown, an African-American 18-year-old, was shot in August 2014 after struggling with white police officer Darren Wilson. Although Brown's supporters claimed it was a deadly case of police brutality, Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned in November 2014.

The shooting led to protests in Ferguson that then spread to other parts of the country. It gained added momentum after subsequent racially charged police shootings, spurred on via on social media and the group Black Lives Matter.

The FBI report said that the agency previously had analyzed the potential for violence of black identity extremism, a term that was unfamiliar before it appeared in the document. What has changed, according to the the report, is that violence has now actually occurred and is 'likely"" to continue.



“It is very likely that BIEs’ perceptions of unjust treatment of African Americans and the perceived unchallenged illegitimate actions of law enforcement will inspire premeditated attacks against law enforcement over the next year,” the report said. “It is very likely additional controversial police shootings of African Americans and the associated legal proceedings will continue to serve as drivers for violence against law enforcement.”

Attacks in which police officers are targeted have been on the rise in recent years. The most high-profile such incident occurred last year in Dallas, when a gunman named Micah Johnson hid in a parking garage and fired on 11 police officers, killing five of them, during a protest against officer-involved shootings. The FBI report noted that Johnson referred to anger over police shootings and toward whites as what drove him to kill the five police officers.

The FBI report drew accusations of racial profiling.

DeRay Mckesson of Black Lives Matter told The Guardian the terrorism report echoes the days when FBI tracked activist groups including the NAACP and those that opposed wars.

“We knew that we were likely being watched,” said Mckesson, a longtime critic of government monitoriing of protest groups. “This is confirmation that the work of social justice continues to threaten those in power.”

The Guardian also quoted an unnamed source it described only as a former senior official from the Department of Homeland Security saying that the category ""black identity extremist"" was troubling.

""This is a new umbrella designation that has no basis,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""There are civil rights and privacy issues all over this.""

But others say that the FBI is correctly sounding an alarm about a serious trend.

""It's not racial profiling, it's violence profiling,"" said Scott Walter, president of Capital Research Center, a conservative think tank, told Fox News. ""Identity politics can kill, whether it's white identity politics, which killed in Charlottesville, or black identity politics, which kills cops.""

""We have to be able to distinguish between free speech and violence,"" Walter said. ""[Many] longtime [black] activist groups were not obsessed with voilence.""



Randy Sutton, a former Las Vegas law enforcement official who now is the national spokesman for Blue Lives Matter, told Fox News that the FBI report makes official what he and others in police work have been observing in recent years.

""Nobody is saying anything negative about protests,"" Sutton said, ""Protesting is everyone's right. This is about commiting acts of violence. Many Black Lives Matter protests call for violence against police, with chants like 'What do we want?' and 'Dead cops!' It's terrorism, and it's no different than Islamic terrorism.""

Sutton said the rising number of ambush attacks on police has had a chilling effect on how they do their jobs.

""Police are not being as aggressive because of the political climate,"" he said. ""There's been a dramatic decrease in proactive policing.""

http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/13/why-russia-props-up-dangerous-north-korean-regime.html,['Hollie Mckay'],2017-09-13 00:00:00,[],,"As North Korea continues to develop a nuclear-weapons program, threatening the U.S. and neighboring countries while starving and enslaving much of its population, the regime of Kim Jong Un continues to receive an increasing amount of both public and private support from Russia. But why?

“Putin is weakening sanctions against North Korea to weaken the concept of sanctions themselves,” Marion Smith, Executive Director of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, which seeks to illuminate human rights abuses in communist governments, told Fox News. “Russia is under heavy international sanctions and Putin wants to empower naysayers in the West who think sanctions ae either too inefficient or too provocative of the dictatorial regimes they are levied against.”

However, Russia did go along this week in siding with the latest round of U.S.-pushed sanctions, approved by the U.N. Security Council. If properly enforced, the new sanctions would severely limit North Korea’s access to international currency and fuel required for its prohibited ballistic missile and nuclear programs. It won’t be able to export textiles, one of its only export industries. In addition, importing oil and fuel will be a marginally harder, as will propelling its people off to make money in labor jobs abroad.

Nonetheless, the sanctions initially proposed by the U.S. – which included completely cutting off oil imports – were significantly diluted largely at Russia’s behest. Moscow is also one of the biggest food-aid donors to North Korea, which is widely accused of pouring its finances into military and missile spending rather than feeding its impoverished population.

Furthermore, experts contend that Russia has long been a prominent recipient of North Korea’s cheap, hard labor trade. For more than fifty years, North Koreans have been sent to do logging in the bitter forests of Siberia. Yet more recently, they are reported to have been used as construction workers in cities such as St. Petersburg which is preparing for the 2018 World Cup, as well as working in private homes across the country.

A brand new ferry system was even set up just four months ago to carry cargo and passengers between Vladivostok, Russia, and Rason, North Korea. But this week, it emerged that U.S. officials now believe Russian smugglers are operating to undercut sanctions by way of these two ports, with Russian entrepreneurs setting up “front” companies to conceal transactions and launder payments, according to the reporting of The Washington Post.

The alleged movements are believed to provide something of a lifeline to Kim Jong Un’s regime, and could effectively keep it from faltering under the hefty and mounting sanctions.

According to Geoff Hellman, Chairman and CEO of the Economic Policy Forum which focuses on business dealings in the Asia-Pacific Region and Russia, it is all an “Asymmetric Hybrid Warfare” (AHW) tactic aimed at promoting Russia’s image at home, as a place of “law and order, peace-loving and devoted to economic prosperity” compared to a more “war-mongering” United States.

“Russia supports actions that benefit Russia. Russia purports to support sanctions against North Korea, but in practice supports North Korea in its effort to evade sanctions,” he said. “Russia employs criminal networks to set up front companies in Singapore, for example, to transship oil.”

Russia and North Korea indeed share a feeble but consequential 11-mile land border and 12-mile maritime border that functions as supply routes between the two nations. But perhaps more significantly, relations between the two countries have deep roots dating back to the end of World War II when North Korea served the Soviet Union as a potent communist ally on the eastern flank.

The Embassy of Russia in North Korea – officially referred to as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) – boasts both historic and future economic and trade ties between the two nations, highlighting that Russian private companies seek to enter the “untapped Korean market” while the government too has grand plans.

“Russia and the DPRK undertake joint efforts to implement bilateral and multilateral economic projects such as the construction of the gas pipeline from Russia to South Korea through the DPRK territory as well as electric power lines using the same route and connection of the Trans-Siberian and Trans-Korean railways,” the embassy states. “If implemented, the projects will be economically beneficial to all the participants.”

In 2012, Russia agreed to discard some 90 percent of North Korea’s $11 billion Soviet-era debt, with the remaining debt fraction to be paid into an account devoted to promoting trade between the two countries.

MILLIONS OF AMERICAN LIVES COULD BE AT STAKE AS NORTH KOREA THREATENS TO ATTACK POWER GRID

And even though Putin recently declared his condemnation of North Korea’s provocative testing exercises, he insisted that a military response would lead to a “global catastrophe.” Putin’s Russia has held a long-running policy of pushing back against U.S.-mandated regime change, and by backing North Korea at the ire of the United States, Russia is able to assert itself as a prominent player in the world of foreign affairs.

“Russia may not like what North Korea is doing, but in taking this stance they get to be a player on the world stage again which is one of their goals,” explained Clint Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Center. “And it is a way to position themselves against the U.S., which hasn’t been complying with their wishes. There hasn’t been the big reset Putin had hoped for with Trump.”

North Korea has undertaken 16 missile tests this year alone – including two intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests and one possible hydrogen-bomb test this month. President Trump has warned the rogue state that the sanctions imposed are “nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.”

NORTH KOREA THREATENS 'PAIN AND SUFFERING' IN RETALIATION FOR NEW U.N. SANCTIONS

But, by forging closer ties to a U.S. enemy, Moscow may have greater leverage in getting what it wants from Washington.

“By Putin’s calculation, misbehavior by North Korea makes his stock go up as the U.S. pleads for Russian assistance,” noted Ryan Mauro, national security expert at the Clarion Project. “From a bargaining perspective, it makes sense for Russia to assist North Korea and see what it can get America to offer in exchange for assistance.”

Yet at least for now, the U.S. State Department is formally maintaining that “Russia supports the overall goal of de-nuclearizing the Korean Peninsula,” and is hopeful that “they will follow through on their agreements.”

“Remember, Russia doesn’t see the same degree of problem here as the U.S. and South Korea do. Korean missiles won’t be aimed at Russian soil,” added one Moscow-based official.

Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert with the Middlebury Institute’s Center for Nonproliferation Studies program in Monterey, Calif., told The Wall Street Journal that by studying photos and videos of other missile tests, he and his team knew North Korea had the capabilities for an intercontinental ballistic missile that could threaten the U.S. mainland.

He said he believes North Korea has the ability to hit New York or Los Angeles with a missile carrying a warhead.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have engaged in a war of words that has only escalated in the past few weeks. Trump nicknamed Kim “Rocket Man” and castigated the rogue nation during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month.

In return, Kim called Trump “deranged” and warned that the U.S. will “pay dearly” for his threats.

The U.S. and its allies are on alert since North Korea tested intercontinental missiles into the Pacific near Japan and Guam, a highly strategic U.S. territory. Pyongyang conducted its longest-ever ballistic missile test flight last month.

Since Kim Jong Un took over the nation in 2011, it has rapidly expanded and tested its missile arsenal with weapons capable of striking the U.S. mainland. His end goal, he reportedly said, is to ""establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military options” for the North.

Read on for a brief look at how North Korea’s nuclear weapons program has grown throughout the regimes in the past century.

Kim Il Sung, leader from 1948-1994

Kim Il Sung can be credited with founding North Korea and propelling the nation’s nuclear program forward — but he did not live to see his country conduct its first nuclear test.

It was under the first Kim that North Korea began to build up its nuclear reactors. And it was under his leadership that the nation began the Korean War — surely a catalyst that led the leader to believe his nation needed nuclear weapons, Dr. Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, told Fox News in an interview.

TRUMP’S COMMENTS ON NORTH KOREA, FROM ‘FIRE AND FURY’ TO BLAMING CHINA

“The seeds of nuclear aspirations were sown in the Korean War,” Lee said.

The Korean War pitted North Korea and its ally China — two nations that did not have nuclear capabilities at the time — against a nuclear-armed U.S., making it “clear to the first Kim that nuclear weapons are very powerful, a powerful deterrent,” Lee said.

Kim Jong Il, leader from 1994-2011

When the second leader of the Kim dynasty died in 2011, Kim Jong Il was remembered as the “dictator who turned North Korea into a nuclear state,” in his New York Times obituary.

And it’s Kim Jong Il that really “gets the credit of taking the country down the nuclear path,"" Lee said.

In the beginning of his reign — he was North Korea’s supreme leader from 1994 to 2011 — North Korea denied that it had a nuclear weapons program.

However, in 2003, Pyongyang announced that North Korea was withdrawing from the 1968 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which barred the nation from making nuclear weapons.

By 2005, North Korea confirmed that it had its own nuclear weapons. It tested its first nuclear device in 2006.

Kim Jong Un, leader from 2011-present

Kim Jong Un is credited with accelerating North Korea’s push for nuclear weapons, and under the Obama administration, many of the world’s attitudes toward the East Asian nation’s nuclear capabilities became less blasé than in the past, Lee said.

And Kim Jong Un recently crossed a major threshold for his country this summer — the ability to credibly threaten the U.S. with an intercontinental ballistic missile.

NORTH KOREA CELEBRATES NUCLEAR TESTS

North Korea last month successfully tested its longest-ever flight of a ballistic missile. The intermediate-range weapon traveled 3,700 miles and passed over Japan before it landed in the Pacific. Earlier this month, the country also tested its most powerful nuclear test to date.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis condemned the test and said it caused “millions of Japanese” to “duck and cover.” Mattis also said the U.S. and Japan are ready for potential future missile threats.

After the missile test, Kim Jong Un said North Korea is nearing “equilibrium” with the U.S. in terms of its military force.

The increasingly frequent and aggressive tests have added to outside fears that North Korea is closer than ever to building a military arsenal that could viably target the mainland of the U.S. or its allies in Asia.

Trump called Kim Jong Un “Rocket Man” in his speech to the U.N. last month and said the dictator is on a “suicide mission for himself and for his regime.”

“The United States has great strength and patience,” Trump said. “But if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.”

http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/10/democrats-it-scandal-just-got-even-more-bizarre.html,['Frank Miniter'],2017-10-10 00:00:00,[],,"Perhaps you’ve lost track of the Democrat’s slowly exploding IT scandal, as much of the media is doing all it can to simply ignore it away.

I’m referring to the strange case of Imran Awan, the IT aide Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., kept on her congressional payroll even after it became known he and his wife, Hina Alvi Awan, were being investigated by the Capitol Police for possible theft, fraud, moving terabytes of data off Congress’s system and more.

Imran Awan was back in court last week. When pushed, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Mirando revealed some telling things about this case.

First, I should note that it was standing room only in the packed courtroom at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Friday morning ... okay, just kidding, actually, only a few reporters sat in the mostly empty wooden benches in the back of the courtroom. Anyone who didn’t know this was the latest scene in a slowly exploding political scandal would have thought this was only a forgettable bank fraud case.

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud.

Awan’s attorney, Chris Gowen, even told me: “This case is hardly newsworthy.”

But before the show started, Imran’s wife, Hina Alvi Awan, entered the courtroom. She had flown away to Pakistan with their children soon after the investigation became known.

Was she back as part of a plea deal?

While Hina Alvi was gone, on August 17, 2017, a federal grand jury indicted her and Awan on four counts, including conspiracy and conspiring to obtain home equity loans for $165,000 and $120,000 from the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union and then transferring the money to Pakistan. (Read the FBI’s criminal affidavit on the bank fraud here and you’ll see why the government thinks it has a strong case.)

Imran Awan is considered such a flight risk that his passport was taken, he was given a curfew and was fitted with a tracking device.

Meanwhile, Hina Alvi’ passport was also publicly taken during the court hearing, but she was officially listed as a “walk in,” a tracking device wasn’t attached to her ankle and the government had asked the court to squash an outstanding warrant for her arrest.

Now came the revelations. Gowen, Imran’s attorney, asked that Imran’s travel restrictions be removed.

This prompted Assistant U.S. Attorney Mirando to say that when Imran was arrested at Dulles International Airport a cellphone found on him “had been wiped clean just a few hours before.”

Gowen tried to counter this by saying, “Awan had recently bought the phone, so of course it didn’t have any data on it.”

But Mirando was ready. He said the FBI found that the phone had been wiped as clean as Hillary’s server. A time stamp on the iPhone indicated it had been wiped at 6:30 p.m. that evening. Also, Imran did have a laptop on him, but one of the few things on it was a resume. Mirando used this and other details—such as the Awans quickly selling many of their Virginia properties—to explain that Imran had no intention of returning.

In another twist, Gowen brought up a computer that Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz wants back so badly she actually threatened the chief of the Capitol Police in a public hearing with “consequences” if she didn’t get it back.

Gowen argued that the computer and documents seized in a bag left in a public area of a congressional building around midnight on April 6, 2017, are “protected by attorney-client privilege.” Gowen hopes to remove this evidence from future court proceedings.

Gowen, however, didn’t answer what Imran was doing in the Longworth congressional building late at night and long after he’d been fired by every Democrat aside from Rep. Wasserman Schultz (Wasserman Schultz’s office isn’t in Longworth).

The deeper you dig the more it becomes clear this case is about much more than bank fraud. Capitol Police are investigating possible theft of congressional computer equipment, massive amounts of data moved off the congressional system, alleged fake computer data created to throw investigators off the trail, and data mined by the Awans that could include emails from many members of Congress and more.

Rep. Wasserman Schultz, who lost her post at the DNC when Wikileaks published emails showing that under her leadership the DNC worked to sabotage Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign, might be exposed to even more revelations.

Meanwhile, Congress has been asked to open an ethics investigation to answer why Rep. Wasserman Schultz kept Imran on her payroll even after the Capitol Police investigation became known.

So does this sound like a small bank fraud story to you or is it more likely that a lot more is going on here?"
http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/10/09/north-korea-could-use-holiday-as-excuse-to-provoke-us-experts-say.html,['Kaitlyn Schallhorn'],2017-10-09 00:00:00,[],,"This week marks two significant dates for North Korea – the anniversaries of its first nuclear test and the foundation of the ruling Worker’s Party of Korea.

Officials have warned that North Korea could use the special dates – in particular, the Oct. 10 anniversary of the Worker’s Party – to provoke the U.S. or launch a new missile.

""There is a clarity of purpose in what (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un is doing. I don’t think he’s done,"" Yong Suk Lee, the deputy assistant director of the CIA’s Korea Mission Center, said at a conference last week, according to Reuters. “In fact, I told my own staff (that) Oct. 10th is the Korean Workers Party founding day. That’s Tuesday in North Korea, but Monday – the Columbus Day holiday - in the United States. So stand by your phones.”

As North Korea’s past provocations have coincided with dates important to them, the U.S., China or Japan, Dr. Sung-Yoon Lee, the Kim Koo-Korea Foundation Professor of Korean Studies at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, predicted the east Asian country could test a missile by late Monday night.

North Korea said it had “perfect success” with a hydrogen bomb test on Sept. 3, 2017, Labor Day weekend in the U.S. It said it tested its first nuclear bomb on Oct. 9, 2006, coinciding with Party Foundation Day in North Korea, Lee said.

Other nuclear tests have lined up with Memorial Day weekend in the U.S. in 2009, Lunar New Year celebrations in China in 2013, Kim Jong Un’s birthday in 2016 and the Day of the Foundation of the Republic in 2016.

North Korea also tested its first successful intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, 2017.

“I have a feeling that they’re ready [for provocation] and they’re biding their time … for the most adverse impact,” Lee told Fox News Monday. He predicted that the country could fire a missile into the waters by Guam – which would illicit a response that would still be less than if Americans were killed.

NORTH KOREA’S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM HAS GROWN WITH EACH KIM REGIME

“They like to rub it in and spoil government officials’ long weekends,” Lee said.

A member of Russia’s lower house of parliament told local media that North Korea is preparing to test a long-range missile believed to reach the west coast of the U.S., according to The Guardian.

“They are preparing for new tests of a long-range missile. They even gave us mathematical calculations that they believe prove that their missile can hit the west coast of the United States,” Anton Morozov reportedly said last week after visiting Pyongyang.

As North Korea continues to develop its nuclear program, Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are engaged in a war of words and threats. Trump promised last month to “totally destroy” the Asian nation if provoked.

TRUMP WARNS KIM JONG UN, SAYS US POLICY TOWARD NORTH KOREA ‘DIDN’T WORK’

Lee also noted that China’s 19th party congress will meet later this month, and Trump is expected to visit China, Japan and South Korea in November – which could be when North Korea provokes next.

“They have a strategic game plan,” Lee said, dismissing the idea that North Korea simply “throws a tantrum” and launches missile tests."

Tony Hall']",2017-05-08 00:00:00,[],,"Jeffrey Fowle lost his job, feared for his life and wondered if he would ever see his family while being held prisoner by North Korea, yet the Ohio man considers himself lucky.

A devout Christian and father of three, Fowle, 58, traveled to the secretive dictatorship in 2014, driven by a long-abiding curiosity about the Hermit Kingdom and a desire to spread the Gospel to its people. In May, in the northern port city of Chongjinin, he made a mistake that cost him his freedom: He left a Bible under a trash can in the men’s room at a nightclub. In a nation where visitors are under constant watch, he was arrested immediately.

“I advise anyone planning personal travel to North Korea to seriously reconsider their plans.” - Former U.S. Rep. Tony Hall

“North Korea had always intrigued me,” said Fowle, who arranged his visit with Koryo Tours, a British-run firm based in Beijing.

NORTH KOREAN DETAINEE HAS EMOTIONAL REUNION WITH FAMILY IN OHIO

News that yet another American had been taken prisoner by the authoritarian dictatorship of Kim Jong Un quickly made its way back to the U.S., and the small, southern Ohio town of Moraine, where Fowle had worked for 26 years in the streets department.

Few Americans have traveled to North Korea. The State Department “strongly urges U.S. citizens to avoid all travel to North Korea/the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) due to the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea’s system of law enforcement.”

The U.S. has no diplomatic relations in North Korea. Foreigners who have been detained or imprisoned in the Hermit Kingdom often have a shared experience: confusion, coached confessions, communication blackouts and isolation.

Four U.S. citizens are currently known to be held in North Korea: 21-year-old college student Otto Warmbier, accounting professor Kim Sang Duk, businessman Kim Dong Chul and Kim Hak-Song, who worked at Pyongyang University.

Fowle understands why many would question his decision to travel to North Korea. He told Fox News that, having grown up in the Cold War era, he was fascinated with communism. He has visited the former Soviet Union, the birthplace of his wife Tanya, six times.

Fowle hoped the Bible he smuggled into North Korea, which contained his name and family photos, would find its way to someone in the underground Christian community. But a day after he concealed it, his tour group’s leader confronted him. The book had been found and turned in almost immediately, and Fowle said he knew he had been caught. He was allowed to continue the tour, but when he arrived at the airport in Pyongyang to depart, authorities grabbed him.

AMERICANS RELEASED FROM NORTH KOREAN CAPTIVITY BACK ON US SOIL

Following his arrest, Fowle said he was in an “information black hole.” He repeatedly asked his guards what North Korea wanted in exchange for his release, but he never got an answer. Early on, Fowle passed the time watching television at the Yanggakdo hotel where he was initially held. He was pleased to find not just state-run channels and propaganda, but options in English and Chinese. But as soon as his minders realized the error, he was limited to just three or four official channels.

Fowle stresses that, unlike Americans held before and after him, he was never placed in one of the brutal nation’s infamous work camps. But in his quarters, he was isolated and monitored constantly. He was given pen and paper and coached on his “statement of guilt,” a coerced confession he was made to re-write over and over.

Later, Fowle was moved to a heavily guarded “guest house,” where he was limited to one small room. He spent up to 23 hours a day in isolation, his only human contact with a translator, with whom he took a daily walk.

Fowle said that his minders were part of the Korea International Travel Company (KITC), the state-run organization that deals with “herding tourists through the country.” He believed they were carefully chosen and “well-trusted” by Kim Jong Un’s regime.

NORTH KOREA SENTENCES AMERICAN TOURIST TO 15 YEARS IN PRISON WITH HARD LABOR

Throughout his detention, a liaison from the U.S. government kept his wife and children informed, but he said they kept the message realistic, without false optimism. His family was aware that the U.S. had to negotiate through the Swedish Embassy.

Relying on his faith throughout his detention, Fowle said he knew “God was in control.” He remains grateful for the “army of people praying for [his family].”

In October 2014, Pyongyang announced that Fowle would be freed. One month later, then-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper visited Pyongyang to secure the release of Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae, accused of evangelizing and committing “crimes aimed to topple the DPRK with hostility toward it,” and American Matthew Todd Miller, accused of “hostile acts” after he arrived in Pyongyang requesting asylum and tearing up his visa.

Although he was in the dark about events, Fowle remembers the moments leading up to his return to the U.S. On his last day in North Korea, he was called to his final “inspection” and felt certain that he was going to be sent off to a forced labor camp. Instead, he was taken to the Pothonggang hotel, escorted into a conference room and given what he said sounded like a “pre-planned spiel” in English.

“The First Party Chairman and Marshal Kim Jong Un recommended” that he be released,” a handler told him. Stunned, Fowle was approached by someone from the U.S. Department of Defense who told him that a plane was waiting to transport him.

Hours later, as he touched down at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Fowle felt like he was “walking on a cloud.” He embraced the family he hadn’t seen in six months: his wife Tanya, his daughter Stephanie and two sons, Alex and Chris.

Since his return, Fowle hasn’t left the country. One might assume that his wanderlust has been dampened by 6 months spent in captivity, but the calculation is far more practical. His job with the city was re-instated, and one condition of his re-employment was that he must refrain from taking any dangerous trips, he told Fox News.

Fowle credits one person above all others in securing his release: former U.S. congressman and former Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture Tony Hall. Hall used contacts and leverage acquired during humanitarian work in the 1990s, when deadly famine gripped North Korea.

Hall told Fox News that Fowle’s ordeal should serve as a warning to Americans curious about life in the rogue nation.

“I advise anyone planning personal travel to North Korea to seriously reconsider their plans,” Hall said."
http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/09/mandalay-bay-security-guard-was-shot-six-minutes-before-las-vegas-gunman-began-shooting-police-say.html,['Nicole Darrah'],2017-10-09 00:00:00,[],,"A Mandalay Bay hotel security guard who ran into Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock ahead of the Oct. 1 massacre is being hailed a hero after he took the shooter’s first bullet, potentially saving lives ahead of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.

Jesus Campos, a security guard at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was shot by Paddock six minutes before he began shooting into a crowd of 22,000 people enjoying the country music festival down below, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Joe Lombardo said in a news conference Monday evening.

Campos was responding to an alarm going off in the hotel and ventured off to find the source when he came across the sound of drilling.

The security guard told investigators that Paddock was drilling to an adjacent wall in the hallway — most likely to install a camera or to point a rifle — but never finished the job.

Lombardo said the alarm that went off was not connected to Paddock’s room.

At 9:59 p.m., Campos was shot in the leg after Paddock reportedly fired 200 shots into the hallway. Paddock began shooting into the crowd six minutes later, contradicting original reports that Campos’ arrival is what stopped Paddock’s mass shooting.

Between the time that Campos was shot and Paddock began shooting, Campos notified authorities of what happened, which Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said Friday was “absolutely critical” as it gave police Paddock’s exact location.

Lombardo said Monday that a maintenance worker was also on the 32nd floor at the time Campos was shot, and Campos prevented that man from also being shot or otherwise injured.

STEPHEN PADDOCK'S HOME SEARCHED AGAIN BY FBI, LAS VEGAS SHOOTER'S BACKGROUND EMERGES

Lombardo confirmed that Paddock had also shot at two aviation fuel tanks roughly 2,000 feet away from his hotel room, apparently in an effort to divert attention away from his shooting at the large crowd of people.

While authorities have yet to find a motive for Paddock, Lombardo said that they are continuing to investigate, noting “every piece of information we get is one more piece of the puzzle.”

Paddock's brother, Eric, and girlfriend, Marilou Danley, are still being interviewed in the wake of the shooting in an effort to gain insight.

""I'm trying to help them move forward with their investigation,"" Eric Paddock told the Las Vegas Journal-Review about cooperating with authorities. ""I'm trying to get them to understand Steve's mindset. I don't want them to chase bad leads.""

Officials have yet to find a possible connection between Paddock and ideology, and Lombardo said there is no evidence there was a second shooter.

JASON ALDEAN VISITS LAS VEGAS SHOOTING VICTIMS

Lombardo said that while investigators have found 200 incidents of Paddock moving through the city, there was no evidence he was with anyone else.

Many had speculated in the days following the shooting that a note found in Paddock’s hotel room was possibly a suicide note, but Lombardo said the piece of paper seen in leaked pictures was only a note with numbers on it.

Las Vegas police officers who entered Paddock’s room told CBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday night that the note contained hand-written calculations, which included “the distance, the elevation he was on, the drop of what his bullet was gonna be for the crowd.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/26/how-to-successfully-sue-isis-hezbollah-or-regimes-iran-syria-and-north-korea.html,['Hollie Mckay'],2017-09-26 00:00:00,[],,"For almost 17 years, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner and her legal team of 10 at the nongovernmental organization Shurat HaDin, known as the Israel Law Center in Tel Aviv, have managed to achieve the seemingly inconceivable: successfully sue — and successfully collect — hundreds of millions of dollars from terrorist groups and governments on behalf of victims’ families.

“We have sued groups such as ISIS, Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority and have worked on cases involving the Japanese Red Army and the Kurdish PKK,” Darshan-Leitner told Fox News. “We have received judgments against North Korea several times and we have many judgments against Iran and Syria for their involvement in international terrorism. If they are not held accountable, they become further emboldened. And for the victims, it is a little closure and justice.”

Ultimately, the powerhouse lawyer digs deep to find as many legal loopholes as possible.

“We try to focus on entities and individuals and rogue regimes that provide it material support and resources. Even then it is very hard to nail down. ISIS moves funds through Islamic ‘Halawa’ money transfers. These are informal networks of money changers who will move sums internationally between branches in neighborhoods of Islamic countries, for a small percentage,” Darshan-Leitner explained. “This dark banking system, which is not plugged into the official international banking system can move funds around virtually undetected. It is a relentless struggle, but we are confident that if we continue to pursue groups like ISIS we can learn a lot about their finances and partners.”

While going precisely after ISIS is a near-impossible feat given the covert nature of its operatives in Iraq, Syria and scattered through western countries, Leitner instead goes after the individuals and businesses who — directly or indirectly — fund them from banks to oil exporters to charities and most recently, social media conglomerates.

As such, the firm’s focus has been to go after those individuals and businesses located in Western states that “aid and abet” the black-clad jihadist army in violation of international antiterrorism laws, which includes social media platforms.

“YouTube provides ISIS with the ability to post its videos and disseminate its messages, and Twitter provides the terror group services,” Darshan-Leitner contended. “Western law enforcement agencies have already determined that several of the deadly ISIS attacks in Europe were perpetuated by terrorists who organized via their social media accounts. Where would ISIS be today if they weren’t able to post beheading videos and recruitment propaganda? How would teens know how to contact them or travel to Syria to join them?”

Darshan-Leitner has to-date filed suits against Facebook, Google — the owner of YouTube — and Twitter on behalf of ISIS and Hamas victims. The cases, initially filed in New York courts, largely have been moved to California at the request of the mostly Palo Alto-based enterprises.

“The social media companies are liable as they violated U.S. law in providing material support and resources,” she said. “Clearly, these companies with their sophisticated technology and logarithms which allow them to know everything about their users’ likes and dislikes, have the capabilities to identify and block the terror groups and block the calls to violence.”

AS NORTH KOREA THREATENS ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE ATTACK, QUESTIONS OVER LAPSES IN U.S. GRID SECURITY RISE

And when it comes to suing governments, Darshan-Leitner has had scores of judgments against the regimes of Iran and Syria for “their involvement in international terrorism and support of groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas” in legal standing of Americans killed or wounded in the Middle East.

“Iran and Syria continue to be the largest state sponsors of international terrorism. They provide the finances, training, weapons, safe houses and ideology,” she claimed. “We are very persistent in continuing to file suits against them and we try to locate Iranian and Syrian assets that we can try to seize to enforce our judgments. It is a war of attrition, and we will continue to pursue these outlaw regimes on behalf of the terror victims and their families.”

On that note, Darshan-Leitner is now deep in a $67 million judgment against U.S.-based Boeing, representing the American Leibovitch family — who lost their seven-year-old child to a 2003 Iran-connected terror attack — over the flight giant’s contentious deal with Tehran. Following the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — commonly called the “Iran Deal” — the previously pariah nation entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase some $20 billion in aircraft.

IRANIAN EX-PATS RALLY WHILE ROUHANI RAILS

Darshan-Leitner wants all the information on how and where the money is going to be exposed, but Boeing has asserted that disclosing the details of the transaction would be an obstruction of a U.S. foreign policy and has fought resolutely to keep the details secret.

Earlier this month, a Chicago federal court ordered the Trump administration to file a statement by October 12 notifying the court if the government concurs that unveiling the details of the Boeing deal will interfere with Iranian-U.S. foreign policy. Boeing declined to comment further on the matter.

Given that Iran and Syria are the only official state sponsors of terror listed in the United States, along with Sudan, suits against them can be filed in American courts. But with other regimes such as North Korea, the process is more complicated and must be filed outside the U.S given that the hermit country was quietly removed from the list in 2008, granting them sovereign immunity and thus they cannot be sued by U.S citizens.

ISIS STILL STEALING, SPILLING AND SMUGGLING OIL THROUGHOUT IRAQ

Prior to that, Darshan-Leitner successfully represented American citizens in three historic multimillion dollar verdicts against the regime in Pyongyang. She won a monumental $30 million judgment on behalf of the family of Kim Dong-shik, a U.S. resident and Christian missionary kidnapped in 2000 and murdered in North Korea by the regime. In 2006, she won a case for Hezbollah rocket attack victims after a U.S. federal court determined that North Korea was liable for providing support to Hezbollah, along with a case in a San Juan Puerto Rico court involving the 1972 Lod Airport attack in which a court ruled North Korea trained and funded terrorists.

“We continue to look for elusive North Korean assets. They conduct little trade and commerce and so going after their assets in order to enforce our judgments is difficult, so we are trying to be very diligent in our efforts to locate those who are illegally trading with North Korea or providing it an type of services or goods that can be seized,” the attorney continued, adding that North Korea ought to be placed once again as a state sponsor of terror so that other victims’ families, such as Otto Warmbier’s parents, can target them directly.

Darshan-Leitner, who was born and raised in Israel in a time when one could not even “walk the streets” for fear of an attack, said that she could not “sit idly” and sees it as her lifelong mission to bring terrorists and their backers to justice.

“We see our efforts, utilizing lawsuits and court systems to counter the terrorists as an important part of the effort to obstruct. Western governments are shackled by treaties, domestic restraints and political correctness and have trouble doing what needs to be done to target and destroy terror groups,” she added. “We are private attorneys representing private terror victims. Once a group like ISIS crosses the line of all civilized behavior, they have to be battled until they are destroyed. Or they will return and come back at us.”"
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/09/why-celebrate-columbus-day-here-are-few-reasons.html,['Steve Kurtz'],2017-10-09 00:00:00,[],,"Columbus Day, the second Monday in October, is a nationally recognized holiday.

But it’s not recognized in Los Angeles, where I live. The City Council recently voted to get rid of Columbus Day and replace it with Indigenous Peoples’ Day, commemorating “indigenous, aboriginal and native people.”

This movement sees Columbus as a symbol of destruction, and thus not to be celebrated.

This new day was first adopted in Berkeley, California in 1992. Since then, it’s spread across the nation with increasing speed, as more than 60 cities from Maine to Washington have supported the idea.

While there is plenty to criticize about Columbus, and what followed his arrival, I think this movement is missing the point.

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it.

It is true that the conquest of the Americas by Europeans, which starts with Columbus, was very ugly, and involved a lot of violence. But that, for better or worse, is how history worked pretty much everywhere for thousands of years. (Though it should be noted a large portion of the deaths of Native Americans was due to disease, not violence--an inevitable consequence of Old World illness in New World soil. Europe, Asia and Africa, of course, suffered through numerous plagues of their own.).

History, in fact, is the story of conquest. We may not like it, but it’s our shared heritage. Not just Europeans, but everyone. While there is only limited knowledge of what pre-Columbus America was like, it did feature war, slavery, torture and plenty of brutality.

The point is not to excuse the worst that happened, but to understand it. And to see that it is not the essence of Columbus, but rather part of the times. With all that, there are reasons to celebrate Columbus Day.

-- Celebrate Italians (though there is some question as to whether Columbus would have considered himself an Italian -- he was long thought to have been born in Genoa, then an independent city-state in what is now Italy, though everyone from Greece to Portugal to Poland have claimed him as their own). Nevertheless, Italians claim him today and Columbus Day is a good chance to recognize what Italians have contributed to America, and the world.

-- Celebrate the spirit of exploration. It took tremendous bravery to sail off into the unknown. One of the best parts of our humanity is that sense of discovery.

-- Celebrate the spread of Western civilization. Lately a lot of people have been putting down Western civilization, but its spread is one of the greatest things that’s ever happened to humanity.

The West has its good and bad points, but its best ideas—equal rights, freedom of religion, free speech, due process, open scientific inquiry, property rights and so on—have helped all people who adopt them. (Not that the West solely had these ideas, but it put them in a package that wasn’t generally available elsewhere.)

Indeed, the promise of the West has delivered freedom and bounty such as humanity has never known.

And, while we celebrate Columbus Day, we can learn from history and also take time to honor Native Americans. They were the original immigrants to the New World, and deserve their remembrance.

Once we do this, Columbus Day can be a truly inclusive holiday. It needn’t be a battleground, but a chance to celebrate the best within us."
http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/10/08/incredible-reason-my-coworker-stopped-talking-to-me.html,['Joshua Rogers'],2017-10-08 00:00:00,[],,"A few years ago I had a coworker who was particularly unfriendly from the start. She barely even acknowledged me when I greeted her. Then one day, everything changed.

The coworker, whom I’ll call Carrie, dropped by my office and asked for advice about how to deal with her supervisor. I appreciated the fact that Carrie trusted my advice, but I was uncomfortable with the conversation. She seemed to be gossiping more than trying to fix the problem, so I tried to turn the conversation to a more positive direction.

“That sounds frustrating, but you can’t fix your supervisor,” I said. “The only person you can work on is you. If you spend your energy trying to fix someone you can’t control, you’re just going to feel frustrated and helpless.”

She laughed and said, “You remind me of Joel Osteen.”

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

I repeated my advice with my best twangy Osteen impression and wrapped up the conversation, sincerely hoping she might actually change her behavior. She didn’t.

When Carrie would see me, she always found a way to make the conversation about her supervisor. I would give a similar motivational talk and redirect the conversation, but it never seemed to work. It became apparent that gossiping about her supervisor was how Carrie connected to other people. And I decided I wasn’t going to be one of those people anymore.

The next time Carrie tried to strike up a gossipy conversation about her supervisor, I was more direct.

“I understand that you’re frustrated with your supervisor, but if you aren’t careful, it will be the only way you can connect with people at work,” I said. “You’ll basically be using people to listen to you vent about your supervisor.”

Carrie looked visibly uncomfortable, abruptly ended the conversation and totally avoided me after that. Even when I would speak in the hallway, she would mumble an unintelligible response and look past me.

We had no relationship unless I was willing to listen to her vent. We couldn’t be friends unless we shared a common enemy. In other words, we weren’t really friends.

My relationship with Carrie was based on emotional triangulation, something Edwin Friedman warns against in his book, “Failure of Nerve.” The common denominator in all triangulated relationships is that there’s some negative third pillar – some frustration or offense – that keeps the relationship together. And it happens more easily than we realize.

We find ourselves always venting about the same subject to a friend. We repeatedly share “prayer requests” that are really passive-aggressive ways of gossiping. It’s cowardly. We can’t deal with our own problems so we find other people who will take on our anxieties and offenses.

There’s nothing wrong with being transparent about our struggles when we talk with friends, but we just need to make sure it’s not the only thing we’re talking about. We’ve got to redirect ourselves and “[f]ix our thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise” (Philippians 4:8).

As we fix our thoughts on the true, honorable, right, pure, lovely and admirable things in the people around us, we’ll find less pleasure in sharing their weaknesses with others. We'll also be less interested in hearing other people spew negativity about others.

Breaking down triangulated relationships takes hard work. It requires us to find new ways to connect with others, and it might mean that we lose friendships that can't survive without the negativity to keep it going. Even so, we’ll gain the respect of real friends who will probably be grateful to have a relationship that’s based on something more than shared offenses."

The new intelligence, detailing reports from September and October and disclosed just ahead of President Trump’s planned announcement Thursday on whether the U.S. will recertify the Iran deal, reveals that Iran’s regime made “32 procurement attempts … that definitely or with high likelihood were undertaken for the benefit of proliferation programs.”

According to the document, the 32 attempts took place in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. The report lists Iran as a nation that engages in proliferation, which is defined as “spreading atomic, biological or chemical weapons of mass destruction.”

Missile delivery systems are also included in the definition of illicit proliferation activity in the report.

THE CASE FOR A 'CLEAN WITHDRAWAL' FROM THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL

The North Rhine-Westphalia agency accused Iran of using front companies in the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China to circumvent international restrictions on its nuclear and missile programs.

The intelligence report, which covered the year 2016 — the Iran deal was implemented on Jan. 16, 2016 — calls further into question Iran’s compliance with the agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.

The overwhelming majority of Iran’s illegal attempts covering the year 2016 in North Rhine-Westphalia encompassed technology for the clerical regime’s missile programs.

The year before, the agency recorded 141 attempts by Iran to secure illicit goods for proliferation purposes.

AS TRUMP CHALLENGES IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THOSE IN TEHRAN WORRY

In a second intelligence report obtained by Fox News, the German state of Hessen said Iran, Pakistan, North Korea and Sudan use “guest academics” for illegal activities related to nuclear and other weapons programs. “An example for this type of activity occurred in the sector of electronic technology in connection with the implementation of the enrichment of uranium,” the document reads.

The intelligence officials also cited an example of foreign intelligence services using “research exchanges at universities in the sector of biological and chemical procedures.”

When asked about whether Iran was involved in the academic and research cases, a spokesman for Hessen’s intelligence agency declined to comment.

In April, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told Fox News he’s “gravely concerned” about Iran’s role in helping Syria develop its chemical warfare program. Rubio, a Republican, said he was troubled by reports that both Iran and Russia were complicit in Syrian President Bashar Assad’s chemical weapons program.

IRAN ISSUES THREAT OVER US STRIKES IN SYRIA

“Congress and the White House should work together to hold the Assad regime accountable for its war crimes and impose harsh sanctions against its enablers,” Rubio told Fox News.

A third intelligence report, from the state of Saxony-Anhalt, said Iran works “unabated” on its missile program.

“With ballistic missiles and long-range rockets, Iran will be in the position to not only be able to threaten Europe,” it says.

United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution 2231 notes that “activities with Iran for nuclear and non-nuclear civilian end uses” should be sent to a technical UN working group on procurement.

When asked if Germany reported the illicit exports and the unlawful attempts to the UNSC, German diplomats told Fox News: ""We have no indication of Iran violating its JCPOA commitments. Quite on the contrary, the recent 2016 Report of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution states that there is no evidence of Iran violating the JCPOA.

""Having said that, we remain worried by Iran’s missile program. The aforementioned report, as well as reports from regional intelligence authorities, shows that Germany is highly vigilant in this regard and will continue to do so. However, this issue is outside the scope of the JCPOA and needs to be dealt with separately.""

David Albright and Andrea Stricker, two experts on Iran’s nuclear program at the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, wrote in April that the UN’s “Procurement Channel is a potentially valuable transparency and verification condition in the JCPOA, aimed at controlling the export of goods to Iran’s authorized nuclear programs and non-nuclear, civil end uses.”

The experts added, “It seeks to deny Iran opportunities, or at least help expose any efforts, to violate the JCPOA and increase the transparency of Iran’s nuclear programs.”

Sigmar Gabriel, the outgoing Social Democrat foreign minister of Germany, has made several trips to Iran since 2015 to boost trade with Tehran. Gabriel is widely considered one of Europe’s most energetic advocates of the Iran deal."

The book given to Sports Minister Kim Il Guk was not signed by Trump, who was Rodman’s boss for two seasons of “Celebrity Apprentice” reality TV show, according to the Associated Press.

Rodman arrived in the isolated Asian nation on Tuesday for the first time in Trump’s presidency. He said he is “just trying to open a door” on a mission he thinks may get support.

Rodman talked to reporters briefly before his flight from Beijing to Pyongyang. Asked if he had spoken to Trump about his trip, he said, ""Well, I'm pretty sure he's pretty much happy with the fact that I'm over here trying to accomplish something that we both need.""

The 56-year-old Rodman, who won five NBA championships as a player with the Detroit Pistons and Chicago Bulls, previously traveled to North Korea in January 2014. On that trip, Rodman sang ""Happy Birthday"" to Dictator Kim Jong Un, who Rodman referred to as his ""best friend.""

A senior Trump administration official told Fox News on Monday that he was traveling as a “private citizen” this time around.

Rodman’s arrival came hours after North Korea decided to release American student Otto Warmbier, who had been imprisoned for 15 years with hard labor for trying to steal a propaganda banner.

Warmbier, who had been confined for 17 months, has apparently fallen into a coma not long after his confinement began. Pyongyang said Thursday saying it decided to let him go for ""humanitarian reasons.""

Washington and Pyongyang officials said that Rodman played no role in Warmbier’s release.

Vice President Mike Pence has been an Indianapolis Colts fan for quite awhile. He served the state of Indiana in Congress during the record-setting heyday of Peyton Manning. So it was unsurprising to find out that Pence planned to be at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis yesterday when the Colts officially retired Manning’s jersey and inducted him into their Ring of Honor during halftime of their game against the San Francisco 49ers.

But the vice president’s homecoming to honor the legendary quarterback was cut short when 15-20 players for the 49ers decided to disrespect the American flag, continuing their pregame publicity stunt by kneeling. Pence left the game and tweeted out his explanation:

“I left today’s Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem…While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don’t think it’s too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem.”

The reaction was largely predictable, with fans tired of the political posturing of overpaid sports stars applauding, and social justice warriors condemning. What was extraordinarily funny, however, was the way that the sports media humiliated themselves in responding.

The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

Former CBS Sports writer and current Indy Star sports columnist Gregg Doyel, a card-carrying left-wing activist, immediately registered his disgust by cranking out an article suggesting that, “Mike Pence used the Colts to spray paint Donald Trump’s political graffiti.” His hyperbole got him an invitation to appear on CNN’s ""New Day"" with fellow leftist Chris Cuomo.

He was far from alone in his indignation, though. In fact, the entire Indianapolis Star staff, which has notoriously opposed and besmirched Pence for years, apparently saw their opportunity to issue a collective, coordinated strike.

Opinion chief Tim Swarens pushed out a column accusing Pence of demonstrating a lack of leadership. Sports writer Zac Keefer kept everyone informed how much per hour it cost taxpayers to fly Air Force 2, and whined that the, “Whole thing was planned.” But the most hysterical response went to their colleague Stephen Holder who quoted NFL reporter Mike Freeman’s tweet calling Pence’s action “pre-planned outrage” and “fake outrage,” adding, “Total publicity stunt IMO (in my opinion).”

Wait a minute. Holder (and Keefer, and Doyel), have fallen all over themselves applauding the publicity stunt of players taking a knee during the anthem for weeks now. Why are some publicity stunts more equal than others?

Local radio star Tony Katz, who fills in occasionally for nationally syndicated Dana Loesch, asked Holder to clarify whether it qualifies as a publicity stunt when players kneel. Holder’s response was choice:

“Probably to you, because you either aren’t listening to them or don’t care. Good day.”

Sorry, but that’s just too funny. I’m guessing Holder doesn’t even realize that the exact same thing can be said about his response to Pence: Holder either isn’t listening to Pence when he explains why he left, or he doesn’t care. The vice president stayed, stood, and honored the flag and anthem while it was performed. He chose not to stay and honor the players who disrespected that flag with his presence at their game – like countless other fans have done as well. This isn’t that difficult to understand.

Keefer, Doyel, and Holder don’t want anyone telling players they have to stand for the anthem. But they’re totally fine with telling the vice president he has to stay for the game. This might be why they write about balls for a living."
http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/09/05/millions-american-lives-could-be-at-stake-as-north-korea-threatens-to-attack-power-grid.html,['Hollie Mckay'],2017-09-05 00:00:00,[],,"North Korea may very well have the ability to kill millions of Americans, without directly firing on U.S. soil. For the first time, the pariah country’s state news agency warned it could hit the U.S. with an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) onslaught, a threat that experts contend is both very real and comes with catastrophic consequences.

“The biggest danger would be shorting out of the power grid, especially on the East Coast. Imagine a situation where large sections of the U.S. had no power. Imagine New York or Washington D.C. with no power for just a week. The implications would be hard to fathom,” Harry Kazianis, Director of Defense Studies at the Center for the National Interest, told Fox News. “The casualty rates would be off the charts.”

According to Kazianis, an EMP delivered by a nuclear weapon would not just fry power grids but also carry the destructive power of an atomic device.

“That in it of itself is going to kill thousands if not millions depending on the size of it and where it is dropped. Also, nuclear weapons carry radioactive fallout that would be spread thousands of miles through the atmosphere and oceans,” he continued. “We would be adding to such a casualty count sadly for decades thanks to cancer cases that would arise many years later.”

So how could North Korea pull off an EMP attack? A hydrogen bomb detonated at a high altitude would create an electromagnetic pulse that would knock out key infrastructure – namely prominent parts of the U.S. electrical grid.

The higher the bomb’s detonation, the wider the range of destruction. An altitude of just under 250 miles – around the orbit of the International Space Station – would annihilate electronics in majority of the mainland, including parts of neighboring Canada and Mexico, analysts have said. North Korea exhibited its capacity to reach such altitudes in satellite launches in both 2012 and 2016.

KAZIANIS: TRUMP HAS OPTIONS BUT MUST ACT QUICKLY

An EMP attack, experts warn, doesn’t require definitive guidance systems as the area affected is so widespread.

“An EMP is similar to a lightning strike in some respects, but it acts over a wide area – hundreds of miles,” explained John Gilbert, retired Air Force colonel and senior science fellow with the Center for Arms Control and Nonproliferation in Washington, D.C. “There would be widespread and probably long-lasting power outages and wire-line telecommunications systems such as telephone and TV/internet cable would suffer serious damage. Individual items such as cars and trucks could also be damaged or disabled and damage could occur to electronic devices in homes and businesses.”

An attack could cut power to health care facilities and cripple municipal facilities and utilities.

“North Korea consistently exceeds our estimates of what we think they can do, so prudence might indicate we take them at their word,” noted Lieutenant General Wallace Gregson (USMC, Ret.), the former assistant defense secretary, now Senior Director of China and the Pacific at the Center for the National Interest. “The aim is to shut down our electrical grid and all the distribution networks – water, waste, financial, traffic management, air control, radio, computer, others – we depend upon.”

Scientists first discovered the EMP fallout of a hydrogen bomb during a test in 1962, in which lights were burned out in Honolulu – some 1,000 miles from the test location.

Experts have long warned of the plausibility of an EMP attack from the likes of North Korea or Iran. A special task force appointed by Congress and known as the EMP Commission cautioned in 2008 that the largely digitized U.S. could be left black for up to a year as a result of an EMP disruption. They say that even the sensors and monitors that function to re-start electronics after a power outage would be wiped out.

KAZIANIS: NORTH KOREA SHOWED THE WORLD HOW IT COULD START A WAR

Yet apparently little was done to address the potential crisis.

The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported last year that the federal government had failed to implement an array of recommendations they had made eight years earlier to prevent calamitous outages triggered by an EMP incursion, noting that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Energy (DOE) had not “established a coordinated approach to identifying and implementing key risk management activities to address EMP risks” and that securing the grid was far from the top priority.

NORTH KOREA WARNS MORE 'GIFT PACKAGES' TO U.S. AS EUROPE WORRIES ABOUT MISSILE STRIKE

Richard Schoeberl, a terrorism analyst and former unit chief at the CIA’s National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), asserted that while North Korea’s own proclamations of having the capability to strike the U.S. with an EMP attack may be well be over-exaggerated, it is a threat that requires serious mitigations.

“The United States can provide better protection of the nation’s infrastructure,” he told Fox News. “The threat of EMP is completely plausible.”

“Most of our East Coast grid has a lot of older equipment that could be vulnerable. We should work quickly to make the necessary upgrades to ensure North Korea can’t catch us by surprise,” Kazianis added. “We are highly vulnerable to such an attack. Considering that if North Koreans are able to pack enough destructive power into such a nuclear device they could fry countless electrical grids and equipment. If they use a big enough device the damage could be beyond belief.”

Now a former Times reporter claims the paper could have exposed Weinstein over a decade ago but the story was watered down by editors after a visit from Weinstein, and calls from two of Hollywood's biggest names.

TheWrap CEO and Editor-in-Chief Sharon Waxman published a story on Sunday night detailing a 2004 incident in which she was given “the green light to look into oft-repeated allegations of sexual misconduct by Weinstein,” when she was a “fairly new reporter at The New York Times” but the story was never published.

Waxman said it was “believed that many” of the allegations against Weinstein occurred overseas, so she traveled to Rome and tracked down Fabrizio Lombardo, the person who ran Miramax Italy. Citing “multiple accounts,” Lombardo “had no film experience and his real job was to take care of Weinstein’s women needs,” she wrote.

TheWrap founder claimed she also “tracked down a woman in London who had been paid off after an unwanted sexual encounter with Weinstein” but was called directly by Weinstein associates such as Matt Damon and Russell Crowe to vouch for Lombardo. In addition, Waxman reported that Weinstein even visited the Times’ newsroom personally to express displeasure at the story she was working on and the story was gutted after he spoke with people above her head at the paper.

Damon's and Crowe's reps did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

“The story was stripped of any reference to sexual favors or coercion and buried on the inside of the Culture section, an obscure story about Miramax firing an Italian executive,"" Waxman wrote. ""Who cared?”

Current Bloomberg editor Jon Landman was the paper’s culture editor at the time and told Waxman that the story wasn’t interesting, according to her report. She said that the Times enabled Weinstein before it eventually exposed him.

“So pardon me for having a deeply ambivalent response about the current heroism of the Times,” Waxman wrote.

Waxman said she “simply gagged” when she read a follow-up Times piece about media enablers who “kept this story from the public” for decades because the paper is one of the news organizations who covered up Weinstein’s history.

Landman declined Fox News’ request for comment, but told Politico: ""“Sharon has now had more than a decade to pursue this story unencumbered by me or any New York Times editor. Why, if she had the goods on Weinstein in 2004, has she been unable or unwilling to publish something in the Wrap, where she was in charge? Could it be because she didn’t actually have the goods then, now or in between?” The Times also fired back at Waxman, noting that her 2004 story may not have met the paper’s standards for publication.

""The Times newsroom has a long history of exposing corruption and abuse by powerful people and institutions. Our newsroom was the first to publish a meticulously reported investigation of Mr. Weinstein revealing numerous settlements for sexual harassment,” a Times spokesperson told Fox News. “Our former colleague Sharon Waxman wrote about a story that was published in The Times in 2004. No one currently at The Times has knowledge of editorial decisions made on that story. But in general the only reason a story or specific information would be held is if it did not meet our standards for publication.""

Some media industry insiders have asked why Waxman, who runs an outlet that covers the entertainment industry, didn’t publish an updated version of the “gutted” 2004 story detailing the woman in London who had been paid off when she founded TheWrap.

Waxman added an update to her report to address why she didn’t report the story at TheWrap: “Fair question. Five years later, 2009, the moment had passed to go back and write the missing piece about Lombardo, who was no longer on the scene and whose story had been half-published in the Times. Miramax was no longer part of the Walt Disney Company. And I did not have sufficient evidence to write about a pay-off, even though I knew one existed. My focus was on raising money, building a website and starting a media company. In the subsequent years since then I did not hear about further pay-offs or harassment and thought the issue was in the past. Weinstein had made a big effort, supposedly, to curb his temper and behavior, which was reflected in other areas of his public life.”

""I get choked up, every time, as I let go and watch it take off,"" Foley told FoxNews.com.

[pullquote]

The balloons, made from a large sheet of ""farm plastic,"" said Foley, are filled with hydrogen before the Bibles and ""tracts"" – testimonials written by other North Korean Christians – are attached at the bottom inside a sack or box. Timers are then used to release the materials in stages, dispersing them at high altitudes across North Korea. Foley and members of his Christian mission group, Seoul USA, use GPS technology to help direct where the Bibles land. Around 50,000 of them have dropped from the skies in the last year.

""They are the most persecuted believers on earth,"" Foley said of North Korea’s estimated 100,000 Christians – 30,000 of whom are believed to be locked inside concentration camps, where they are overworked, starved, tortured, and killed. Other activist groups, like Open Doors USA, estimate that number to be even higher, reporting that the secretive nation has about 400,000 Christians.

In North Korea, the practice of Christianity is illegal. Owning a Bible is a crime, and any person caught with one is sent – along with three generations of his or her family – to prison. Foley said despite the risks, demand for Bibles is strong within North Korea. His group targets rural areas where they might be picked up discreetly, he said.

North Koreans are forced to embrace Juche ideology, which mixes Marxism with worship of the late ""Great Leader"" Kim Il Sung and his family – a warped version of Christianity, says Foley, because Kim took concepts from Christianity, like the Trinity and church hymns, to create a religion in which he is worshipped. Foley said that if North Koreans learned about Christ, they would realize ""this is all a fraud.""

""It's a distortion of Christianity,"" Foley said. ""And the best way to reach them [North Koreans] is through mindset and knowledge.""

Foley, who is in his late 40s, founded Colorado-based Seoul USA in 2003 with his wife, a South Korean who immigrated to the U.S. in 1984. The two, along with other members of their group, launched their first balloon -- strapped with Bibles -- from South Korea in 2006. Foley said the balloons are typically sent out overnight from a muddy field at a high altitude between May and October. He said the best conditions are during a ""rain storm or really bad weather because of the currents.""

""We are constantly monitoring the wind conditions as we're launching,"" he said, ""And the North Korean border is always within the sight line.""

The balloons also include tracts, or testimonies, written by other North Korean Christians -- some of whom managed to flee to South Korea -- about Christ.

""The North Koreans respond very well to story,"" Foley explained, ""Because all are required to memorize 100 stories"" related to Kim's ideology.

In addition to supplying religious materials by air, Foley's group produces short-wave radio programs with North Korean defectors reading the Bible. He said about 20 percent of North Koreans own radios, which are illegal.

Foley and his group won the legal rights to conduct the balloon launches from South Korea, but officials there ""don't make it easy,"" he said, noting that they often try to force hydrogen suppliers not to sell the group hydrogen.

""Every time we fill up one of these balloons, we hold it and we pray together in English, North Korean and South Korean,"" Foley said. ""We pray loudly and always with tears.""

You can’t get to ‘yes’ unless you ask.

So, President Trump and Senate Republicans, as leaders sworn to protect the U.S. Constitution, please walk away from Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore (R).

The man does not believe in the basis of our democracy, the Constitution.

He once tried to order federal judges to ignore the law of the land and deny marriage licenses to gay couples. He says a Muslim should not be allowed to serve in Congress, simply because of his or her religion.

And in blasphemy that should send Republicans through the roof, Moore blames America for the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. He said they were God’s punishment for the nation’s “perverseness and oppression.”

Moore stands in a line of repugnant GOP candidates, such as former Missouri Rep. Todd Akin. As a candidate for Senate in 2012, Akin claimed that a woman's body is able to distinguish between “legitimate rape” and illegitimate rape, and shut down pregnancies from “legitimate rape.”

Mitt Romney, the party’s 2012 presidential nominee, and the two top Senate Republicans, then-Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and his number two, Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), called on Akin to get out of the race.

But last week Moore got a warm welcome from the head of the GOP’s Senate campaign committee, Sen. Cory Gardner (Colo.). “We support him in keeping this seat in Republican hands,” said Gardner.

The critical difference for Republicans between Akin and Moore is that the party does not want to risk seeing its slim 52-48 majority reduced by one with a possible year-end vote on tax cuts approaching.

Moore’s support for the tax cut is not certain. Cutting the deficit is his priority and the current Republican plan will do the opposite.

There is a bigger picture here, however. Surely the GOP has bigger fish to fry than depending on Moore’s vote in support of a tax cut?

Is a legislative victory so important that it justifies promoting authoritarian government?

Moore’s outrageous statements invite ridicule from fair-minded Americans in all parties who believe in the nation’s founding principles — specifically, that there should be no government-sanctioned religion.

But to laugh at Moore’s attempts to undermine the Constitution is to dismiss the dangers his rhetoric poses.

A recent Huffington Post article revealed the depth of concern:

“A dangerous demagogue,” is how Rev. Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State has described Moore.

Larry Decker, head of the Secular Coalition of America, a group that stays out of politics, felt compelled to make an exception and oppose Moore.

Decker said in a statement that Moore has repeatedly “flaunted his disregard for the Constitution” by asserting “religious beliefs must take precedence over the law.”

The Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based group, also points to Moore’s disdain for the Constitution and history of “basing judicial opinions on his Biblical beliefs.”

Richard Cohen, president of the law center, has called Moore the “Ayatollah of Alabama,” suggesting that Moore’s goal of replacing the Constitution with the Christian bible is comparable with the view of Islamic extremists who would replace civil law with Sharia law based on the Quran.

But the man who needs to take the lead in repudiating Moore is Trump.

Trump rode a populist tide of rage to win the White House. He opened the door to dark forces in our politics with his vulgar talk about grabbing women by the genitals, and demonizing immigrants and Muslims.

Now he is in danger of being swallowed by the same anti-government populist wave. If Moore wins, he will unleash a tide of Republican candidates for House and Senate seats who care nothing about democracy and have no skill at governing.

Their penchant for waging culture wars and attacking the rule of law will break down the party’s unity on Capitol Hill and make it impossible to gather votes to pass Trump’s legislative agenda.

Recall that Moore’s key support in the primary race came from Steve Bannon, the president’s former top advisor.

Bannon wants to break apart the Republican Party to increase his power as the leader of a populist rebellion.

Moore is his instrument for throwing the GOP into a downward spiral of chaos.

The latest polling from JMC Analytics has Moore at 48 percent support with Democrat Doug Jones at 40 percent. Former Vice President Biden visited Alabama last week to campaign alongside Jones in Birmingham.

Jones is well-known for his years of service as a U.S. attorney and for prosecuting the perpetrators of the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in Birmingham.

Both parties — Republican and Democratic — have a moral obligation to do everything they can to ensure Moore does not get to the Senate.

That is why McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund PAC spent $10 million to defeat Moore in the Alabama primary. Even Trump opposed Moore.

Now Trump, McConnell and the GOP are biting their tongues bloody because they are being told to be pragmatic and focus only on the possible loss of a Senate seat.

Donald Trump was the test case for this new era of shameless politics.

Trump energized dark forces in our politics. Now he has a special responsibility to bring them to heel."

John Lewis (D-Ga.) on Saturday ? two days before America recognizes Martin Luther King Jr. Day ? after the civil rights leader said he doesn’t see him as a “legitimate president.”

Trump hit back at Lewis, suggesting that the congressman was doing a bad job of representing his district.

Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017

Trump was responding to Lewis questioning the president-elect’s legitimacy during an interview with NBC News Friday after intelligence reports said Russia interfered in the presidential election. “I don’t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,” Lewis told Chuck Todd, host of NBC’s “Meet The Press.”

The backlash was swift to Trump’s tweets about a man who’s considered a major figure in the civil rights movement.

Rep. Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) tweeted that Trump has “no clue” about sacrifice:

Sen. Ben Sasse (Neb.), an anti-Trump Republican, tweeted that “Lewis and his ‘talk’ have changed the world.” Sasse tweeted Friday asking Lewis to come to Trump’s inauguration.

“It isn’t about a man,” Sasse tweeted. “It is a celebration of peaceful transfer of power.”

Conservative commentator and noted Trump critic Bill Kristol compared Trump’s talk about Lewis to the way he treats Russian President Vladimir Putin:

It's telling, I'm afraid, that Donald Trump treats Vladimir Putin with more respect than he does John Lewis. — Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) January 14, 2017

Many pointed out the irony of Trump saying Lewis was “all talk,” posting photos of him marching with King and staging sit-ins:

Lewis rose to prominence as a civil rights leader after police beat him in 1965 as he crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. Police attacked Lewis and hundreds of peaceful voting rights activists at the event, known as “Bloody Sunday.” Lewis was beaten so badly he suffered a fractured skull. He was awarded the presidential Medal of Freedom in 2010.

This is good news for anybody who likes pollution, thinks we ought to hitch our economy to 19th century technology and doesn’t mind dealing with extreme weather disasters.

But it’s not good news for our economy – despite the falsehoods you’ll hear from President Trump, his surrogates and their fossil fuel industry backers.

Here’s why.

Under the Clean Power Plan, states are supposed to reduce their carbon emissions from existing power plants by about 30 percent.

To do that, states have a variety of good options. They can increase the availability of clean, renewable energy sources like solar and wind. That creates jobs and drives economic growth.

They can pass policies to make energy efficiency improvements in our schools, offices and homes ? saving consumers and businesses money along the way. That creates jobs and drives economic growth.

They can clean up or replace outdated coal power plants, reducing their emissions while increasing their efficiency. Guess what? That creates jobs and drives economic growth.

In a recent analysis, E2 found that repealing the Clean Power Plan will sacrifice the chance to create 560,000 jobs and generate $52 billion in economic activity between now and 2030.

https://www.e2.org/opportunitylostcpp/

By rolling back the Clean Power Plan, President Trump also is rolling right over the more than 3 million Americans who already work in clean energy today (that’s about 12 times as many people who work in coal and gas, by the way).

He’s also sacrificing American competitiveness in the fastest-growing energy sector to China, Europe and other parts of the world, while simultaneously linking the United States with Syria as the only countries not willing to join the rest of the world in doing something about climate change.

Is this really how President Trump expects to become “the greatest jobs president that God ever created”?

We know that policies that advance clean energy create jobs and drive economic growth in every part of the country

In my home state of North Carolina – the only state in the Southeast that has a renewable energy standard – more than 34,000 people now work in clean energy. Amazingly, the state is now No. 2 for solar in the country.

And in California, the state with the country’s strongest clean energy policies also has the country’s strongest economy. Today, more than 519,000 Californians work in clean energy and more than $45 billion have been invested into the state’s economy thanks to California’s leading climate and clean energy policies.

By cutting pollution and replacing outdated energy sources with clean, renewable energy, the Clean Power Plan is simply good for our economy and our environment.

Pretending it isn’t is like pretending a border wall will stop immigration problems or that climate change is a hoax perpetuated by China."

President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he would place his two sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, in charge of his multibillion-dollar Trump Organization.

“My two sons, who are right here, Don and Eric, are going to be running the company,” Trump said at a press conference in New York. “They are going to be running it in a very professional manner. They’re not going to discuss it with me.”

Sheri Dillon, a financial adviser at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said at the event that Trump’s sons would have no business-related contact with their father while he serves as president, and the company will appoint an ethics adviser to oversee any possible conflicts. The president-elect and his daughter Ivanka Trump, whose husband will become a senior White House adviser, will resign all positions in the Trump Organization, Dillon said.

Dillon added that the Trump Organization will not make any new foreign deals during his administration. The company will still pursue domestic deals.

The decision to put his two adult sons in charge of his company while the president-elect maintains a financial stake in the business will do little to alleviate concerns about the conflicts of interest he will face in office.

Norm Eisen, the top ethics adviser to President Barack Obama, laid out a simple test for Trump prior to the press conference.

“Is he turning it over all to the trustee or not?” Eisen said. “Clean break, blind trust or equivalent as every president has done for four decades. If he fails that test, he’s failing the presidency, he’s failing the American people, he’s failing the Constitution and failing all of us.”

Trump’s announcement falls far short of that standard. He will maintain a financial stake in his business, meaning that he will be subject to certain laws and constitutional provisions targeting financial conflicts of interest of the president of the United States.

At the end of his press conference, the president-elect made clear to note that he would still maintain a stake in his company that he could return to later. “I hope at the end of eight years I’ll come back and say, ‘Oh, you did a good job,’” he said. “Otherwise, if they do a bad job, I’ll say, ‘You’re fired.’”

President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built. Sheri Dillon, financial adviser at Morgan, Lewis & Bockius

Dillon said during the press conference that Trump did not pursue a sale of assets because any effort to sell the company would be hampered by the fact that its largest asset is the brand name associated with the president-elect.

“Selling his assets without the rights to the brand would greatly diminish the value of the assets and create a fire sale,” Dillon said. “President-elect Trump should not be expected to destroy the company he built.”

She added that Trump could not pursue a blind trust, as he knows what he owns and which buildings have his name on them. This is a point that’s been made by ethics experts, who have advocated for Trump to appoint an independent trustee to sell his assets and put the proceeds into a true blind trust.

Richard Painter, the former top ethics advisor to President George W. Bush, said that Trump’s plan for his business “does not work because he’s retained an ownership stake and all the existing conflicts of interest are in place.”

“It’s completely unprecedented,” he added, noting that every other president has extricated themselves from their business conflicts, “except for this one.”

Questions about Trump’s conflicts of interest related to his business holdings barely made noise during the presidential campaign. He was asked in debates and television interviews what he would do with his business if he won. “I would have nothing to do with my company,” he said in September. He floated handing off the business to his three adult children.

After his victory on Nov. 8, it became readily apparent that Trump, his campaign and his business had no plans for how to extricate the president-elect from business conflicts. Numerous foreign business partners attended his election-night celebration. Two of his Indian business partners came to Trump Tower to pay their respects and try to solidify new deals with the man about to assume the highest office of the United States. Trump promoted one of his partners in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

In a conversation with Nigel Farage, former head of the right wing anti-immigrant United Kingdom Independence Party, Trump asked Farage to agitate against offshore wind farms in Britain. Trump has long opposed the construction of a wind farm in the waters off one of his golf courses in Scotland because he feels it will ruin the view.

Trump also appointed all three of his children to the executive committee of his presidential transition. In those positions, they helped direct policy, interviewed candidates for Cabinet positions and met with foreign dignitaries. These appointments mixed business roles with governmental and policy roles, making it impossible to avoid conflicts if any of the children were appointed to head the Trump Organization.

In November, Trump angrily denounced those reporting on his financial conflicts of interest.

Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world.Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 22, 2016

And in an interview with The New York Times, Trump dismissed any concerns about conflicts of interest with his business by stating that it is not illegal if the president does it. “The law’s totally on my side, meaning, the president can’t have a conflict of interest,” Trump said.

Conflict of interest rules mandate that Cabinet officials divest from holdings that would conflict with their official duties on behalf of the American people. Those rules do not apply to the president or the vice president.

But since the adoption of these laws, every president has acted as though they have applied to their office. In addition, there are both laws and constitutional provisions that necessitate the divestment of certain business holdings to avoid legal conflicts.

Trump’s failure to fully extricate himself from his business also means that he will remain as the beneficiary of his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. The hotel’s lease with the General Services Administration specifically states that an “elected official of the Government of the United States” cannot “be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.” If Trump still retains a financial stake in the hotel, this means that he and his company will be in violation of his lease.

Gary Cameron / Reuters Donald Trump and his family attend an official ribbon-cutting ceremony at the new Trump International Hotel in Washington on Oct. 26, 2016.

Since the election, the hotel has pitched its expensive luxury rooms to foreign diplomats as a way to curry favor with the incoming Trump regime. Some foreign governments, including Bahrain and Azerbaijan, and corporate lobbying groups have since held events at the hotel.

At the press conference Wednesday, Dillon announced that the Trump Organization will voluntarily direct all profits made from any foreign governments using any Trump hotel property to the U.S. Treasury. Dillon did not clarify if this meant the hotels would direct all payments to the Treasury, or only the profits.

Trump initially announced plans for a Dec. 15 press conference solely devoted to laying out plans for the Trump Organization, but postponed it as it became clear that the task would be far more complicated than initially thought.

The president-elect and his aides have made conflicting statements since then. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN in December that “it’s a very unconventional situation.” But Trump said later in the month, “Honestly, it’s a very routine thing. It’s not a big deal. You people are making that a big deal — the business.”

The reality is that the Trump Organization is actually just a string of interlocking LLCs that each individually own specific properties and specific debt. Many of these individual LLCs are linked to one of the more than two dozen foreign business deals Trump has been engaged in over the years.

Beginning in December, the Trump Organization began to extricate itself from some foreign business deals. The company cancelled deals to license the Trump name to buildings in Brazil; Azerbaijan; Argentina; Georgia; and Pune, India.

In Brazil, a federal prosecutor opened a criminal investigation into the real estate development company that sought to license the Trump name for a Trump Tower and Trump hotel. The plan to build a Trump-named building in Buenos Aires, Argentina, faced increased scrutiny after it was reported that Trump pressed President Mauricio Macri to help get the proper permits from the city government. Both Trump and Macri denied this topic of conversation coming up in their call.

Even though these business deals were canceled, many others continue apace. Two Trump-named resorts are being developed in Indonesia by the developer Hary Tanoesoedibjo, who also runs his own political party in the world’s third-largest democracy. Tanoesoedibjo is reportedly coming to Trump’s inauguration to help solidify his business relationship with the Trump Organization.

“I have to underline that it’s a business relationship,” Tanoesoedibjo told Bloomberg in an interview on Monday. “I’m sure when he becomes president, Mr. Trump, everything won’t be much different from now.”"

“In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company - Robert Weinsten, Lance Maerov, Richard Koenigsberg and Taka Ben Ammar - have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately,” reads a statement from the company’s board of directors, obtained by Variety.

Weinstein co-founded the film studio in 2005 with his brother, and has an ownership stake in it. It has produced some of Hollywood’s biggest hits, including “Django Unchained” and “The King’s Speech.”

Weinstein’s brother may take over the company along with David Glasser, the chief operating officer, according to Variety.

Earlier this week, Weinstein was reportedly lawyering up to fight two “potentially explosive” stories about him. The New York Times published one of those stories on Thursday.

Titled “Decades of Sexual Harassment Accusations Against Harvey Weinstein,” the piece details damning accusations from Weinstein’s current and former employees and associates, as well as actress Ashley Judd.

Judd described an encounter with Weinstein in which he “sent her up to his [hotel] room, where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or she could watch him shower.”

The Times report contains a number of other accusations, including the claim that Weinstein reportedly enforced a code of silence in regards to his behavior and reached an undisclosed settlement with actress Rose McGowan. (McGowan did not comment in the article, but she seemingly responded to the report on Twitter.)

Weinstein did not deny the allegations against him, though he did release a statement addressing the reports.

“I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it. Though I’m trying to do better, I know I have a long way to go,” he said. “I so respect all women and regret what happened.”

“I cannot be more remorseful about the people I hurt and I plan to do right by all of them,” he added.

The producer told the Times that he plans to take a leave of absence from his studio. Meanwhile, one of Weinstein’s attorneys, Charles Harder, told The Hollywood Reporter he is preparing a lawsuit against the Times on Weinstein’s behalf.

Harder said the Times story is “saturated with false and defamatory statements” and it “relies on mostly hearsay accounts and a faulty report.”"

Fast forward to present day where in one given school district hundreds of classrooms are equipped with electronic chalkboards, students are taking quizzes online and printing 3D models, others walk the halls toting laptops. And yet, just over the county line, at a different middle school, they lack the basic technology to access Wikipedia, to write a term paper, to research a news item. There are no laptops and, at best, shared computers. There may even be no access to the internet. This is the reality for hundreds of thousands of students across America; this is the digital divide.

From Without A Net: The Digital Divide In America courtesy of Moxie Firecracker Films Kids wait for their computers to buffer but, without connectivity, they are unable to complete their assignments.

By the year 2020, approximately 77% of all U.S jobs will require computer skills, leaving thousands of students out of America’s digital future. When I spoke with people about the film that I was making with Verizon on the digital divide, about how millions of kids do not have access to computers or the internet, they assumed I was making a documentary about schools abroad. They believed that such a situation would only occur in developing countries within Africa or Asia. When I told them that this was happening in their own backyards, they were shocked. But the sad truth is that this is happening all across America, primarily in poor school districts in public schools in every state kids are being left behind.

For years the public school system has worked this way, favoring the wealthy and systematically disempowering the poor. School districts across the nation continue to be separated by tax bracket, limiting the distribution of wealth across the region. And while some schools may own computers, many lack the resources to train their teachers on how to use and implement technology in the classroom, resulting in hundreds of unused iPads and laptops collecting dust in hallway closets.

From Without A Net: The Digital Divide In America courtesy of Moxie Firecracker Films Frank Dalmas, Superintendent of Sto-Rox School District in Pennsylvania explains that the school cannot use the stacks of laptops in their closet, because the school district doesn't have WiFi.

Why is this happening? I believe that we need to urge our elected officials and government agencies to do more. We need universal infrastructure to provide adequate technology for students. Additionally, general awareness of this issue is low, preventing communities from advocating for themselves and their children. As of now, grassroots organizations, nonprofits and private companies are leading all progressive initiatives.

Those of us who grew up before the digital age may not be aware of this chasm. In my generation classroom interactions were limited to teachers standing in front of the room with overhead projectors rehearsing multiplication tables. But education today requires a thorough and considered integration of technology and this changes the teaching model. For our kids to succeed, teachers must act almost as coaches, engaging with students, with tech in hand. Unfortunately, this presents a challenge not easily overcome and contains multiple steps to resolve the crisis.

From Without A Net: The Digital Divide In America courtesy of Moxie Firecracker Films Jameira Miller, a 12th grader in the William Penn School District in Pennsylvania, advocates for school funding equality.

The first step is awareness: our country must realize that our kids are being significantly left behind in terms of their education. The second step is connectivity: while children in our schools are unable to access the internet, our international counterparts in Asia, in Europe and across the globe have their students building robots and printing digital models to solve math problems. The third step is teacher training: in order to help our young people to succeed and, in turn, boost our global economy, we will need to give our students the qualified technological training and skills to fill the four million STEM jobs available.

If nothing else, I hope that our film, Without A Net, raises awareness of the complex problems that we face. If we do not act on this issue, the implications are stark: our future workforce will be unprepared to meet market demands – while students from Europe, Australia, Asia and South America will have received advanced technological educations. Our children, our economy and our country will fall behind. But, if we do take the necessary steps to solve this issue, we will be providing students with a future filled with possibility, we will be taking real steps towards leveling the playing field, we will be working to rebuild the American Dream.

From Without A Net: The Digital Divide In America courtesy of Moxie Firecracker Films Thomas Hager, who is an 11th Grader in Kentucky, absolutely believes that ""We can teach coalminers to code.""

Let’s join together today to find solutions for these challenges. Now is the time. All of our futures depend upon it."

John Lewis (D-Ga.) does not consider the presidency of Donald Trump “legitimate,” he said in an interview with NBC News that appeared Friday.

“I don’t see this president-elect as a legitimate president,” Lewis told Chuck Todd, host of NBC’s “Meet The Press.” “I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected and they have destroyed the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.”

Lewis added that he believes there was a conspiracy “on the part of the Russians and others” to help Trump get elected.

“That’s not right, that’s not fair, that’s not the open democratic process,” he said.

Intelligence officials briefed Trump last week on their findings that Russia had interfered in the election with the intention of helping his candidacy. Trump has begrudgingly accepted that some kind of activity took place, he said during a press conference earlier this week, but he’s continued to dismiss the idea that foreign meddling actually affected the outcome of the election.

Lewis also said that he will not attend Trump’s inauguration, and that it will be the first one he’s missed since his election to Congress in 1986.

“You cannot be at home with something that you feel is wrong,” Lewis said.

Trump responded to Lewis’ comments Saturday via his favored means of communication, Twitter:

Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to...... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017

mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-conflict-of-interest_us_582f578be4b058ce7aaaf3c0,"['Paul Blumenthal', 'Reporter']",2016-11-19 08:10:00-05:00,[],,"WASHINGTON ? The biggest potential conflict of interest for President-elect Donald Trump sits about half a mile away from the White House: The Trump International Hotel.

The Pennsylvania Avenue property occupies a federal building that the Trump Organization leases from the General Services Administration, one of the federal agencies that he will oversee come January.

Having a U.S. president operating a hotel that advertises his name in giant letters on a government-owned building flies in the face of the federal prohibition of government employees holding government contracts, not to mention long-standing norms for preventing conflicts of interest. In fact, the 60-year lease agreement between the GSA and the Trump Organization plainly states that “no … elected official of the Government of the United States … shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.”

It appears that neither the Trump Organization nor the GSA has planned for this situation. Neither responded to The Huffington Post’s requests for comment.

Clear conflicts of interest already abound at the president-elect’s D.C. hotel. On Nov. 14, the Trump Organization refiled a lawsuit against the nation’s capital over its 2015 tax bill, arguing that it should be lowered. The company had previously filed suit over both its 2015 and 2016 tax bills in June, but that suit was thrown out of court in October because the tax assessment appeals for each year had to be filed separately.

City officials do not seem concerned that the lawsuit is now coming from the soon-to-be-president’s company. “We’ll handle this tax case like any other tax case,” said Rob Moruse, communications director for Washington D.C.’s attorney general, Karl Racine. “His new position does not change the legal equation.”

Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images Donald Trump's children will run his business empire while he serves as president. Their appointment to his transition team complicates this arrangement.

Next year, though, Trump will be in the position of appointing a new GSA director. The agency is required to enter into annual negotiations with the Trump Organization over the terms of its lease. The lease terms could include everything from the property assessment to tax issues like the historic preservation tax break the company has applied for.

At that point, Trump says he’ll set up as a “blind trust” and leave his three oldest children in charge of the company. The problem is, this setup is in no way a blind trust under any possible definition; Trump knows exactly what he owns and he knows who has invested in it. And while his children may be managing the business, he is still a beneficiary ? and they are also members of his presidential transition team.

Ethics and government contracting experts believe this setup creates an immediate and irreconcilable conflict of interest. “It’s not only unprecedented and improper, but it’s also horrible from an optics standpoint, in terms of conflicts of interest for the president of the United States to have a massive contract with an agency that reports directly to him,” said Steve Schooner, a procurement law professor at George Washington University Law School.

Schooner, a former government contracting official at the Department of Justice and the Office of Management and Budget, said it appears that neither the GSA nor the Trump Organization has a solution to this problem. He thinks that there is almost no way for the GSA to accommodate this arrangement and should just plan to cancel the lease on or before Trump’s inauguration.

It’s not only unprecedented and improper, but it’s also horrible from an optics standpoint, in terms of conflicts of interest. Steve Schooner, George Washington University Law School

Government contracts normally contain a clause specifying that the government retains the right to terminate the contract at its convenience; Trump’s is unique in that it does not. Still, the government has the right to terminate the lease for default despite the fact that it’s not stated explicitly in the contract.

Trump could always sue for breach of contract if this happens. Yet while the government would likely have to pay monetary damages to Trump, it would allow the agency to get out of a massive potential conflict of interest ? and certainly the glaring appearance of a conflict.

“In the end, it’s just a frigging lease,” Schooner said. “If GSA wants to terminate it tomorrow, the only thing Trump can do is sue and get money damages. That’s a price worth paying.”

Another way around the conflict would be for Trump to sell or gift his company to his children, said Richard Painter, a former top ethics official for President George W. Bush’s administration. But Trump hasn’t indicated that he has any interest in doing this, and may have to pay a hefty gift tax. Even if he did, the children’s role on the transition team ? which Painter described as “shocking” ? would still create an obvious appearance of a conflict of interest.

Trump isn’t likely to give up his new hotel in D.C. without a fight. He visited the hotel repeatedly during his presidential campaign, even hosting an absurd and controversial press conference there where he lied about his role in disseminating falsehoods about President Barack Obama’s birthplace.

Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call Donald Trump appeared at the Trump International Hotel in D.C. in September to lie about his role in promoting the birther myth about President Barack Obama.

The fears about conflicts of interest over this lease are well-founded. Aside from a tax lawsuit, the Trump Organization has already changed elements of its lease contract with GSA several times since it was first signed in 2012. The company had to change its financial backer after its original investor fell through. After the original architect ? a major supporter of historical preservation in Washington D.C. ? was removed, the Trump Organization subbed in a new architect. This brought on fights with the agency over design changes that officials said no longer preserved or showcased the building’s historical features, BuzzFeed reported earlier this year.

The Trump Organization could seek to renegotiate its contract any number of ways while its primary beneficiary sits just up the street in the White House. Then there are the enforcement questions: If the Trump Organization, for example, does not submit its annual financial documents on time, or if its financial documents need to be audited, GSA employees would face a direct confrontation with the president’s children, who will be running a corporation with his name on it."

Working Late Or Retiring Early: Which Is The Healthy Option? Studies have shown that retirement is linked to less physical activity, changes in dietary patterns (eating less fresh fruit and vegetables for example), more alcohol consumption and less social interaction.

The happy hour may start earlier, lunch may linger and that early morning brisk walk for the train we have lost, may eliminate our day's dose of strenuous exercise.

No Hope For Young People From Hapless Hammond The reality is that young people in this country have felt the brunt of seven years of Tory austerity.

Incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus warned the head of the Office of Government Ethics on Sunday to “be careful” in his criticisms of President-elect Donald Trump.

OGE Director Walter Shaub last week panned Trump’s plan to address his business conflicts as “meaningless,” marking the second time the director called on the president-elect to fully divest his assets before he assumes the presidency this week.

“The head of the government ethics ought to be careful because that person is becoming extremely political,” Priebus said on ABC News’ “This Week.”

The outgoing chairman of the Republican National Committee further suggested that Shaub supported Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.

“So I’m not sure what this person at government ethics, what sort of standing he has any more in giving these opinions,” he said.

Shaub’s extraordinary decision to speak out drew the ire of Republicans. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, accused Shaub of “blurring the line between public relations and official ethics guidance” in a letter Thursday.

During a separate appearance Sunday on “This Week,” Chaffetz further called into question Shaub’s statements, claiming he had “never done an investigation and never looked at the paperwork in the point where he can actually come to a reasonable conclusion.”

Asked whether he, as chair of the House Oversight Committee, would look into Trump’s conflicts of interest around the world, Chaffetz said he had “no plans to do that at this point.”"

One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn’t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.

The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.”"

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/article177823806.html,"['Ryan Lillis', 'Molly Sullivan', 'Ellen Garrison', 'Hudson Sangree']",,[],,"Wildfires driven by powerful winds tore through Northern California’s famed wine country Monday, killing at least 10, leveling neighborhoods and forcing thousands of residents to grab what they could and flee from fast-moving walls of flames.

Two huge fires in Sonoma and Napa counties were part of a series of blazes that raged across the north state, from Yuba and Nevada counties in the east to Mendocino and Lake counties in the west. Cal Fire Chief Ken Pimlott said bone-dry conditions and high winds combined to whip sparks into firestorms.

“To be honest, pretty much anywhere in the state today (is threatened), and that’s not an exaggeration,” Pimlott said at a midday news conference.

Santa Rosa, a city of 175,000 in central Sonoma County, experienced some of the worst urban damage from a wildfire in Northern California since the massively destructive Oakland Hills fire of October 1991, which resulted in the loss of 25 lives and 2,900 structures.

In the early morning hours Monday, the 27,000-acre Tubbs fire raced down the hillsides above Santa Rosa and struck the flat, densely populated landscape of the northern city. It jumped across Highway 101, destroying hundreds of homes. It burned down a Kmart store, a Trader Joe’s market and a McDonald’s restaurant. And it engulfed a large Hilton hotel in towering flames.

Fires continued to rage throughout the day, with huge plumes of black smoke suddenly erupting from commercial buildings and homes. Fire crews raced to each new emergency, pouring water onto rooftops. The northern part of the city was a post-apocalyptic scene of deserted streets, smoldering ruins and wailing sirens. Thick smoke hung in the air.

“It’s challenging in this urban environment because it’s really like a firestorm inside,” Pimlott said. All of the combustible materials in a city function as fuel, he said. As of midday Monday, firefighting efforts had focused largely on saving lives by evacuating residents ahead of the blazes.

At a mobile home park in Santa Rosa called Journey’s End, around 100 homes were razed by the fire, leaving twisted metal skeletons. Next door, about 130 patients at Kaiser Permanente Santa Rosa Medical Center were evacuated as flames and smoke from the burning mobile homes lit the night sky. Patients at Sutter Health’s medical center in Santa Rosa were also evacuated.

“An evacuation of this magnitude is unprecedented,” said Deborah Burger, a nurse at the Kaiser hospital and president of the California Nurses Association. “This is really pretty devastating.”

A number of hospital employees had lost their homes in the fires, including a nurse who was in Puerto Rico as a volunteer assisting hurricane victims, Burger said. Patients were taken to hospitals in San Rafael, Sacramento and other locations, she said.

In the Coffey Park neighborhood, where block after block of homes had been reduced to rubble, Michael Singh, 33, walked his family’s dog. He said his brother woke him up pounding on his bedroom door at 3 a.m. before their family’s house was leveled. They raced away, with every house on fire and the sky raining burning embers, he said.

“There was a crazy wind, and it smelled like death,” Singh said. “The fire was overpowering.”

He said he’d long been expecting a natural disaster, but not a wildfire in the flat, landscaped tract of suburban houses that his family and many others had called home for the past 30 years.

“I’ve been waiting for an earthquake,” Singh said. “Fire was never something I expected.”

Nearby, Chris Cortese poked through the remains of his parents’ home looking for pieces of his mother’s prized collection of sad-faced clowns. He kept finding the clowns’ arms and legs amid the debris.

“Little things you pass by everyday, you don’t even notice it, and then you see it like this and it means something,” he said.

Many evacuees from Coffey Park ended up in the Red Cross evacuation shelter in the Finley Community Center, about three miles south of the devastated neighborhood. Residents of two convalescent homes had been brought there, too. Elderly residents slept in wheelchairs, Red Cross blankets draped over their faces, or laid in cots in darkened rooms.

Shelter manager Roy Pitts said volunteers and workers had served over 700 breakfasts Monday morning.

Standing by his pickup truck in the parking lot of the evacuation center, Leo Langer, 77, said he and his wife got an automated call telling them to evacuate at 1:30 a.m. and looked out to see that all of their neighbors’ lights were on. They grabbed their cat and medications, and Leo got some beer and wine from the fridge, before they left their home. Langer thought it had probably been destroyed.

The Langers live in the Fountaingrove neighborhood, in the hills above the flatlands of Santa Rosa, where the sprawling Hilton Sonoma Wine Country hotel burned to the ground. Another hotel in the area was also reported destroyed.

In Glen Ellen, a picturesque village in Sonoma County’s wine country, the 5,000-acre Nuns fire barreled downhill and cut a swath through homes, sparing one, incinerating another. Firefighters protected the center of the historic town, where wineries and estates line the hills east of Santa Rosa.

Many homeowners faced an early-morning nightmare.

As a wall of flames sprinted toward Highway 12 in Glen Ellen early Monday, Mike Turpin made a decision: He was going to stay and try to save his home of nine years.

“I stayed up all night fighting that fire,” Turpin said. “That was quite a show.”

Turpin watered the trees around his house, ripped out a dry wooden fence with his bare hands and stamped out spot fires with a shovel. Seven other homes that share a driveway with Turpin’s were destroyed.

“Someone was looking out for me,” Turpin said.

The Tubbs and Nuns fires were two of seven large infernos that ravaged the forested hills and lush valleys north of the San Francisco Bay on Sunday and Monday. Seven people were confirmed dead in Sonoma County alone, authorities said.

Firefighters had no containment on the Tubbs fire, which continued to threaten Santa Rosa as of Monday evening. Officials imposed a curfew in mandatory evacuation areas Monday night from sunset to sunrise.

Further north, the Redwood Complex of fires in Mendocino County had consumed around 19,000 acres as of Monday night, killing at least one person and seriously injuring two others, fire officials said.

The Atlas fire quickly spread to 25,000 acres northeast of the city of Napa and south of Lake Berryessa, killing two people, Cal Fire officials said. The Patrick fire west of Napa consumed at least 3,000 acres. The Pocket fire near Geyserville burned 1,000 acres. The Sulphur fire in Lake County charred 2,500 acres in a county devastated by the Valley fire in 2015, the third most destructive in state history based on structures burned.

In Monday’s fires, officials estimated that at least 1,500 structures had been destroyed and 20,000 residents had been evacuated.

Pimlott, the Cal Fire chief, said high winds and low humidity started the rash of fires around the same time. The conditions meant every spark – from a power line, a vehicle or another source – could potentially ignite a fire in dry vegetation.

“Under these kinds of conditions, the risk is just extreme of new starts, and that’s literally what happened last night and this morning,” Pimlott said Monday. “The planets literally aligned to have these explosive conditions.”

Pimlott said wildfires in Northern California seemed to have gotten worse in recent years, citing 2015’s destructive blazes – the Valley fire in Lake and Napa counties and the Butte fire in Amador and Calaveras counties.

“It’s not uncommon to have multiple fires burning, but I can certainly tell you it’s becoming more the norm now to have multiple damaging fires like we’re seeing today,” he said.

“I think what we’re going to find, when we talk to seasoned fire professionals here in the next several days, is they’re going to talk about conditions that they have not seen before,” Pimlott said.

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article177744986.html#storylink=mainstage,"['Greg Gordon', 'Peter Stone', 'Mcclatchy Washington Bureau']",,[],,"Russia has exploited social media networks to target current and former U.S. military personnel with propaganda, conspiracy theories and other misinformation, achieving “significant and persistent interactions” over Twitter during a one-month period last spring, a British research team found.

The Oxford University study, which traced the reach of three websites with clear ties to the Russian government, adds a new dimension to revelations of a Kremlin cyber campaign aimed at undermining Americans’ trust in democracy during last year’s U.S. elections and helping Donald Trump win the presidency.

“We’ve found an entire ecosystem of junk news about national security issues that is deliberately crafted for U.S. veterans and active military personnel,” said Philip Howard, a professor of internet studies who led the research. “It’s a complex blend of content with a Russian view of the world – wild rumors and conspiracies.”

This is further evidence of the Kremlin’s holistic effort to try to get inside the minds, computers and communications of our forces to steal information on things such as the locations and deployment schedules of specific military units and to conduct psy-ops against our troops. Mike Carpenter, former senior Pentagon official and Russia specialist

However, the study found that Russia’s communication inroads with the military community on Twitter “are not presently very deep,” and that it has had more success gaining influence through Twitter than Facebook.

The researchers sought to map how social media amplified the impact of these websites that sprang up over the last four years:

–Veteranstoday.com, which in late 2013 began publishing content from New Eastern Outlook, a geopolitical journal of the government-chartered Russian Academy of Sciences.

–Veteransnewsnow.com, a sister site that started posting information from the Moscow think tank Strategic Culture Foundation during the same time period.

–Southfront.org, which was registered in Moscow in 2015 and soon partnered with Veterans Today.

Politico first reported last June about Russia’s recent military targeting, describing how Veterans Today mixed advice for veterans on how to find jobs and pay medical bills with headlines such as “Ukraine’s Ku Klux Klan — NATO’s New Ally.” It said that while the United States confronted Syrian leader Bashar al Assad, a Russian ally, over chemical weapons attacks on Syrian children last spring, the site carried a story headlined: “Proof: Turkey Did 2013 Sarin Attack and Did This One Too.”

Mike Carpenter, a former senior Pentagon official who specialized in issues surrounding Russia, said the three web sites all “appear to be Russian fronts, given the high degree of Russian content.”

“[T]hey bill themselves as providing ‘alternative points of view,’ similar to Russian propaganda channels like RT and Sputnik,” he said.

Facebook disclosed last month that a company tied to a Russian “troll farm,” where operatives use cyber skills to spread misinformation, set up fake accounts that bought 3,000 election-related ads. It said 75 percent of the ads, which the company said may have popped up in the Facebook newsfeeds of as many as 10 million people, focused on divisive issues such as immigration, gun rights and gay rights.

The Kremlin’s global “active measures” campaigns have showered disinformation on democracies around the globe since the Soviet era. But newer social media tools have enabled explosive growth of networks dedicated to distributing false and misleading news.

The Oxford study categorized 12,413 Twitter users and 11,103 Facebook users whose social media messages referred to or carried content from one or more of the Russian-linked websites between April 2 and May 2, 2017. The researchers used sophisticated modeling in an attempt to examine how tweets and “likes” of Facebook posts broadened the effects of junk and phony news on the three sites, sometimes directly connecting the recipients with Russian trolls.

“On Twitter there are significant and persistent interactions between current and former military personnel and a broad network of Russia-focused accounts, conspiracy theory-focused accounts and European right-wing accounts,” the researchers concluded.

The interactions are an indication that the messages are being noticed and may be having some impact.

In the networks reaching vets and active duty troops, the researchers wrote, both liberals and conservatives were drawn to posts on the websites that laid out supposed conspiracies, including some pointed at the U.S. government.

The researchers noted that they couldn’t track all of the relevant content, in part because the limited data publicly available from Twitter and Facebook does not include fake accounts that the two companies detected and closed.

Spokespeople for Twitter and Facebook declined to comment on the study.

Carpenter said that under President Vladimir Putin, the Kremlin’s propaganda machine “has become very good at targeting specific demographics and subgroups within American society, with tailored content in order to sow discord and undermine trust in government.”

He said the “information warfare” meshes with Russian “spear phishing attacks” – attempts to compromise the emails of U.S. service members and military contractors.

“This is further evidence of the Kremlin’s holistic effort to try to get inside the minds, computers and communications of our forces to steal information on things such as the locations and deployment schedules of specific military units and to conduct psy-ops (psychological operations) against our troops.”

Howard, who has tracked Russia’s use of social media to circulate propaganda in dozens of countries, and research colleague Bence Kollanyi, wrote in an op ed in the Washington Post on Friday that their studies have been handicapped because of the lack of cooperation from Twitter and Facebook.

“No doubt, Twitter and Facebook have higher-quality data on all this,” they wrote. “They certainly employ some of the best network analysts and data scientists in the world. Yet it has taken an FBI inquiry, congressional investigations, nearly a year of bad press and pressure from outside researchers such as us to dislodge some examples of Russian interference.”

“The next step should be open collaborations that explain network effects and help restore public trust in social media.”

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/mcclatchys-america/article175220256.html,['Jonathan Shorman'],,[],,"Companies that employ thousands of Wichitans may face a choice in the not-so-distant future: Keep jobs here or move them elsewhere.

Kansas is thirsty for skilled workers – the kind that work at Spirit AeroSystems or Textron Aviation – but it can’t find enough.

The shortage becomes more urgent each year as baby boomers grow older and retire. Over time, it threatens economic growth here.

How the state responds may affect your ability to get a job in the future.

Right now, you may be able to quickly find a good-paying job, if you’re able to work in fields like advanced manufacturing and other technical industries. But if companies don’t come to Kansas, or don’t expand because they can’t hire enough workers, that will leave fewer options for all workers eventually.

“Are we doing everything we can do in the state of Kansas to backfill those jobs so that Spirit, Textron and other major employers don’t have to make a choice between Wichita and other operations they have around the world?” said Gary Plummer, president and CEO of the Wichita Regional Chamber of Commerce.

The Eagle spoke to more than a dozen business, civic and state leaders who say that too often the workers that could fill these jobs just aren’t here or lack the necessary skills. They advocate an array of steps to combat the problem, from more technical education to better-targeted tax incentives.

Kansas had close to 45,000 job vacancies in 2016 – or more openings than the entire population of Hutchinson. That’s according to the latest available survey by the state Department of Labor, which looked at vacancies in the second quarter of the year.

For every 100 jobs, about 3.2 were vacant, according to the survey. A full half of the vacancies either lasted more than 30 days or were always open.

Kansas’ labor force has shrunk from more than 1,525,000 in 2009 to about 1,480,000 today. The labor force nationwide has grown during the same time.

The state’s unemployment rate stands at a low 3.9 percent.

The shortage of trained workers is likely to surface as an issue in the 2018 governor’s race – and in the next legislative session – as candidates and lawmakers debate how to spur economic growth.

“We need more people moving into Kansas,” Gov. Sam Brownback said recently.

“It’s not going to do any good to bring companies in if they can’t get staffed,” said Sen. Julia Lynn, a Republican who chairs the Senate commerce committee.

Companies look for help

The problem affects companies large and small.

Spirit AeroSystems employs more than 10,000 in Wichita. A full 40 percent of that workforce will be eligible for retirement within five years, said Justin Welner, the company’s vice president for human resources.

“This is the topic that keeps me up at night,” Welner said. “Because we are experiencing a gap in terms of finding people with the experience we would typically require.”

The company may need to hire thousands within the next few years just to keep pace with attrition. Right now, there are not enough people here to do it.

Spirit is recruiting nationally to make up the difference and sometimes has to put new hires through intensive training that adds costs.

Drew Parish runs Air Solutions Heating and Cooling in Wichita. He grew the company from a one-man show to a four-person operation in three years and he wants to keep expanding. Help is hard to find, though, as he found out this year when he tried to find more employees for his repair and service business.

“We couldn’t get a good applicant in, no matter what avenues we were trying. There just weren’t the qualified applicants,” Parish said.

Someone starting out with no experience can expect to make $10 to $12 an hour, while a moderately experienced employee will bring in $18 to $20, he said. High-experience workers earn $26 an hour or more.

Finding a skilled workforce has been the top concern expressed by members of the Wichita Regional Chamber of Commerce for the last four to five years, Plummer said.

Wichita needs to keep talent flowing into the state to keep the city and Kansas attractive to businesses, he said.

“It’s holding back economic growth, I believe, in this state because those jobs are not always being filled,” Plummer said.

Focus on education

So how can Kansas find and keep enough workers – particularly those with technical skills that are in demand?

The state faces dual challenges. It must both train its own residents for these jobs and attract workers from elsewhere.

To lure Kansans to enter these trades, more emphasis is needed on vocational and technical training, some say.

“Everyone’s going to four-year colleges, which is very admirable, but it’s leaving this industry … at a loss,” said Parish, who runs the heating and cooling company.

Nearly 75 percent of the more than 8,300 vacancies in south-central Kansas last year required some type of training or education. About 10 percent required vocational training.

In south-central Kansas, 24 percent of job vacancies had no education requirements in 2016, down from 36 percent in 2008.

Education must adapt, says interim Kansas Commerce Secretary Nick Jordan.

“There’s going to have to be an adjustment in the education system ... to a certain extent, to get the system adjusted to the skills – educating kids to what’s needed in today’s economy,” he said.

Kansas has a program that allows high school students to qualify for state-paid tuition in some technical and community college courses. The number taking part rose from about 6,101 when it started in 2012 to 10,275 in the 2014-2015 year before falling to 10,023 last year.

Some lawmakers and business leaders say the program needs better funding.

The Kansas State Department of Education has also launched a redesign of K-12 schools meant to value and support students who choose to pursue technical careers as much as those who go to college. A handful of districts are redesigning now as part of a pilot project.

Mark Tallman, a lobbyist with the Kansas Association of School Boards, said a perception still exists in Kansas, and other states, that students should attend college even if they may want to go in a different direction.

“There’s more social prestige in those areas, but what we find is kids – they start in that area but if you don’t have the preparation and the interest, you drop out, you aren’t retained and then maybe you’re kind of out of the system,” Tallman said. “We know that’s an issue.”

Tam Nguyen is one 18-year-old who opted not to go to a traditional four-year college.

Nguyen, who emigrated from Vietnam three years ago, chose to enter the aviation maintenance program at Wichita Area Technical College.

She wants to someday work for the aircraft manufacturer Textron Aviation.

The idea of helping build safe airplanes appeals to her – as does the possibility of a good-paying job without amassing college debt.

“I feel important, I feel special in doing it – happy,” Nguyen said.

Still, Kansas is also interested in retaining people who have college degrees. Rep. Brandon Whipple, the ranking Democrat on the House commerce committee, said Kansas has to reverse its “brain drain.”

“Our number one export in Wichita and possibly all of Kansas is highly educated young people,” Whipple said.

Kansas needs to work to bring jobs to the state that will appeal to young people, said Jordan, the commerce secretary.

“We have to start attracting companies that the kids will enjoy working for,” Jordan said, mentioning Amazon, which is seeking a site for its second headquarters. The Brownback administration is promoting the Kansas City area as a potential location.

Incentives questioned

Tax incentives often play a role in luring companies to the state, but some businesses want the state to explore new types of programs.

Welner, the Spirit executive, suggested Kansas should look at relocation incentives to assist workers moving to the state to take a job.

Parish, the owner of Air Solutions, wishes Kansas had an apprenticeship tax credit that would make it easier to hire people without experience and put in the time needed to train them.

Some lawmakers want a greater focus on the kind of jobs that incentives are bringing to Kansas.

“Are those the kind of jobs we want to have? Are those jobs that have a good wage? Are they jobs that can attract high school and post-high school people that have some experience?” Lynn said.

Recent efforts to bring a new Tyson Foods plant to Kansas have highlighted these concerns.

Tyson announced plans to build a $320 million poultry complex near Tonganoxie, northeast of Lawrence. Tyson says the plant would generate 1,600 jobs.

But the company put its plans on hold after the county government rescinded an offer to issue revenue bonds to help finance the project amid intense local opposition.

The Kansas Department of Commerce already faces legislative scrutiny over how it deploys its economic development programs. Kansas has to balance what companies to pursue, and what companies are coming after Kansas, when making decisions about incentives, Jordan said.

“And certainly, we’re after those (companies) that have the high skills, best paying jobs,” Jordan said.

“We’re not going to turn somebody down if they come in and they have a manufacturing plant that’s not paying $100,000 a year. We’re not going to turn them down, and the programs can help them, too.”

Quality of life important

Quality of life also plays a key role in attracting people to the state. That includes the type of jobs available, but also good schools, low crime and other amenities.

Kansas and other Great Plains states can face trouble in keeping workers because labor is more mobile in these states than elsewhere in the country, said Kenneth Kriz, a economist at Wichita State University.

That makes quality of life considerations all the more important.

“When people lose a job in this part of the world, they leave. If they lose a job living in California or something, they may choose to stick it out and try and find another job there first,” Kriz said.

The state also needs to do a better job promoting itself, lawmakers say. Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, said the state needs to start telling the “good story” about its people and the opportunity here.

Nguyen, the Wichita Area Technical College student, is already convinced. She said ultimately working in aviation maintenance in Wichita will help her earn a good wage while staying close to family.

“Take the opportunity and make a better future,” Nguyen said.

Security Council Thursday gave the go-ahead to Britain and France — backed by the U.S. and at least two Arab nations — to launch airstrikes to enforce a no fly zone over Libya and to protect civilians in rebel-held areas from forces loyal to dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

The resolution authorized the enforcement of a no-fly zone over the embattled North African nation of 6.3 million, a measure designed to ground the aircraft that have given Gadhafi's forces a considerable edge over their ragtag opponents of armed civilians and military defectors.Jubilant crowds in Benghazi, the eastern city of some 1 million people where the rebellion against Gadhafi erupted a month ago, greeted the news with cheers and fireworks.

The U.S., France, Britain — three of the five veto-wielding permanent council members, and seven other countries approved the resolution, which passed by one vote more than was required. China and Russia, the two other permanent members, and three other nations abstained. There were no votes against it.

Airstrikes were expected against dozens of Libyan air defense missile sites to eliminate threats to planes enforcing the no-fly zone.The resolution's key provision also authorized countries enforcing the zone ""to take all necessary measures . . . to protect civilians and civilian populated areas under threat of attack . . . including Benghazi,"" but it ruled out a foreign occupation force ""of any form on any part of Libyan territory.""

That wording permits airstrikes to prevent Gadhafi's forces from overrunning Benghazi and other cities and towns that rose up in mid-February against the Arab world's longest ruling leader, inspired by the pro-democracy revolts in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt.

The resolution also called for an immediate cease-fire and tightened sanctions against the Libyan regime by expanding an asset freeze that the U.S. has already used to sequester more than $32 billion linked to Gadhafi and his inner circle.

Thousands of people are believed to have been wounded and killed in what has evolved into a civil war that has helped drive up world oil prices. Gadhafi's forces, backed by tanks and aircraft, have retaken since last week all but one rebellious city in western Libya and a series of eastern towns overrun by the rebels, whose leadership is based in Benghazi.

The resolution's passage appeared certain when China and Russia, which initially expressed reservations, agreed to abstain after the language excluding a ""military occupation"" of Libya was inserted.

""Today the Security Council has responded to the Libyan people's cry for help,"" Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, told the council following the vote.

""Colonel Gadhafi and those who still stand by him continue to grossly and systematically abuse the most fundamental human rights of Libya's people. On March 12, the League of Arab States called on the Security Council to establish a no-fly zone and take other measures to protect civilians,"" she said. ""Today's resolution is a powerful response to that call and to the urgent needs on the ground.""

In a highly unusual move aimed at underscoring the urgency of the issue, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe flew to New York from Paris for the vote.

As the 15-seat council deliberated last-minute changes to the resolution, Gadhafi vowed to unleash a final assault on Benghazi and show ""no mercy"" to his opponents.

""We are coming tonight,"" Gadhafi declared in a state-run radio address greeted by defiant jeers and gunfire volleys from hundreds of people listening in the main square of Benghazi, Libya's second largest city. ""All free people should surround the traitors and attack them to take control.""

Britain and France, along with two unnamed Arab countries, were preparing to enforce the no-fly zone, said a European diplomat, adding that it could take ""between 24 and 48 hours"" for the operation to begin.

At least two Arab nations also agreed to participate, according to the European diplomat and a U.S. official, and discussions were ongoing with other governments in the region.

They declined, however, to identify the Arab countries that would take part. One was believed to be the United Arab Emirates, the federation of pro-West oil-producing sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf.

The U.S. also will participate, but the extent of the American role was still being decided by President Barack Obama, according to the U.S. official who asked not to be further identified in order to talk about the issue.

""This is an ongoing discussion,"" he said.

Speaking at the end of a visit to Tunisia, which borders Libya to the northwest, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that the options under consideration by the U.S. included the use of unmanned drones, bombing Libyan air defenses to help enforce the no-fly zone, and arming the Libyan rebels.

With U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his Republican critics casting him as a big government spender as he prepares to run for re-election, Obama has gone to great lengths to avoid giving the U.S. a leading role in another costly foreign military intervention in a part of the world where anti-American sentiments are already high.

Yet after repeatedly condemning Gadhafi's assaults on peaceful protests that ignited the revolt and demanding that the dictator step down, Obama was under pressure to authorize some form of U.S. participation. Otherwise, he risked being flayed for inaction and timidity by his GOP critics and by the demonstrators he has been praising for their largely peaceful challenge to the ruling order in other Arab nations.

Sens. John McCain, Joe Lieberman and John Kerry issued a joint statement Thursday night supporting the U.N. resolution.

""We must immediately work with our friends in the Arab League and in NATO to enforce this resolution and turn the tide before it is too late,"" the senators said. ""We must also build a bipartisan consensus here at home to support the President in taking the swift and decisive measures necessary to stop Qaddafi.""

Robert E. Hunter, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, said that Western powers would have little difficulty carrying out airstrikes against Libyan targets.

French jets can fly from bases in France without needing to refuel, Hunter said, and the U.S. military maintains significant air assets in Italy that could help with refueling or surveillance operations.

Britain maintains an airbase on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, while the U.S. also has airbases on the Mediterranean island of Crete and in Turkey. The U.S. also has two helicopter-carrying amphibious assault vessels in the Mediterranean that could participate in humanitarian aid deliveries.

""There's no lack of capacity to do it,"" said Hunter, a senior adviser with the Rand Corporation, a research group. ""It's been a problem of political will.""

Hunter said that he expected Libyan pilots to stop flying missions with the declaration of the no-fly zone. But it wasn't clear if British or French commanders would direct strikes against Libyan air defense systems, as U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has said would be required to establish control of Libyan airspace.

One goal of a bombing campaign would be to scare some members of the Libyan military into abandoning Gadhafi, Hunter said. In the early days of the Libyan uprising, at least two Libyan pilots refused orders to fire on protesters and flew their jets to the Mediterranean island of Malta, but since then the military has seemed largely to follow Gadhafi's orders.

""Gadhafi has nothing to live for but to go all out,"" Hunter said. ""One tactic is to create an environment in which others will give up.""

In Benghazi, rebel officials insisted that their ragtag force of civilians and military defectors armed with weapons pilfered from Libyan army bases was holding off an advance by Gadhafi's better-trained and equipped troops on the strategic town of Ajdabiya, 100 miles to the south.Ajdabiya controls two major highways: One leads to Benghazi and other population centers along the eastern coast of the Gulf of Sidra; the second runs inland, straight across the desert to the border with Egypt. By controlling those routes, Gadhafi's forces would cut off the coastal towns and cities and could overrun each one in succession.

Many Benghazi residents dismissed the threat.

""For Benghazi, it is not too late,"" said Mohammed Amer, 46, speaking from one of Benghazi's few operating Internet cafes. ""There is no doubt that the international community's interference will help especially if they bomb his (Gadhafi's) military bases and troop concentrations.""

At the crash site of a war jet that they claimed to have shot down, young rebels cheered, even though it might have been a case of friendly fire. The aircraft had the pre-Gadhafi national flag revived by the rebels painted on its fuselage. Regardless, any sign of victory, even a false one, drew hundreds to the site near Benghazi airport.

Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country and Libya's neighbor to the east, has said it will not participate in military operations or help enforce a no-fly zone. Egypt has hundreds of thousands of citizens in Libya who might face retaliation from the Gadhafi regime and is dealing with political ferment of its own following the ouster last month of longtime president Hosni Mubarak.

The Obama administration's policy toward Libya shifted sharply this week, after the 22-member Arab League endorsed a no-fly zone over Libya, providing important political cover for the White House.

http://www.mcclatchydc.com/latest-news/article177771811.html,['Tim Johnson'],,[],,"As U.S. soldiers Sunday handed out dozens of boxes of emergency food and water rations in this coastal town, a federal relief official pronounced himself satisfied.

“They seem pretty happy right now. I think it’s going great,” said Patrick Hernandez, assistant administrator for field operations for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Just a few feet away, Serafin Roman looked through cyclone fencing at the distribution scene and offered a radically different view: “It’s nasty. People are desperate. They got no water.... Some people are starving.”

The scene put a vivid spotlight on the gap between some government views of relief efforts for Hurricane Maria, and a somewhat testier view on the street. In some corners of Puerto Rico, deep into the third week of recovery efforts, a smattering of Puerto Ricans said they feel forgotten and vulnerable. Residents and city officials often tell drastically different stories about the frequency of food distribution.

Responding to the evolving crisis, U.S. military officials spelled out Sunday how they will alter the distribution of food, water and fuel to many of the island’s 78 municipalities, militarizing relief efforts in a significant way as some mayors stumble on the job.

Prior to this weekend, relief supplies were delivered to 10 regional staging areas on the island, and mayors were largely responsible for arranging pick-up and distribution.

But Brig. Gen. Jose J. Reyes, assistant adjutant general of the Puerto Rico National Guard, said in an interview that a new strategy calls for placing 10 to 20 soldiers in each municipality, providing them with vehicles and logistical support, and tasking them with delivering relief to each neighborhood.

“We need to push it directly to the barrio to ensure that everyone’s getting it,” Reyes said. “They will have some vehicles. They will have radio communications as well as logistics support.... They are going to be living there. They are going to be operating 24/7.”

In Puerto Rico’s 10 largest cities, each with a population greater than 150,000 people, city halls will continue to manage distribution, Reyes said, but not so in the smaller towns.

The commander of relief efforts, Army Lt. Gen. Jeffrey S. Buchanan, acknowledged that distribution of aid on the municipal level has not always gone smoothly.

“We’re relentless in looking for areas that are bottlenecks,” Buchanan said at a San Juan airfield before boarding a helicopter for Aguadilla, some 80 miles to the west of the capital.

“We shouldn’t pretend that this is going to be pain-free,” he said, noting that mayors can feel a variety of constraints in delivering aid, from damaged roads and lack of vehicles to poor communications and large geographical areas with sparse population.

Some anger was palpable Sunday at the relief distribution scene in Aguadilla. But that sentiment of frustration is not uniform. Some municipalities are handling relief efforts much better than other ones. Among the hardest hit areas from the Sept. 20 hurricane, some are so remote that they require ongoing helicopter air-drops of food and water due to impassable roads.

“There are people who live up in the mountainous areas in the central region that are harder to get to, but we’re getting to all of them,” Hernandez, the FEMA official, said. U.S. military teams are “doing a phenomenal job with the road clearance.”

Hernandez downplayed the discontent voiced by some of the residents during Sunday’s relief activities, saying that all disaster survivors want to get their lives back to normal.

“Every survivor in a disaster feels that way,” he said.

Sheila Lenox, 29, said Sunday’s box of food was the first substantial aid she had seen.

“This is the first time here that they come with a nice box full of stuff for us,” said Lenox, who is unemployed. “We’ve been eating what our neighbors give us.”

Asked how she had survived, her partner, Jetson Samot, responded: “Sausage.”

“Sausage and crackers,” Lenox added.

“There’s no way for us to buy anything. The supermarkets, they upped the prices on everything. It’s hard for us to find any food. We have a place to live but we don’t have nothing to nurture our body with,” Lenox said.

Another resident, Carmen Santiago, a 67-year-old retiree, said she wished there was more discipline and logic in distribution to avoid having some residents take too much, and leaving others without.

“They should give a set amount to each apartment,” she said. “That way, no one takes too much. They take just what is due them.”

Told that some residents complained Sunday that it was the first delivery of any food or water to the district, Mayor Carlos Mendez disputed that.

“They’ve received it. I’ve come here three or four times before,” Mendez said.

Mendez said relief got off to a “slow start. But we’re doing good now.”

“Everybody’s thirsty, everybody’s hungry because they don’t get food every single day. But at least we take it to them every four or five days.”"

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Conroy/AP Michael Conroy/AP

Updated Monday 8:20 a.m. ET

President Trump on Monday defended Vice President Mike Pence's decision to walk out of Sunday's NFL game between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers in Indianapolis.

Trump tweeted, ""The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!""

The president's response comes amid suggestions by some media outlets and on social media that Pence's protest was a publicity stunt engineered by Trump.

The original story continues below

Vice President Pence was so offended by kneeling professional football players that he left a game Sunday between the Indianapolis Colts and the San Francisco 49ers.

""I left today's Colts game because President Trump and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem,"" Pence, a former governor of Indiana, said in a statement.

""While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, I don't think it's too much to ask NFL players to respect the Flag and our National Anthem,"" the statement opposing the protest continued. ""I stand with President Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem.""

But first, the moment was commemorated with a photo of himself and second lady Karen Pence while they stood, hand over hearts, for the anthem.

It appears the choice to leave did not belong to Pence or his wife alone. According to Trump, it was his idea.

""I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled, disrespecting our country,"" Trump tweeted, adding that he was proud of the couple.

Only members of the 49ers knelt for the rendition of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" — a symbol of protest not against the flag or the song but against institutional social injustice and the violence perpetrated by police against black men. Colts players stood, linked arm in arm.

The controversial practice of kneeling during the anthem was started by former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has yet to be signed to a new team after his contract with the 49ers expired last year.

In an on-camera report on Sunday, CBS reporter Jason La Canfora said Kaepernick would stand for the anthem if he was signed to an NFL team.

""He's not planning on kneeling ... and he's planning on standing for the anthem,"" La Canfora said.

But after the story began making headlines, La Canfora backtracked tweeting, ""Standing for Anthem wasn't something that I spoke to Colin about."" He was merely relaying what had already been reported about Kaepernick in other outlets, La Canfora wrote, adding, ""what he would do during the Anthem I do not know.""

Kaepernick has not denied La Canfora's claim outright, but he has been retweeting others who have responded to the CBS sports reporter. Among them is the quarterback's own girlfriend, Nessa Diab, who wrote, ""The reports that Colin will stand for the anthem are completely false! He has never discussed this with anyone.""

Howard Bryant, an ESPN Magazine columnist, also weighed in on Twitter with what he said was confirmation from Kaepernick.

""Just got a message from @Kaepernick7 who says he has not discussed with anyone his plans in the event he is signed by an NFL team,"" Bryant wrote.

The president has been railing against the NFL over the league's tolerance of the sustained demonstration. Trump has repeatedly called on team owners to fire all players who kneel during the national anthem.

At a campaign rally in Alabama last month, Trump shouted, ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b**** off the field right now'?"" he said to roaring applause.

The statement by the president, and the subsequent Twitter storm he unleashed, renewed a national debate over players' First Amendment rights and also pitted NFL owners and players against the president, inspiring many of them to kneel or link arms in the game that followed.

By walking out over the kneeling, Pence hasn't just stirred the stoked the flames of the controversy, it has also kicked up a new dust storm: criticism over the cost of the vice president's protest of the protest.

Hawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz was the first to raise the issue.

""Wait,"" Schatz wrote on Twitter. ""This was orchestrated to make a point? That's not an inexpensive thing to do."""

At 87, Dolores Huerta is a living civil rights icon. She has spent most of her life as a political activist, fighting for better working conditions for farmworkers and the rights of the downtrodden, a firm believer in the power of political organizing to effect change.

And yet, her role in the farmworkers movement has long been overshadowed by that of Cesar Chavez, her longtime collaborator and co-founder of what became the United Farm Workers of America union. That's true even when it comes to credit for coining the movement's famous slogan, Sí se puede — Spanish for ""Yes, we can"" — which inspired President Obama's own campaign battle cry and has often wrongly been attributed to Chavez. (Obama acknowledged Huerta as the source of that phrase when he awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2012. She talks about its origins below.)

Dolores, a new documentary from director Peter Bratt, aims to finally set the record straight. The film chronicles Huerta's evolution from a teenager outraged by the racial and economic injustices she saw in California's agricultural Central Valley to a key architect of the nationwide boycott of grapes that led to the first farmworker union contracts. At its height, an estimated 17 million people stopped buying grapes.

Huerta was 25 when she became the political director of the Community Service Organization, run by influential community organizer Fred Ross. That's where she met Chavez, and in 1962 the two teamed up to form what became the UFA, organizing farmworkers who toiled for wages as low as 70 cents an hour, in brutal conditions.

""They didn't have toilets in the fields, they didn't have cold drinking water. They didn't have rest periods,"" Huerta tells NPR.

In 1965, the grape workers struck, and Huerta was a leading organizer. She faced violence on the picket lines — and sexism from both the growers she was staring down and their political allies, and from within her own organization. At one point, a lawmaker is seen referring to Huerta as Chavez's ""sidekick."" At a time when the feminist movement was taking root, Huerta was an unconventional figure: the twice-divorced mother of 11 children. ""Who supports those kids when she's out on these adventures?"" one of her opponents is shown asking in historical footage.

Now grown, her children provide some of the most moving accounts in the film. They speak with great admiration for their mother, but are also candid about the price her tireless dedication to the cause exacted on the family. As one daughter puts it, ""The movement became her most important child.""

As she approaches nine decades of life, Huerta remains outspoken and indefatigable. Through her Dolores Huerta Foundation, she continues to work with agricultural communities, organizing people to run for office and advocating on issues of health, education and economic development.

Huerta recently stopped by NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she spoke to us about the new film, her life's work and her ongoing activism. Excerpts of our conversation are transcribed below, edited for brevity and clarity.

After the grape workers went on strike, you directed the national boycott of grapes. What kind of day-to-day conditions did farmworkers in the field face at that time?

Well, the conditions were terrible. The farmworkers were only earning about 70 cents an hour at that time — 90 cents was the highest wage that they were earning. They didn't have toilets in the fields, they didn't have cold drinking water. They didn't have rest periods. People worked from sunup to sundown. It was really atrocious. And families were so poor. I think that's one of the things that really infuriated me. When I saw people in their homes — they had dirt floors. And the furniture was orange crates and cardboard boxes. People were so incredibly poor and they were working so hard. And the children were [suffering from malnutrition] and very ill-clothed and ill-fed. I said, ""This is wrong,"" because you saw how hard they were working, and yet they were not getting paid anything.

One thing that struck me while watching the documentary was the violence directed against farmworkers during the strike. Were you subjected to this violence?

Oh, many times. We had violence directed at us by the growers themselves, trying to run us down by cars, pointing rifles at us, spraying the people when they were on the picket line with sulfur. And then we had violence by the Teamsters union with the goons that they hired at that time — and by the way, I have to say that the Teamsters union are OK today. [Editor's note: In 1970, the Teamsters union signed a deal with growers for access to organize farmworkers, undercutting the efforts of the United Farm Workers.] They came at us with two by fours. We had a lot of violence, definitely. And then I was beaten up by the police San Francisco [in 1988], which also is shown in the film. [During that incident, several of her ribs were broken and her recovery took months.]

In the documentary, we hear a lot of moving testimony from your children. And they obviously have a great deal of respect and admiration for you. But they also talk about the toll that the work took on the family when they were growing up. Was that something that weighed on you — the fact that you were very much a pioneer, but the time that you spent on activism meant time away from your children?

I think that's something that all mothers have to deal with, especially single mothers. We work and we have to leave the kids behind. And I think that's one of the reasons that we, not only as women but as families, we have to advocate for early childhood education for all of our children. To make sure that they're taken care of but also educated in the process. Because we do need women in civic life. We do need women to run for office, to be in political office. We need a feminist to be at the table when decisions are being made so that the right decisions will be made. But you know, actually, in the farmworkers union — and the film doesn't really show this — we always had a daycare for children. Because when we did this strike, and especially when all of the people went on the march to Sacramento, the women had to take over the picket lines.

Because the men were marching to Sacramento?

Yeah, the women had to take over the strike. The women had to run all the picket lines. They had to do all the work that we were doing in the strike.

Do you feel that women working in the fields faced special challenges when you were organizing?

Oh absolutely, especially on the issue of pesticides. Because you know, the pesticides in the fields really affect women even more than they do men. They affect children and they affect women more than they do men. But we have had so many women that have cancer, so many children have been born with deformities. And men also that have died because they were spraying pesticides in the field and they died of lung cancer. This is a really, really big issue to this day for farmworkers. Because even though we were able to get many of the pesticides banned, they keep inventing new ones. And it was actually just a couple of months ago that a group of farmworkers working in a field near Bakersfield were poisoned. And one of the pesticides that affected them was one that was recently taken off the restricted list by President Trump. [Editor's note: The Environmental Protection Agency, under President Obama, had concluded that the pesticide chlorpyrifos could pose a risk to consumers and proposed banning it. But a final decision was not made until March, when the Trump administration's EPA reversed course and said it would keep the pesticide on the market.]

One of things in the documentary that stayed with me is that you say that for a long time, you didn't think it was right to take credit for your work.

You know what? I've thought about that a lot. When we had our first constitutional convention for the National Farm Workers Association and we were having elections and Cesar [Chavez] was running the meeting, he stepped down from the dais and came up to me. He said, ""Who's going to nominate you for vice president?"" And I said, ""Oh, I don't have to be on the board. I just want to serve all the women out there."" How many of us have thought that way?

And he said, ""You're crazy."" So I did — I grabbed somebody to nominate me. But if Cesar hadn't told me to, I wouldn't have thought about it. And I think that's a problem with us as women — we don't think we need to be in the power structure, that we need to be on those boards where decisions are being made. Sometimes we think well, I'm not really prepared to take that position or that role. But I say [to women out there]: Just do it like the guys do it — pretend that you know. And then you learn on the job.

The slogan ""Sí se puede"" — ""Yes, we can"" — that was you. How did you come up with that?

We were in Arizona. We were organizing people in the community to come to support us. They had passed a law in Arizona that if you said, ""boycott,"" you could go to prison for six months. And if you said ""strike,"" you could go to prison. So we were trying to organize against that law. And I was speaking to a group of professionals in Arizona, to see if they could support us. And they said, ""Oh, here in Arizona you can't do any of that. In Arizona no se puede — no you can't."" And I said, ""No, in Arizona sí se puede!"" And when I went back to our meeting that we had every night there ... I gave that report to everybody and when I said, ""Sí se puede,"" everybody started shouting, ""Sí se puede! Sí se puede!"" And so that became the slogan of our campaign in Arizona and now is the slogan for the immigrant rights movement, you know, on posters. We can do it. I can do it. Sí se puede.

That must make you smile every time you hear it.

Oh, it does. I always feel very happy."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jose Jimenez/Getty Images Jose Jimenez/Getty Images

Barbuda was the first place Hurricane Irma made landfall as the Category 5 storm devastated a string of islands in the Caribbean earlier this month. As of noon ET on Friday — 24 days after the storm destroyed much of the island — Barbuda's evacuation order was officially lifted.

Some residents were being allowed to return home this week, but health and waste management officials haven't yet given the all-clear that the island is once again sufficiently habitable. Even before the evacuation order was lifted, construction and relief crews were working on the island. Some hotel owners were also allowed to return, to start preparing their properties to reopen.

Antigua and Barbuda's ambassador to the U.S., Ronald Sanders, says the evacuation meant that for the first time in 300 years, there's been no one living on Barbuda full time.

Citing the current lack of water and power on the island, Sanders added that while people will be allowed to go back on a voluntary basis, ""it's not a bed of roses.""

The massive cleanup and recovery effort is being carried out in stages. In an update this week, Antigua and Barbuda's Ministry of Health and the Environment said:

""The mosquito problem is under control. Stagnant water has been treated and removed from most areas. Measures have been taken to control the rodent population. Most debris has been removed from public roads and other public areas. The dead animals issue has been treated and mainly eradicated. ""In addition, the Hanna Thomas hospital was cleaned up and the undamaged part is now being used by EMS as a medical post.""

Irma brought ""unprecedented"" levels of destruction to Barbuda, Prime Minister Gaston Browne said after touring the damage earlier this month. He said that 95 percent of the island's buildings were damaged; the government deemed it to be uninhabitable.

As the National Office of Disaster Services tries to prepare the island for more people to return, the agency says 280 tents have been donated, along with 500 temporary housing units. The agency also says that ""two generators have been issued to the tire repair shop and a supermarket on the island so that services in those areas can be provided.""

The country's Red Cross division says $50,000 worth of medical equipment was donated to help Barbuda's Hanna Thomas hospital carry out examinations and emergency care. The agency's director on the island, Peter Cuffy, says his home was spared — and that he wants it to be used as a base for the Red Cross and for anyone who needs shelter.

The next phase of the rebuilding effort, the government says, will focus on repairing houses that were least damaged. Carpenters are rebuilding part of a community center, in the hopes that it can be used to house at least 100 workers during the rebuilding phase."

Two women were stabbed to death at Marseille's Saint Charles train station in the south of France Sunday in a possible terrorist act, before French soldiers shot the assailant dead.

The station was evacuated, reports The Associated Press, train service suspended and police warned people to stay away.

""An odious attack,"" tweeted French Interior Minister Gérard Collomb. ""A cowardly and abject crime.""

After having viewed video footage of the incident, Collomb said the suspect attacked one woman before fleeing, then returned to kill the second victim, reports Le Monde. Collomb called both victims ""young women"" and added that the quick-acting soldiers possibly saved others from becoming victims of the attack.

""This act could be terrorist in nature, but at this time we cannot confirm it,"" Collomb said at a press briefing in front of the station.

France has been the site of numerous terror attacks in recent years; the worst of which unfolded on the night of Nov. 13, 2015 when gunfire and grenades exploded across Paris, including at the Bataclan concert hall. In all, 130 people died in the attack claimed by the Islamic State.

The soldiers on patrol Sunday in Marseille were working as part of Opération Sentinelle, which has seen thousands of combat troops deployed to guard transportation hubs, religious centers and tourist attractions across the country.

The operation was launched in January 2015, after Islamic extremists opened fire at the Paris-based satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo and a Kosher grocery store, killing 17 people.

Since 2015, more than 230 people across France have been killed in terrorist attacks, reporter Jake Cigainero says from Paris.

On Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed ""deep indignation for the barbarous act,"" and saluted the police and soldiers ""who reacted with sang-froid and efficiency.""

Earlier this month, four American university students studying abroad were splashed with acid at Saint Charles, the same train station that was the scene of Sunday's attack. But authorities said the suspect in that case was suffering from a mental illness and did not consider it an act of terror."

Although she'd never cooked until her early thirties, food was always an integral part of Archana Pidathala's life. The author of the self-published cookbook, Five Morsels of Love, shortlisted earlier this year for the 2017 Art of Eating Prize, cherishes memories of long, languid summers spent at her grandmother's home in the South Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

Her grandmother, Nirmala Reddy, a cookbook author herself, asked her grandchildren every day what they wanted to eat for each meal. ""She never once complained or felt overwhelmed by the incredible amount of cooking she did for us. And she always prepared all the dishes we asked for,"" recalls Pidathala.

Pidathala says her favorite recipes from Five Morsels of Love have the power to instantly transport her to back those blissful summer afternoons. Sometimes, she would watch as her grandmother chopped vegetables and crushed spices on a stone pestle, releasing a fragrance that stirred her appetite.

The pachchi pulusu (a tangy peanut stew), the anapaginjala pulusu (a hyacinth bean curry that her grandma loved) and her own personal favorite, the ulava charu (a slow-cooked, thick stew made from horse gram beans) were the flavors of her childhood. It was the eggplant biryani, however, that always brought home to her the ingenuity of her grandmother's cooking. ""It was perfected after years of trial and improvisation,"" she says. ""No special occasion in our family is complete without serving this dish.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Archana Pidathala Courtesy of Archana Pidathala

The biryani calls for a rich curry thickened by sesame seeds, dried coconut and an array of Indian spices. The curry is then stuffed into an eggplant and slow-cooked. It turns out intensely aromatic, surprisingly light and bursting with flavor and texture.

At mealtimes during those summer afternoons in Hyderabad, Pidathala remembers gathering the children of her family close while her grandmother lovingly ladled food onto one large plate.

""Communal eating in this way wasn't uncommon in India. It happens in many families, though it is getting rarer today,"" Pidathala says. ""These early experiences brought home to me how food can nourish the soul as much as the body, how it can create enduring bonds.""

The five morsels in the book's title refers to these cousins, who bonded over such exquisite meals. They're represented in the recurring motif of the five grains of rice that prance across the soft yellow cloth-bound cover like snowflakes.

Her grandmother's death in 2007, barely nine weeks after she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, devastated the family. Pidathala, who had recently moved hundreds of miles away to Bengaluru to begin a career in IT, particularly reeled after the loss.

""I had always promised her we'd work together on an English translation of her cookbook, written in Telugu [a language native to Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana],"" says Pidathala. The simple paperback had seen three print runs since it was published in 1974. It was the kind of book that emigrants sought to carry back with them overseas. By offering an authentic taste of home, it helped them ache less for what they'd left behind.

""Ammamma, as I called her, had always wanted to reach out to a much wider audience, but I thought I had all the time in the world to make that happen,"" Pidathala says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Archana Pidathala Courtesy of Archana Pidathala

She spent the next few years immersed in the hundreds of recipes that her grandmother had painstakingly documented. They were everywhere — including on the backs of medical prescriptions and withered wedding invitations.

Deciding to translate parts of the original cookbook first, she added recipes that were childhood favorites. However, she struggled to quantify ingredients — something that her grandmother, like most other Indian cooks, did with instinctive ease. ""I had no idea that recipe writing could be so nuanced,"" Pidathala laughs. ""It was a fascinating journey, and every day, I was learning something new. But I had to measure and cook each recipe several times to perfect it. For someone who had never cooked before — that was the real challenge.""

In 2013, with help from a friend, Bengaluru-based food blogger Chinmayie Bhat (who shot the photos for the book), she tried out dozens of recipes over the weekends. When the cook who had her helped her grandmother through the years visited Pidathala, the trio made a formidable team — they prepared and photographed 60 dishes in 5 days.

And remarkably, a book that focuses on a tiny slice of Indian cuisine — the fiery, chili-laden food native to the state of Andhra Pradesh — soon made an impression on people from around the world after it was self-published in May 2016. Pidathala personally shipped the book to readers in 40 countries. It was also stocked internationally by niche and indie bookstores.

Chen Kariv, a graphic designer and her friend, Hili Enzel, a high school teacher, were the first from Tel Aviv, Israel, to order the book from the author's web site. ""Hili and I are food enthusiasts, and cooking meals is our way of hanging out together,"" says Kariv. ""At first it was a challenge to identify all the special ingredients. It was a very different [cuisine] from what we know.""

The duo were soon cooking for their friends. ""It's a great way to explore other cultures, by trying to learn their flavors,"" says Kariv.

Today, Pidathala is an accomplished chef. ""Although I began this journey to honor my grandmother's memory, along the way, I discovered her passion for cooking,"" she says.

As she ponders over writing a second cookbook, culled from her grandmother's notes over the years, she's grateful for reclaiming the kitchen as a place that embodies creativity, self-expression and love.

Six days after the shooting along the Strip, Vice President Mike Pence visited Las Vegas, and told residents that America is united with their city in grief.

""We do mourn with those who mourn and grieve with those who grieve, but we do not grieve like those who have no hope,"" he said. ""Because heroes give us hope.""

President Trump was in Las Vegas on Wednesday, when he visited some victims of the shooting at a local hospital and met with first responders. Pence's speech echoed the president's, in its somber tone, religious language, message of unity — and in eschewing discussion of guns or gun control.

""In the wake of this tragedy we put on love,"" Pence said. ""We find comfort in the knowledge that we are united as one nation, as one people, with one voice. United in our grief, united in our support for those who have suffered. And united in our resolve to end such evil in our time.""

The vice president spoke at Las Vegas City Hall, where he was joined by state and local officials, including the city's mayor. He addressed participants in an interfaith unity prayer walk, an event planned well before the shooting happened.

Two who walked were John and Kristie Lum, retirees who moved to Las Vegas three years ago.

John says he's a person of faith, but that he struggles with it.

""Because for me, it's not enough just to pray,"" he says. ""It's not enough just to have faith. I think that our calling is that we also have to act. So I get concerned that we just have these kind of events ... and it's over with. And then we move on and wait for the next event. I think we have to do a whole bunch more.""

""It's very confusing,"" adds Kristie. ""Because to believe so strongly, and then again, to have people that just have so much hate inside ... it's hard to understand.""

With her characteristic candor, Mayor Carolyn Goodman said the city would be defined not by violence, but by its humanity, tolerance and compassion.

""I want to thank all you walkers,"" said Goodman. ""Everybody who's prayed, everybody who's prayed quietly, everybody who's made a difference in this phenomenal city — that has been safe, that will remain safe.""

""We will not be brought down by craziness, anger, and hatred!"" she said to loud applause.

Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old resident of Mesquite, Nev., opened fire on the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Sunday night, killing 58 people before fatally shooting himself. Nearly 500 others were injured as he sprayed bullets from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay resort, across Las Vegas Boulevard from the festival.

Investigators have still not uncovered a motive for the shooting, despite having pursued more than a thousand leads.

""While some of it has helped to create a better profile into the madness of this suspect, we do not still have a clear motive or reason why,"" Clark County Undersheriff Kevin McMahill said on Friday.

Police say they are confident that only one shooter was in the Mandalay Bay hotel room at the time of the attack, but they continue to investigate whether anyone else might have known about the shooting in advance.

The police are asking for anyone with information to contact them via the FBI's tip line, 1-800-CALL-FBI.

""No information is too small or insignificant,"" Las Vegas police tweeted. ""If you know something, say something.""

FBI Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse said investigators are launching a public information campaign, in partnership with Clear Channel, to put up billboards with that message across Las Vegas.

More than $13 million in donations have been raised to support the victims and their families.

Mochi has a taste for: peanut butter, sweet potato and dressing up in costumes.

Mochi dislikes: dust and leaves sticking to her tongue.

While proud of her ""unique"" feature, Rickert says it also comes with some issues: extra slobber, especially when nervous, as well as breathing problems.

Mochi takes the title from the previous record holder, Puggy, whose tongue measured a mere 4.5 inches, reports The Associated Press.

But the holder of the longest tongue on a dog (ever) has Mochi licked. Brandy, a boxer, had a tongue measuring nearly 17 inches, or almost a foot and a half, according to Guinness. She died in 2002.

Rickert said she hopes Mochi's moment of fame can inspire others.

""With this record, we hope to bring attention to how much joy rescued animals can bring to their new family,"" Rickert said. ""She has brought a lot of joy to our life because she is so calm and she is also a comic relief to us."""

Right behind Irma, of course, is another hurricane, Jose - not as big but still very dangerous, as Texas still dries out from its encounter last week with the enormous Hurricane Harvey, which makes a lot of people wonder, how unusual is this sequence of hurricanes?

SIMON: This does seem extraordinary - three huge hurricanes in a matter of weeks.

JOYCE: It's unusual, very unusual - not unprecedented. There have been occasions in the past in the Atlantic and the Pacific, where there have been two or three hurricanes swirling around somewhere. What makes them particularly noticeable, of course, is that they're hitting land. Often, these happen, but nobody knows because they never hit land.

SIMON: How does what we're seeing match up with the predictions that have been made over the years by climate scientists?

JOYCE: We have to remember that, though, of course, there have always been hurricanes, and there would be without climate change. But what the computer models that climate scientists use - what they tell us is that bigger storms are going to get bigger. Not necessarily more - there will be more of them, but they'll get bigger. And the reason for this is heat. Heat drives storms. The more heat you have, the bigger storms you have. What happens is hot water creates water vapor. You know, a cup of coffee - it's got vapor coming off it. So the water vapor rises. You get convection. It creates these circulating winds. And that's what creates the conditions for a hurricane. And what's happened is that, you know, hurricanes feed off of this fuel. And the hotter the oceans, the more fuel you'll get for the hurricane.

SIMON: Global warming can provide that heat from the ocean.

JOYCE: Yes. I mean, there's always heat. And there've always been hurricanes. But there's extra heat now. I mean, this summer, the Atlantic Ocean, where the hurricanes form, was close to two degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the normal. And that may not seem like a lot. But you're talking about tens of thousands of square miles, 150 feet deep. That's a lot of heat. We saw a similar situation in 2005 when Katrina hit in 2010 - a very warm ocean and lots of hurricanes. And we should note that it's not just power you get from the heat. More water vapor means more rain. And that's what happened with Harvey. A warmer atmosphere holds more rain. More of it comes out of the hotter ocean. So that's what happened with Harvey.

SIMON: So is this our future?

JOYCE: Very hard to predict. Natural things unrelated to climate change cause hurricanes to happen. You know, we saw this with Harvey. There was a high pressure system over the United States that made it stall and rain more over Houston. That's not related to climate change clearly. Some people think it is, but it's difficult to say. But at the same time, the heat is the essence here. And climate scientists are pretty sure that at least one thing is clear. We're going to ratchet things up the hotter it gets. The ocean absorbs that heat, and we'll get hurricanes that get ratcheted up a little bit. Some get ratcheted up a lot. But the more we heat up the oceans, the more we're going to get big, big storms.

SIMON: Same time as we've had these hurricanes, of course, there have been some huge wildfires that have been burning in the West. Do scientists believe climate change is at work there, too?

JOYCE: That's a tougher link. Again, so many things cause wildfires, not least of which is a hundred years of suppressing wildfires. The Forest Service, Smokey the Bear - has suppressed it, meaning a lot of fuel has grown up, a lot of underbrush. So when it does burn, it burns hotter and bigger. That said, again, heat makes a big difference. It's been hotter than normal. When you have heat, you suck more moisture out of the land. You suck more moisture out of the vegetation. It's drier. Poof. You get maybe not more fires, but you get big ones.

SIMON: NPR's Christopher Joyce, thanks so much.

JOYCE: You're welcome.

Updated at 2 p.m. ET

A tropical cyclone in the northwestern Caribbean Sea has been upgraded to a named storm, Tropical Storm Nate. The system is likely to become a hurricane in the next three days and could hit the northern Gulf Coast on Sunday morning, forecasters say.

""Residents along the Gulf Coast from Louisiana through the Florida Panhandle should monitor the progress of this system and heed any advice given by local officials,"" the National Hurricane Center says.

In an update Thursday, the center said, ""Nate is forecast to be near hurricane intensity when it approaches the Yucatan Peninsula late Friday, bringing direct impacts from wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall.""

Nate is showing signs of developing an eyewall. It's also expected to strengthen as it moves over warmer waters on its way to the U.S. coast. But at this point, the National Hurricane Center says, ""it is too early to specify the timing, location, or magnitude of these impacts. ""

Nate is currently bringing heavy rainfall to Nicaragua and Honduras, as it scrapes along their coasts on a northwest track toward Cancun. The storm has triggered flood warnings in those areas, along with a hurricane watch in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula, from Punta Herrero to Rio Lagartos.

Enlarge this image toggle caption National Hurricane Center National Hurricane Center

The cyclone has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, and it's moving northwest at 9 mph. That will change later today, the National Hurricane Center says, when Nate takes a more north-northwestward path and also moves at a faster speed.

By Sunday, Nate's sustained winds are expected to reach 75 mph. While that speed is a far cry from the incredible intensity of recent hurricanes such as Irma and Maria, forecasters say people in Nate's path need to be careful of flash floods and mudslides from its heavy rains.

Powerful winds often attract the most attention and concern regarding cyclones. But it's the water — from both storm surges and rainfall — that's often the most deadly component of a tropical system. The hurricane center warns that Nate will bring 15 to 20 inches of rain to Nicaragua — and that a wide area is at risk, with heavy rainfall expected along the Pacific coast of Central America.

The cyclone's predicted path has shifted to the west since the first NHC advisory went out for Nate's system Wednesday morning. It had once been expected to thread the gap between Mexico and Cuba's west coast, and to make a potential landfall in the Florida Panhandle. The storm is now expected to pass over Mexico's tourism-friendly southern coast, with a potential — and subject to change — landfall forecast along the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi."

Updated at 12:26 p.m. ET

Hurricane Nate is a hurricane no more.

It is now a tropical depression, dousing the Deep South, Tennessee Valley and central Appalachian Mountains with heavy rains, expected to continue through Monday.

Nate first struck near the mouth of the Mississippi River on the southeastern Louisiana coast as a Category 1 storm Saturday night and again near Biloxi, Miss., early Sunday morning.

After several hours of heavy rainfall, the National Hurricane Center downgraded the tropical storm to a tropical depression and has subsequently discontinued all hurricane and storm surge warnings and watches.

Tropical storm-force wind gusts are expected over the Florida Panhandle and portions of Alabama and Georgia through Sunday, the NHC said. Portions of the northern Gulf Coast continue to experience elevated water levels but were expected to gradually subside Sunday afternoon.

Nate was downgraded to a tropical storm, hours after it made landfall near the city of Biloxi, Miss.

Videos and photos from Biloxi show water inundating parts of the city.

In its 7 a.m. CT advisory, the National Hurricane Center said storm surge warnings remain in effect for the areas between the Mississippi and Alabama border to the Okaloosa and Walton counties in Florida. While tropical storm warnings remain in effect throughout the Alabama and Florida border eastward to Indian Pass, Fla.

Water is expected to rise by 5 to 8 feet between the Mississippi-Alabama border to the Alabama-Florida border, including Mobile Bay, Ala.

Photographer Mike Theiss posted video on Twitter of what he said was the flooded interior of Biloxi's Golden Nugget casino.

Two other Twitter users posted videos of flooded casino parking garages.

Wesley Williams of WLOX wrote that power had been knocked out in downtown Biloxi by the forceful winds.

Pictures and videos show parts of U.S. Route 90, which runs east and west along much of the Gulf Coast, completely submerged.

The Associated Press reports that Nate is the first hurricane since 2005's Hurricane Katrina to make landfall in Mississippi.

But Katrina is better known for causing the widespread destruction of New Orleans in neighboring Louisiana that year. This time, New Orleans, which is about 90 miles to Biloxi's west, appeared to miss the brunt of the storm. Mayor Mitch Landrieu had imposed a curfew on the city but lifted it when the National Weather Service canceled a hurricane warning for the area. City officials still cautioned residents to take shelter from heavy winds.

The situation was different to Biloxi's east. Mobile, Ala., experienced flooding of its own.

Adam Olivier of Fox10 tweeted what he said was water inundating downtown Mobile.

Another tweet apparently showed more extensive flooding in downtown.

At 2:15 a.m. local time Sunday, the National Weather Service of Mobile measured water surges of 5.6 to 5.7 feet at locations near the city.

The NHC said Nate will ""quickly weaken as it moves farther inland"" and ""should degenerate into a remnant low late Monday."""

There is one small field on Michael Sullivan's farm, near the town of Burdette, Ark., that he wishes he could hide from public view.

The field is a disaster. There are soybeans in there, but you could easily overlook them. The field has been overrun by monsters: ferocious-looking plants called pigweeds, as tall as people and bursting with seeds that will come back to haunt any crops that Sullivan tries to grow here for years to come.

""I'm embarrassed to say that we farm that field,"" Sullivan says. ""We sprayed it numerous times, and it didn't kill it.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR

These weeds have become resistant to Sullivan's favorite herbicides, including glyphosate, which goes by the trade name Roundup.

Yet the rest of Sullivan's farm is beautiful. As farmers like to say, the fields are ""clean."" There is not a weed to be seen.

In those fields, he planted soybeans that enjoy a novel superpower. They've been genetically modified by Monsanto, the biotech giant, so that they tolerate a different weed-killing chemical, called dicamba.

As a result, starting this year, Sullivan got to spray dicamba on those soybeans. And he loves the results.

""Now we finally got a chemical [where] we can farm clean and be proud of our crop. And don't have these vicious pigweeds coming up,"" he says.

But there is a dark side of this weed-killing revolution, and David Wildy is living it.

""It's a real disaster,"" Wildy says. His voice sounds tired.

Wildy is well-known in Arkansas's farming community. He was named Southeast Farmer of the Year in 2016. This year, he planted the same soybeans that he has in previous years, not the new dicamba-tolerant ones. He didn't think he needed them.

But in midsummer, all across his farm, a strange thing started happening. Soybean leaves bent into cupped shapes. Plants stopped growing.

""My heart just came up in my throat, thinking, 'Oh my gosh, we've got a real problem,' "" Wildy says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR

He was seeing the telltale symptoms of dicamba damage. Apparently, dicamba fumes had drifted into his farm from fields up to a mile away where neighbors had sprayed the chemical on their new dicamba-tolerant soybeans and cotton.

Herbicide drift is a familiar problem for farmers. What happened this summer, though, was unprecedented in its scale. Dicamba damage was reported all over the Midwest and mid-South, from Mississippi to Minnesota. Farmers filed thousands of complaints. They reported damage to tomato fields, watermelons, fruit trees and many other crops.

Farmers have used dicamba for many years. But this year, they used more of it, and they used it in a new way, spraying it over soybeans and cotton in the heat of summer, which can cause the chemical to vaporize from soil or leaves and drift away to damage other plants nearby.

Soybeans are especially sensitive to dicamba. Wildy says that every single soybean field on his farm — thousands of acres — showed some injury. A third of those acres were hit hard enough to reduce his harvest. He says it probably will cost him several hundred thousand dollars.

Just as upsetting is the loss of trust between neighbors, as farmers argue over who should pay for those damaged crops.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR

One such argument led to a killing last year, and the horror of it still hangs over conversations about dicamba damage in northeast Arkansas. Mike Wallace, a farmer in Monette, Ark., had complained repeatedly about damage caused by a neighbor's dicamba use. At that time, the chemical was being used illegally. For reasons as yet unknown, Wallace arranged a meeting on an isolated back road with a man named Allan Curtis Jones, who worked on that farm. An argument broke out and Wallace was shot. Jones is awaiting trial for the killing.

""It's something that is so heartbreaking to me. I see farmers taking sides, and enemies being made,"" Wildy says. ""It's a situation that is so catastrophic and appalling, I never would have thought that I would see something like this.""

Sometimes, farmers can't tell where the wind-blown dicamba came from. In other cases, the source of the damage is clear, but farmers who sprayed it insist that they sprayed the chemical exactly as directed and refuse to accept responsibility for any damage.

Tom Burnham, a farmer near Blytheville, Ark., whose fields were damaged, says that some of his neighbors were helpful and reported the damage to their insurance companies, just as they would do if they were in a car accident.

""But there's some who were so nonchalant about the situation, so unforthcoming, I don't think those relationships will ever be repaired,"" he says. ""As a human being, I can't trust someone like that.""

Farmers also are battling over whether they'll get to use this weedkiller next year. David Wildy has taken a stand against further dicamba use.

""Regardless of how good it is, and how much I need it, if I can't keep it from damaging my neighbor, we can't use it,"" he says.

Michael Sullivan, meanwhile, the farmer with the pigweed problem, thinks that farmers have no alternative.

""The technology is too good to just trash it,"" he says. ""Pigweeds are literally going to take the country over if we don't control them.""

Sullivan thinks the problem of damaged crops can be solved. The benefits of dicamba-tolerant crops will be so obvious, he says, that almost all the farmers in his area will decide to plant them — which means that there won't be any vulnerable crops that dicamba would damage.

That might reduce the damage to crops, but the resulting free-fire zone for dicamba could be bad news for other vegetation, such as wildflowers and trees.

The wider ecological impact of dicamba drift received little attention at first. Richard Coy, whose family-run company manages 13,000 beehives in Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri, was one of the few people who noticed it.

""If I were not a beekeeper, I would pay no attention to the vegetation in the ditches and the fence rows,"" he says. But his bees feed on that vegetation.

Coy takes me to a group of hives parked between an overgrown ditch and a soybean field, in an area where farmers sprayed a lot of dicamba this summer.

""Do you see this vine right here?"" he asks. ""The green one, [that] has little tags? Those tags should have been blooming during the month of July. As of today, they have not bloomed.""

No blossoms means less pollen for his bees. Coy thinks that dicamba drift is the most likely explanation. Other plants nearby, such as a cottonwood tree, showed clear symptoms of exposure to dicamba.

Honey production at his site is down by 40 percent to 50 percent, Coy says. Across the region, in areas where farmers sprayed dicamba, honey production dropped by about one-third, on average. If farmers keep spraying dicamba, he says, he'll have to move his hives somewhere else.

But the fate of his business isn't as important as the fate of the environment. Dicamba exposure ""affects ""things that people are not even aware of,"" he says. ""It affects the butterflies, and all pollinators. But all of these insects are in the environment for a reason, and they all have to be sustained for everything to work as it should.""

Along the southern shore of Tennessee's Reelfoot Lake, a well-known state park, bald cypress and oak trees also showed symptoms of dicamba exposure this summer. Nathan Hoover, a forest health specialist with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, called the damage ""minor"" and says he expects the trees to recover.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and many states are taking a close look at dicamba use. Regulators in Arkansas have voted to ban most spraying of dicamba in the state next summer, but the governor and leaders of the state Legislature still need to sign off on it."

In a few months, AOL Instant Messenger will go the way of such tech touchstones as AltaVista and Netscape. It was 20 years ago that ""AIM"" went online. It quickly exploded in popularity, peaked and then slowly succumbed to competitors.

For many of us, AIM conjures up memories of dial-up modems, the sound of a ""handshake"" and the phrase ""You've Got Mail.""

""AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift, but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed,"" says Michael Albers, vice president of communications product at Oath Inc., a subsidiary of Verizon Communications that brought AOL and Yahoo together into a single unit earlier this year.

On Twitter, a social media platform that in no small way contributed to AIM's demise, people seemed a bit nostalgic but not terribly surprised.

""You likely remember the CD, your first screenname, your carefully curated away messages, and how you organized your buddy lists,"" Albers says. ""In the late 1990's, the world had never seen anything like it. And it captivated all of us.""

In fact, by 2001, AIM had captivated about 100 million of us worldwide, but as Techcrunch.com writes:

""It battled for supremacy with competitors like ICQ, and messengers from Yahoo and Microsoft MSN. But eventually text messaging, Google's GChat and Facebook took over, while AIM never fully figured out the shift to mobile. That led to AOL's fall from grace, going from being valued at $224 billion in today's money to just $4.4 billion when it was sold to Verizon in 2015. For context on the business AOL let slip away, WhatsApp sold that same year to Facebook for more than $19 billion.""

""We know there are so many loyal fans who have used AIM for decades; and we loved working and building the first chat app of its kind since 1997,"" AOL writes on the AIM help page. ""Our focus will always be on providing the kind of innovative experiences consumers want. We're more excited than ever to focus on building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products.""

If you still have an AIM account, you can keep using it until December 15. After that, you will no longer be able to sign on."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Matt Bochman, Indiana University Matt Bochman, Indiana University

Whether it's food production, medical microbiology or alcohol-fermentation, one yeast genus holds a near monopoly on research: Saccharomyces.

It's ""the most well-studied organism in history,"" according to Indiana University's Matthew Bochman, a microbiologist specializing in the research of new bacteria and yeast for beer-brewing.

By comparison, we know little about other yeasts. However, an ancient type of beer that continues to grow more popular in America's craft brew scene has sparked a scientific race to unearth and tame new wild yeasts and long-maligned bacteria, which could have wide-ranging implications for other fields.

Sour beer's story starts with Belgium's ancient lambic brewing technique: Wort, the sweet liquid extracted from grain mash, is left in an open vat. Bacteria and yeast from the brew room's wooden ceilings and the Senne Valley air seed the wort before brewers ferment it for up to three years in former wine barrels scrubbed of harsh, bitter tannins. There, slow oxygen diffusion imparts sherry characteristics and softens bitterness. Aromatic compounds leave notes of rose, vanilla and caramelization.

To take some of the guesswork and mysticism out of this process, a few years ago scientists characterized the procession of bacteria and yeast — that is, the microbiome — of these brews. They found that while Sacc. makes most of the alcohol, so-called Brettanomyces yeasts and Lactobacillus bacteria — which normal brewers consider spoilage organisms, but that sour beer circles have nicknamed ""Bretts"" and ""Lactos"" — contribute the lactic acid that gives sour beer its flavor.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Anne A. Madden Anne A. Madden

Nevertheless, lambic brewing is fickle. Brewers hesitate to replace worn panels on the ceiling of the fermentation room for fear of throwing off a batch's flavor. To avoid using potentially taste-altering chemicals, flies attracted to the wort are controlled with an army of spiders.

In America's $55 billion craft brew scene, small brewers can't recreate the exact microbial environment used by Belgian lambic-style brewers, but they do ""have the freedom to make a small batch of [sour] beer and see how it's accepted,"" says Virginia Commonwealth University's Stephen Fong, who's working to identify new potential brewing yeasts.

So, with sour beer becoming a rising star, brewers are partnering with microbiologists like Fong and his wife, Grace, to find (or ""bioprospect"") new brewing yeasts and bacteria from strange places — or isolate long-maligned stowaways in the microbiome of sour beers and aging barrels.

According to Fong, American brewers typically split sour brewing into two parts: primary and secondary fermentation. During the former, yeast ferments the wort's sugar into alcohol. ""For that, we need something that creates ethanol.""

There are a lot of variables to consider in finding an ethanol-producing yeast, says Bochman. Potential yeasts must work within a narrow temperature range, and produce ethanol as well as a complex array of flavorful and aromatic compounds, he explains.

""Secondary fermentation is where you produce organic acids and stuff like that, which give it sourness,"" says Fong. Here, there are way more variables, even with a simple question like: Do you want to sour a beer with bacteria or yeast?

Many sour beers are quite strong for bacteria, says Bochman, ""so you need something that will tolerate that much ethanol."" In exchange for your troubles, according to Grace Fong, ""lactos will do their job really quickly,"" and some can even brew probiotic beers. But bacteria are nature's favorite infection agent, and your new, resilient bacteria could easily contaminate non-sour beer brewing equipment.

Conversely, souring yeast are more resistant to alcohol and hops, allowing for stronger, hoppier beers. Many also produce a wider array of byproducts, notes Grace Fong, which add to the complexity of the beer. But ""A lot of wild yeasts ... don't want to coexist,"" says Bochman, and of those that do, you need one that's going to be acid-tolerant.

Trial and error abounds. ""We've worked with 54 different species from 24 genera,"" Bochman says, to find five yeasts capable of souring beers. Nevertheless, each new microbe — whether isolated from the microbiome of the Jamestown historical site, or some guy's beard — expands sour beers' flavor palette and allows craft brewers to work with entirely new compounds.

toggle caption Matt Bochman, Indiana University

Moreover, sour beer microbiologists may soon consider modifying novel yeast and bacteria, brewing microbes considered wild today, to produce specific flavor compounds and antioxidants. ""The technology is already there,"" says Bochman. ""You could conceivably engineer a lactobacillus to be hop tolerant ... [or] species of yeasts to become alcohol tolerant."" And for brews in which organisms are filtered out, the final beer wouldn't be a GMO.

In its American reinvention, sour beer has allowed microbiologists an opportunity to find new souring microbes with applications that could extend beyond simply beer. Many of the yeasts and bacteria — and the compounds they produce — being studied for sour brewing have potential applications in manufacturing biodegradable plastics, biofuel, drug delivery systems, antimicrobial substances, breaking down pollutants and antibiotics, and advancing gene and protein expression research.

For now, the largest impact of this sour microbial gold rush is storytelling.

""People are really excited about understanding what hops their beer was made from,"" says Anne Madden, a bioprospecting microbiologist at North Carolina State University's Robb Dunn lab. ""In the very near future, you're going to see consumers asking what yeast their beer was made with."" Every brew with a new microbe tells a microbial drama that appeals to aficionados and communicates science.

Bochman, for example, uses sour brewing as a ""rubber bullet"" to train students who'll transfer their skills to isolating pathogens. ""If they drop a sample on the floor, or ruin an experiment, it's not $2,000 down the drain. You're not screwing up some cancer cell line. You just spilled a beer.""

Put simply, microbes are the new terroir — one that, thanks to sour beer, tells a more educational story than the same old Saccharomyces tale."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Getty Images Getty Images

Amir Attaran, a professor in the School of Public Health and the School of Law at the University of Ottawa, isn't afraid to take a bold stand.

He has written a commentary for the Harvard Public Health Review, published this week, with the headline, ""Why Public Health Concerns for Global Spread of Zika Virus Means that Rio de Janeiro's 2016 Olympic Games Must Not Proceed.""

The World Health Organization is soon expected to release a statement with guidance on travel to the Olympics.

NPR's Robert Siegel spoke to Attaran about his controversial position. Attaran's comments have been edited for length and clarity.

You are calling for the Summer Games to either be postponed or moved to other countries — London, Beijing, Sydney. Why?

The risk of [accelerating the spread] of Zika is simply too great to bear.

What we know from Brazil's devastating outbreak is that it began with a single infected person who brought the virus to South America. Does it really make sense to send a half-million [Olympic tourists] into Rio, which is, to be very clear, not the fringes of the outbreak. It's the heart of the outbreak. Rio de Janeiro state has more Zika cases than anywhere else in the country. Doesn't make sense.

So are you saying the games should be canceled?

No one is saying cancel the games. But is it at the end of the day sensible to run the risk of a global epidemic of, let's face it, brain-damaged babies, when that could be avoided by simply postponing the games or moving them elsewhere?

This is not a question of worrying about whether individual athletes get sick or individual tourists. For any of those individuals, the risk is quite low. But when you multiply by 500,000, the odds are extremely high that somebody will take the disease elsewhere and seed a new outbreak.

Wouldn't it also be logical from your perspective that no one should travel to Rio de Janeiro?

We can't fall into the trap of being extremist. It would be completely inappropriate, totalitarian even, to say nobody should enter or exit. But do we need to accelerate the entry and exit by a half-million people for [the Olympic] games?

We speak of the Summer Games, but actually in the Southern Hemisphere where they're taking place, it'll be winter. And some people say mosquitoes won't be that much of a problem because it's not their season.

There's no doubt that mosquitoes will decline in Rio's winter, but they're not going to decline to point that the disease vanishes. Other mosquito-transmitted diseases like dengue fever persist through the winter in Rio, and Zika will too because it's transmitted by the same mosquito. But here's the bigger problem: in Rio this year, insect-transmitted disease is up 600 percent over the same period last year. Why did it go up 600 percent when there are mosquito control efforts? That proves the efforts aren't working as well as one would have liked. And even if the mosquito-borne diseases do go down over winter, they're coming down from a level that's six times higher than normal."

Yelberton Abraham Tittle, better known as Y.A. Tittle, has died at age 90. He passed away Sunday night at Stanford Hospital near his home in Atherton, Calif.

Tittle was a great quarterback for Louisiana State University and went on to play 17 seasons of pro football. His greatest success was in New York when he led the Giants to three division titles in four years. In 1954, he became the first pro football player to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

""He came to personify the competitive spirit of football, thanks to an iconic photo taken by Dozier Mobley during Tittle's final season in 1964. ""The frame caught the then-37-year-old quarterback, who looked older than his years, after throwing an interception returned for a touchdown by Pittsburgh's Chuck Hinton. Tittle is seen kneeling in exhaustion and pain from an injured rib, blood dripping down his face from a head gash.""

More than 20 years ago, All Things Considered host Robert Siegel interviewed Tittle and his daughter, Dianne, a classicist and harpist who had written a book about him. The book, Giants & Heroes, compared Tittle, a great passer who never won a championship, to heroes of classical mythology. Tittle said he was immensely proud of his daughter's erudition.

""The same thing seemed to follow me all my life, never, ever really winning the big game. And I think Dianne has sort of - sort of - her book has been built around this. It's the quest of really winning, that I never did win. But I did win, really, in the long run because I have four wonderful children and grandchildren. And Dianne has written this book, and she's written it with good taste. She's praised her father while I think telling a lot of truth about the people in sports that I played with.""

Tittle held the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a season, 36, until 1984 — that's when Dan Marino threw 48.

In the 2006 NPR interview, Tittle said he loved playing football from his early days in East Texas.

""I almost wish I could do it all over again,"" he said. ""Because it was a wonderful experience and a wonderful ride."""

Verizon is buying Yahoo for $4.8 billion, acquiring its ""core Internet assets"" — search, email, finance, news, sports, Tumblr, Flickr — in essence writing the final chapter of one of the longest-running Internet companies.

Last year, Verizon bought another Internet pioneer, AOL (aka America Online) for $4.4 billion — complete with its ad targeting technology and content sites Huffington Post and TechCrunch.

This got us thinking: What happened to all those other big brands that dominated the early Internet experience? Here's a nerdy remembrance of a few of them. (A TL;DR preview: Yahoo and AOL bought a bunch of them, though many survived far longer than you might think.)

CompuServe

Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP

CompuServe launched for consumers as a dial-up online information service in 1979, and its popularity skyrocketed in the 1980s and 1990s. It was the original online portal, with news, chats, file sharing — a first such experience for several generations of users.

H&R Block (yep, that tax-prep company) bought CompuServe in 1980 and in 1997 sold it to WorldCom, which in turn passed on the subscriber base to the growing rival AOL. After itself going through a merger and then a spin-off with Time Warner, AOL officially shut down CompuServe in 2009.

But! A relic version still exists here.

Prodigy

A younger competitor to CompuServe, Prodigy was a ""home computer information service"" launched nationally in 1990 by a partnership of Sears and IBM, distinguishing itself with the addition of graphics and advertising support. The service lost money and users in the early '90s and went through a reboot in 1993, according to Wired.

Prodigy Classic officially shut down in 1999, citing the ""Y2K problem,"" and the Atlantic has a great long read on what went wrong. The company re-imagined itself as an Internet provider and got fully acquired by SBC communications, now known as AT&T.

AltaVista

Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Sakuma/AP Paul Sakuma/AP

Launched in 1995 by Digital Equipment Corporation as a demo project, AltaVista — aka a web ""super spider"" — was essentially an indexing predecessor of Google.

It changed hands a few times: Compaq Computer bought it in 1998 (for $3.3 million), one-time Internet giant CMGI bought it in 1999 (for $2.3 billion), ad company Overture Services bought it in 2003 (for $140 million) and it was acquired by Yahoo later the same year. Yahoo officially shut down AltaVista in 2013.

GeoCities

This was like the original Facebook — or, um, MySpace? You could find a community and build your own neon-colored, spinning-animation, multi-fonted, totally cool personal web page! After its mid-'90s launch, Yahoo bought GeoCities for more than $3.5 billion during the dot-com boom in 1999, ran it as Yahoo! Geocities and eventually shut it down in 2009.

But if you're nostalgic, you could still Geocities-ize websites, thanks to the Internet.

Ask Jeeves

Enlarge this image toggle caption Adam Berry/Bloomberg/Getty Images Adam Berry/Bloomberg/Getty Images

Remember that web butler Jeeves who answered your web queries in a distant echo of today's Siri?

Launched in 1996, Jeeves didn't live up to Google's search engine ascent: Bought in 2005 by IAC (whose businesses include OkCupid, Tinder, The Daily Beast, CollegeHumor and Vimeo), it went through several relaunches, abandoning the search engine and emerging as Ask.com.

Angelfire

The website host/builder is still around! Launched in 1996, it was bought a year later by another dot-com startup WhoWhere, which in turn was bought in 1998 by Lycos, described by CNN at the time as ""the world's fourth most popular Web site, behind America Online, Yahoo and Microsoft."" Lycos, after trading hands many times, currently belongs to Indian digital media company Ybrant Digital.

Netscape

Enlarge this image toggle caption AP AP

A brainchild of now-legendary Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark of Silicon Graphics, the Netscape browser beat Microsoft to the market in 1994. After intense ""browser wars,"" detailed by Engadget, Netscape's release of the source code spurred the creation of Mozilla.

AOL bought Netscape for the dot-com-bubble price of $4.2 billion in 1998, though it ended up costing $10 billion. As Firefox gained prominence, AOL made several attempts to revive Netscape's popularity, but eventually stopped supporting it in 2008.

ICQ

You've got a message! YouTube

Launched in 1996 by Israeli company Mirabilis, the ""I seek you"" chat service was an alternative to AIM and Yahoo Messenger (both of which are still around, and the latter is apparently beloved by oil traders).

AOL bought Mirabilis in 1998 for $287 million and sold ICQ in 2010 to Russian investment firm Digital Sky Technologies for $188 million.

Police apprehended a student accused of fatally shooting a Texas Tech University police officer at the campus police station Monday night.

University officials issued an alert saying the suspect was taken into custody and that the campus lockdown order had been lifted.

The incident began earlier in the day as Carlos Morales of West Texas Public Radio reported for our Newscast unit:

""University officials say Texas Tech police made a welfare check on 19-year-old Hollis Daniels earlier in the day, when they discovered evidence of drugs and drug paraphernalia. ""Daniels was brought in for a debriefing when he allegedly pulled out a gun and shot and killed an officer. ""Daniels then fled on foot, prompting a university wide lockdown, lasting nearly an hour.""

Texas Tech President Lawrence Schovanec issued a statement offering condolences:

""The family of the officer is in the thoughts and prayers of the Texas Tech community. ""I want to express my deep appreciation to the Texas Tech Police Department, Lubbock Police Department, Lubbock Sheriff's Office, and other state and federal law enforcement officials for their response.""

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also issued a statement on the shooting:

""First and foremost, our hearts go out to the family of the police officer killed at Texas Tech University. I have spoken to Chancellor Robert Duncan to offer my condolences, and I have mobilized the Texas Department of Public Safety to offer any assistance to the Lubbock Police Department. As the Texas Tech campus deals with this heartbreaking tragedy, Cecilia and I pray for the continued safety of the students and the entire community.""

The University says classes will resume as scheduled today."

A Football Giant and His Hero-Worshipping Daughter

toggle caption Getty Images

In honor of the new National Football League season, I've dug into the archives for an interview that is, at least ostensibly, about football. One thing I have learned about interviewing people is that an interview often turns out to be about something other than, or greater than, what the producer and I thought it would be about.

This particular interview promised to be about football and heroism but turned out to be about fathers and daughters. As a father of two daughters, both of whom possess talents far beyond my own, I am still delighted to hear Y.A. Tittle, the great New York Giants quarterback of my youth, and his daughter Dianne Tittle de Laet. She is a charming aesthete and classicist, a harpist and poet who saw in her father heroics worthy of the ancient epics. The two of them reminded me that (a) children assimilate the gifts of their parents in unusual ways and (b) some people play football for money so that their kids can play the harp for personal fulfillment.

And I have learned that there is an unwritten last chapter to the book. Although Giants and Heroes: A Daughter’s Memories of Y.A. Tittle is now out of print, de Laet uses the proceeds from the book to fund five scholarships for deserving high school students in the United States and abroad – athletes, artists, and others in need. Information is at aretepoetics.com (arete is the Greek word for virtue). ""The book didn't end with the book,"" de Laet says. ""It's been like a football on the bounce.""

Robert Siegel: As we approach this season of bowl games and pro football playoffs, some thoughts now about football, the way it used to be played, before sophisticated coaching staffs with wireless telephones moved players around the field like chess pieces. The quarterback used to call the plays. In the 1940s, Y.A. Tittle, a young star quarterback at Louisiana State University, made a seemingly brilliant call against Texas A&M.

Y.A. Tittle: In those days, you could not get any kind of coaching from the sideline. If you received any information, a hand signal or any of that nature, you would get a 15-yard penalty. If a receiver came into the game and brought in a play and told you what to do, it was a 15-yard penalty. The referee would actually stick his head in the huddle to make sure he wouldn't talk to you. But we sort of cheated a little bit. The water boy would come in with the jugs of water. Inside of my jug, which would be a different color, it might be fourth down and one, so I'd open up the jug and it would say, as an example, ""punt."" Then I would go in the huddle and call a punt. When we were playing Texas A&M, the score is 6 to nothing and about a minute to go and we're behind. So I call time- out and here came Lang, the water boy. I opened up my little top and it said ""punt."" I said why would we punt with less than a minute to go and we're behind? Well, [the water boy] had forgot to take the top off from the time before. But still, I was going to follow orders like I'm supposed to do. So I got in the huddle and called a quick kick and, of course, we had a revolution in the huddle with 10 other ball players saying I had to be the stupidest guy in the world. With 50 seconds left in the game and behind, we're gonna kick the ball away. But I did it and the ball went dead on the one-yard line. And then the first down: Texas A&M ran off tackle, fumbled, we covered it and then I threw a winning touchdown pass with about 20 seconds to go to Jim Cason and we won 7 to 6. The papers came out the next day and said it was the most brilliant call that any 18-year-old quarterback had ever made in the history of the game. Coach Moore said Y.A. knew we could never win without a break and he took the chance and did it. The only reason we did it because I got our illegal signals mixed up.

Robert Siegel: Y.A. Tittle tells that story in a book about him by his daughter. I talked with the two of them on NPR's All Things Considered.

There’s a famous photo of Y.A. Tittle in 1964, his last year as quarterback with the New York Giants. Tittle was 38. Football had broken his bones, age and asthma had stolen his wind. On his knees on the turf, helmet off, bloodied and exhausted, the erstwhile boy wonder out of east Texas was at the end of a brilliant career. Y.A. — Yelberton Abraham — Tittle had come to New York just three years before. He was the oldest quarterback in the game and the best: a man who could throw a football with stunning accuracy. The Bald Eagle, as they called him, broke passing records and took his team to three championship games and to three defeats. Many saw Tittle as a mythic figure — no one more so than his daughter Dianne, who has put that photograph on the back cover of her book, Giants and Heroes: A Daughter’s Memories of Y.A. Tittle. Dianne Tittle De Laet seems an improbable offspring of the great quarterback — she is a poet, a harpist, a woman who sets classic verse to music.

Dianne Tittle de Laet: I just gave a performance last week at Stanford of the lyrics of Sappho and some selections from Eurypides' ""Trojan Women."" That’s the program I did the first, and it's the one I think I love the most.

Siegel: Yes, uh, Mr. Tittle?

Tittle: I was just thinking, Mr. Siegel, don't you think that maybe the doctors got mixed up and we got the wrong baby in the hospital, 40-some-odd years ago? My daughter is a harpist and a poet, and talking about Sappho. The only Sappho I ever heard of was a linebacker for the Packers, or something like that.

De Laet: You’re more related than you realize, maybe not to Sappho, but to some of the other characters. Hector, in fact, [was] dragged around the walls of Troy three times. You could say you had experienced a variation on that theme.

Tittle: I know they made a switch at the hospital

Siegel: There’s a passage in your book, Dianne, that begins on page 134. I guess this is when your father was made the second-string quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers [in 1960]. Having been a great chief formation quarterback, he was, I guess made second-string because they went to a shotgun formation.

Siegel: In 1960. And Dianne, you write about that. And I’m wondering if you can read from your book a bit, describing your feelings as a young girl.

De Laet: Let's see. ""Personally I felt very lucky when Red Hickey decided to go with a shotgun formation and a younger quarterback because in 1960 I had had a hero in Perseus for nearly half of my life. It happened in kindergarten that I had opened a book before I could read, and found a picture of a man holding a ghastly trophy. Like sports, the picture had its share of violence, but the severed head of the Gorgon was only a part of the picture, and what was even more amazing than beheaded snakes was the peace and contentment of the man leaning on one hip, as if to say that he was not surprised in the least by what had to be the most bizarre and fantastic moment of his life. Because victory, in spite of its strange and sometimes startling shapes, was not only his, but humanity's true element. And so it was that I began to wonder about the hero, and it was a good thing, too, because when the going got tough for my father in 1960, there were a multitude of Greek heroes I had come across in books who had it a lot tougher than he did. These people who faced nine-headed Hydras, clashing rocks, three-headed dogs, were like exotic candles being lit, one by one, inside my own dark and brutal world."" Should I continue, or I’ll stop there.

Siegel: Why don't you stop there.

Tittle: Dianne, I want you to read the book to me. I love this. When I read it, it doesn’t come out like that.

Siegel: Well there’s the connection, you see, between the Greek heroes and the ancient world and your career as a quarterback in the National Football League. You still think she was switched at birth, is what I hear.

Tittle: I definitely think so. (Laughs) Anyone who could write these beautiful words like that.

Siegel: You quote Seneca in the book, saying in the morning they throw a man to the lions and bears, at noon they throw them to the spectators. While writing about a game, which, even for me, as a 16-year-old New York Giants fan at the time, was a heartbreaking day to watch the championship game — there was no Super bowl yet — the championship game of the National Football League, between the New York Giants, with Y.A. Tittle at the helm, and the Chicago Bears. And I wonder, Y.A. Tittle, when you think back on that game, what are your memories?

Tittle: I was disappointed because for so many years I'd chased the whale, had never really won the championship game. We'd won our district championship when I was in high school, we went and lost in a crucial game later. We didn't go as far as we could have gone. Going to college, we played in the Cotton Bowl, tied with Arkansas, [we were] a much better football team than Arkansas that year but we caught a snowstorm there. The same thing seemed to follow me all my life, never ever really winning the big game. Dianne's book has been built around this: the quest of really winning, that I never did win. But I did win, really, in the long run because I have four wonderful children and grandchildren, and Dianne has written this book, and she's written it with good taste. She has praised her father while, I think, telling a lot of truth about the people in sports that I played with. And Mr. Siegel, I've loved football ever since the day I played [wearing a Lindbergh-style leather cap stuffed with rags] back in east Texas to the very last day at 38 years old I threw a ball in my last practice with the Giants. I wish I could do it all over again because it was a wonderful experience and a wonderful ride.

Siegel: Do you remember watching that game, Dianne — the 1963 championship?

De Laet: I would say, out of my entire childhood, that is the one thing I remember more than anything, in particular the last 10 minutes or so of the game when my father threw an interception. That game stands out in my mind as sort of perplexing, a riddle as Perseus was for me when I found him in the book. That's why I chose to make this game the subject of my victory ode in a sense. I feel that, at least for me, there was a victory that was shared by my father and maybe me, too, because I think he did show his excellence that day, even though it was the worst day of his career. I came away from that game with something that I needed to keep in mind as I continue to grow and explore my own art, and go and run down the field with my own ball, so to speak.

Siegel: Well, Dianne Tittle de Laet, and Y.A. Tittle, thank you both very much for coming here today.

Tittle: Mr. Siegel, thank you very much.

De Laet: Thank you very much.

Tittle: Can I ask a question?

Siegel: Yes, certainly.

Tittle: Is it at all possible that we could get a copy of the entire interview for ourselves?

Siegel: The entire interview is hard...

Tittle: I’m just fascinated by listening to my own daughter talk. I was just a C-student at LSU sitting next to the smartest girl. I’m listening to you, Dianne, and I’m really impressed.

Siegel: Proud father and retired quarterback Y.A. Tittle. His daughter Dianne Tittle De Laet is the author of Giants and Heroes: A Daughter's Memories of Y.A. Tittle."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP

President Trump on Sunday sent Congress a list of sweeping immigration changes he says ""must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.""

Trump wants the border wall he campaigned on to be built, a crackdown on illegal immigration and to switch the U.S. legal immigration system from one that prioritizes family connections to one based on merit.

Trump has promoted these policies before, both during the campaign and as president. But what's new is demanding that they be included in the legislative fix for the DACA program.

""Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end,"" Trump said in a letter to Congress.

Last month, concluding that the DACA program put into place by the Obama administration through executive action was illegal, Trump announced that he would end it in six months. He called on Congress to enshrine in law the protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the country as children. The approximately 700,000 DACA recipients are often referred to as DREAMers. Under the program, they temporarily avoid deportation and receive work permits.

Around that time, Trump had dinner at the White House with the two top congressional Democrats, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and all emerged talking about the rough outlines of a deal. A major component of that agreement was President Trump's willingness to take funding the border wall off the table, when it came to DACA legislation.

After the apparent agreement with Pelosi and Schumer, conservatives vocalized their rage, accusing Trump of abandoning the hard-line immigration platform he campaigned on. Conservative commentator Ann Coulter said at the time, ""If we're not getting a wall, I'd prefer President Pence.""

""DACA now, and the wall very soon,"" Trump told reporters on the south lawn of the White House in mid-September. ""But the wall will happen.""

The White House immigration principles appear to be a departure from that earlier statement. White House documents call for ""completing construction of a wall along the southern border of the United States"" and ensuring ""funding for the southern border wall and associated infrastructure.""

Pelosi and Schumer say these proposals are a clear break with what they believe was agreed to during that dinner at the White House.

""We told the President at our meeting that we were open to reasonable border security measures alongside the DREAM Act, but this list goes so far beyond what is reasonable,"" Pelosi and Schumer said in a statement. ""This proposal fails to represent any attempt at compromise.""

Beyond the wall, the Democrats say the administration's list is ""anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans.""

Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, they have a narrow majority in the Senate and have struggled to pass even top legislative priorities. And it's not clear that all, or even most, Republicans back what Trump is proposing on immigration. Passing a DACA fix is a top priority for Democrats, but they won't go along with Trump's long list of demands, meaning what once seemed like a bipartisan compromise in the works now looks more like another legislative standoff.

In his letter to Congress, Trump said the list of proposals was developed from the bottom up, working with law enforcement professionals on the front lines of America's immigration system.

""In response, they identified dangerous loopholes, outdated laws, and easily exploited vulnerabilities in our immigration system — current policies that are harming our country and our communities,"" his letter said.

These recommendations happen to also align nicely with Trump's campaign rhetoric.

Among the recommendations, as described by the White House:

Fund and complete construction of the southern border wall

Ensure the safe and expeditious return of Unaccompanied Alien Children and family units

End abuse of our asylum system by tightening standards, imposing penalties for fraud, and ensuring detention while claims are verified

Remove illegal border crossers quickly by hiring an additional 370 immigration judges and 1,000 ICE attorneys

Stop ""sanctuary cities""

Strengthen law enforcement by hiring 10,000 more ICE officers and 300 federal prosecutors

End visa overstays by establishing reforms to ensure their swift removal

Protect U.S. workers by requiring E-Verify and strengthening laws to stop employment discrimination against U.S. workers

End extended-family chain migration by limiting family-based green cards to include spouses and minor children

by limiting family-based green cards to include spouses and minor children Establish a points-based system for green cards to protect U.S. workers and taxpayers

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., quickly offered praise.

""The principles the president has put out show he understands what's broken in our immigration system and what's holding down wages for American workers,"" Cotton said in a statement. ""I'm especially glad to see him call for ending chain migration and moving to a skills-based immigration system. These kinds of reforms are long overdue.""

Cotton introduced a bill to create a skills-based immigration system earlier this year, and while Trump voiced support for it at a White House event, the bill has just one co-sponsor."

At least a dozen people are dead after an overcrowded boat carrying Rohingya Muslims fleeing Myanmar capsized off the coast of Bangladesh.

Michael Sullivan, reporting on NPR's Morning Edition, says that the majority of the dead are children and at least 30 other people are still missing.

The accident occurred late Sunday near Shah Porir Dwip in Bangladesh's southern coastal district.

More than a half-million Rohingya have fled Myanmar's western Rakhine State since Aug. 25, when a militant group known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army — which is associated with the minority group — attacked a series of military outposts, prompting a brutal crackdown from soldiers. The United Nations has called the retaliatory attacks by Myanmar's military ""a textbook example of ethnic cleansing."" The Rohingya have long suffered persecution in predominately Buddhist Myanmar.

Hala Jaber is spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. She tells NPR that the weather in the area has been bad.

""I can tell you, it's been raining non-stop, pelting down, not just rain, on and off for the last three four or five days. With strong winds,"" Jaber says. ""These are small fishing boats. They've got like 60 to 70 persons on board and it takes one wave to turn it over.""

Jaber says several thousand refugees keep crossing into Bangladesh pretty much every day either by boat or by land. And there are reports of many thousands more massing on the Myanmar side waiting to cross when they can.

Sullivan reports:

""It's an often perilous journey—one that frequently ends in tragedy. In early September, 46 bodies were recovered after a boat crammed with refugees capsized; 11 days ago, another boat sank with 80 people on board. Fewer than twenty survived. Yet still the refugees keep coming—the risk on the water preferable to that of staying and facing Myanmar's military.""

Sayed Azin, 46, who crossed into Bangladesh overland is quoted by Reuters as saying soldiers and Buddhist mobs torched his village.

""Half of my village was burned down. I saw them do it,"" he said after walking for eight days with his 80-year-old mother to reach Bangladesh.

""I left everything,"" he told Reuters, sobbing. ""I can't find my relatives ... I can't take this anymore.""

Some people streaming into Bangladesh reported bloody attacks by Buddhist mobs on people trying to reach the border, according to Reuters.

Conditions in the makeshift camps housing the refugees are still wretched and adequate food, shelter and sanitation is still a challenge, Michael reports.

""The floods, ...basically the misery. It's relentless. It's not easing up at all. It's not getting better,"" Jaber says."

Enlarge this image toggle caption Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images

High-profile lawyer Lisa Bloom has resigned from advising Hollywood studio head Harvey Weinstein, who was recently accused of sexually harassing female employees for decades.

Bloom announced her departure over Twitter on Saturday afternoon, writing, ""I have resigned as an advisor to Harvey Weinstein. My understanding is that Mr. Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement.""

Allegations against the movie mogul have been escalating since The New York Times published a story Thursday that he sexually harassed female assistants, executives and actresses — including Ashley Judd — for more than 30 years.

On Friday, television journalist Lauren Sivan reported that Weinstein trapped her in a restaurant hallway and masturbated in front of her in 2007, according to HuffPost.

Bloom has been under fire since the Times dropped the bombshell story chronicling years of alleged predatory behavior by Weinstein and the payouts that followed the allegations.

Prior to her stint as Weinstein's legal counselor on ""gender and power dynamics,"" Bloom had built her career fighting legal battles on behalf of victims of violence and discrimination. She represented women who brought sexual harassment claims against former Fox News host Bill O'Reilly, comedian Bill Cosby and President Trump.

On ABC's Good Morning America on Friday, Bloom explained her role with Weinstein. ""See, you have to understand that, yes, I'm here as his adviser,"" she said.

""I'm not defending him in any sexual harassment cases — there aren't any sexual harassment cases. I'm working with a guy who has behaved badly over the years, who is genuinely remorseful, who says, you know, 'I have caused a lot of pain.' ""

She told The New York Times that she ""saw advising Mr. Weinstein as an opportunity, adding that she felt uniquely positioned to work with him,"" adding: ""Here was an opportunity of a guy saying, 'Lisa, what should I do? I have behaved badly.' I'm like, 'Good, I'll tell you what to do. Be honest, be real.' ""

Weinstein, who is co-chairman of the Weinstein Company, announced Friday that he is taking an indefinite leave of absence immediately.

Bloom and Weinstein have had a prior working relationship: His film studio is planning to work on a series of television and film projects about the life of Trayvon Martin, the black teenager who was fatally shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in 2012. The projects are based on a pair of books about the teenager, one of which was written by Bloom."

Danish divers looking for the remains of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, whose torso washed ashore in Copenhagen this summer, made a gruesome discovery Friday nearby in Køge Bay.

""We found a leg and then another leg, and shortly thereafter, we found a head, which was also in a bag weighed down by several pieces of metal,"" Chief Police Investigator Jens Møller Jensen said at a press briefing Saturday, according to a translation by The Guardian. Møller Jensen said they also found a weighted bag containing a knife and Wall's clothing, socks and shoes.

There were no signs of fracture or blunt force trauma to the skull, according to Møller Jensen.

Friday's discovery will likely strengthen prosecutors' case against Danish inventor Peter Madsen.

Wall, 30, died after going out on Madsen's homemade submarine on Aug. 10 for a story. A day later, the vessel had sunk, Madsen was rescued alone and claimed that Wall died in ""a terrible accident"" and that he buried her body at sea.

Officials were skeptical.

Police said the submarine had been deliberately sunk. And on Aug. 21, Wall's torso, with metal attached, was discovered.

Madsen has been charged with manslaughter, the legal equivalent of murder in Denmark.

At a pretrial hearing Tuesday, more damning evidence was presented. Prosecutors said an autopsy revealed more than a dozen stab wounds on Wall's torso. Her DNA was found on Madsen's hand, neck and clothing, and police found a hard drive in Madsen's workspace with images of women being tortured and killed.

Møller Jensen said Saturday that an official cause of death has still not been established. A forensics team will continue to examine the newly discovered body parts and will look for DNA on the clothing.

Copenhagen police said more diving is scheduled for the weekend. The hope is to find Wall's arms.

""It is from an exploratory angle, but definitely also from an ethical angle, so that the relatives of Kim Wall can get a whole human being once she is to be buried,"" Møller Jensen said reports Danish newspaper Politiken."

The Trump administration will scuttle an Obama-era clean power plan aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, made the announcement in Hazard, Ky., on Monday, saying the rule hurt coal-fired plants.

""The EPA and no federal agency should ever use its authority to say to you we are going to declare war on any sector of our economy,"" Pruitt said, speaking at an event with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

""That rule really was about picking winners and losers,"" the EPA administrator said, adding that the rule change would be signed on Tuesday.

The announcement had been anticipated. It would eliminate the Clean Power Plan that was put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore never implemented.

A draft document obtained by NPR and other outlets says the administration will also issue an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ""in the near future"" to take comments on whether and how it should replace the CPP.

According to The Associated Press, the EPA is ""expected to declare the Obama-era rule exceeded federal law by setting emissions standards that power plants could not reasonably meet.""

Coal-fired power plants generate roughly 40 percent of the electricity globally, but generate more than 70 percent of the carbon dioxide, according to the International Energy Agency.

The vast majority of scientists worldwide say that carbon dioxide is a leading contributor to climate change. President Trump, however, has called climate change a hoax perpetrated by China to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive, but he also said he had an open mind toward efforts to control it.

In June, Trump announced that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Accord, an international agreement that set a limit on greenhouse gas emissions. At the time, the president said staying in the deal, which is aimed at capping average global temperature increases, ""could cost America as much as 2.7 million lost jobs by 2025"" and would cause the loss of close to $3 trillion in GDP.

However, the claims of potential job losses have been disputed by economists and climate scientists."

Updated at 7:20 a.m. ET

The 2017 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences has been awarded to Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for his pioneering work in behavioral economics.

The announcement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm said the 72-year-old Thaler ""has incorporated psychologically realistic assumptions into analyses of economic decision-making. By exploring the consequences of limited rationality, social preferences, and lack of self-control, he has shown how these human traits systematically affect individual decisions as well as market outcomes,"" the committee said in a statement.

The relatively new field of behavioral economics studies the effects of psychological, social, cognitive and emotional factors on economic decision-making.

""Human behavior is very complex. So, if we want to construct useful models of economic behavior, we have to make simplifications. One such simplification which has been very important in economics is the assumption that humans behave in a fully rational way and make economic decisions in a way as to maximize their own well-being,"" Per Strömberg, chairman of the prize committee, said.

Over time, Strömberg said, researchers have gathered more evidence from psychology on how humans deviate from rational economic decisions. ""Richard Thaler is a pioneer when it comes to incorporating such insights from psychology into economic analysis,"" he said.

""Thanks to his contributions and discoveries, this new field [of behavioral economics] has gone from being sort of a fringe and somewhat controversial part of economics to being a mainstream area of contemporary economic research,"" the chairman of the prize committee said.

Speaking from his home in the United States to a news conference at the Royal Academy, Thaler said he felt the most important impact of his work was ""the recognition that economic agents are human.""

Thaler is the author of the books Nudge and Misbehaving: The Making of Behavioral Economics.

Among Thaler's contributions to the field are his ""theory of mental accounting, explaining how people simplify financial decision-making by creating separate accounts in their minds, focusing on the narrow impact of each individual decision rather than its overall effect,"" the Academy said.

One area singled out by the committee is Thaler's work on retirement savings. He was an early proponent of employers automatically enrolling their workers in 401(k) programs. He also developed a ""Save More Tomorrow"" retirement plan that encourages people to put future salary increases toward retirement.

Kenny Malone of NPR's Planet Money says Thaler is ""a bit of a rock star"" in the field of economics.

""In terms of real-world implications, once you start to understand the ways that we are weird, irrational beings, you can structure policies to move people toward the ends that you would want,"" Malone tells Morning Edition.

Thaler made a cameo in the movie The Big Short, where he explained the ""hot-hand fallacy"" about how someone who has experienced success in something involving random chance has a greater chance of further success going forward.

Asked whether he thought that applied to President Trump, Thaler responded with a chuckle, ""I think he would do well to watch that movie.""

When the same Swedish journalist asked what Thaler would do with the 9-million kronor ($1.1 million) monetary portion of the Nobel award, the economist: ""I will say that I will try to spend it as irrationally as possible."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Andrew Harnik/AP Andrew Harnik/AP

Updated at 5:45 p.m. ET

President Trump has announced that the U.S. will be withdrawing from the Paris accord — the historic global agreement reached by 195 countries in 2015 to set targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and limiting the rise in average global temperatures.

During a news conference Thursday in the Rose Garden at the White House, Trump said the withdrawal is aimed at keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first. But he added that the U.S. would begin negotiations to possibly re-enter the Paris accord or a similar deal that, he said, would result in a better deal for American workers.

""The agreement is a massive redistribution of United States' wealth to other countries,"" Trump said. ""It's to give their country an economic edge over the United States. That's not going to happen while I'm president. I'm sorry.""

He later added: ""Our withdrawal from the agreement represents a reassertion of American workers' sovereignty.""

During his campaign, Trump vowed to ""cancel"" U.S. participation in the deal. World leaders and business figures had recently urged him to reconsider, but by Wednesday morning, reports began to surface that Trump had decided to leave the pact.

Barack Obama had used his authority as president to join the Paris accord without a vote in Congress. That means Trump can remove the U.S. from the accord without a vote. But it will take awhile: Under the terms of the agreement, he wouldn't actually be able to withdraw until November 2020.

Leaving the underlying treaty — the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — would be faster and could be completed within a year. But that treaty was ratified by the U.S. Senate. Presidents have unilaterally exited Senate-ratified treaties before, but it's rare and controversial.

Urged to stay, urged to leave

A wide chorus of voices had called for Trump to recommit to the Paris agreement: other world leaders and hundreds of scientists, of course, but also CEOs of major energy companies and other big U.S. corporations. Even many of Trump's own advisers support the deal, according to The New York Times.

But those supporting a departure won out. More than 20 Republican senators had called for Trump to leave the deal. Influential Trump advisers, reportedly Steve Bannon and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, also urged him to withdraw.

And then, of course, there was the argument advanced by candidate Trump. On the campaign trail, he criticized the agreement that the U.S. formally signed on to last year. He called the deal ""unfair"" to the U.S., objecting in particular to the requirement that wealthy nations help developing countries build renewable energy sources.

He remained consistent with those criticisms Thursday.

""I cannot in good conscience support a deal that punishes the United States, which is what it does, while imposing no meaningful obligations on the world's leading polluters,"" Trump said — singling out China and India by name.

""In short, the agreement doesn't eliminate coal jobs, it just transfers those jobs out of America and the United States and ships them to foreign countries,"" he added. ""This agreement is less about the climate and more about other countries gaining a financial advantage over the United States.""

Though in his announcement Trump referred to himself as ""someone who cares deeply about the environment,"" he has signaled, more broadly, that fighting climate change is not a priority for his administration. He has denied the existence of climate change and appointed as the head of the EPA a man who doesn't accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And he has already overturned several Obama-era efforts to reduce emissions.

A hard-fought diplomatic agreement

The Paris accord was reached in 2015 after lengthy negotiations. The deal relies on voluntary cuts in emissions by all member nations.

The agreement also, significantly, sets a global target to keep the rise in the average temperature to no higher than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And it calls for some $100 billion a year in funding from developed countries toward developing countries to support green energy sources.

Still, it fell short of what some parties had hoped for. Island nations — which face an existent threat from rising seawaters — had pushed hard for a target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. (Why not even lower? Well, as of 2015, the global average temperature had already risen by 1 degree Celsius, and even with robust efforts to cut emissions, some further increase is essentially inevitable.)

And the agreement relies on voluntary cuts in emissions, seen by some critics as a major weakness.

Still, the fact that the world managed to agree on a target was celebrated as a diplomatic achievement, one that multiple world leaders have emphasized as crucial to support. After the recent G-7 meetings of leading industrial nations, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and vocally supported her commitment to action on climate change.

Modi said failing to act on climate change would be ""a morally criminal act."" Merkel had previously vowed to ""convince the doubters"" among world leaders that ""protecting the climate matters to all of us.""

The doubters are in the minority. Only two countries — Syria and Nicaragua — have completely rejected the deal.

Several dozen countries have signed but not fully approved — including Iran, Turkey and, most significantly, Russia, which is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. But three-quarters of the countries on Earth have fully committed to the accord.

A pact in name or in deed?

It is important to note that the Paris accord is only as strong as each nation's actual reduction in emissions. That means leaving the agreement isn't the only way to weaken it: Trump could have kept the U.S. as a signatory but continued to slash the programs that would actually make it possible to reach the target for emissions.

The opposite is also true: U.S. greenhouse gas emissions could continue to go down, at least in the short term, even as Trump withdraws from the accord.

As NPR's Christopher Joyce recently reported, emissions in the U.S. have declined by about 12 percent since 2005.

Environment Market Forces May Impact Emissions More Than Climate Agreements Market Forces May Impact Emissions More Than Climate Agreements Listen · 3:38 3:38

""The U.S. has successfully bent its greenhouse gas emissions curve,"" Kate Larsen, of the economics research team Rhodium Group, told Christopher. ""And we are going to continue to reduce emissions over the next 10 years, likely regardless of Trump policy.""

But while the Paris accord isn't synonymous with U.S. emissions cuts, that doesn't mean Trump's decision on the accord is meaningless.

Economist Marc Hafstead, who is with Resources for the Future, told Christopher that exiting the deal ""could potentially have political ramifications — to the extent that our pulling out of the agreement is going to cause other countries to do less.""

It would also threaten the $100 billion a year pledged to help developing countries achieve emissions cuts, as Bloomberg has reported.

Meanwhile, many analysts see a U.S. departure from the deal as paving the way for China to take the lead on climate change.

It's not just a question of intangible moral leadership or even of the potential profits from green energy that would be on the table. The Atlantic reported last year that a U.S. departure would likely result in less-transparent mechanisms for actually enforcing the Paris accord — because Chinese ""faulty and unreliable energy statistics"" could play a prominent role.

By staying in the deal, the U.S. would have kept a spot at the negotiating table — and potential influence over how the agreement is enforced.

Reaction in the U.S.

Obama decried Trump's decision in a statement released Thursday.

""The nations that remain in the Paris Agreement will be the nations that reap the benefits in jobs and industries created,"" the former president said.

He added: ""I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.""

John Kerry, Obama's secretary of state and a key player in crafting the Paris agreement, also denounced the U.S. withdrawal as ""a self-destructive step that puts our nation last.""

""This is an unprecedented forfeiture of American leadership which will cost us influence, cost us jobs, and invite other countries to walk away from solving humanity's most existential crisis,"" he said in a statement Thursday. ""It isolates the United States after we had united the world.""

Even before Trump announced his final decision, Democrats in the U.S. decried withdrawal as ""a low point in modern American leadership,"" as Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., put it.

On Wednesday, Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., wrote on Twitter that it would be ""catastrophic for the President to cede our leadership on this issue.""

Some Republicans in Congress, including several representing districts particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, also rebuked reports of Trump's decision. ""Climate change is a serious issue,"" tweeted Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida — with a photo of development near a Florida beach.

In a tweet Thursday, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk announced that Trump's withdrawal from the deal means Musk will be withdrawing, as well — from the president's business advisory council.

But GOP Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma strongly defended the decision to leave the accord.

""The main thing is, it's something that we couldn't do; it'd be impossible to do,"" he told Here & Now. ""It's necessary, then, to make sure that we don't have a bunch of people out there suing us because we're not doing what the president said we're supposed to do.""

And in a statement, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy applauded the move, calling it the ""right call"":

""The previous Administration refused to recognize that private innovation and American natural gas have achieved more than government mandates and misguided international agreements — and that naiveté led President Obama to sign a climate deal that will impose great costs with little gain. President Trump made the right call in leaving a deal that would have put an unnecessary burden on the United States.""

Reaction from beyond U.S. borders

Immediately after Trump's speech, France, Germany and Italy issued a joint statement announcing that the accord could not be renegotiated, as Trump said he would try to do.

French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Trump briefly by phone, expressing that fact directly to him and saying France would no longer be working with the U.S. on climate issues, The Associated Press reports.

A spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres called Trump's decision ""a major disappointment for global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote global security.""

""The Secretary-General remains confident that cities, states and businesses within the United States — along with other countries — will continue to demonstrate vision and leadership by working for the low-carbon, resilient economic growth that will create quality jobs and markets for 21st century prosperity,"" the spokesman said in a statement.

The United States' northern neighbor weighed in as well.

""Canada is deeply disappointed at the U.S. position,"" the country's environment minister, Catherine McKenna, told reporters Thursday. ""The Paris agreement is a good deal for Canada, and it's a good deal for the world. No one country can stop action on climate change."""

Updated on Tuesday at 5:35 p.m. ET

Stephen Craig Paddock, the 64-year-old white man who police say carried out the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history Sunday night on the Las Vegas Strip moved frequently, buying and selling property in several states. But the twice-divorced retiree had one vein that seems to run through the middle of his itinerant lifestyle — a love of gambling.

Police say that on Sunday night, Paddock broke out windows in a 32nd-story hotel room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino and pulled the trigger, raining a hail of gunfire on concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival across the street. Witnesses described what followed as ""nonstop gunfire"" that sent people fleeing for their lives.

At least 59 people were killed and more than 500 injured.

Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said shooter, described by authorities as a ""lone wolf,"" checked into his room at the Mandalay on Thursday, but that police did not know what he had been doing in the days leading up to the shooting. Lombardo called Paddock ""a psychopath.""

But in a news conference on Tuesday, Lombardo said authorities still did not have a motive for the shooting.

Paddock's brother, Eric seemed to rule out any ideological motive for his brother's actions. Asked if Stephen had been agitated about politics, he replied: ""No religious affiliation. No political affiliation. He just hung out.""

He did say that his brother liked to play high-stakes video poker. ""He was a guy. He gambled,"" Eric, who lives in Orlando, Fla., told reporters Monday.

Although Stephen Paddock had lived for several years in California and briefly in Florida, in recent years, Paddock seemed to gravitate to Nevada — specifically the gambling cities Las Vegas and Reno, which is where he may have met Marilou Danley, the woman described by authorities as his companion. His last address was in Mesquite, about 90 miles from Las Vegas.

He had another home in Reno, where Danley had worked as a ""high-limit hostess"" in the Atlantis Casino Resort and Spa, the casino said in a statement. Although Atlantis did not confirm the dates of her employment — reportedly from 2010 to 2013 — it did say she had left the job ""several years ago.""

Records show that a few years after moving into Paddock's condominium in Reno, Danley, an Australian citizen with family in the Philippines, divorced her husband of 25 years. Paddock sold the condo unit in Dec. 2016. Public records for Paddock show his first marriage was in 1977. He divorced in 1980. He married again in 1985 and was divorced from his second wife just five years later.

In 2013, Paddock bought a newly built property in Melbourne, Fla. NPR's Pam Fessler spoke to a neighbor there, Sharon Judy, who lived next door. Paddock told Judy that he bought the house for speculation and that ""he wouldn't be living there, but he would come and visit."" She described him as friendly and said he gave her a key to the house so she could check in occasionally.

""He was very open with us that he bought the house for speculation, that he bought other homes for speculation,"" Judy tells NPR. He also told her, ""he was a professional gambler, he and Marilou both, and that's what they did. They traveled around, they gambled, they speculated on property.""

Judy said the couple would stay at the house for a few days at a time and then leave.

Paddock ""never talked politics or religion,"" she said. The couple told her that they gambled online and when they were at the house, they didn't wake until noon or 1 p.m., ""because they were up all night gambling.""

One other detail: ""They would both talk about how they would go back to the Philippines and visit [her] family,"" Judy says.

NBC News says that Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines last week, but NPR has not independently verified that report. NBC says that Danley traveled to the Philippines on Sept. 25 via Hong Kong. Separately, USA Today reports that authorities were looking into ""recent transfers of large amounts of money involving the suspect and the possible relationship to gambling activities.""

Lombardo on Tuesday confirmed that Danley was in the Philippines and said she is currently considered ""a person of interest."" He said he did not know about the reported wire transfer.

Eric Paddock, who spoke with Amy Green from member station WMFE, said he doesn't think Danley will be able to provide much information about his brother's mental state in the lead up to the attack.

He said he thinks his brother probably ""bubbled her from this completely.""

In a story published Monday, Eric told The Orlando Sentinel, that his brother had ""never even drawn his gun before."" He told CNN that Paddock owned ""a couple of handguns.""

But that picture was at odds with what police found in the shooter's hotel room and residence: ""We have recovered 23 firearms at Mandalay Bay, and 19 firearms at his home in Mesquite [Nv.],"" Las Vegas Assistant Sheriff Todd Fasulo said.

As NPR's Richard Gonzales reports: ""the office of Rep. Adam Schiff, (D-Calif.) said that he had been briefed by the FBI and informed that some, but not all of the weapons found in the hotel room were fully automatic. It was not clear whether those weapons were manufactured as fully automatic or whether Paddock had converted them.""

In the news conference on Tuesday, Lombardo said he could not say if any of the weapons were automatic, but ""we are aware of a device known as a 'bump stock'"" that allows a user to increase the fire rate of a semi-automatic weapon.

Two Nevada gun shops confirmed that the shooter had bought weapons from them, apparently in the past year. One of the shops, Guns and Guitars in Mesquite, issued a statement saying that ""all necessary background checks and procedures were followed.""

Mesquite lies near the border with Arizona and Utah. Chris Michel, the owner of another gun shop in St. George, Utah, met and spoke with Paddock three times earlier this year.

Speaking to NPR's Howard Berkes, Michel says that the number of weapons Paddock owned was not all that unusual. ""I have customers that have hundreds of guns,"" he says.

Sheriff Lombardo said Monday that Paddock might have had a traffic citation — but had no criminal history in the state and that there were no immediate indications of such a history elsewhere.

Lombardo said several pounds of ammonium nitrate, a chemical compound used in bomb-making, was found in Paddock's car. On Tuesday, the sheriff said ""numerous electronics, two handguns, five shot guns and a plethora of ammunition"" were found at Paddock's Reno residence.

He said the shooter had installed cameras outside and inside the room, apparently to monitor for the approach of authorities. ""I don't know the specific numbers,"" he said.

For years, Paddock held a private pilot's license. He had owned two different single-engine airplanes, selling the last more than a decade ago. Records show he allowed his license to expire in 2010. He also had a hunting and fishing license for Alaska.

Paddock's family also apparently has a dark past: Eric Paddock said his father held up multiple banks, broke out of prison and spent several years on the FBI's most wanted list. Speaking in an interview with CNN, he said sarcastically: ""We're all proud. My father was on the Top 10 list for a while.""

NPR has not independently confirmed that Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, the man from the Most Wanted poster, is the father of Stephen and Eric Paddock. A report in The Chicago Tribune from June 1969 states that a Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, then 42, was being added to the ""10 most wanted men"" list. It said the suspect had ""once tried to run down an FBI agent with his car"" and that Paddock, ""known as 'Chrome Dome' in underworld circles because of his practice of shaving his head, has been diagnosed as a 'psychopath.' ""

Eric Paddock said of his father: ""I didn't know him; we didn't know him. He was in jail,"" adding that his father had ""broken out of jail.""

FBI Las Vegas Special Agent in Charge Aaron Rouse said at a news conference that the bureau has ""determined, to this point, no connection with an international terrorist group."" He was responding to reports that Paddock had recently converted to Islam and that the terrorist group Islamic State had claimed responsibility for the Las Vegas Strip attack.

A Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department undersheriff called the attack an act of ""domestic terrorism."""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sylvia Poggioli/NPR Sylvia Poggioli/NPR

Tourism is booming in Italy, which welcomed close to 50 million visitors over the summer. That has helped some places that have been struggling to survive. But for one destination, it might be too much of a good thing.

Civita di Bagnoregio is in the northern corner of the Lazio region, 75 miles north of Rome, tucked between Tuscany and Umbria.

On the road, signposts point the way to ""Civita, The Town That Is Dying.""

And in fact, not so long ago, Civita was at death's door — shrinking because of erosion and landslides and in need of constant restoration.

Then, in 2013, the town took a bold step: It became the first (and perhaps the only) Italian town to charge visitors an entry fee.

The result? Civita has become an international tourist destination.

At 10 a.m. on a Sunday in late September, visitors leave their cars and tour buses at a parking lot at the edge of the town of Bagnoregio and set off on foot. At the bottom of a steep cliff, there is already a long line at the ticket booth.

On weekends and holidays, the fee is about $6. On weekdays, it's $3.50. On major holidays such as Easter and May 1, the number of day-trippers can reach 10,000 to 15,000.

Visitors to Civita are warned to carry as little as possible because it is a tough trek across a long, winding and very steep footbridge.

At the top, a fairy tale hamlet floats in the clouds — below it, a stunning landscape of deep, clay-colored canyons.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Sylvia Poggioli/NPR Sylvia Poggioli/NPR

After passing beneath the Gothic Archway of Porta Santa Maria and catching one's breath, the first stop is the Geological Museum of Landslides.

Numerous maps and exhibits show Civita's gradual reduction since the ancient Etruscans founded the town on volcanic rock 2,500 years ago. It's estimated that today's Civita is just one-third of the original settlement: It's 500 feet long and 300 wide.

Its big decline, says geologist Luca Costantini, began with a strong earthquake in 1695, when some 3,000 people lived here.

""A little by little, they go away,"" he says. ""Now the number of people who live in Civita is 10 persons. In the future, the city can disappear.""

The cause is erosion. The mountain's sides are melting away, plummeting to the canyons below.

Three million years ago, Costantini explains, this was a large inland sea. Some 500,000 years ago, that sea disappeared when a nearby volcano erupted. Lava and ash spewed out, creating a plateau of volcanic tufa rock. Gradually, the surrounding landscape evolved into steep, chalk-colored canyons — called calanchi in Italian — that create an otherworldly atmosphere.

""The landscape of the calanchi, those cliffs, is a lunar landscape,"" says landscape architect Thomas Allsop.

A native of Seattle who first came here on a study grant two years ago, Allsop says Civita's fragility is due to a soft clay layer that is giving way under the hard volcanic rock.

One building that slid down the cliffs long ago was the 13th century birthplace of St. Bonaventure, Civita's favorite son.

An average five to 20 landslides per year leave Civita perching precariously above a crumbling precipice. Nevertheless, several Romans and Americans have bought homes and spend summers here.

And the small town is packed with charm. Old stone walls are draped with clinging vines. Well-tended flowerpots are lined up on balconies and staircases. There is also the occasional surreal glimpse: a medieval façade with wooden door still intact and the bright blue sky visible through the window above — a sign the rest of the building is long gone.

Residents and those nearby want to keep the town alive, but that requires constant restoration. To fund it, the town introduced the tourist toll in 2013.

Paradoxically, the visitors fee has proven to be an extraordinary tourist magnet. Mayor Francesco Bigiotti says he is getting calls from other Italian towns that would like to do the same.

""Four years ago, before the entry fee,"" says Bigiotti, ""we had 40,000 annual visitors. At the end of this year, we forecast 850,000.""

The fresh funds allowed the elimination of local taxes and there is close to zero unemployment, thanks to 200 new startups in the region. But the town cannot provide sufficient services for such large numbers — it has only a few cafés and restaurants and two public toilets.

One booming business is Maurizio Rocchi's restaurant Almacivita. His family roots here go back to the 16th century and he is proud that Civita is flourishing. But living and working here, he says, is tough.

With no pharmacy, post office or shops, he has to trek across the footbridge to neighboring Bagnoregio every day to buy everything.

""So you really have to plan your day, every day, very well,"" he says. ""You cannot forget anything, because there are no markets up here.""

It's not just the visitors entry fee that has attracted tourists. American travel writer Rick Steves has written that Civita is his favorite Italian hill town — an endorsement that draws American and Canadian tourists in droves.

There is also a very large contingent of Japanese tourists. On this Sunday, they include a bride and groom having their photos taken on the footbridge.

The Japanese are said to be drawn here by an 1986 animated movie, Laputa: Castle in the Sky, by famed Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. He was reportedly inspired by his visit to Civita.

By 3 p.m., there are some 6,000 visitors jamming Civita's narrow cobblestone streets. There are lines everywhere.

American architect Tony Heywood laments ""the masses of people who come on weekends, and the noise and confusion.""

Heywood first came here with his wife in the 1960s. Now one of Civita's 10 permanent residents, he acknowledges tourism has been good for some townspeople.

""Some are profiting from it, but not everybody,"" he says. ""And the very reason some people came here was to get away from this.""

Civita's survival has always depended on the forces of nature. Now the town is a candidate for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. But UNESCO is promoting sustainable tourism. So Civita may face a new challenge: limiting its number of daily visitors."

Seit 1958 landen Verkehrsteilnehmer, die der Straßenverkehrsordnung grob zuwider handeln, im Verkehrszentralregister des Kraftfahrtbundesamtes in Flensburg. Im Zuge einer Reform heißt die Sammelstelle ab 1. Mai 2014 Fahreignungsregister und parallel dazu tritt auch ein neuer Bußgeldkatalog in Kraft.

Die wichtigsten Fragen rund um die Neuordnung beantwortet SPIEGEL ONLINE:

Was ändert sich am Punktesystem?

Ab dem 1. Mai 2014 gilt in Flensburg ein neues Punktesystem. Verstöße werden je nach Schwere künftig nur noch mit 1 bis 3 Punkten geahndet, statt wie bisher mit 1 bis 7 Punkten. Allerdings wird der Führerschein künftig bereits ab 8 Punkten eingezogen, statt wie bisher bei 18 Punkten. Die bereits vorhandenen Punkte werden zum Stichtag 1. Mai umgerechnet, und zwar folgendermaßen: 1 bis 3 ""alte"" Punkte entsprechen künftig 1 Punkt im neuen System, 4 oder 5 Punkte werden zu 2 Punkten, 6 oder 7 Punkte zu 3 Punkten, 8 bis 10 Punkte zu 4 Punkten, 11 bis 13 Punkte zu 5 Punkten, 14 oder 15 Punkte zu 6 Punkten und 16 oder 17 Punkte zu 7 Punkten im neuen System umgerechnet.

Was wird im Verkehrszentralregister eingetragen?

Als Verkehrsteilnehmer erhält man einen Eintrag im neuen Fahreignungsregister in Flensburg, sobald man entweder eine Ordnungswidrigkeit begangen hat, die laut Verkehrsrecht im Bußgeldkatlog nach der neuen Regelung ab dem 1. Mai 2014 mit einem Bußgeld von 60 Euro (derzeit: 40 Euro) oder mehr geahndet wird. In diesem Fall werden automatisch auch ein oder mehrere Punkte eingetragen. Punkte kassiert ebenso, wer eine Straftat in Zusammenhang mit dem Führen eines Kfz begangen und damit die Verkehrssicherheit direkt gefährdet hat. Hierzu zählen beispielsweise das Fahren ohne Fahrerlaubnis, Trunkenheit am Steuer oder Fahrerflucht.

Was wird nach der Reform am 1. Mai 2014 nicht mehr eingetragen?

Entsprechend der Vereinfachung des Punktesystems werden künftig nur noch Verkehrsverstöße im neuen Fahreignungsregister gespeichert, die als gefährlich eingestuft werden. Ordnungswidrigkeiten wie etwa das unerlaubte Befahren einer Umweltzone ziehen künftig keinen Eintrag mehr nach sich. Auch Straftaten wie Beleidigung im Straßenverkehr werden künftig nicht mehr im Register vermerkt.

Damit die nicht mehr eintragungspflichtigen Verstöße nicht als Kavaliersdelikte wahrgenommen werden, wurden die entsprechenden Bußgelder zum Teil drastisch erhöht. Das unberechtigte Befahren einer Umweltzone etwa kostet künftig 80 Euro, das Missachten des Fußgänger-Vorrechts an einem Zebrastreifen 120 Euro (obwohl in beiden Fällen keine Punkte eingetragen werden).

Was bedeutet die Neuerung für bestehende Eintragungen im Register?

Bestehende Verstöße, die nach dem neuen Recht nicht mehr eingetragen würden, werden zum 1. Mai 2014 automatisch gelöscht. Ein Beispiel: Aktuell weist ein Konto 10 Punkte auf, von denen 5 aufgrund von Beleidigung im Straßenverkehr erteilt wurden. Da dieser Tatbestand nach der neuen Regelung nicht mehr eintragungsfähig ist, werden diese Punkte gelöscht und das Konto schrumpft auf 5 Punkte. Diese werden ins neue System umgerechnet und belaufen sich dann noch auf 2 Punkte. Aufgrund dieser Erlassung könnten nach Schätzung des Autoclubs ""Mobil in Deutschland"" von den derzeit rund 9 Millionen eingetragenen Verkehrssündern etwa 1 Million ganz aus der Kartei verschwinden.

Wie viele Punkte gibt es für Verkehrsverstöße?

Derzeit werden für Ordnungswidrigkeiten je nach Schwere 1 bis 4 Punkte und für Straftaten 5 bis 7 Punkte eingetragen. Mit der Neuregelung gelten künftig drei Abstufungen: Einen Punkt gibt es für Ordnungswidrigkeiten, 2 Punkte für grobe Ordnungswidrigkeiten mit Regelfahrverbot sowie für Straftaten ohne Entziehung der Fahrerlaubnis. Eine Straftat mit Entziehung der Fahrerlaubnis wird mit der Eintragung von 3 Punkten geahndet.

Wie erfahre ich meinen Punktestand?

Jeder Autofahrer hat das Recht auf eine kostenlose Auskunft über seinen Punktestand im Fahreignungsregister. Dabei müssen jedoch gewisse Formalitäten beachtet werden. So kann der Antrag ausschließlich schriftlich per Post, nicht aber per Fax gestellt werden. Auch telefonische Auskünfte sind nicht möglich. Das zur Abfrage notwendige Formular gibt es auf der Homepage des Kraftfahrtbundesamtes (KBA). Der Personalausweis muss in Kopie mitgeschickt oder vor Ort vorgezeigt werden. Wer schon einen neuen Personalausweis mit Datenchip hat, kann den Kontostand auch online abfragen.

Wie ändern sich die Tilgungsfristen?

Derzeit bleiben Ordnungswidrigkeiten 2 Jahre, Straftaten 5 Jahre und Straftaten mit Fahrerlaubnisentzug mindestens 10 Jahre eingetragen. Neue Verkehrsverstöße können dabei zur Verlängerung der Eintragungsdauer von bis zu 5 Jahren führen. Die neue Regelung sieht starre Tilgungsfristen vor, die sich nicht durch neue Eintragungen verlängern. Ordnungswidrigkeiten mit einem Punkt bleiben künftig 2,5 Jahre eingetragen. Ordnungswidrigkeiten oder Straftaten die mit 2 Punkten belegt wurden bleiben jeweils 5 Jahre und Straftaten mit 3 Punkten 10 Jahre im Register bestehen.

Ist ein Abbau der Punkte möglich?

Die Möglichkeit, Punkte abzubauen bleibt auch nach neuem Recht bestehen: Bei einem Stand von 1 bis 5 Punkten kann durch die freiwillige Teilnahme an einem etwa 400 ? teuren Fahreignungsseminar 1 Punkt abgebaut werden. Wer noch nach altem Recht ein Aufbauseminar oder eine verkehrspsychologische Schulung freiwillig absolviert hat, dessen Rabatt wird bei der Umstellung der alten Punkte berücksichtigt. Punkte durch eine freiwillige Seminarteilnahme können allerdings nur einmal binnen fünf Jahren abgebaut werden.

Was ändert sich mit dem neuen Bußgeldkatalog?

Das bisherige Bußgeldsystem gehört zu einem der kompliziertesten Bereiche des Straßenverkehrsrechts. Der neue Bußgeldkatalog soll einfacher, gerechter und transparenter werden und dazu auf eine Erhöhung der Verkehrssicherheit abzielen. Die Eintragungsgrenze für Delikte, die einen Eintrag ins Register und somit auch Punkte nach sich ziehen, wird von 40 Euro auf 60 Euro angehoben.

Welche Verstöße werden mit der Punktereform teurer?

Um möglichst alle Verstöße, die die Verkehrssicherheit stark gefährden, künftig ins Fahreignungsregister eintragen zu können, werden die entsprechenden Bußgelder auf mindestens 60 Euro angehoben. Beispielsweise beim Telefonieren mit dem Mobiltelefon am Steuer, der Verstoß gegen die Winterreifenpflicht oder die Missachtung der Kindersicherungspflicht künftig mit 60 statt bislang mit 40 Euro geahndet. Beim Missachten der Vorfahrt, dem Fahren ohne Zulassung oder einem Versäumnis der Hauptuntersuchung von mehr als 8 Monaten müssen statt bisher 50 dann 70 Euro Bußgeld gezahlt werden.

Bußgelder für überhöhte Geschwindigkeit

Tempoüberschreitungen innerorts von bis zu 20 km/h kosten maximal 35 Euro, ab 21 km/h Überschreitung werden 80 Euro Bußgeld und ein Punkt fällig. Ab 31 km/h zu viel auf dem Tacho steigt das Bußgeld auf 160 Euro, es werden 2 Punkte eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Geschwindigkeitsüberschreitungen außerorts bis 20 km/h kosten 30 Euro, ab 21km/h steigt das Bußgeld auf 70 Euro und es wird 1 Punkt eingetragen und ab 41 km/h zu viel werden 160 Euro fällig, zwei Punkte eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Bußgelder für Rotlichtverstöße

Wer bei rot über eine Ampel fährt, zahlt 90 Euro und bekommt 1 Punkt. Steht die Ampel bei Überquerung schon länger als eine Sekunde auf rot, kostet es 200 Euro, 2 Punkte werden eingetragen und der Fahrer erhält einen Monat Fahrverbot.

Bußgelder bei Alkohol oder Drogen am Steuer

Fahren im Rauschzustand wird richtig teuer. Wer sich mit 0,5 Promille oder mehr hinters Lenkrad setzt oder unter Drogeneinfluss ein Auto fährt, muss mit einem Bußgeld von 500 Euro und der Eintragung von 2 Punkten rechnen, dazu kommt noch ein einmonatiges Fahrverbot. Bei Wiederholung in beiden Fällen steigt die Strafe auf 1000 Euro, 2 Punkte und drei Monate Fahrverbot.

Wie und wann kann man Widerspruch einlegen?

Innerhalb von zwei Wochen ab Zustellung kann sowohl gegen einen Bußgeldbescheid als auch gegen einen Strafbefehl Einspruch eingelegt werden. Wird diese Frist nicht beachtet, wird der Bescheid rechtskräftig. Wurde Einspruch eingelegt, entscheidet ein Gericht den Fall - es sei denn, die Behörde gibt dem Einspruch statt oder der Beschuldigte zieht den Einspruch vorher zurück."

Wenn Amerikaner den Vietnam-Krieg ""nachspielen"" wollen, sollen sie aber bitte auch Agent Orange einsetzen. Nur so können sie erleben, was die USA dem vietnamesischen Volk angetan hat. Die Folgen des Einsatzes dieser Chemiewaffe haben noch heute die Neugeborenen in Vietnam durch Missbildungen zu ertragen. Die USA sollte zur Verantwortung der Folgen dieses Krieges stehen. Aber es ist natürlich bequemer, den Dschungelkampf und die ""glorreichen Einsätze"" der US-Armee nachzuspielen. Entlaubungsmittel 2,4,5,T, genannt Agent Orange, war zu jener Zeit in Deutschland zur Bekaempfung von breitblaettrigen Unkraeutern auf Getreideaeckern zugelassen. Deutsche Bauern, sowie andere Bauern rund um den Globus haben dieses Herbizid versprueht.



Als die US Streitkraefte grosse Mengen davon bestellten, um in Vietnam Waelder zu entlauben, aenderte der Herstellers das Produktionsverfahren um mehr Profit einzuheimsen, wobei sich unerwuenschte Nebenprodukte aus der chemischen Familie der Dioxine bildeten.



Die Einkaeufer der US Armee haben nur auf den Wirkstoffgehalt getestet, nicht auf unerwuenschte Nebenprodukte, festgestellt, dass die Ware den Spezifikationen entspricht, die Rechnungen des Herstellers bezahlt und das Entlaubungsmittel nach Vietnam geliefert. Da Dioxine nicht akut giftig sind, Schaeden erst nach Wochen oder Monaten, manchmal sogar erst nach Jahren, auftreten, wurde lange nicht begriffen, welche Schweinerei hier im Gange war. Die ersten Betroffenen waren die Mannschaften, welche die Spritzflugzeuge damit beladen haben.



Aber die eigentliche Schweinerei war nicht nur, dass der Hersteller zusaetzlichen Profit absahnen wollte, sondern, dass der Generalstab der USA die Idee Waelder zu entlauben ueberhaupt in die Praxis umgesetzt hat.



Das war auch aus militaersiche Gruenden schon Unsinn und aus Umweltgruenden verwerflich.

Dass Champagner viel zu teuer sind - sowohl die qualitativ schlechten als auch die wirklich guten - konnte man in der Region die letzten Jahrzehnte sehen: die vor 30, 40 Jahren ungepflegten Häuser in vielen der halbverlassenen Dörfern der Champagne sind wieder super herausgeputzt, renoviert. Oder einfach die Most-Preise vergleichen. Es gibt sehr gute Alternativen die nicht aus der Champagne kommen, aber eben - keiner schlägt die Dachgesellschaft der Champagner-Hersteller wenn es darum geht die Marke ""Champagner"" nicht nur zu schützen sondern auf den Märkten durchzusetzen."

Wieviele Kinder auf der Welt warten auf Eltern...Hormontherapien sind nicht ohne Nebenwirkungen und es stellt sich wirklich die Frage ob es man diese Belastungen auf sich nehmen muss.

Es muss nicht immer alles um jeden Preis sein. Die kosten den Krankenkassen an zu lasten ist falsch da es sich nicht eine Krankheit handelt sondern um einen unerfüllten Wunsch. Das wäre genauso wie bei Schönheitsoperationen bei denen auch keine medizinische Indikation vorliegt.

Man muss genau abwägen was das marode Gesundheitssystem noch tragen kann, da viele Kranke schon drastisch zuzahlen müssen und eine LEBENSNOTWENDIGE Therapie brauchen welche nun bei ein unerfüllten Kinderwunsch definitiv nicht gegeben ist."

http://www.spiegel.de/forum/thread-125984.html,"['Spiegel Online', 'Hamburg']",,[],,"Das Problem begann aus meiner Sicht, als Werder sich von dem jahrelang erfolgreichen Prinzip, nicht mehr Geld auszugeben,als reinkam verbaschiedete. Lange wurden altgediente aber inzwischen günstige Recken wie Burgsmüller, Allofs oder Kostedde mit damals jungen noch günstigen Spielern wie Völler,Riedle,Basler,Ailton sowie international erfahrenen Ausländern wie Bratseth,Herzog,Pezzey, Micoud zu einer alle Bereiche abdeckenden Mannschaft geformt. Erst als man Anfing viel Geld in die Hand zu nehmen (Carlos Alberto,Wesley etc) und sich kaum noch für den Nachwuchs interressierte gings bergab. Als Folge müssen Spieler wie Clemens Fritz, die nicht einmal mehr entfernt die alten Listungen bringen oder Spieler wie Prödl als Einäugiger untern den Blinden das Gerüst bilden. Das kann nicht gutgehen. Im Übrigen wurden wirkliche Talente wie zB Kruse nicht als solche erkannt. Wehmütig vermisst man deshalb das gute Auge für Speiler, wie es ein Kalli Kamp besaß. Aber auch in der leitung scheint es nicht rund zu laufen. Während sich in der erfolgreichen Zeit eine klare Trennung von sportlichen Entscheidungen und geschäftsleitung immer wieder bewährt hat, wird heute, ähnlich wie beim HSV, von allen Seiten mitentschieden und hineingeredet. Das Klare Konzept jedenfalls ist auf der Strecke geblieben. So bewunderswert die Ruhe in Bremen immer wieder sein mag,hinzu kommt auch ein sich seit Jahren wiederholdendes Schönreden der Dauerkrise. Man ertappst sich auch als Fan gelegentlich dabei, den Gedanken eines Abstieges und völligem Neuanfang gar nicht für so unsymphatisch zu halten. Ob Eichin und Dutt die Richtigen dazu sind ist höchst zweifelhaft. Die Tatsache, daß Frank Baumann seine Scouting-Funktion zum Herbst aufgibt,läßt zumindest schon einmal hoffen."

Wenn bei uns die Einbrüche zunehmen, dann kann ich persönlich gegen die Ursachen - welche auch immer das sind - nicht viel tun. Aber ich kann mir eine Alarmanlage kaufen. Und genau die gleiche Logik steckt hinter dem Wunsch nach Waffenbesitz - neben solchen Faktoren wie amerikanische Tradition und Freiheitsanspruch. Die USA sind ein gespaltenes Land. Die unterschiedlichen Volksgruppen sind nicht integriert, sondern leben nebeneinander her und verachten sich teilweise gegenseitig. Im Schmelztiegel sind keineswegs alle zu ""Amerikanern"" verschmolzen, sondern die Rassen definieren sich immer noch auch im Gegeneinander. Weiße verachten Farbige und Farbige Weiße - und für so manchen Native American (Indianer) sind die Weißen immer noch die Eroberer und Farbige deren Helfer (Buffalo Soldiers). Kein Wunder, dass das Gefühl von ""Feinden"" umgeben zu sein, bei vielen vorhanden ist.

Und so fremd ist das gar nicht: Kürzlich sah ich ein Interview mit einem Inhaber eines Waffengeschäftes in Deutschland(!). Er erzählte, dass es oft vorkommt, dass Deutsche und Flüchtlinge nebeneinander stehen und Pfefferspray kaufen. Der Deutsche aus Angst vor den Flüchtlingen und der Flüchtling aus Angst vor den Deutschen. Nur reden tun die beiden nicht miteinander. Genau wie in den USA."

Mysterium Spritpreis - so tanken Sie günstig

Einmal voll tanken für einen Euro - der Traum eines jeden Autofahrers. Und er ist seit fast zwanzig Jahren Wirklichkeit: allerdings in Venezuela. Dort wird der Treibstoff zu 90 Prozent vom Staat subventioniert, was dazu führt, dass ein Liter Benzin umgerechnet weniger als zwei Cent kostet. Davon können deutsche Autofahrer nur träumen. Im vergangenen Jahr kostete ein Liter Benzin in Deutschland 1,549 Euro für Super E10 und 1,420 für Diesel. Seit Ende August 2013 müssen mehr als 14.000 Tankstellen in Deutschland ihre aktuellen Preise melden. Wie sich der Spritpreis zusammensetzt, wodurch er beeinflusst wird und wie man die Spritkosten möglichst gering halten kann - das wird im Folgenden kurz und bündig erklärt.

? Wie setzt sich der Benzinpreis zusammen?

Den größten Anteil am Benzinpreis machen Steuern aus, nämliche die Energiesteuer von 65,45 Cent pro Liter sowie die 19 Prozent Mehrwertsteuer. Hinzu kommt der Produktpreis, der für Europa an der Rohöl-Börse des Hafens in Rotterdam ermittelt wird, wo auch die Preise für Benzin, Diesel und Heizöl festgelegt werden. Des weiteren schlagen die Mineralölgesellschaften und Tankstellen ihre jeweiligen Betriebs- und Lagerkosten auf den Preis auf.

Hier ein Beispiel: Im Januar dieses Jahres kostete ein Liter Benzin für Autofahrer durchschnittlich 151,9 Cent pro Liter. Dieser Betrag setzt sich zusammen aus: 65,45 Cent Energiesteuer, zirka 51 Cent Produktpreis, 24,25 Cent Mehrwertsteuer und rund 11 Cent, die als Deckungsbeitrag bezeichnet werden. In diesen 11 Cent sind unter anderem die Betriebskosten und der Gewinn der Tankstellen enthalten.

? Welche Faktoren beeinflussen die Benzinpreise?

Der Benzinpreis unterliegt laufenden Schwankungen und variiert inzwischen mehrmals täglich. Die Preisentwicklung wird dabei vom Rohölpreis, von der Fördermenge, von der weltweiten Nachfrage, vom Wechselkurs des Euro (denn Rohöl wird in Dollar gehandelt), dem von den Mineralölgesellschaften festgelegten Produktpreis und dazu von globalen, politischen und ökonomischen Entwicklungen beeinflusst.

Steigt der Preis pro Barrel Rohöl (ein Barrel sind exakt 158,987 Liter) auf dem Weltmarkt, steigt auch der Preis des Benzins an den heimischen Tankstellen.

Ein Barrel der für den europäischen Rohölmarkt wichtigen Nordseesorte Brent kostete Anfang 2009 noch 40 Dollar, aktuell sind es rund 90 Dollar.

? Ist der Benzinpreis verantwortlich für steigende Mobilitätskosten?

Nach Angaben des Verbraucherpreisindex des Statistischen Bundesamts stiegen die Preise für die allgemeinen Mobilitätskosten im Zeitraum von 2009 bis 2013 um mehr als zehn Prozent. Dieser Preisanstieg liegt jedoch nicht allein daran, dass im gleichen Zeitraum die Preise für Diesel und Benzin um mehr als 23 Prozent gestiegen sind.

Denn zusätzlich kletterten auch die weiteren Betriebskosten für einen Pkw - etwa Reparaturen, Inspektionen sowie Kfz-Versicherungen - um durchschnittlich jeweils gut acht Prozent. Teurer wurden in diesem Zeitraum zudem Gebrauchtwagen (+0,8%), Neuwagen (+2,8 %) sowie Ersatzteile und Pflegemittel (+5,5%). Insgesamt entfällt etwa ein Drittel der gesamten Betriebskosten eines Pkw auf die Kraftstoffkosten.

? Was kann man tun, um die Spritkosten möglichst gering zu halten?

Den größten Einfluss auf den Spritverbrauch eines Fahrzeugs hat, sofern man die jeweilige Größe und Antriebskonfiguration eines Pkw als gegeben hinnimmt, das Fahrverhalten. Durch eine vorausschauende Fahrweise ohne extreme Beschleunigungen oder Verzögerungen, durch frühzeitiges Schalten in den nächst höheren Gang sowie den zurückhaltenden Einsatz von Nebenverbrauchern, wie etwa der Klimaanlage, können erhebliche Spriteinsparungen realisiert werden.

Darüber hinaus kann auch durch das Tanken zum richtigen Zeitpunkt Geld gespart werden, wie aus einer Langzeitstudie des Automobilclubs ADAC hervor geht. Die niedrigsten Spritpreise an den Tankstellen sind demnach am frühen Abend zwischen 18 und 20 Uhr zu erwarten. Laut der Markttransparenzstelle (MTS) zufolge kann ein Autofahrer in einer Stadt im Schnitt 15 bis 20 Cent pro Liter Kraftstoff sparen, wenn er die günstigste Tankstelle zum günstigsten Zeitpunkt des Tages anfährt.

Als Faustregel gilt, dass früh morgens der Sprit am teuersten ist und der Preis im Tagesverlauf eher fällt, da die Tankstellen häufig versuchen, sich gegenseitig zu unterbieten.

In den Nachtstunden wiederum sind die Preise meist hoch, weil einige - vor allem freie - Tankstellen schließen und die durchgehend geöffneten Stationen diese fehlende Konkurrenz meist nutzen, um einen höheren Preis zu verlangen. Was die Wochentage betrifft, so ist der Sonntag eine Ausnahme, denn sonntags sind die Preisschwankungen meist sehr gering.

Generell gilt, dass das Tanken am Sonntagabend nicht so billig und in der Sonntagnacht nicht so teuer ist wie zu den gleichen Zeiten von Montag bis Samstag.

? Woher bezieht Deutschland sein Rohöl?

Nach den Statistiken des Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Technologie betrugen die Rohölimporte nach Deutschland in den vergangenen Jahren rund 95 Millionen Tonnen (2012: 93,4 Mio. Tonnen). Der Löwenanteil, nämlich 37,1 Prozent des importierten Rohöls, kam aus Russland; die weiteren großen Lieferanten waren Großbritannien (14,2 Prozent), Norwegen (10,0 Prozent), Libyen (9,2 Prozent) und Nigeria (7,1 Prozent). Aus dem Nahen Osten (Saudi-Arabien, Irak, Iran) stammten nach Angaben des Ministeriums im Jahr 2012 lediglich 4,2 Prozent der Rohöl-Gesamteinfuhr.

? Lohnen sich Benzinpreis-Apps?

Wer sparen will, muss Preise vergleichen. Wie für zahlreiche Konsumgüter gibt es auch für Treibstoff entsprechende Spritpreisvergleich-Apps für das Smartphone. Angeblich informiert sich jeder vierte Deutsche auf diese Weise über die aktuellen Spritpreise.

Doch auch wenn solche Apps eine günstige Tankstelle in der näheren Umgebung anzeigen - der Umweg wegen geringer Preisunterschiede ist nicht immer sinnvoll und wirklich billiger. Ein Beispiel: Beträgt der Unterschied beim Preis pro Liter zweier Tankstellen zwei Cent, bringt das bei einer Tankfüllung von 50 Liter exakt einen Euro Ersparnis. Angenommen, der betankte Wagen verbraucht im Schnitt 6,5 Liter pro 100 Kilometer, ist bei einem Umweg von zehn Kilometern zur billigeren Tankstelle die Ersparnis durch den Mehrverbrauch schon wieder verloren."

http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/service/brutto-netto-rechner-was-von-ihrem-lohn-noch-uebrig-bleibt-a-223811.html,"['Spiegel Online', 'Hamburg']",,[],,"Das Gehalt für den neuen Job hört sich gut an. Doch wie viel Geld bleibt netto davon übrig? Welche Steuerklasse ist die günstigste, wenn beide Ehepartner arbeiten? Und wie wirkt sich ein Kinderfreibetrag aus?

All diese Fragen lassen sich mit dem Brutto-Netto-Rechner beantworten. Tragen Sie einfach Ihren Bruttolohn und Freibetrag ein, wählen Sie Steuerklasse, Bundesland und Krankenkasse. Falls Sie Kinder haben, geben Sie mögliche Kinderfreibeträge an. Je mehr Angaben Sie machen, desto genauer ist das Ergebnis.

In Kooperation mit Steuerfachanwalt Disqué

Brutto-Arbeitslohn Euro (Jahres-)Freibetrag Euro Jahr 2017 2016 2015 2014 Zeitraum Monat Jahr Steuerklasse I II III IV V VI Faktor (nur bei Stk 4) Kirchensteuerpflichtig ja nein Bundesland Baden-Württemberg Bayern Berlin Brandenburg Bremen Hamburg Hessen Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Niedersachsen Nordrhein-Westfalen Rheinland-Pfalz Saarland Sachsen Sachsen-Anhalt Schleswig-Holstein Thüringen Krankenkasse Gesetzlich versichert Privat versichert ohne Arbeitgeberzuschuss Privat versichert mit Arbeitgeberzuschuss Arbeitnehmerbeitrag zur privaten Krankenkasse Euro Kassensatz (nur gesetzliche KK) Zusatzbeitragssatz gesetzl.

Für die Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit der Tabelle sowie des ermittelten Auswertungsergebnisses wird keine Gewährleistung übernommen.

Um den Rechner benutzen zu können, müssen Sie zunächst ihre Lohnsteuerklasse kennen. Hier eine kurze Übersicht, in welche Klasse Sie gehören.

Die Lohnsteuerklasse I gilt für die folgenden Arbeitnehmer:

-Ledige

-Verwitwete ab dem übernächsten Jahr nach dem Tod des Ehepartners oder eingetragenen Lebenspartners

-Geschiedene

-Verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende, die dauernd getrennt leben

-Verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende, deren Ehegatte oder eingetragener Lebenspartner in der Bundesrepublik nur beschränkt steuerpflichtig ist (in der Regel, weil er oder sie nicht in Deutschland lebt)

Die Lohnsteuerklasse II gilt für Alleinerziehende, die die Voraussetzungen der Steuerklasse I erfüllen und die zusätzlich Anspruch auf den Entlastungsbetrag für Alleinerziehende haben.

In die Lohnsteuerklasse III fallen folgende Arbeitnehmer:

-Verheiratete und eingetragene Lebenspartner, die nicht dauernd getrennt leben und nicht die Steuerklasse IV gewählt haben. Der ebenfalls berufstätige Ehepartner oder Lebenspartner erhält dann die Steuerklasse V. Wenn der andere Partner nicht berufstätig oder selbstständig ist, gilt für ihn ebenfalls die Lohnsteuerklasse III.

-Verwitwete bis zum Ende des auf den Tod des Ehegatten/Lebenspartners folgenden Kalenderjahres. Der verstorbene Ehegatte oder Lebenspartner muss zum Zeitpunkt seines Todes unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig gewesen sein. Die Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner dürfen bis zum Zeitpunkt des Todes nicht dauernd getrennt gelebt haben.

In die Lohnsteuerklasse IV fallen verheiratete oder in Partnerschaft lebende Arbeitnehmer, wenn beide Partner unbeschränkt einkommensteuerpflichtig sind und nicht dauernd getrennt leben. Wenn allerdings für einen Partner die Steuerklasse III gilt, fällt der andere nicht in Steuerklasse IV, sondern in Steuerklasse V. Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner, die beide berufstätig sind, können die Steuerklasse einmal im Jahr ändern lassen.

Die Steuerklasse V wird angewendet, wenn beide Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner beantragen, den jeweils anderen Ehegatten oder Lebenspartner in die Steuerklasse III einzureihen (siehe oben)

Die Lohnsteuerklasse VI wird in der Regel eingetragen, wenn ein Arbeitnehmer mehr als ein Arbeitsverhältnis hat.

Wie ändern sich Ihre Finanzen, wenn Sie Ihr Leben ändern?

Mit Hilfe dieses Rechners können Sie zum Beispiel schnell und unkompliziert herausfinden, wie sich ein Jobwechsel oder eine Gehaltserhöhung auf Ihr Nettogehalt auswirken. So vermeiden sie Überraschungen, wenn sie dann tatsächlich die ersten neue Gehaltsabrechnung in Händen halten. Auch andere Veränderungen im Leben lassen sich mit Hilfe des Rechners auf ihre finanziellen Auswirkungen hin abklopfen.

Sie wollen heiraten? Dann müssen Sie sich zusammen mit Ihrem Partner überlegen, in welchen Steuerklassen Sie arbeiten wollen: Entweder der eine in III oder der andere in V oder beide in IV. Die Steuerklasse IV für beide Partner ist empfehlenswert, wenn beide ähnlich viel verdienen. Sonst eher die Kombination aus III für den einen Partner und V für den anderen. Die Steuerklassen unterscheiden sich aber nur dadurch, wie viel Steuer monatlich automatisch vom Gehalt abgezogen wird. Wer zu viel gezahlt hat, bekommt das Geld einmal im Jahr nach Abgabe seiner Steuererklärung zurück.

Sie erwarten ein Kind? Dann erhöht sich in der Regel ihr Nettogehalt durch Kinderfreibeträge und ein höheres Kindergeld.

Sie sind vom Glauben abgefallen? Dann können Sie überprüfen, ob die gesparte Kirchensteuer den Verzicht aufs ewige Seelenheil wett machen kann.

Sie erwägen, von der gesetzlichen in die private Krankenkasse wechseln? Wenn sie wissen, welchen Beitragssatz ihre neue Versicherung verlangt, können Sie anhand des Rechners überprüfen, wie sich dadurch ihr Netto-Gehalt verändert.

Allerdings sollten Sie die Frage der richtigen Krankenversicherung auf keinen Fall allein von steuerlichen Erwägungen abhängig machen. Die mögliche Steuerersparnis fällt gering aus gegenüber den gewaltigen Kosten, die eine schlecht gewählte private Krankenversicherung im Laufe der Jahre verursacht. Welche Versicherungen für Sie generell sinnvoll sind, finden Sie in unserem Überblick.

Die allermeisten Möglichkeiten zur Steuerersparnis erschließen sich nur dem, der auch eine Steuererklärung abgibt. Gerade für junge Arbeitnehmer kann das eine ziemliche Herausforderung sein. Eine Hilfestellung finden Sie hier."

11 December 2016 ? Portugal's António Guterres will soon take the reigns as the UN Secretary-General, having been appointed by the United Nations General Assembly, on 13 October 2016. He will serve for a five-year period, ending 31 December 2021.

Mr. Guterres, aged 67, was Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from June 2005 to December 2015.

The world’s next top diplomat has expressed his deep solidarity with all UN staff and looks forward to working with them around the globe.

Accepting the designation, Mr. Guterres said, “I believe this process means that the true winner today is the credibility of the UN. And it also made very clear to me that, as Secretary-General, having been chosen by all Member States, I must be at the service of them all equally and with no agenda but the one enshrined in the UN Charter.”

The next UN chief sees the need for a holistic approach to mutually-reinforcing links between the Organization’s three pillars of peace and security, sustainable development and human rights policies. “It's widely recognized,” he says “that there is no peace without development and no development without peace; it is also true that there is no peace and sustainable development without respect for human rights.”

Political solutions are primary

He believes that there are only political solutions for humanitarian problems and underscores that the UN should “ensure the primacy of political solutions at all stages, promote preventive approaches, mainstream human rights, and foster inclusive engagement and empowerment of women and girls” while highlighting that the “full participation of women is essential to the success of any peace process.”

Mr. Guterres’ strong commitment to gender parity was evident in his assertion that the UN “must be at the forefront of the global movement towards gender equality, an inalienable and indivisible feature of all human rights and fundamental freedoms: progressively moving from perceiving women and girls as a subject of protection to promoting their empowerment; from an isolated focus on women to gender mainstreaming.”

Pointing out that the world spends more energy and resources managing crises than preventing them, Mr. Guterres feels strongly about building a ""culture of prevention,"" for which the UN’s good offices and mediation capacity would act “as an honest broker, bridge builder and messenger of peace” in “a surge of diplomacy for peace” which, he says, will be his priority.

The next UN chief also holds true that peacekeeping and peacebuilding “create a unique opportunity” to develop a comprehensive, modern and effective operational peace architecture, or a peace continuum, which encompasses prevention, conflict resolution, peacekeeping, peacebuilding and long-term development.

The incoming Secretary-General hails values as the defining argument in collectively mobilizing against intolerance, violent extremism and radicalization. “Force must be used when necessary and in accordance with the Charter,” he says, adding “it is also a battle for values.""

The indispensability of partnerships, reform and innovation

Mr. Guterres believes that for multilateralism to be effective, the UN needs to develop a strong partnership culture at the three levels of: regional organizations; International Financial Institutions; and civil society and the private sector, emphasizing, “Global coherence demands a permanent strategic cooperation culture at all levels.”

Mr. Guterres maintains that the Secretary-General must promote reform and innovation, focused on delivery and results, saying “The future of the UN will be determined by its readiness to change and adapt.” He pledges “unwavering commitment to transparency, accountability and oversight,” including by “imposing the highest ethical standards on everyone serving under the UN flag.”"

http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=57483,['United Nations News Service Section'],,[],,"8 September 2017 ? As the excitement starts to build ahead of the United Nations General Assembly’s annual high-level session – which sees Heads of State and Government and top ministers from nearly all Member States gather in New York to weigh in on the vital issues of the day – Secretary-General António Guterres sat down with UN News to talk about the role of the 72-year-old Organization in a world that is facing more challenges than ever.

Mr. Guterres, the Prime Minister of Portugal from 1995 to 2002, and the former UN High Commissioner for Refugees, took up his post on 1 January this year. He has consistently pushed for, among others, increased diplomacy on nettlesome global issues, broad adherence to the aims of the landmark Paris climate accord, wider engagement with the world’s youth and dedicated efforts to ensure gender parity across the UN system.

Saying that the UN “must be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace,” the Secretary-General discusses how he is working with the international community to make parties to conflict see that “nobody is winning” in today’s devastating wars; to spotlight the links between climate change and sustainable development to ensure a globalized world that “leaves no one behind;” and to follow through on his deep belief that an equitable presence of both male and female colleagues makes organizations work better.

UN News: Mr. Secretary-General, with the new session of the General Assembly and its high-level debate coming up, what is the role of multilateralism in today’s world and what are you going to do to try to strengthen this role?

Secretary-General: We live in a world with global problems – climate change, terrorism, inequality – and there is no way we can solve [them] on a country-by-country basis. We see, more and more, that only global solutions can address global problems. And for global solutions to be possible, we need to have mechanisms of governance allowing countries to come together and manage together the problems of our times.

VIDEO: Secretary-General António Guterres talks with UN News about issues such as climate change, terrorism and inequality, as well as the role of the 72-year-old Organization.

And so multilateral organizations – like the UN, but also like many others… the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, regional organizations like the European Union, the African Union… they’re all essential to allow us to face the very dramatic challenges that are today threatening humankind.

UN News: With all of the challenges facing the world right now – terrorism, extremism, the refugee crisis – what’s your vision for the role the UN should be playing in today’s world?

The UN must, first of all, be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace

Secretary-General: The UN must, first of all, be an instrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace and we are doing everything we can, facing all the crises that we have – from Mali to South Sudan to Libya to Central African Republic to Syria to Afghanistan to Somalia – to do everything we can to convince the parties to those conflicts and those that have leverage, that support the parties to the conflict, we are doing everything we can to convince them that these are wars that nobody is winning; everybody’s losing.

And it is absolutely essential that they forget their differences, their contradictions of interests and that they really come together to put an end to these tragic series of crises, violence and conflicts. Because these conflicts are also becoming more and more interlinked and more linked to global terrorism.

So we need to fight terrorists where they are, but we need to address the root causes of terrorism. That means solving conflicts, and at the same time, building cohesive societies where people can feel they belong, where they don’t feel discriminated [against] and respect human rights, to make sure that terrorist organizations have more and more difficulties recruiting people.

Youth unemployment, for instance. Youth unemployment in certain parts of the world is one of the most dramatic problems that facilitate the work of terrorist organizations recruiting people that have no future. So we need – in sustainable development, in human rights and in a peace and security approach – to combine all the UN instruments in order to be able to defeat terrorism.

UN News: We see the effects of climate change around the world. What’s your message to everyone involved – governments, civil society, citizens – about the phenomenon and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?

Secretary-General: First of all, climate change today is undeniable. I just came from my country, Portugal, where we are having a huge drought in the south. We’re seeing forest fires multiplying terribly. In the United States, as in Portugal and other parts of the world, we are seeing heat waves, we are seeing dramatic floods – Sierra Leone, India, Nepal – we always had floods in the past but now natural disasters are becoming more frequent, more intense and with more devastating consequences. We see deserts progressing. We see glaciers diminishing. We see the sea levels starting to rise. So it is clearly a threat to us all.

Second, to fight it we have today an important instrument – the Paris Agreement. We need to make sure that all countries commit themselves to that [accord]. And wherever countries are not able to do so at the government level, that the societies, the business communities, the cities, are able to lead the process and in this way, we can be able to meet the Paris Agreement, but with an increased ambition because Paris is not enough to be able to contain global warming at the level that is acceptable.

We need to see that there is a clear link between climate change and development

At the same time, we need to see that there is a clear link between climate change and development, and the sustainability of development. So, the 2030 Agenda, the Sustainable Development Goals, are the global programme accepted by all Member States to have a fair globalization. A globalization that leaves no one behind. Contrary to what has happened in the recent past where we see so many regions that are dramatically, negatively impacted by technological progress or globalization.

We need to make sure that globalization that has brought enormous advantages for humankind, that it leaves no one behind. That there is inclusivity and that there is sustainability for our children and our grandchildren also to benefit from what we are achieving today.

UN News: A question dear to me – gender parity. You promised gender parity, and to strengthen gender parity within the UN system when you assumed office. Looking back at these past months, are you satisfied with what the progress so far? And what are your plans?

Secretary-General: I’ve appointed members of the Senior Management Group, which is the top level of the United Nations, between appointments and the renewal of mandates we have done it with 19 women and 17 men, which means parity has been taken very seriously by me in the decisions I can make. And we will have, at the end of my mandate – this is a very strong commitment – at the level of the Assistant Secretaries-General and Under-Secretaries-General across the board, all over the Organization, full parity.

We just approved a road map for parity that we will now submit to Member States in the areas where Member States need to take decisions aiming at reaching in 2023 in a majority of the areas of the UN, but for some that have more specific difficulties: in 2028, full parity for international staff across the board. So this is a strong commitment. And it’s not because this idea is now very much in the public debate. It’s because it’s my deep belief that organizations work much better when there is an equitable presence of both male and female colleagues.

UN News: In your youth, you stood up for the principles you believed in. What would you say to young people in today’s world who want to do something against racism, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism and discrimination?

It’s my deep belief that organizations work much better when there is an equitable presence of both male and female colleagues

Secretary-General: I think that young people are exactly my hope because young people are much more cosmopolitan. They are much less prone to these irrational approaches of nationalism, of xenophobia, racism; they understand diversity is a richness; it’s not a threat. I hope that young people will push their societies, their communities, their governments to understand that they need to have policies of social cohesion, they need to have policies that allow for everyone to feel that his or her identity is respected but, at the same time, that they belong to the community as a whole.

UN News: People want to know you on the personal level. So I have a few questions to try to do that. You are a fan of history. Who are your favourite historic figures?

Secretary-General: Well I had two personalities that had a very, very important influence on my political life, both ideologically and in relation to the political attitude, political behaviour. One, in my youth, Olof Palme. Another, in the maturity of my life, Nelson Mandela. I think they correspond to a fantastic combination: on one side, the policies that are at the same time clearly oriented for equality, for a progressive view of the world, equality between people, equality between societies.

Olof Palme has made a fantastic contribution to the development of a progressive vision of his country and of international relations. And then Nelson Mandela is the very symbol of forgiveness, tolerance and the capacity to rebuild a society that was so deeply and so tragically divided.

UN News: Who is your favourite author and what is your favourite book?

Secretary-General: I am, as you said, a compulsive reader of history. There are two history authors that I really consider the best I’ve read. One is French, Georges Duby. He was an excellent medievalist. The other is British, A.J.P Taylor. But of course, I am Portuguese; I come from a country of poets. There is a Portuguese poet that I consider absolutely unique: Fernando Pessoa.

UN News: With all your responsibilities as the head of an Organization that people look up to for solutions in a complicated world, what do you do to de-stress? What do you do for fun?

Secretary-General: Well, I like music a lot. So I [listen to] music at home. I go to concerts, operas frequently. I am very fond of contemporary art, so here in New York is the best place in the world – the galleries in Chelsea and other parts, contemporary exhibitions in the different museums.

And at the same time, I love to travel – and to go and try to discover either aspects of cultural heritage or landscapes that are unusual, or to have contact with people that are different and can enrich us. So I would say these are probably the areas where I try to use my spare time to my own benefit."
