And that means another Primal Blueprint Real Life Story from a Mark\u2019s Daily Apple reader. If you have your own success story and would like to share it with me and the Mark\u2019s Daily Apple community please contact me here . I\u2019ll continue to publish these each Friday as long as they keep coming in. Thank you for reading!\nHello Mark and Primal community. My name is Hilmir Petersen. I\u2019m 35-years-old and from Iceland.\nI got to know the Primal lifestyle community 18 months ago when I was listening to a Joe Rogan podcast and heard a interview with Mark Sisson, and you can easily say that I was really taken by that talk. All my life I\u00b4ve been a carbs spokesman and campaigner. But not any more!\nI was born \u201c in\u201d a bakery\u2014family business and grew up literally eating sugar out of the container in many kinds of forms, but I always loved being healthy and strong, so I starting eating more \u201chealthy\u201d = wholegrain (\u201chealthy carb\u201d and less sugar).\n\nI was a basketball player, and I always knew there was something missing in my diet plan when it came to getting my full potential/power for mind and body in games. Every time I tried to follow the right (stupid) pre-game carb-load program (which I read was important to keep energetic through a game), I was slow, weak and tired\u2014especially in the big games!\nOn the other hand, often when I came to practice after a long day, an early morning 4 a.m. and was active most of the day and had nothing to eat, I was like a rocket/beast but still stuck in the dark\u2026! I kept counting on the wrong plan for me before games because I trusted that it would sustain the energy I needed to perform my best. Omg, how I wish I could go back. \nTwo years ago I started the primal diet\u2026.eating and following a more primal living in a way. I now do the Primal Endurance diet, time-restricted diet/fasting, getting a variety of environmental stressors like cold-exposures, extra hot saunas and plenty of sun\u2026.(with some caution), focusing more on sleep in the rhythm of my circadian clock\u2014and last but not least I\u00b4ve been focusing on improving my \u201cprimal\u201d mobility. I believe the theories on connection between some stiff muscles and a stress response in your nervous system or mind and vice versa\u2026which is more obvious I think.\nThese pictures show great results for my first 21 days of doing the Primal Blueprint. It looks like this would need extreme measures to achieve but the truth is, it was the opposite. Actually, the first 4 days of that 21-day transition I was still on crutches after an ankle surgery and I didn\u2019t move fast, but I did some dips and other manageable low-intensity workouts.\n\nAfter that for most of the days I took some walks and running with low intensity or in the fat-burning state = heart-rate of (180-age = x). Plus, I did some light weight strength training. As you can see, the importance in the 21-day transition is low intensity, so you don\u2019t have to refuel your glycogen storage and force your body straight back into carb-burning state.\nNow I\u2019m changing my life. To get out of the family company to pursue a healthier career, I started on the Primal Health Coach Program, but the bakery is still taking is toll (time). I haven\u2019t gotten out until now when I just moved to another country, and I\u2019m going to finish the program \nNow I\u2019m running more, lifting less and fasting regularly and counting on FAT as my main energy Fuel\u2026. I\u2019ve never been in such a good mental or physical state before.\nAnd I just took a big challenge and signed up for the Ultimate Spartan Race in Iceland. I know I can be in the top. I\u2019m athletic, 19,2m in height, strong and only 84 kg with a a tough mental state. Now I need to educate myself more with this Endurance Mastery Course so I know how to train in the smartest way so I can WIN this thing.\nI\u2019m trying out new, different things with my diet. One month ago I took a 96 hours fast, except I drank about 2-400 ml of homemade bone-broth every day with either coconut oil and sometimes little piece of 85% organic chocolate. At the end of the fast I went for a mountain run/climb in 8 C\u00b0, only in shorts that took 5 hours and 30 min to cover 23 kilometers or 14 miles, and I had so much energy and focus in the end that I was sprinting and jumped into a river for a swim.\nThis Spartan race is a 24-hour race and I\u2019m planning to tackle it with a slow pace (fat burning state) on at least a 24-hour empty/bone-broth stomach. And the plan is that I won\u2019t have to stop for a carb-refuel\u2014only for a cup of hot bone broth with some fat/oil. I will be a very light, clean and strong Fat Burning Beast. To increase my chances to win this race I\u2019ve decided to take time out from work\u2014when I \u201cfled\u201d the country (bakery). And for that not to increase my debt I\u00b4m hoping to find some sponsorship from sportswear company and supplements store.\nHere is a list of things I\u00b4m doing to increase my changes.\nI\u2019m doing time restricted diet (only eating in a 9 hour window per 24 hours), starting no later then 9 a.m. This is what I have taken from Rhonda Patrick. Rhonda Patrick has a Ph.D. in biomedical science. You\u2019ve probably heard of or from her. This has been shown with studies to help with endurance! I\u2019m a big FAN!\nAnother tip from Rhonda: Taking a hot sauna for at least 20-30 minutes 3-5 times a week can help endurance and also spikes up some proteins called heat Protein. I\u00b4m not ready to get into the academics \nEating Primal and using fat in as much capacity possible for energy\nPracticing the Wim Hoff method: the cold exposure in mornings and after cardio training to help with rest and recovery. Plus, I\u00b4m doing the Wim Hof breathing technique to increase oxidant capacity in cells. Up to 3:30 minutes holding my breath with empty lungs.\nRunning, swimming, sprinting, bicycling, conditional training in moderated volume and movement improvement workouts from \u201cPrimal Iceland,\u00b4\u00b4 which helps with the whole musculoskeletal wellness. They are inspired for example by Tomas Myers.\nCreated a Spartan winner Pyramid! Four stages of how to achieve the Spartan Goal. Starting with the fundamentals: balance, meditation, goals, good sleep, gratitude, focus, self-esteem, sober, diary, and more. Stage 2# recovery, wellness, prevention, maintenance, ice-baths, sauna, workout diary, functional movements and more, Stage 3# discipline, achievement, effort, challenge, conditioning, obstacle training, and more. Stage 4: WINNER super beast, elite Spartan proud, famous.\nAnd plenty of other small things \nYou can find me on Instagram as the Primal_viking . Even though my audience isn\u2019t big yet\u2026 (I\u00b4m working on it) Here is a video from my first of two 21 day cleaning 18 months ago!\nAll that been said \u2026\nPeople ask me, how can you do this? Eat no carbs-sugar-bread etc. My answer is: how could I not? When the results and benefits are more energy, better skin, shorter depression episodes, and less work for more physical fitness and improvement.\nAnd, yes, of course there are times I\u2019m not on top of my game and I fall in high carb trash food for a day maybe. Those days will have less value the longer you stay on your path and build a healthy foundation to fall back on.\nTo quote a huge role model, the beast Jocko Willink \u201cDISCIPLINE EQUALS FREEDOM.\u201d Discipline in your diet gives you freedom to live optimally and to eat freely every now and then. Enjoy!\nBest regards,\nHilmir Petersen Hj\u00e1lmarsson\nThe post Discipline Equals Freedom! appeared first on Mark's Daily Apple .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "wim hof", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhonda patrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilmir petersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark sisson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe rogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wim hoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rhonda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tomas myers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hilmir petersen hj\u00e1lmarsson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jocko willink", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "primal health coach program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:10:18.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "abe028c26291d66197d71c592c5bcf26affaf4ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RlEfWz1fNjuFN0BFGalvendURF5lsIS99Nj6kaM31jtGBxHxUBCgotA-", "site_full": "www.marksdailyapple.com", "site": "marksdailyapple.com", "site_section": "https://www.marksdailyapple.com", "site_categories": ["health", "exercise"], "section_title": "Mark's Daily Apple", "title": "Primal/Paleo Cornbread", "title_full": "Primal/Paleo Cornbread", "published": "2017-10-14T15:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 15747, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "abe028c26291d66197d71c592c5bcf26affaf4ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQRfU.5KUm1RlEfWz1fNjuFN0BFGalvendURF5lsIS99Nj6kaM31jtGBxHxUBCgotA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Worker Bee", "published": "2017-10-14T15:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Primal/Paleo Cornbread", "text": "Meet Mark \nLet me introduce myself.

It\u2019s true\u2026with its emphasis on candy consumption, many Primal types feel lost on Halloween. They don\u2019t know what to do with themselves.\nThe costumes are fun, and being with friends is always a good time, but how should they react to all that sugar? It\u2019s a hard thing.\nLuckily, today I have 6 ways you can observe Halloween while staying true to your Primal roots.\n\nDo Some Ancestral Reenactment Everyone knows, deep down, that going Primal is really all about re-enacting ancient hunter-gatherers. Personally, my mode of communication and utilization of Internet technology is a source of deep shame. I\u2019d much rather cite PubMed entries while sitting around a campfire. If I could, I\u2019d smash my laptop, renounce antibiotics, toss my toothbrush. That I cannot find the courage to do so is slowly killing me on the inside.\nBut I can\u2019t. I\u2019m in too deep. So I use Halloween as the one day out of the year that I can fully embody the paleolithic hunter-gatherer that yearns to burst free. I suggest you do the same. Put on a loincloth. Grab an atlatl . Contract a parasite . Live the dream, if only for one night.\nDress Up As Your Favorite Obscure Ancestral Health Community Celebrity Sure, almost no one will get your costume. But when you meet someone who does, you\u2019ll know you have a friend or lover for life. A few ideas:\nRobb Wolf: Wear a jiu jitsu gi and a big broad smile; refer to everyone as \u201cfolks.\u201d\nMark Sisson: No shirt, paint-on abs, and a frisbee.\nChris Masterjohn: Carry a cup of egg yolks, and hand out vitamin K2 capsules.\nBill Lagos: Blue blockers and a blow torch.\nPeter Attia: Ride a road bike while wearing only a speedo and carrying a gallon bag of cashews.\nStephan Guyenet: Wear a peasant\u2019s burlap tunic, and carry around a dinner plate containing boiled cabbage, boiled chicken breast, boiled potato.\nPetro Dobromylskj: Dress as a molecule of palmitic acid.\nEmily Deans: Doctor\u2019s lab coat made of mammoth fur, stethoscope made of bone; hand out samples of magnesium glycinate and SSRIs.\nMichelle Tam (NomNomPaleo): Carry an Instant Pot filled to the brim with Red Boat fish sauce.\nRichard Nikolay: Naked, dusted with raw potato starch, with Bitcoin hash emblazoned in Sharpie across chest.\nGive Out Healthy Primal Treats To Trick-or-Treaters There\u2019s nothing kids love more than healthy treats on Halloween. Some options that the kids in our neighborhood just love :\nTeaspoons of Cod Liver Oil: Keep capsules on hand for kids with costumes that restrict mouth access.\nRaw Liver Shake: Blend up some raw liver (beef, lamb, or chicken) with a little OJ and frozen blueberries. Serve in tiny, decorative Dixie cups.\n100% Cacao Dark Chocolate: Everyone knows that kids love chocolate.\nKale Chips: Fill a big serving bowl with loose kale chips and let the kids grab as many as they like.\nMini Bottles of Natural Dry-Farmed Wine: Reduced alcohol content makes it perfect for minors.\nDark Chocolate Covered Brussels Sprouts: Fill snack-sized Ziplocs with 3-4 Primal \u201ctruffles.\u201d Tell them to eat it quick before it melts!\nMagnesium Oil Spritzes: Spray everyone who comes to the door. Tell the irate parents it will help their kids sleep, so they should thank you.\n4-inch PVC Pipe Sections for Foam Rolling : As kids approach, be rolling out your quads as an example. Actual foam rollers are best but get rather expensive.\nSingle-Serving Kerrygold Butter Slivers: Just cut each stick of butter into 8 pieces, wrap in foil, keep in fridge, and hand out. Tell them it\u2019s expensive and they should appreciate it.\nOffer Lessons in Evolved Fear In this Sunday\u2019s Weekend Link Love, I linked to an article about the evolution of fear. It turns out that most of the things we innately fear, like snakes, spiders, heights, the dark, and deep water correspond to real dangers faced throughout the course of human evolution. Halloween is the perfect time to give a lesson on how it all works.\nGather three tarantulas, three black widows, two scorpions, one snake (ideally not venomous), 1000 fly larvae, two bats, and assorted cobwebs and other bugs. Set up shop on the edge of a rocky cliff. The possibilities are endless.\nRail Against the Sins of Sugar Consumption On the Busiest Trick-or-Treating Corner Now\u2019s the perfect time to change hearts and minds. Dress in your Sunday best, grab a big sandwich board sign, and scrawl quotes from Gary Taubes and yours truly. Wear the sign and hit the busiest trick-or-treating street near you.\nHand out printed out copies of \u201c The Definitive Guide to Sugar .\u201d Have the article on sugar alcohols handy in case you get into nuanced discussions.\nTell kids that \u201cSisson saves\u201d and \u201cGary loves you but hates the sin.\u201d\nBurn a pile of granulated sugar in the street. Make sure it burns, rather than turns into delicious caramel.\nHand out stevia packets.\nGo On a Candy Bender It\u2019s Halloween night. Your kids are down for the count, having eaten their nightly allotment. Cleaning up, you come across a Baby Ruth candy bar. It used to be your favorite one. In your heyday, you\u2019d go through five King-Sized bars every week. How long has it been?\nYou\u2019re doing so well. You just read The Keto Reset and finally beat that stall you hit a few months back. The weight\u2019s flying off, and by the looks of it appears to be almost all lost body fat. Your wife\u2019s even taken notice. You feel her eyes all over you, lingering in the best of ways.\nOne can\u2019t hurt\u2026. You unwrap it, take a bite. You take another. And another. It\u2019s gone. You\u2019re on to the next one.\nYou hit the chocolates first. Snickers, Kit-Kat, Milky Way. Then the fruity candies: Skittles, Starbursts, Sour Patch Kids, Sweet Tarts. Then the weird stuff you hated as a kid. candy corn, Twizzlers, Tootsie Rolls. You don\u2019t care anymore. You eat it all.\nYour child\u2019s stash exhausted, you move onto the drug stores. CVS is selling fun-sized Three Musketeers for a buck a bag. You don\u2019t even like nougat, but you buy out the store anyway. That\u2019s the last thing you remember.\nThree months later, you have no teeth. Your insulin is so high you can feel it. All the weight\u2019s back on, and more.
