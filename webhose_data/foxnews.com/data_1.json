(AP Photo/Matt Rourke) (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) PHILADELPHIA\u2014 A onetime challenger to U.S. Rep. Bob Brady pleaded guilty Monday to hiding a $90,000 payment from the powerful Philadelphia Democrat\u2019s campaign in exchange for dropping out of a 2012 primary. Jimmie Moore, a 66-year-old former city judge, pleaded guilty in federal court to a charge of filing a false campaign finance report, and agreed to cooperate with any investigations related to the primary campaign. \n\u201cI don\u2019t disagree with what the government said I did,\u201d Moore told Judge Jan DuBois. \nMoore met with Brady shortly before exiting the race and the two discussed the arrangement, according to the plea agreement. They decided that the payment would be disguised, partly as the purchase of a campaign poll that Brady already had in his possession, according to the court documents. \nBrady hasn\u2019t been charged with a crime. A message left Monday for his lawyer, James Eisenhower, wasn\u2019t immediately returned. Eisenhower has previously denied there was an agreement to hide the source of the money. \nThe money was supposed to be used to cover Moore\u2019s large campaign debts, prosecutors said. \nMoore\u2019s lawyer and federal prosecutors wouldn\u2019t say whether the investigation was leading to Brady. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a vast amount of evidence out there. Whether it tends to point to Congressman Brady as doing something illegal, or tends to exculpate him, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Moore\u2019s lawyer Jeffrey Miller. \nMoore will be sentenced Jan. 11. \nHe was released on $25,000 bail and will be permitted to travel within the United States. He told the judge he needed to travel to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore for prostate cancer treatment. \nMoore\u2019s campaign aide and then-fiance Carolyn Cavaness has already pleaded guilty to concealing the payments on Moore\u2019s campaign finance reports. \nBoth she and Moore face up to five years in prison.

(iStock) For patients with breast cancer, it's important to know which stage of the disease they have. Breast cancer stages may indicate the size of a patient's tumor and if the cancer has spread. It's also key to be aware of different survival rates for women. Read on to learn more. Stage 0 \nPatients in this category may have ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS ), which is noninvasive but can possibly turn into invasive cancer. \nStages 0, 1, 2 and some stage 3 cancers \"are treatable and very often curable\" using combinations of things like surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and hormone therapy, Stanford University Medical Center professor Dr. Douglas Blayney told Fox News. Stage IA \nA tumor can be as large as 2 cm, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) says. Stage IB \nAt this stage, patients may have a tumor as large as 2 cm, along with \u201csmall clusters of breast cancer cells\u201d in lymph nodes, the NCI says. Patients with with no tumor discovered -- but that still have these clusters -- are also considered to have Stage IB breast cancer. Stage IIA \nA patient can have a tumor as large as 2 cm, and as many as 3 lymph nodes have cancer, the NCI says. There may also be Stage IIA patients where a tumor hasn't been discovered, but there's cancer in up to three lymph nodes. \nOther people in this cancer stage don't have cancer in their lymph nodes, but have tumors between 2 and 5 cm, the cancer institute explains. Stage IIB \nPatients can have a tumor between 2 cm and 5 cm, along with cancer cell clusters in lymph nodes, according to the NCI. It's also considered Stage IIB if someone has a tumor between 2 cm and 5 cm and 3 or fewer lymph nodes have cancer. \nThe NCI says another possibility is for someone to have no cancer in their lymph nodes and have a tumor that's bigger than 5 cm. Stage IIIA \nSomeone may have a tumor along with cancer in 4 - 9 of their lymph nodes, the NCI says. Patients with no discovered tumors, but have cancer in 4 - 9 lymph nodes, are also in Stage IIIA. \nStage IIIA includes patients who have cancer cell clusters in lymph nodes and tumors bigger than 5 cm, the NCI explains. The category also includes people with tumors larger than 5 cm who have cancer in 3 or fewer lymph nodes. Stage IIIB \nCancer may have extended to the chest or caused skin issues like an ulcer, the NCI says. As many as 9 armpit lymph nodes could have cancer. Stage IIIC \nPatients in this category either have a tumor or one hasn't been discovered, the cancer institute says. The disease may be in other parts of their bodies, like in at least 10 armpit lymph nodes. Stage IV \nPatients in this category have cancer that's metastasized, meaning it's spread distantly. What about 5-year survival rates? \nThe NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) program online lists relative 5-year survival rates for female breast cancer. \n\"Relative survival statistics compare the survival of patients diagnosed with cancer with the survival of people in the general population who are the same age, race, and sex\" with no cancer diagnosis, it says. \nBREAST CANCER SYMPTOMS TO LOOK OUT FOR \nWhen female breast cancer is diagnosed when it's localized, the 5-year relative rate is 98.9 percent, according to SEER. \n\"Localized does not include stage 0, but it is not exactly stage 1 either,\" NCI spokeswoman Shannon Hatch told Fox News in an email. \"Local means confined to breast tissue and fat including nipple and/or areola. Includes some stage II as well.\" \nThe relative 5-year survival rate for female breast cancer drops to 85.2 percent if the disease is found when it has extended to \"regional lymph nodes,\" SEER says online. If it's caught when it has already metastasized, the relative 5-year survival rate is 26.9 percent.

By Tevi Troy, The Wall Street Journal The federal government deserved the rave reviews it earned for its responses to back-to-back hurricanes in Texas and Florida. The Federal Emergency Management Agency worked well with state and local officials and predeployed key resources and personnel. It seemed as though Washington had learned from its failed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Yet as President Trump visits a Puerto Rico devastated by Hurricane Maria, cheers for FEMA have turned to boos. What went wrong? \nFirst, Puerto Rico is an island. Getting resources in place before landfall was much more difficult than using the Interstate Highway System to move people and supplies. A FEMA official told me that \u201cto say it\u2019s logistically challenging is an understatement.\u201d \nThe logistical challenge was compounded by the devastation on the island. The first responders in Puerto Rico were also victims, which meant many were unavailable to help with the response effort. The result is that FEMA must transport supplies as well as distribute them, which is typically a local responsibility and not FEMA\u2019s real expertise. \nIn addition, it was harder for the residents themselves to evacuate when planes and boats were the only means of escape. We saw the lines of cars on Interstate 95 headed north from Florida before Hurricane Irma. Such an escape route was not available to Puerto Ricans or Virgin Islanders. At the same time, being cut off from the mainland made it that much harder for Good Samaritans to assist. A Dallas kosher caterer brought badly needed food to observant Jews in Houston who had been subsisting on Chex Mix after Hurricane Harvey. Dallas is 239 miles from Houston. Puerto Rico is only 110 miles wide, and the Virgin Islands even smaller, limiting the geographic range from which those willing to help could come. \nFEMA must learn how to cope with serial disasters. As we saw with Harvey and Irma, post-Katrina reforms in 2006 improved FEMA\u2019s \u201csurge capacity\u201d\u2014its ability to handle more than one disaster at a time or in quick succession. But Texas and Florida are two of the best-prepared emergency-response states, which made FEMA\u2019s job easier. Puerto Rico is less well-equipped. \nLike any government agency, FEMA has limited resources. Its appropriations run out quickly in one disaster, let alone three, requiring a less-than-nimble Congress to vote for disaster funding. And FEMA personnel, who have been doing heroic work, are only human. They are subject to exhaustion when faced with a month of constant deployments and redeployments. \nFinally, there is the issue of presidential focus. While Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands reel, the president has also engaged in a feud with the National Football League over recent protests\u2014perhaps not the best fight to take on during a series of natural disasters. This was made worse by failing health-care legislation, a new tax-reform effort and the Alabama special election, not to mention continued saber rattling from North Korea.

Here are questions to ask.Ever the hypocrite, she urged Americans to \u201cput politics aside.\u201d Then she proceeded to immediately inject politics into the catastrophic shooting in Las Vegas. \nClinton knew she could not call for a ban of a weapon already banned by law. The fully automatic weapon allegedly used by gunman, Stephen Paddock, was made illegal under federal law back in 1986. \nSo Clinton invented an ancillary argument that more people would have died if Paddock had used a \u201csilencer.\u201d Survivors were still being treated when she began condemning the National Rifle Association and attacking the law on \u201csilencers.\u201d \nClearly, Clinton knows nothing about firearms, although she purports to be an instant expert on everything. \nForget that Clinton used the wrong term. \u201cSilencers\u201d don\u2019t silence. The proper and accurate term is \u201csuppressor\u201d because they diminish, but do not eliminate, the sound of gunfire. \nBut Clinton\u2019s claim that Paddock could have used such a device on his automatic weapon only underscores that Clinton is nothing, if not obtuse. Suppressors do not function well on automatic weapons. They tend to melt or malfunction under the intense heat of automatic fire. For this reason, there are only a few companies that even manufacture them for use on automatic weapons. And there is almost no marketplace for them. \nYet, Clinton is calling for a ban on a device that has no significant history of use in U.S. crime.

There was nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Some 22,000 people -- young and old, people of all colors and religions -- were attending the final night of a three-day country music festival starring Jason Aldean when they suddenly found themselves cornered in a killing field. Aldean was on the stage when lead began raining down on them as the music played. This was the ultimate \u201csoft target.\u201d \n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have had a worse, more terrifying scenario,\u201d said Raymond W. Kelly, the New York Police Department\u2019s longest-serving commissioner and now vice chairman of K2 Intelligence. \u201cAn individual with no criminal record, with as many as 23 weapons, some of them apparently modified to be fully automatic, shooting down on the ground from on high in a fortified position,\u201d he said. \u201cThe simplicity is part of what makes this so deeply disturbing.\u201d \nIn roughly ten minutes, 59 were dead and more than 500 wounded. The casualties might have been even higher had police not located the shooter\u2019s room and barged in when they did, Mr. Kelly said. And it happened in Las Vegas, known for good security, given its hotels, casinos, clubs, stadiums and other convention venues. Such soft targets are a police officer\u2019s ultimate nightmare. Precisely because there is so little they can do to protect such helpless civilians. The attack happened in Las Vegas, known for good security, given its hotels, casinos, clubs, stadiums and other convention venues. Such soft targets are a police officer\u2019s ultimate nightmare. Precisely because there is so little they can do to protect such helpless civilians. \nStephen Paddock, the lone-wolf shooter, fit no known terrorist profile. A retired accountant and heavy gambler, he lived in a retirement community just outside of the city. He had no criminal record, no apparent struggles with drugs or alcohol, no known history of mental illness, as his shocked brother told reporters. Several years ago, he got a parking ticket. He had no apparent ties to a terrorist organization, foreign or domestic. When police cornered him in his two-room suite, he shot himself. The massacre, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, is being called a \u201cone-off.\u201d \nThere are things that potential terrorism \u201csoft targets\u201d can do to make themselves less vulnerable. Police and security consultants, for example, urge diplomats in dangerous posts to alter their routes to and from work, fortify their homes, offices, and compounds, give out as little information as possible about their planned activities, and limit distribution of personal data. But none of these sane safety rules apply to shootings in which slaughter is random and seemingly without motive. Passengers in train stations, airports and shopping malls, theater and concert goers, attendees at sports events: such individuals are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. \nLarge, experienced police departments train for such events. The NYPD, said Mr. Kelly, stations \u201canti-sniper teams\u201d in skyscrapers and buildings surrounding Times Square, for example, where thousands of people gather each day and as many as a million assemble each year on New Year\u2019s Eve. \nIn Las Vegas on Sunday night, many concert goers ran for their lives; others crouched on the ground; still others sought shelter under cars and buses and the concrete barriers of McCarran Airport, where they crashed through the fence in terror. Mr. Kelly says that in such a shooting spree, running in a zigzag pattern is often the best defense. But many of those injured were trampled in the stampede of terrified people fleeing the scene. \nBut ultimately, police can do little to prevent a killer like Paddock, who had an Alaska hunting license, from murdering people and sparking mass mayhem. \nAmerica has more guns than people.Paddock's motive remains unknown. No gun control measure, such as requiring background checks, which polls show Americans overwhelmingly support, may have prevented him from purchasing the 42 weapons found in his home in Mesquite and his hotel room in Vegas and opening fire on helpless concert goers Sunday night. But before this massacre, Congress was preparing to consider legislation to make it easier for Americans to purchase silencers for their weapons.Washington\u2019s politicians apparently fear the National Rifle Association more than the public\u2019s short-lived fury after such senseless slaughter. \nJudith Miller, a Fox News contributor, is an award-winning author, and an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

Aroca intended to defend her Spanish roots and cast a ballot against Catalonia breaking away from the rest of the country. But when a squad of police in riot gear marched up, roughly tossed her and other voters aside and shattered the glass entrance of the Estel School in central Barcelona to confiscate ballot boxes, she felt something break inside her. \n\"I felt so angry and hurt inside that I thought, 'A country that hits me wants me to stay? You don't listen to me and on top of it you hit me?' For me that is abuse,\" she said a day later. \nSimilar indignation swept across the wealthy northeastern region, one of 17 in Spain, as police stormed through packs of voters and peaceful protesters at polling stations. \nThe outrage was compounded as mobile phone footage made the rounds on social media, showing officers in body armor pushing people, dragging them by the hair and hitting them with batons. Hundreds of civilians and police officers were injured. The Spanish government, acting on a judge's order to shut down the referendum, defended the response as professional and proportionate. \nThe ugly scenes run the risk of confirming a long-held belief among many Catalans that the region is chronically mistreated by Spain's central government despite serving as an economic driver for southern Europe \u2014 it generates a fifth of Spain's 1.1 trillion-euro economy \u2014 and having a high degree of self-governance. \nCatalan officials said that 90 percent of the 2.3 million people who voted Sunday were in favor of independence. But fewer than half of those eligible to vote turned out. The vote was boycotted by most of Spain's national parties on grounds it was illegal and lacked basic guarantees, such as a census. \nPolls and the most recent regional elections showed residents of Catalonia roughly split on the divisive issue of independence, but it remains to be seen how many people like Aroca are changing their minds after the events of recent weeks. \n\"I was crying from rage,\" she recalled. \"Now, I was going to vote no matter what. My husband and I didn't even have to talk about it, we just looked each other in the eyes and we knew that we had to vote. And that we had to vote 'yes' (for independence).\" \nBorn of parents from other parts of Spain, Aroca, a 40-year-old mother of two, still wants to embrace a dual identity of both Spanish and Catalan. But she says the political crisis caused by a lack of dialogue between Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and Catalan regional chief Carles Puigdemont has forced her to choose. \n\"All bonds have been broken. Not by the referendum, but by the police,\" Aroca said. \"I feel rage and pain. I think that is how most people feel, seeing what people are chatting about, talks I have had at work. (Sunday) night I was very sad, truly sad that it has reached this point of me wondering what kind of country my daughters will inherit.\" \nAroca also believes that Puigdemont and other leaders of the separatist movement are partly to blame for provoking the crackdown when they flouted court orders to stop the vote on grounds that it could violate Spain's constitution. \nPuigdemont has vowed to act on the results regardless of the legality of the referendum. He is expected to present them this week to Catalonia's regional parliament, which could trigger the process of starting to break away from Spain. Such a move that would inevitably be met by a robust response from Madrid, and Spain's interior minister has said the 5,000 extra officers deployed to Catalonia will stay as long as necessary. \nRuben Satinya is afraid more clashes are coming. The 40-year-old father of one felt compelled to join the separatist camp when Spain first tried to stop the referendum. \nWhen a judge ordered police to seal off polling stations before the vote, Satinya joined a groundswell of parents who occupied their local schools from Friday to Sunday, staying overnight in sleeping bags and organizing activities for children during the day. \nThe Congres-Indians School, which Satinya helped occupy, was not hit by police even though it is just a 15-minute walk from the Estel School. \nBut Satinya said voting amid the fear that police could descend at any moment made him feel more Catalan than ever, and convinced him that severing centuries-old ties with Spain was necessary. \nThe transformative experience reached its climax when the polls closed and the crowd gathered at the school joined in singing the Catalan anthem, \"Els Segadors\" (\"The Reapers\" in Catalan). \n\"There really is a different sentiment that sets us apart from the rest of Spain, and that was reinforced in me,\" he said. \"Hearing Els Segadors sung by so many people, I got goose bumps.

Kenneth Nyangani, a reporter with the NewsDay newspaper, was detained on Monday in the eastern city of Mutare after the story was published but police have not formally charged him, lawyer Passmore Nyakureba said. \nIn the Newsday story published Monday, Nyangani reported that a ruling party legislator donated the clothing items on behalf of Grace Mugabe. The first lady, whose political profile has risen in the recent years, routinely donates clothing and food items to ruling party supporters at her rallies. \n\"They wanted to charge him with criminal defamation, but I told them that law has been struck down by the Constitutional Court,\" Nyakureba said of his conversations with police. \"They didn't even seem aware of that fact.

(ABC) \"Dancing with the Stars\" went on Monday night -- but in a distinctly low-key way after the Las Vegas massacre. It had earlier been announced that the celebrities and their partners wouldn't be giving interviews after the show. And host Tom Bergeron opened the night by somberly telling the cameras, \"There\u2019s an old saying that the show must go on, and it will. But first, all of us at 'Dancing with the Stars' want to send our love, thoughts and prayers to everyone touched by the senseless violence in Las Vegas. Please know that we are doing tonight\u2019s show with your foremost in our minds and hearts.\u201d Bergeron also said Monday would NOT be an elimination show so the celebrities could relax on the \"guilty pleasure\" themed night. Co-host Erin Andrews surprised viewers by announcing that Vanessa Lachey's partner and longtime \"DWTS\" pro Maksim Chmerkovskiy, was \"dealing with a personal issue\" and wouldn't perform with her. Alan Bersten, who was eliminated with singer Debbie Gibson last week, took his place on Monday.\"Property Brothers\" star Drew Scott shared his guilty pleasure of watching true crime shows; his Argentine tango took place on a \u201cCSI\u201d-style street set. After the dance, for which he got a score of 23 out of 30 with partner Emma Slater, Scott said on camera, \"I lived in Vegas for many years. I want to say that all of our hearts here are with the families affected. It\u2019s a really sad situation\u2026.\" Former NBA star Derek Fisher and partner Sharna Burgess did a cha-cha based on his guilty pleasure, binge watching \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.\" They got a score of 21. Paralympian Victoria Arlen said her obsession was the song \"Tubthumping,\"which had lifted her spirits in high school because she was in a wheelchair at the time and got bullied. She and Val Chmerkovskiy grabbed 22 points as their quickstep mirrored the song's lyric, \"I get knocked down but I get up again.\" Vanessa said her guilty pleasure was hanging out with her BFFs. Her jazz performance featured troupe dancing girls in the background to Cyndi Lauper's \"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\" Judge Bruno Tonioli said, \"I absolutely loved it,\" but Inaba saw \"a few mistakes\" and Vanessa earned 23. WWE star Nikki Bella told partner Artem Chigvintsev in rehearsal, \"I'm obsessed with romance,\" which to her meant the X-rated novel \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\" Their Viennese waltz featured the wrestler vamping it up in a lingerie-style gown. For the first time this season, John Cena came to see his fianc\u00e9e perform and when it was over, the WWE star, dressed in a suit and tie, joined Bella and Chigvintsev in a chat with Bergeron. Bella hugged Cena and said, \"I love you.\" When Bergeron asked Cena to judge his girlfriend, he said, \"I thought it was spicy, exciting, fearless.\" Looking at Bella, the tough guy elaborated, \"Every reason why I love you.\" Cena kissed her on the head and then Judge Len Goodman complained about Bella's dance, \"It was a tad on the aggressive side.\" Cena smiled, \"That's my girl. She's aggressive.\u201d Former \"Malcolm in the Middle\" actor Frankie Muniz lived out his boy band fantasy with a samba that found the judges wanting more hip action. Muniz and Witney Carson got a score of 21. YouTube violinist Lindsey Stirling and partner Mark Ballas shone with the highest score of the night, 27 for jive which emphasized her guilty pleasure\u2014staying in her pajamas all day. Judge Carrie Ann Inaba said it was, \"One of my favorite numbers of all time.\" Former \"Pretty Little Liars\" actress Sasha Pieterse, who revealed last week how PCOS had caused her to gain weight, performed a cooking-themed jazz routine with partner Gleb Savchenko but judges burned her with the night's lowest score, 19. Nick Lachey was looking to up his dance game after last week's disappointment and told fans about his guilty pleasure, romantic comedies. The singer's 1980s style aerobics jazz dance with Peta Murgatroyd, however, received just 21 points. Former football player Terrell Owens also garnered 21 -- for his salsa with Cheryl Burke that took advantage of his break dancing guilty pleasure. \"Hamilton\" star and comic book fan Jordan Fisher and partner Lindsay Arnold finished off the night with an energetic superhero Charleston, earning 25 from judges. With no elimination, all 11 couples advanced to next week's \"most memorable year\" show.

The shooter used a fully-automatic rifle to mow down the victims, of whom there were more than 500. \nReporting and commentary on guns, especially in the harrowing aftermath of mass shootings, is regularly muddled, and the press often conflates automatic weapons and semi-auto weapons. Semi-automatic weapons fire one round per trigger pull, while an automatic weapon can spray many rounds per second as long as the shooter squeezes the trigger. \nWhile semi-automatic weapons are regulated mostly on a state-by-state basis, automatic weapons are mostly illegal, banned by a handful of federal laws. Yet the shooter in Las Vegas appears to have used an automatic weapon, according to law enforcement sources and the video of the event. \nAs gun control advocates yell that guns like this need to outlawed, it's crucial to remember that guns like this already are, for the most part, outlawed. \nAll automatic weapons must be registered with the federal government, under the 1934 National Firearms Act. (Again, semi-automatics are registered on the state level.) In 1986, Congress basically outlawed civilian ownership of automatic weapons, although it grandfathered in previously owned guns (the undesirable alternative to grandfathering being a government confiscation of machine guns). Some government officials can own automatic guns. \nIf you want to buy a grandfathered machine gun, you need permission from local law enforcement, you have to pay $200, plus you must submit fingerprints and photos to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Other restrictions apply. \nThese facts are directly relevant to our current gun-control debate for a couple of reasons. \nFirst, the restrictions on automatic rifles are far stricter than most proposed curbs on the sort of semi-auto \"assault rifles,\" such as AR-15s, used in the most notorious mass shootings in recent years.

Waking up and hearing the fear in people\u2019s voices, listening to the gun shots, it took me back to a war zone. \nStriking locations such as concerts, schools, churches, are typically things I see in third world countries that are under a constant state of attack. We call these types of locations soft targets -- vulnerable areas with high occupancy, limited protection, and easily accessible by the public. \nStill within hours of the aftermath of Vegas, I worry the horrifying repeat of Orlando, Sandy Hook, Virginia Tech shows how vulnerable we are as a nation, both on our soil and now at a global level. \nHow are we working to protect ourselves on the home front? Are we making valuable legislative changes that will make these horrific events impossible to take place again? \nUnfortunately, there is no escaping it any longer.

Officials said he booked one suite, with two rooms that had windows facing different directions. \nNeighbors in Reno \u2014 where he had a home, in addition to a property in Mesquite \u2014 described Paddock as \u201cextremely standoffish,\u201d The Washington Post reported. One neighbor told the paper that Paddock occasionally revealed a refrigerator-sized safe when he opened his garage door, but otherwise kept the blinds drawn. \n\u201cNo affiliation, no religion, no politics.

While President Trump was consoling the nation and offering support for Las Vegas, the Democrats and their friends in the media were rushing in to politicize a tragedy in the most despicable way imaginable. The 59 people gunman Stephen Paddock killed were not even buried and the hundreds he injured still fighting for their lives when irresponsible politicians and members of the press sought to score cheap political points and push a gun-control agenda. \n\"Our grief isn't enough,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWe can and must put politics aside and stand up to the NRA and work together to try and stop all of this from happening again.\" \nLikewise, Hillary Clinton weighed in less than nine hours after the shooting and went deep into the gutter of politics. She mused that the massacre would have been worse if Paddock had a \u201csilencer,\u201d showing she knows as much about firearms as she does running a campaign. \nDo these people have any decency? We don't know Paddock\u2019s motive. We have very few details. Families are still in shock. But this is their initial impulse. Imagine if President Trump today brought up the Second Amendment. How would the news media in this country have reacted? \nWhen it comes to the media\u2019s reaction to this horrific event, it gets even worse. Liberal CNN \u201creporter\u201d Jeff Zeleny suggests that the only reason President Trump is going to Las Vegas tomorrow is because the victims in the audience may have been his supporters. \n\u201cOf course Las Vegas is a town that he is connected to and knows well, his name is emblazoned on top of a hotel there as well, he campaigned there a lot,\u201d Zeleny said. \u201cSo, this is something that I'm not surprised at all to see him go there visiting early. Something else I think to keep in mind, a lot of these country music supporters were likely Trump supporters.\u201d \nA top lawyer for CBS was fired Monday after writing something on Facebook that ought to make you sad and angry. \n\"If they wouldn't do anything when children were murdered, I have no hope that Republicans will ever do the right thing,\u201d wrote Hayley Geftman-Gold, CBS\u2019s now former vice president and senior counsel. \u201cI'm actually not even sympathetic [because] country music fans are often Republican gun toters.\" \nExploiting this shooting is pathetic. Yet every single time something like this takes place, Democrats rush to judgment without facts, immediately calling for stricter gun control. The lack of sympathy for the families speaks volumes. And if you watched TV all weekend, you saw they were doing the exact same thing when it comes to the recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. \nThe island was pounded with two hurricanes. Its infrastructure, airports, roads, electrical grid, water supply and cellular service were all knocked out. And instead of focusing on the Trump administration's valiant efforts to help those people in need, the media again tried to politicize a natural disaster to hurt the president. \n\u201cYou've also heard a lot of commentary saying that yesterday might have been President Trump's Katrina moment,\u201d ABC newsman and former aide to President Clinton George Stephanopoulos said. \n\u201cLet's go back to, you know, this comparison with Katrina, whether or not, this is Trump's Katrina, this could actually be worse,\u201d one guest said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cBecause Katrina was about indifference and incompetence, this is about mean spiritedness.\u201d \nAnd CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper decided \u201crace or ethnicity might be playing a factor\u201d in what he erroneously believes was Trump\u2019s delayed reaction to Puerto Rico. \nIn truth, the Trump administration is working nonstop to help people in need. After unrelenting attacks from the media, the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tried to set the record straight. \n\u201cThe federal government is doing everything within our powers and capabilities to first focus on the life-sustaining and life-saving measures as well as on the rebuilding process,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got over 12,000 federal staff on the ground, 64 hospitals out of 67 are partially or fully operational. Fourteen are now back on the electrical grid. Forty five percent of customers in Puerto Rico have access to drinking water. Eight commercial airports are operational, 65 percent of gas stations are open, all of these things are things that we are continuing to push, continuing to move forward and will be part of that effort.\u201d \nDoes that sound like Katrina? Does that sound like racism? \nWhether it is a mass shooting by a lunatic or a devastating hurricane, the rush to politicize a tragedy and attack President Trump shows the liberal mainstream media would they rather just play politics than tell the truth or do its part to help when people are suffering. \nAdapted from Sean Hannity's monologue on \"Hannity,\" Oct. 2, 2017 \nSean Hannity currently serves as host of FOX News Channel's (FNC) Hannity (weekdays 9-10PM/ET) .

Who is she? And what clues can she reveal about Paddock's motives? Here's what we know about her so far. The one person who can provide insight into the Las Vegas killer's warped mind -- and potential motive -- remained out of reach of U.S. authorities Tuesday. But they want to talk to her. Soon. Marilou Danley, the Las Vegas shooter's live-in girlfriend who left the country before Stephen Paddock gunned down 59 people outside the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, was cleared as a \"person of interest\" in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, but on Tuesday evening, officials announced she was, in fact, a \"person of interest.\" \nMarilou Danley was overseas during the Las Vegas shooting. \nHow and when did Paddock acquire his deadly arsenal? And why did he open fire on a country concert crowd, killing dozens and injuring more than 500 people? \nClark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday that Danley, 62, is in Tokyo, although, on Tuesday, her location and estimated return date to America was not immediately clear. \nMarilou Danley was initially declared a \"person of interest.\" Though that label was removed, police still want to talk to her. \n\"She was reported to have been in the Philippines at the time of the incident, but there are unconfirmed reports that she is no longer in the Philippines at this time,\" Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman Robespierre Bolivar told the Sydney Morning Herald on Monday. Bolivar added there was \"no official confirmation yet on her nationality, original or acquired.\" \nPolice combing the hotel room Paddock used as a perch for his deadly rampage found Danley\u2019s slot machine card, Clark County Commission Chair Steve Sisola told the Nevada Independent . Lombardo said Paddock also was carrying some of Danley\u2019s identification. \nThose items led police initially to declare her a person of interest and launch a search.

Prosecutors at Malaysia's High Court were seeking to establish the basic facts regarding Kim Jong Nam's death on Feb. 13. There has been no testimony about the motive for the killing, but North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is believed to have considered his older sibling a potential rival for power. \nSiti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam have pleaded not guilty to charges they smeared the nerve agent VX on Kim's face. They have yet to testify, but diplomats from their countries have quoted them as saying they believed they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and had been hoodwinked by men suspected of being North Korean agents. \nMonday's testimony reconstructed Kim Jong Nam's final moments at the airport, while Tuesday's session focused on the cause of death. \nDR. NIK MOHAMAD ADZRUL ARIFF RAJA AZLAN, airport clinic physician \nNik continued his testimony from Monday, in which he described how Kim arrived at the airport clinic conscious but in pain, with very high blood pressure and pulse. He said Kim then had seizure-like symptoms and his blood pressure, blood oxygen level and pulse plunged. Nik said he injected Kim with atropine, a standard procedure to boost slow heart rates, and said he did not know at the time that it is also a treatment for counteracting VX and other nerve agents. \nNik said he also inserted a tube into Kim's trachea to improve his oxygen level, and that stabilized Kim's blood pressure and oxygen level so he could be transported to the hospital. \nDR. NUR ASHIKIN OTHMAN, chemical pathologist at Kuala Lumpur Hospital \nNur Ashikin said Kim's blood had a very low level of 344 units per liter of cholinesterase, an enzyme used to break down neurotransmitters in the body that send signals to the brain and control the muscles. The normal level is above 5,300 units per liter, she said. \nThe low level \"could be caused by poison such as pesticide or nerve agent,\" she told the court, and can cause heart and lung problems and symptoms such as profuse sweating and vomiting. \nShe said blood tests on the two women accused of murdering Kim showed normal enzyme levels, but this may not conclusively show they were not exposed to VX because the women may have been in contact with a low concentration level or have decontaminated themselves by washing their hands with soap or taking an antidote. \nDR. MOHAMAD SHAH MAHMOOD, head of the Forensic Unit at Kuala Lumpur Hospital \nDr. Mohamad Shah, one of two pathologists who examined Kim's body and prepared the post-mortem report, said the cause of death was determined to be \"acute VX nerve agent poisoning.\" He said Kim was dead on arrival at the hospital. \nA copy of the post-mortem report, submitted as evidence, showed that traces of VX were found not only on Kim's eyes and face but also in his blood and urine, and on his clothing and bag. \nAn examination of Kim's body found damage in his organs including part of the brain, both lungs, liver and spleen, Mohamad Shah said, adding that this could be caused by poison or a drug overdose. But based on his examination and toxicology and chemist reports, he said there were no contributing factors to Kim's death apart from VX. \nThe report said Kim weighed 96 kilograms (211 pounds) and had tattoos on his chest, arms and back, including a colored dragon head breathing fire and a man with two fish-like figures.

Similar in size to the original Ford Bronco, it features a stripped out interior and boxy bodywork, designed for easy manufacturing and simple repairs. The chassis and body are both made of aluminum, while a steel roll cage provides added safety. \nBollinger claims the 360 hp vehicle can accelerate to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, and has released video of it being tested off-road with the doors removed, Jeep Wrangler-style.

Sitting in the \u201cLiquid Lab\u201d test kitchen at the coffee giant\u2019s Seattle headquarters in 2003, Dukes and a small group sought to perfect a pumpkin-inspired espresso beverage, which they accomplished by sampling bites of pumpkin pie, following by sips of espresso. \n\"Nobody knew back then what it would grow to be. It\u2019s taken on a life of its own,\" Dukes said of the beverage in 2014. \nTo date, Forbes estimates that Starbucks has sold at least $300 million worth of Pumpkin Spice Lattes.

Top health officials from the Obama administration testified Tuesday that Sen. Robert Menendez pressured them to change a long-standing Medicare policy in a way that would benefit the Florida ophthalmologist at the center of the New Jersey Democrat\u2019s corruption trial. Menendez is accused of accepting campaign donations, gifts and vacations from his friend Dr. Salomon Melgen. In return, Menendez allegedly used his Senate powers to lobby on behalf of Melgen\u2019s business interests. \nThen-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the highest-level Obama official to testify in the case, took the stand Tuesday to describe a meeting she had with Menendez in the office of then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Prosecutors\u2019 previously filed brief said that meeting was held in August 2012 and alleged Menendez \u201cpersonally pressured\u201d Sebelius to intervene over a Medicare payment policy, though Sebelius balked. \nGiving her side of the story, Sebelius testified Tuesday that the \u201cgist\u201d of the conversation involved Menendez\u2019s \u201cunhappiness\u201d over the policy, which he felt was \u201cunclear\u201d and \u201cunfair\u201d to providers. The policy happened to be at the center of a billing dispute involving Melgen. \nSen. Bob Menendez, shown arriving to court in Newark in this April 2, 2015 photo, is battling corruption charges. (Reuters) \n\u201cHe felt this was a policy that needed attention and was not fair to health care providers,\u201d Sebelius said Tuesday. \u201c\u2026 I basically reiterated what I knew about this practice and what I knew about the policy, which was I thought the policy was clear.\u201d \nShe added, \u201cTo me it was pretty simple,\u201d and noted that she didn\u2019t think it was a \u201cvery satisfactory meeting\u201d for Menendez. \nSebelius also said it was \u201cunusual\u201d for Reid to invite her to a meeting involving another member of Congress. It was \u201cactually the only time in five and a half years that this occurred,\u201d she said. \nBut Sebelius wasn\u2019t the only Obama health official with whom Menendez met. Two months earlier, Menendez met with then-Acting Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Marilyn Tavenner, who also testified Tuesday. \nTheir meeting apparently ended on a similar note \u2013 with the health official pushing back, and Menendez allegedly dissatisfied. \nFormer Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, shown at a Nov. 7, 2012 news conference on Capitol Hill, could be called to testify in the Menendez trial. (AP) \nTavenner testified Tuesday that she met Menendez in his office in June 2012 to discuss the Medicare payment policy. \n\u201cWhat he was asking me was to take a look at the policy, and the policy went back for a few years,\u201d Tavenner testified. \u201cAnd he was questioning the clarity of the policy and [asked] if I would take a look.\u201d \nShe suggested that when Menendez determined Tavenner would not be altering the policy, he seemed to want to take his request up the ranks. \n\u201cI think he was not happy. He told me he was disappointed, that he felt there should have been changes,\u201d Tavenner testified. \u201cAnd that he did not intend to let it stand. He intended to take it to the next steps.\u201d \nTavenner, who worked for CMS for five years, explained that those \u201cnext steps\u201d would include bringing the issue to Sebelius. \nAccording to court documents filed in 2016, CMS in 2009 suspected Melgen had overbilled Medicare for $8.9 million from 2007-2008 by \u201cengaging in a prohibited practice known as \u2018multi-dosing.\u2019\u201d According to court documents, the Medicare policy required that each patient receiving the drug Lucentis be treated using a separate vial, but Melgen \u201croutinely\u201d used the extra solution from a single vial to treat multiple patients. CMS believed Melgen was paid for more vials of the drug than he actually used. \nAccording to Tavenner, the changes to the Medicare payment policy Menendez allegedly proposed would have benefitted Melgen, though she did not recall Melgen\u2019s name coming up in the June 2012 meeting. \nHARRY REID EXPECTED TO BE CALLED TO TESTIFY IN MENENDEZ TRIAL, SOURCE SAYS \nMenendez has proclaimed his innocence in the case. When the trial opened last month, his lawyers said the case is not about corruption or bribery but about a long-term friendship. \nReid also is expected to be called to testify in the Menendez trial. The former Senate Democratic leader\u2019s name re-emerged weeks ago in the case, when prosecutors said he was \u201cfirst enlisted\u201d by Menendez in November 2011 to advocate for Melgen in the ongoing dispute with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS.) \nReid already has met with the Justice Department and the FBI in connection with the investigation, back in 2015. \nCourt documents claim that Reid reached out to the White House deputy chief of staff in 2011 about Menendez being \u201cupset about how a Florida ophthalmologist was being treated\u201d by CMS. Prosecutors said the White House deputy chief of staff \u201cdemurred\u201d as it involved a \u201cdispute between a single doctor and an administrative agency, not a policy matter.\u201d \nIn June 2012, Melgen also apparently flew Reid on his company\u2019s private plane from Washington to Boston and back, but Menendez was not present, according to a source with knowledge of the situation. \nReid did not respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment. \nFox News' Tara Prindiville and Whitney Ksiazek contributed to this report. \nBrooke Singman is a Politics Reporter for Fox News.

The U.S. has ordered the expulsion of 15 Cuban diplomats from their embassy in Washington following mysterious attacks on American officials in Havana. U.S. officials said the diplomats must leave the country within seven days. While the move is described as an \"expulsion,\" the U.S. isn't declaring them \"persona non grata\" -- a designation that would prevent them from ever returning, according to a State Department official. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday the decision was made because Cuba failed to protect diplomats on its soil -- without directly blaming Cuba for the attacks on Americans in Havana. \n\"The decision was made due to Cuba's failure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention,\" Tillerson said in a statement. \nThe U.S. is also withdrawing 60 percent of U.S. diplomats from the embassy in Havana as a result of the unexplained attacks that have harmed at least 22 American government workers and their family members. \n\"Until the government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,\" Tillerson said. \"We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks.\" \nThe Cuban government called the move \"hasty\" and \"irresponsible,\" according to the Associated Press. \nForeign Minister Bruno Rodriguez denied Cuba's involvement in the attacks in a news conference. \n\"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs strongly protests and condemns this unfounded and unacceptable decision as well as the pretext to justify it,\" Rodriguez said. \nAt least 22 U.S. Embassy employees on the communist-run island have reported injuries from attacks \"of an unknown nature,\" according to the State Department. Symptoms have included ear issues, hearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues and difficulty sleeping. \nThe State Department said last week that investigators have been unable to determine who is responsible or what is causing these attacks. \nOn Friday, the Trump administration ordered the departure of non-emergency personnel assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Havana, as well as all family members. The U.S. also issued a travel warning advising American citizens to avoid travel to Cuba. \n\"We have no reports that private U.S. citizens have been affected, but the attacks are known to have occurred in U.S. diplomatic residences and hotels frequented by U.S. citizens,\" Tillerson said. \nThe Associated Press, citing unnamed U.S. officials, reported that American intelligence operatives in Cuba were among the first and most severely affected victims. \nIn some of these cases, U.S. operatives have suffered brain injury and hearing loss that has not healed, according to the AP. The American spies affected also reported hearing an unsettling sound inside and sometimes outside their Havana homes, described as similar to loud crickets. Then they fell ill with a range of physical symptoms. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \nCristina Corbin is a Fox News reporter based in New York.

"Girlfriend of Las Vegas gunman arrives in US \nNorth Korea threatened to bring \u201cnuclear clouds\u201d to Japan and mocked Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for acting like a \u201cheadless chicken\u201d at the United Nations General Assembly when the leader urged UN members to force North Korea to end its nuclear and missile programs. \nPyongyang claimed Japan was inciting more tension in the Korean peninsula, calling its plea to end Kim Jong Un\u2019s nuclear goal a \u201csuicidal deed\u201d that will end with a nuclear attack to sink the island, according to a statement released Monday by the state\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency . \n\u201cJapan\u2019s such rackets inciting the tension of the Korean peninsula is a suicidal deed that will bring nuclear clouds to the Japanese archipelago,\u201d the statement said. \u201cNo one knows when the touch-and-go situation will lead to a nuclear war, but if so, the Japanese archipelago will be engulfed in flames in a moment. This is too self-evident.\u201d \nNorth Korea called Abe a \u201cheadless chicken\u201d and said the country could be \u201cthe first victim of nuclear disaster in the world.\u201d \nNorth Korea has already fired two missiles that flew over Japan in the last two months. The missile from the latest launch in September reached a height of 480 miles and flew 2,300 miles out, putting it in range of US territory Guam. North Korea then threatened to \u201csink\u201d Japan and reduce the US to \u201cashes and darkness.\u201d \n\u201cThe four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche. Japan is no longer needed to exist near us,\u201d KCNA said in another message. \nA top government spokesman for Japan responded to the threat by calling it outrageous and provocative. see also Trump says it's a waste of time to negotiate with North Korea President Trump had a stark message for North Korea on... \nThe growing nuclear threat pushed Abe to seek a public mandate on his tougher diplomatic and defense policies to deal with escalating threats from North Korea. He dissolved Japan\u2019s lower house of parliament and called for a snap election to be held this month. \nNorth Korea\u2019s string of belligerent threats have continued since President Trump vowed to \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the dictatorship in his speech to the UN General Assembly last month. North Korea\u2019s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said Trump\u2019s threatening words were a \u201cdeclaration of war,\u201d though the White House insisted no such explicit statement was made. \nTrump once again ripped Kim as \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d in a series of tweets over the weekend after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said there were \u201clines of communication\u201d to Pyongyang.

President Trump visited storm-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday to survey damage and talk to residents, while also meeting and briefly praising the San Juan mayor following their feud over the administration's response to Hurricane Maria. The president, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, participated in a packed briefing on storm recovery shortly after landing at Luis Mu\u00f1iz Air National Guard Base in San Juan. \nSan Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has repeatedly criticized the president\u2019s actions since the storm wreaked havoc on the U.S. territory last month, was seen shaking Trump's hand and joining him for the briefing in a hangar. \nPresident Trump is seen greeting San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has repeatedly criticized the president\u2019s actions since the storm wreaked havoc on the territory last month. (White House pool photo) \nTrump didn\u2019t mention Cruz in his remarks to the media. But \u2013 in comments that seemed meant to draw a contrast \u2013 the president singled out Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, the governor of Puerto Rico, for praise. \n\u201cThis governor did not play politics,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t play it all. He was saying it like it was. And he was giving us the highest grades.\u201d President Trump meets with Hurricane Maria victims \nWhile in Puerto Rico, Trump viewed the damage from a helicopter, participated in several briefings with officials, met storm victims and toured the USS Kearsarge. He also met with senior military personnel and government officials, including Rossell\u00f3 and Kenneth Mapp, the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, which was also severely damaged by the storm. \n\u201cNow, I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you\u2019ve thrown our budget a little bit out of whack,\u201d the president said at the hangar briefing. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico. And that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ve saved a lot of lives.\u201d \nThe president pointed out that 16 people died in Puerto Rico because of Maria -- a death count far lower than that of \u201ca real catastrophe like Katrina\u201d in 2005. \n\u201cSixteen people versus in the thousands,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou can be very proud of all your people.\u201d \nTrump's visit comes just days after getting into a high-profile spat with the San Juan mayor. \nCruz had begged the administration to \"make sure somebody is in charge that is up to the task of saving lives.\" \nTrump responded angrily on Twitter, deriding the \"poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help.\" \nTrump downplayed the spat with the mayor when asked about it by reporters as he departed the White House on Tuesday. \n\u201cWell, I think she\u2019s come back a long way,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s now acknowledged what a great job we\u2019ve done, and people are looking at that. And in Texas and in Florida, we get an A+. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019ve done just as good in Puerto Rico, and it\u2019s actually a much tougher situation.\u201d \nBut Trump added: \u201cOn a local level, they have to give us more help.\u201d \nAfter his hangar briefing, Trump walked from home to home through a neighborhood in Guaynabo, where piles of debris and downed trees were visible. Accompanied by Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Trump greeted residents and took photos with them outside their homes. \nMaria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island's entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads. \nNearly two weeks after the Puerto Rico storm, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access such basic necessities as food, fresh water and cash. \nTrump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat a perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm's destruction in its immediate aftermath. \nWhile early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved. \nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there are now more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island, and 45 percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 60 percent of retail gas stations now up and running. \nMarine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee during a hearing on Tuesday that the United States military has 10,000 troops on the ground in Puerto Rico. \nA number of top officials joined the president for Tuesday's trip, including Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, Puerto Rico\u2019s representative in Congress, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke, EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, Small Business administrator Linda McMahon and Homeland Security adviser Tom Bossert. \nFEMA administrator Brock Long is also in Puerto Rico. \nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

President Trump will go to Puerto Rico next week to oversee ongoing rescue and relief efforts on the island which was devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. With this visit comes the opportunity to help make Puerto Rico great again. \nCars drive past a damaged traffic light after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria en Guayama, Puerto Rico September 20, 2017. (REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins) \nWhen candidate Donald Trump ran for the highest office in the land, he promised to fight for forgotten Americans. In the presidential election of 2016, the forgotten Americans of the Upper Midwest and the coal country of Kentucky and West Virginia, many of them life-long Democrats, delivered a decisive win for this first-time Republican candidate. The tropical island of Puerto Rico couldn\u2019t be more different than America\u2019s rust belt or the mountains of Appalachia, but here too live Americans who feel forgotten by our leaders and left behind by our economy. \nPrior to President Obama, no sitting U.S. president had visited Puerto Rico since Gerald Ford. Still, President Obama\u2019s 2012 visit was just a campaign pit stop, and it was for about as much time as he spent at a baseball game in Cuba with dictator Raul Castro. \nDebris and damaged electrical installations are seen after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria en Guayama, Puerto Rico September 20, 2017.

That money and attention should have gone to helping our fellow American citizens in Puerto Rico. \nA man looks for valuables in the damaged house of a relative after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria in Guayama, Puerto Rico September 20, 2017. (REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins) \nPresident Trump won\u2019t go to Puerto Rico to fundraise or campaign. He\u2019ll go to show the people of Puerto Rico that he cares, to see the island-wide damage up close and personal, and to make sure that the federal government and mainland Americans don\u2019t forget about our fellow citizens struggling in Puerto Rico. \nPresident Trump's business reputation as a \"doer\" who can get results is essential now more than ever, as the hurricanes have knocked out most of the island\u2019s power and basic infrastructure. \nDamaged electrical installations are seen after the area was hit by Hurricane Maria en Guayama, Puerto Rico September 20, 2017. (REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins) \nMoreover, with his extensive experience in the tourism industry, President Trump is uniquely positioned to understand and empathize with the effects of Irma and Maria on the island\u2019s fragile economy. \nHis business background will also help him fully appreciate the consequences of the current debt crisis plaguing the island. Looking at the images of devastation coming out of Puerto Rico, it's hard to believe that anything could inflict as much damage as the winds and rains of these Category 4 hurricanes. But long before Irma and Maria, Puerto Rico\u2019s irresponsible government policies led to economic recession, joblessness, massive debt, and an unprecedented exodus to the U.S. mainland. Tens of thousands of Puerto Rico\u2019s most talented and ambitious citizens have made the painful decision to leave their families and their beautiful island in search of opportunities on the mainland, and countless thousands more will be forced to do the same if there is no decisive action to rebuild the island. \nThe Republican Congress has taken the lead in trying to help Puerto Rico restructure its debts and make the necessary reforms to get back on its economic feet through a bill introduced and passed last year called PROMESA. PROMESA, crafted to address the economic crisis, satisfy bondholders holding Puerto Rican debt, and protect U.S. taxpayers from another bailout, was a good and necessary first step. But making Puerto Rico great again will require more than Congress. It will need the attention and leadership of the president. \nWhile in Puerto Rico, President Trump will not only see the effects of Irma and Maria, but also have an opportunity to discuss the deeper and equally damaging effects of the Puerto Rican debt crisis with Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 and the island\u2019s business community. \nMoreover, after experiencing the negative effects of big, unsustainable government, Puerto Ricans may be more receptive than ever to conservative ideas and solutions such as limited government, fiscal restraint, and serious entitlement and regulatory reform that will attract new investment to the island, and grow their economy. A strong, durable Puerto Rican economy will leave the island better prepared to handle future natural disasters. \nSo what can the rest of us do to help our American brothers and sisters in Puerto Rico? Well, if you are planning a Caribbean vacation, you can start by booking it to this warm and friendly island paradise as soon as it is ready to receive tourists. As a U.S. territory, your trip to Puerto Rico doesn\u2019t require a passport or currency exchange. Hotels and amenities meet U.S. standards \u2013 not so in Cuba. And unlike Cuba, where your tourist dollars go directly to the communist Cuban regime, thereby funding and enabling a brutal dictatorship, you can feel good knowing that every dollar you spend on your dream vacation to Puerto Rico is, indeed, making America great again! \nRachel Campos-Duffy is a FOX News Contributor and a mother of eight. Her debut children\u2019s book \u2013 inspired by real life events - is a story about a little girl\u2019s adventure inside the US Capitol where she learns lessons about patriotism, courage and her immigrant father\u2019s journey to citizenship.

A House panel had backed the bill last month and lawmakers were expected to move ahead on the measure. \nThe bill is \"not scheduled right now. I don't know when it will be scheduled,\" Ryan said. \nInstead, Ryan and other GOP leaders urged prayers to unify the country and said a positive way to respond to the shooting is to donate blood. Ryan said the actions of the gunman who killed at least 59 people and wounded hundreds more will not \"define us as a country. It's not who we are.\" \nRyan's comments came as Democrats renewed calls for gun safety legislation. \nSen. Richard Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, pushed Congress to pass a universal background checks bill and \"commonsense gun laws\" to help prevent the next mass shooting. \n\"We can't stop the shootings that have already happened in Las Vegas, Chicago, Roseburg, Oregon, and across the nation. We failed to respond in time for those victims and their families. But if we work together, we can stop shootings in the future,\" Durbin said. \nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned that the GOP-backed silencer bill could have deadly consequences. \n\"One of the few ways the police had to go after this shooter was they could look for the sound, try to hear the sound of where the guns came from,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"Thank God our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have pulled back on this bill.\" \nSchumer and other Democrats noted that Republicans postponed a hearing on the silencer bill in June when House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others were shot at a congressional baseball practice. \n\"When two mass shootings force you to delay a bill that would make those mass shootings harder to detect and stop, maybe that's a sign you ought to let go of the bill go, once and for all,\" Schumer said. \nBesides the silencer measure, House GOP leaders had been moving forward with a bill to allow people with concealed-carry permits to take their weapons to other states. Republicans had been upbeat about prospects for legislation, but votes on both measures seemed unlikely. \nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who favors gun control, said Monday it was \"time for Congress to get off its ass and do something.\" In an outdoor news conference Monday, former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, grievously wounded in a 2011 attack, turned to the Capitol, raised her fist and said, \"The nation is counting on you.\" \nBut no action was expected, as other mass shootings in Colorado, Connecticut, and Florida, and even attacks on Gifford and Scalise, failed to unite Congress on any legislative response. A bipartisan bill on background checks failed in the Senate four years ago, and since then Republicans have usually pointed to mental health legislation when questioned about the appropriate congressional response to gun violence. \nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on Monday asked Ryan to create a select committee on gun violence to recommend legislation. A group of Democratic lawmakers asked Ryan to remove the silencer bill from the House calendar indefinitely. \nIn an interview with The Associated Press last month, Ryan said Congress needs to fund mental health reforms. \"But if you're saying that this Republican Congress is going to infringe upon Second Amendment rights, we're not going to do that,\" he said. \nHouse Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said lawmakers should remember the good feelings they shared when Scalise returned to the Capitol last week, more than three months after the June 14 shooting. \n\"It's really a time that we have to heal. It's really a time to find what divides us\" and put it aside, he said. \"We need to find that we are stronger. We cannot allow this terror to win.\" \n___ \nAssociated Press writers Erica Werner and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.

During testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mattis sought to assure lawmakers that President Donald Trump's new strategy for Afghanistan represents the best approach for winning America's longest war. \nMattis said that the Afghan forces are becoming bolder in combat because they know U.S. and NATO forces are using airpower to strike the Taliban and other militants on \"the high ground.\" That frees up the Afghans to \"take the fight to the enemy,\" Mattis said. \nBut Marine Corps Gen. Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it's currently a stalemate in Afghanistan. \n\"We're not at a point where we can bring a successful political solution to the war,\" Dunford said. \nMattis also said during the hearing that the United States should remain in the nuclear deal negotiated during the Obama administration that constrains Iran's ability to build a nuclear arsenal \nSen. Angus King, I-Maine, asked if he thinks it's in the national security interest of the United States to stay a part of the international accord. \nMattis says, \"Yes, senator, I do.\" \nTrump has called the deal the worst agreement ever negotiated by the United States. He has repeatedly said that he's inclined not to certify Iranian compliance after having twice found the country compliant at earlier deadlines. Denying certification could lead the U.S. to reintroduce sanctions, which in turn could lead Iran to walk away from the deal or restart previously curtailed nuclear activities. \nSen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, lectured Mattis and Dunford at the opening of the hearing for failing to provide lawmakers with detailed information about Trump's Afghanistan strategy. \nMcCain declared that it was \"bizarre\" that Mattis and Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did not submit written testimony before the hearing started. That's common practice for administration witnesses testifying before congressional committees. \n\"We want to be your partners,\" McCain said. \"But this committee will not be a rubber stamp for any policy or president. We must be well-informed. We must be convinced of the merits of the administration's actions. And unfortunately, we still have far more questions than answers about this new strategy.\" \nTrump unveiled his new strategy for Afghanistan in August and said American troops would \"fight to win\" by attacking enemies, \"crushing\" al-Qaida, and preventing terrorist attacks against Americans. \nBut Trump's description of a win in Afghanistan notably did not include defeating the Taliban. He indicated that after an effective military effort it eventually may be possible to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan that includes elements of the Taliban. \nAlthough Trump insisted he would not talk about numbers of troops, he hinted he would embrace the Pentagon's proposal to boost troop numbers by nearly 4,000, augmenting the roughly 8,400 Americans currently stationed there. Mattis told the committee that more than 3,000 additional American forces will be arriving in the coming months to expand the training of the Afghan forces. The combined U.S. and NATO troop contingent currently in the country is about 13,500. \nTrump also singled out Pakistan for harboring Taliban leaders and other militants that are battling American troops in Afghanistan. Trump's tough words about Pakistan, a troubled U.S. security partner, infuriated Islamabad, which has denied the country provides safe havens for the Taliban. \nBut U.S. officials and analysts have long said Pakistan tolerates the presence of the Afghan Taliban and the allied Haqqani network, which are leading the insurgency against Afghan and U.S. forces. \nDunford told the committee that it's clear to him that Pakistan's intelligence service has connections to the terrorist groups. \nThe administration said last month that it was holding up the release of $255 million in military assistance for Pakistan until it cracked down on extremist groups that threaten Afghanistan. \n___ \nAssociated Press writer Robert Burns contributed to this report. \n___ \nFollow Richard Lardner on Twitter at http://twitter.com/rplardner Trending in U.S. ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:54:59.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9f7084e5b42f4e1395948f971a220870da6f245", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.08s7MHOUpOu2a9T_TFBGwp7pf.AKuNBf.uGc8bA8_CDrEumxUPcXFNXEtW.XIuf1y5Av854OH.3gL4sIxeu6HwyLa84ghNLPiXRsrsw2PsWFLqV33NRSw", "site_full": "www.foxnews.com", "site": "foxnews.com", "site_section": "http://www.foxnews.com/about/rss/feedburner/foxnews/latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Tennessee mail carrier sentenced for stealing opioids", "title_full": "Tennessee mail carrier sentenced for stealing opioids | Fox News", "published": "2017-10-03T18:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.foxnews.com/content/dam/fox-news/logo/og-fn-foxnews.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 185, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 25, "comments": 0, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9f7084e5b42f4e1395948f971a220870da6f245", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.08s7MHOUpOu2a9T_TFBGwp7pf.AKuNBf.uGc8bA8_CDrEumxUPcXFNXEtW.XIuf1y5Av854OH.3gL4sIxeu6HwyLa84ghNLPiXRsrsw2PsWFLqV33NRSw", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Associated Press", "published": "2017-10-03T18:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tennessee mail carrier sentenced for stealing opioids", "text": "Email GREENEVILLE, Tenn. \u2013 A Tennessee mail carrier who pleaded guilty to stealing at least 33 packages of medications intended for veterans has been sentenced to probation.
