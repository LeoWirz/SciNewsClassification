News & Views \u2018The Best is Yet to Come\u2019 Kaiser Permanente Watts Counseling and Learning Center celebrates 50 years October 3, 2017 Add to Collection Jacob Haik, left, John Jones III and David Roberts, representing the office of LA City Councilmember Joe Buscaino, celebrate the Watts Counseling and Learning Center\u2019s 50th anniversary. \nDining under the low-lit wings of the Space Shuttle Endeavour, more than 350 guests honored the Kaiser Permanente Watts Counseling and Learning Center\u2019s inspiring 50-year legacy while glimpsing an even brighter future. \n\u201cThis evening is a celebration to thank all of you for your support and commitment in helping to bring better health and wellness to Watts,\u201d said Maria T. Aguirre, director, Watts Counseling and Learning Center . \u201cBy working together, we can better support the neighborhoods where people live, work and play.\u201d \nFormer clients shared their positive experiences with the center, demonstrating its ability to change lives \u2014 one life at a time. \nEden Nava-Martinez, who grew up in the nearby Florence-Firestone neighborhood, expressed gratitude for the $7,500 Bill Coggins Leadership Award she recently received. Learning firsthand the importance of never giving up, she graduated high school with an exceptional 4.4 grade point average. She now attends the University of California, Los Angeles, where she is majoring in mathematics. \n\u201cI want to motivate kids that being from South Central should not stop them from pursuing their dreams,\u201d said Nava-Martinez, who plans to become a math educator. All guests invited to attend the anniversary party on Sept. 13 at the California Science Center in Los Angeles \u2014 including community partners, current and former center clients, parents, students, teachers, social workers and elected officials \u2014 have contributed to, or benefited from, the Watts Center services. The evening, themed \u201cHonoring the Past and Shaping the Future,\u201d completed a yearlong series of Kaiser Permanente events to acknowledge the center\u2019s dedication for more than half a century. \nA legacy of caring \nKaiser Permanente established the Watts Counseling and Learning Center two years after the 1965 Watts civil unrest to provide essential mental health, educational and outreach services for the children and families of Watts and surrounding communities, regardless of whether they were Kaiser Permanente members. \nVisionaries such as Southern California Permanente Medical Group physician leaders, Raymond Kay and Edward Green, and former Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Southern California Regional Manager James Vohs, inspired the idea then known as the \u201cWatts Project.\u201d But Bill Coggins \u2014 the young, ambitious, licensed clinical social worker they hired \u2014 took it to a level few could imagine. \n\u201cFor a seven-month period, Coggins went door to door in the community to learn what was needed to create a safe, nurturing, healthy environment where children and their families could learn, flourish and succeed,\u201d said Edward M. Ellison, MD , executive medical director and chairman of the board, SCPMG, and co-CEO, The Permanente Federation, LLC. \u201cThe rest, as they say, is history.\u201d \nSince then, the center known as a caring refuge where everyone feels like family, continues to fulfill its motto of \u201cHelping People Grow.\u201d \n\u201cOur people are what make the center special, and the services provided are what make what we do unique,\u201d said Julie Miller-Phipps , regional president, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan/Hospitals, Southern California, highlighting the broad range of specialized, low-cost programs and services the center offers. \n\u201cI made an internal commitment without telling anybody I was going to see it (the project) through,\u201d said Coggins, who received two standing ovations at the event for his dedication and service to the center. \nReferring to Kaiser Permanente\u2019s original concept of prepaid health care and caring for workers in the community, Coggins emphasized, \u201cCommunity health \u2014 it\u2019s been there from the beginning. And without Kaiser Permanente, there would be no Kaiser Permanente Watts Counseling and Learning Center.\u201d \nAn exciting future \nValued collaborations with local school districts, the city, our partners in health, community-based organizations, local government, business and the faith-based community have been key to the center\u2019s success \u2013 and are just as critical to its future, said Miller-Phipps. \nThe demand for more center services and increased physical space has led Kaiser Permanente to begin exploring ways to provide more accessible medical and mental health and wellness services to our growing South Los Angeles area membership. \n\u201cWe propose acquiring more land to rebuild the center and expand its programs and services,\u201d said Miller-Phipps, noting Kaiser Permanente has been working closely with the city of Los Angeles. \u201cThis could also mean the addition of a Kaiser Permanente Medical Office building in the future. We will continue engaging with local community officials, residents, and business partners throughout the process to ensure, as in the beginning with Bill Coggins, the community voice is heard.\u201d \n\u201cSo, get ready,\u201d said John Yamamoto, vice president, legal, government and community relations, community benefit, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan/Hospitals, to a thunderous crowd. \u201cThe best is yet to come!\u201d \nFor more information about Kaiser Permanente Southern California, follow us on twitter @KPSCALNews or go to https://share.kaiserpermanente.org .

News & Views Talking to Children About Tragic Events October 4, 2017 Add to Collection \nWhen tragedy occurs, parents face overwhelming and often difficult tasks: How do you explain this type of event to your children? How do you help them feel safe when you may feel helpless yourself? How much should you tell them? \nIn search of some answers, we reached out to Samantha Bookman, a licensed marriage and family therapist, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at Kaiser Permanente Woodland Hills Medical Center in Southern California. \nHere are some of her ideas: \nFor young children, don\u2019t assume children want, need, or can handle the whole truth just because they have a question or two. \nGive children short, simple answers to the exact question they ask. Avoid giving information they don\u2019t need. Don\u2019t feel pressured to give them the entire socio-political background regarding the situation. It\u2019s best to stay simple and wait and see if children want more information. If they appear satisfied with the information you gave them, you have said plenty. \nOnly give information that is appropriate for the youngest member of the family or group. \nIf you have a 5- and 8-year-old, only give information they both can handle. It\u2019s okay, and may be necessary, to interrupt and stop an older child if they are asking questions that will upset the younger child. Gently let them know you\u2019ll talk together later. \nFor older kids and teens, don\u2019t try to talk them out of being angry or afraid. \nIt won\u2019t work and they\u2019ll end up feeling like you don\u2019t understand and that they can\u2019t come to you with feelings. \nFocus on the fact that the majority of the time, in most places and cities around the world, we are safe. \nFor more mature young people, remind them that it\u2019s okay to be scared and to carry on with our lives. There is risk in our lives every day. We drive in cars. We live along fault lines. Bad things could happen, but usually, we aren\u2019t reminded of that, and we forget about it so that we can live our lives happily. And guess what? We are almost always just fine. \nChildren\u2019s exposure to news should always be limited. \nFor teens on social media, this is nearly impossible, but at the very least, you can view things together so you can help them sort through fact and fiction, etc. We can use this as an opportunity to talk with our teens about filtering social media and self-care. For example, if somebody frequently posts things that are upsetting or scary, we could talk with our teen about why temporarily (or permanently) hiding that person\u2019s posts might be a great way to take care of themselves. \nThe main way children hear about these events is from listening to adults. Remember: They are always listening, even when they don\u2019t seem to be paying attention. Be highly vigilant about what adult conversations are happening within earshot. \nIt is imperative parents not show anxiety about these events to their kids. \nChildren and teens have an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex (the area of the brain behind the forehead) which is what lets us use reason to calm our fears. \nYes, we are all afraid on some level, but we can remind ourselves of the reasons we are safe most of the time. Children and teens don\u2019t yet have nearly as much capacity to do this. Therefore, the result of scary information can be overwhelming and debilitating. \nIf your kids are really affected by the events, help them find a way to contribute something positive. Pick an organization that is offering aid and think of ways for your child to participate. Young kids can make a card to send to victims\u2019 families. Kids and teens could have a bake sale to raise money or contribute money earned from babysitting to an organization dedicated to helping those affected by tragedy. \nDon\u2019t hesitate to ask for help if you or your children are struggling with fear. \nAsking for help is a brave step. \nLetting high levels of anxiety go untreated can lead to behavioral, emotional, health and academic problems. Numerous healthy activities can help reduce stress and get you back on track: exercise; getting enough sleep; practicing relaxation; and talking to someone, whether it is a close friend, a supportive family member, a spiritual advisor, or a trained therapist.

News & Views Taking Health Care to the Work Site Increases Primary Care Visits By Dani K. Dodge Medlin, Southern California Permanente Medical Group October 6, 2017 Add to Collection Before Kaiser Permanente opened a clinic at the California Steel Industries worksite, the location was home to Kaiser Steel Mill, and the first Kaiser Permanente hospital in Southern California. \nA decade ago, Kaiser Permanente in Southern California sought to improve access to primary care by expanding patient services outside of hospitals and medical offices. They considered the possibility of offering health care at an actual worksite, just like Kaiser Permanente founders Sidney Garfield, MD, and Henry J. Kaiser did early in the development of what is now the nation\u2019s largest integrated health system. \nAt the same time, California Steel Industries in Fontana, California, put out a request for proposals to build a primary care clinic at their worksite. Kaiser Permanente won the contract, and it changed health care significantly for many of the company\u2019s 1,000 employees. \nA research article published today found that in the seven years since the clinic opened, primary care visits among employees and their family members insured by Kaiser Permanente increased, and the rate of urgent care and emergency department visits decreased. \nThe future of health care Paul Minardi, MD \n\u201cThis is a model for the future,\u201d said Paul M. Minardi , MD, senior author on the research article and the medical director of Business Management for Southern California Permanente Medical Group. \u201cWith this model, we can bring primary care directly to people so we can provide timely preventive care, and avoid long-term implications of chronic conditions and unmanaged health needs.\u201d \nThe study on the pilot project was published in the Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice . It compared California Steel employees who were Kaiser Permanente members with a control group of Kaiser Permanente members who lived in the same area, but did not work at California Steel. \nSignificant increase in primary care visits \nThe study found that: California Steel employees and their families had an increase in primary care visits of 43 percent, while the control group had an increase of 4 percent. California Steel employees and their families had a decrease in urgent care visits of 43 percent, while the control group had a decrease of 5 percent. California Steel employees and their families had a decrease in emergency room visits by 4 percent, while the control group had an increase of 8 percent. While the rate of primary care visits increased for the California Steel employees by 96 percent, it only increased by 15 percent for their dependents. \n\u201cThis research explores what happens when primary care is easily available,\u201d said lead author David Glass , PhD, a Kaiser Permanente research scientist at the Department of Research & Evaluation in Southern California. \u201cAlthough this was one small pilot, we learned a lot from it and were gratified to see decreases in urgent care and emergency room visits.\u201d David Glass \nWhile the rate of primary-care visits increased for the California Steel employees by 96 percent from the pre- to post-intervention period, it only increased by 15 percent for their dependents. \nGlass also noted that due to the employees\u2019 higher rate of primary care visits and a limited number of costly inpatient stays, there were no cost savings overall from the project. If researchers looked at dependents alone, though, they found that there was a cost savings. \n\u201cThere has been a widespread belief that if patients had more access to primary care that costs would go down because there would be fewer high-cost visits to urgent care and emergency departments,\u201d said Glass. \u201cBut the reality is much more complicated than that.\u201d \nThe researchers hope to explore what happens when they work with larger employers. \nBecoming health care partners \nAt the same time Kaiser Permanente leaders in Southern California began looking at ways to create new health care opportunities, California Steel wanted to better manage the health care costs of their employees, reduce absenteeism and allow employees to manage their health care while at work. \nThe clinic construction began in 2009. It was a slow time in the steel industry, so instead of laying off workers, California Steel had them build the health care center. The worksite clinic opened in 2010. It was not the first time Kaiser Permanente was part of building something at that Fontana location. California Steel is on the site of the former Kaiser Steel Mill, where the first Kaiser Permanente hospital in Southern California was built in 1942. \nThe California Steel Kaiser Permanente members received their care at the clinic for free (no co-pays), and received same-day appointments. California Steel employees who were not Kaiser Permanente members also could receive health care at the clinic. \nIn providing health care to California steel workers, Kaiser Permanente became a health care partner and helped it\u2019s Fontana campus become smoke free, remove unhealthy foods from vending machines, offer healthier options in the cafeteria and tackle obesity with a range of programs. \nMore on-site clinics planned \n\u201cKaiser Permanente saw its insured portion of the workers grow from 40 percent to 65 percent,\u201d said Dr. Minardi, \u201cand virtually every new employee signs on with Kaiser Permanente.\u201d \nThe pilot project at California Steel will continue at least five more years. \nKaiser Permanente is now beginning a new pilot project with the employees of the county of San Diego, Dr. Minardi noted.

That one-day event has evolved into a movement, as many people now advocate for walking or biking to school as a way for children to incorporate regular physical activity into their school days. \nConsider creating a walking school bus with the kids and families who live in your neighborhood to make walking to school safer and more fun. \nAbout the Author Caitlin Dong works in National Public Relations and Communications for Kaiser Permanente and has been involved with nonprofit youth organizations for many years.

It is important for parents and school staff to be aware of a few safety basics when it comes to strapping on that pack. How much weight is too much for a student\u2019s backpack? \nProperly fitted backpacks that are not too heavy can prevent injuries. \nA child\u2019s backpack should weigh no more than 10 to 15 percent of their weight. If your child weighs 70 pounds, that means a bag weighing 7 to 10 pounds \u2014 which is a couple of books, a full water bottle, a jacket and healthy lunch \u2014 could be pushing it. \nFinding ways to lighten the load can mean less muscle soreness, less fatigue and a happier student ready for academic success. \nIt\u2019s simple to keep kids safe from the discomfort and pain that can be caused by backpacks. Choosing the best backpack Select a backpack that is the correct size for the child \u2014 if it looks too big, it\u2019s likely not the best size. Pick a backpack with padded shoulder straps. Find a backpack with a padded back for extra comfort. Pick a pack with extra pockets and use the compartments to distribute the weight evenly. If carrying heavy items is a must, consider a backpack that has wheels \u2014 if allowed by the school. \nWearing it right Keep the load light \u2014 if the student has to lean forward, the pack is too heavy. Heavy items should sit near the center and closest to the back. Encourage children to use both shoulder straps rather than hanging the back pack on one side. Secure the sternum strap and the hip belt. Check that the backpack fits snugly and rests comfortably on the back. \n\nAt the very least, helping a student be aware of the potential for injury can be helpful in prevention. Apply these basics to make a difference and set students on a path to healthy backpack-wearing habits. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jack", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "school", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "comment  every school", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T23:41:36.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1e6af7214832891abef582271bd664dfd028e2b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUoVnRmrrky7k0DEiaAGM7NNCVrJPTr8GCUh_KU_pwlQ6", "site_full": "share.kaiserpermanente.org", "site": "kaiserpermanente.org", "site_section": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/category/rss-feed/feed", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "rss-feed \u2013 Kaiser Permanente Share", "title": "Fires in Northern California", "title_full": "Fires in Northern California", "published": "2017-10-09T22:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/KPLogo_MidBlueBackground_548x336.png", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 1935, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 352, "comments": 0, "shares": 352}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 16}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1e6af7214832891abef582271bd664dfd028e2b5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUoVnRmrrky7k0DEiaAGM7NNCVrJPTr8GCUh_KU_pwlQ6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karen Hershenson", "published": "2017-10-09T22:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Fires in Northern California", "text": "  Fires in Northern California Updated: October 10,   \nUpdated 7 p.m. Tuesday, Oct. 10 \nOur Santa Rosa Medical Center remains closed until further notice.

News & Views Press Release Live Phone Calls Better Than Text Messages and Letters to Remind People About Colon Cancer Screening Kaiser Permanente study also finds differences in the way Spanish- and English-speaking patients respond to reminder strategies October 11, 2017 Add to Collection \nPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 Live phone calls significantly outperform text messages and letters as a way to remind patients to complete and return at-home screening tests for colon cancer, according to new research in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. \nThe study included more than 2,700 patients who receive care in safety-net clinics and who were overdue for colon cancer screening. Colon cancer screening is recommended for everyone ages 50-75. \nThe patients were sent test kits by mail, and 10 percent mailed back their completed tests within three weeks. Those who did not return the kits within that period were assigned to one of seven reminder interventions. These included a phone call from a clinic outreach worker (live call), two automated calls, two text messages, a single reminder letter, or a combination of these strategies. \nThe live phone call intervention was most effective, resulting in 32 percent of patients in this group completing and returning their test kit within six months. The text message intervention was the least effective \u2014 only 17 percent of patients in this group completed and mailed back their test. \n\u201cWe knew that these patients are not as text savvy as younger patients, but we didn\u2019t expect text messaging to do so poorly, compared to the other strategies,\u201d said Gloria Coronado , PhD, lead author and cancer disparities researcher with the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research . \u201cText messaging is a relatively inexpensive way to send patient reminders, but for this group it was also relatively ineffective.\u201d \nPatients received the various reminders in their preferred language. Phone calls were the most effective strategy for all patients, but English speakers were more likely to resond to live phone calls, while Spanish speakers were more likely to respond to the combination of a live call and two automated calls. \nPeople assigned to receive the live call and the automated calls had more contacts with the health care system. It appears that Spanish speakers appreciated this additional contact, while English speakers may have been more likely to disregard the additional automated calls, said Coronado. \n\u201cThe phone calls may help to build trust or confianza , which is an important value and motivator for care-seeking among Hispanics,\u201d added Ricardo Jimenez, MD, co-author and medical director of Sea Mar Community Health Centers in Seattle, where the study took place. \n\u201cOur study shows that one reminder intervention doesn\u2019t necessarily work for all patients. We need to design interventions tailored to the patient\u2019s language and cultural preference,\u201d explained Coronado. \nInitially, at-home fecal screening tests were sent to 2,722 patients who received their health care in the Sea Mar system and who were overdue for colon cancer screening. Some of the tests were returned by the U.S. Postal Service because patients no longer lived at the address on file. After excluding these patients and the patients who mailed their test kits back within three weeks, there were 2,010 assigned to one of the seven reminder interventions. \nThe authors believe it is the first study to rigorously test the effectiveness of reminder strategies in a safety net system among patients with different language preferences. \nStudy strengths include its large, diverse sample size and ability to capture the patients\u2019 demographic and medical information in the medical record. The study also has some limitations. Researchers could determine whether the text messages were sent to active cell numbers, but not whether patients received the text messages. They also don\u2019t know whether patients listened to the automated phone messages or read the postcards. \nThe study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health Common Fund and the National Cancer Institute, and is part of the larger STOP Colon Cancer pragmatic trial that aims to improve colorectal cancer screening in community health clinics in Oregon, California and Washington (UH2AT007782) (4UH3CA188640-02). \nIn addition to Coronado and Dr. Jimenez, other authors include Jennifer Rivelli, MA, Morgan Fuoco, MA, William Vollmer, PhD, Amanda Petrik, MS, Erin Keast, MPH, from the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research in Portland, Oregon, and Sara Barker, MPH, and Emily Topalanchik from Sea Mar Community Health Center in Seattle.. \nAbout the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research The Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, founded in 1964, is a nonprofit research institution dedicated to advancing knowledge to improve health.

This is the latest expansion investment in Southern Colorado, part of a larger, multiyear strategy to offer more care options and continue to grow membership. The Pueblo South Medical Offices will be located at the intersection of Pueblo Boulevard and Acero Avenue and provide convenient access to primary care, some specialty care, laboratory, pharmacy and routine medical imaging services, all under one roof. \nThe Pueblo South Medical Offices will open to Kaiser Permanente members in early 2019. This is the health plan\u2019s second medical office building in Pueblo and the fourth in Southern Colorado. Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Pueblo North Medical Offices are located on the north end of town and opened in 2009. The new Pueblo South facility will provide members with an additional option to access Kaiser Permanente\u2019s health care services. \n\u201cWe wanted to bring a new medical office building to the Pueblo community and this location was ideal to provide another access point for our members in the south-central part of the community,\u201d said Holly Kortum, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s executive director of operations in Southern Colorado. \u201cOur Pueblo South Medical Offices will make it easy to see a doctor, pick up a prescription or have blood work done, all in the same place. We think the Pueblo community is going to love this new facility.\u201d \nWhile specific staffing plans are still in the works, the new Pueblo South Medical Offices will employ approximately six health care professionals, including two to three physicians, nurses, technicians and administrative staff. Kaiser Permanente will be purchasing 3.28 acres of land located at the intersection of Pueblo Boulevard and Acero Avenue. Construction on the 8,200 square foot facility is tentatively scheduled to begin in early 2018. \n\u201cThe Pueblo South Medical Offices will bring primary care closer to our members on the south end of town,\u201d said C. Rocky White, MD, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Southern Colorado market medical director. \u201cAccess to primary care services in smaller communities is always a challenge, so bringing more of our integrated care delivery system to Southern Colorado will help to address that need. While we will continue to work with our network physicians, this facility offers an additional site for our physicians to provide the level of care expected from Kaiser Permanente.\u201d \nKaiser Permanente continues to expand services and develop innovative programs to better serve the needs of its members and community, including opening a second location in Colorado Springs and expanding primary and specialty care in 2015, offering extended hours for primary care and pharmacy hours in 2017, and offering more virtual-care options in 2017. Kaiser Permanente has also made a significant investment in physician recruitment. Today, 28 Colorado Permanente Medical Group physicians serve Kaiser Permanente members in Southern Colorado, including 13 primary care physicians (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics), eight specialty care physicians (audiology, cardiology, dermatology, endocrinology, optometry, rheumatology, palliative care), and seven hospitalists. \nKaiser Permanente has also increased its commitment to health technology by launching several virtual-care options to meet members where they are, including e-visits, video visits, email and phone. Kaiser Permanente also launched a new, on-demand service called \u201cChat with a Doctor.\u201d The service is an online platform that allows all Kaiser Permanente Colorado members to securely interact with a Kaiser Permanente physician in real-time, for questions or advice. \nAs a nonprofit,   also committed to improving the health of its communities. Since 2010, Kaiser Permanente has donated more than $3.1 million Southern Colorado nonprofit and community-based organizations to improve access to safety-net clinics, educate the public about food insecurity, bolster physical activity for schoolchildren, and address the mental health needs of teachers, students and school staff . \nAbout   Pueblo South Medical Offices Open Date: Early 2019 Address: Pueblo Blvd. and Acero Ave. intersection Square Footage: Approximately 8,200 square feet \nServices:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "holly kortum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c. rocky white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "second pueblo kaiser permanente medical office announced   plans for second pueblo kaiser permanente medical office", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pueblo north medical offices", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pueblo south medical offices", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado permanente medical group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente\u2019s southern colorado", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pueblo boulevard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pueblo blvd.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pueblo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southern colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado springs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pueblo south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acero ave.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acero avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado springs", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T01:12:42.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d8bf2873b102e469d701ed9a982d61ef9032c58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUgf_3yRbzVCphsdfJGAqeuPZbAto25BOcyKxdokULJ0rPudLG5vsOZBqdnUsXHLeDT0OobosNZYkRtWG9LTnDJeezRDd6Q1MehCWB3HUXd1g1w1DG3ukXrs-", "site_full": "share.kaiserpermanente.org", "site": "kaiserpermanente.org", "site_section": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/category/rss-feed/feed", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "rss-feed \u2013 Kaiser Permanente Share", "title": "Breast Cancer Survivor and Single Mom Advises Women to Get Essential Health Screenings", "title_full": "Breast Cancer Survivor and Single Mom Advises Women to Get Essential Health Screenings", "published": "2017-10-13T01:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/breast-cancer-survivor-feature-548x336.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1935, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d8bf2873b102e469d701ed9a982d61ef9032c58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUgf_3yRbzVCphsdfJGAqeuPZbAto25BOcyKxdokULJ0rPudLG5vsOZBqdnUsXHLeDT0OobosNZYkRtWG9LTnDJeezRDd6Q1MehCWB3HUXd1g1w1DG3ukXrs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karen Hershenson", "published": "2017-10-13T01:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breast Cancer Survivor and Single Mom Advises Women to Get Essential Health Screenings", "text": "Add to Collection Shelley Ramey \nLOS ANGELES, Calif . \u2014 October is Women\u2019s Health and Breast Cancer Screening Month, and Shelley Ramey, a West Los Angeles resident and breast cancer survivor, is sharing her story with the hopes of encouraging women to take care of their health, and not skip essential screenings. \nShelley Ramey calls the cancer that for years plagued her body mentally, physically and emotionally \u2013 a gift. \n\u201cI am learning from my cancer experience and turning it into a new passion for my life,\u201d the 45-year-old said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I had cancer, but am open to the idea that it will do something for me in my life. Every day I am meeting more survivors, and I believe I can be of help by sharing with them what I have gone through.\u201d \nThe Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center patient is a single mother who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2012 when her son was just 3 years old. She initially thought a mastectomy had removed all the cancer, and was devastated when it returned a few years later. This time it came back under her arm in a much more aggressive form. \n\u201cI was so powerless about whether I lived or died, I wasn\u2019t thinking negatively \u2013 I was doing everything I had to live. But I realized that I had to take a little bit of time to think about what would happen if I passed away. I knew my son would be a stronger person for it, but I knew I was going to fight for it not to happen,\u201d Ramey said. \nShe worked closely with Kanchana Subramanian Anand, MD , an oncologist at Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Center, and underwent a thorough series of bone scans, chemotherapy treatment, radiation and surgeries. \nDespite how nauseous she often felt after receiving chemotherapy, Ramey said she always enjoyed her treatments. \n\u201cThe oncology nurses at Kaiser Permanente West LA are just stellar,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey always maintained such a cheerful attitude. There were days that I just didn\u2019t feel well. The nurses would sit with me and provide warm blankets and pillows, you felt like you were part of their family. I couldn\u2019t thank them enough for their attitude, it was just incredible.\u201d \nShe also took advantage of the multitude of services Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles offers, including nutrition and counseling services, financial assistance, the 24-hour pharmacy, and even had to make several late-night visits to urgent care. Social workers in oncology and radiation guided her along every step of the way. \nRamey completed her radiation treatments in November, but says the struggle to return to \u201cnormal\u201d life as a cancer survivor, was something that she didn\u2019t expect. \n\u201cYou just put your head down and fight so hard during the chemo and radiation and then you transition from being a fighter to a survivor. I was simply shell shocked \u2013 I wanted to just get back to my old life but I found that my old life wasn\u2019t there anymore. Everything was different,\u201d she said. \nShe now hopes to help other cancer survivors by bridging the gap from being a fighter to a survivor \u2013 maintaining a positive attitude while not brushing away the feelings experienced during their journey to health. That\u2019s the gift she\u2019s talking about. \n\u201cI\u2019m using it as a catapult or a bridge to a new life,\u201d she said. \u201cI talk to people about what I got out of cancer \u2013 how do we cope with it from here?\u201d \nRamey is available for interviews on this topic.

News & Views Kaiser Permanente Selects LAEP to Provide Mental Health and Wellness Support in Schools Resilience in school environments project kicks off in California, Colorado and Georgia October 12, 2017 Add to Collection \nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Kaiser Permanente has selected the Los Angeles Education Partnership (or LAEP ) Transform Schools department, as the national organizational partner for its Resilience in School Environments (RISE) project, which is part of the organization\u2019s goal to improve the total health \u2014 mind, body and spirit \u2014 of its members and communities in which it serves. \n\u201cThe health of school teachers and staff are of the utmost importance to our communities, and we at Kaiser Permanente recognize that supporting their mental health and wellness benefits them, the students they work with, and our communities as a whole,\u201d said Loel Solomon, vice president of Community Health, Kaiser Permanente. \u201cThis unique partnership with LAEP is an exciting and innovative way to foster support for our communities\u2019 teachers, staff and students.\u201d \nBuilding on the work of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Thriving Schools program, the RISE project will integrate trauma-informed practices into the school environment using methods guided by Senior Director Xiomara Mateo-Gaxiola, Ed.D, and Director Ana Maria Apodaca, along with their team of coaches. The University of Maryland School of Medicine\u2019s Center for School Mental Health will evaluate the implementation and impact of RISE during a two-year term. Both teachers and students will benefit from the program. \n\u201cWe see resilient school systems as important to not only student wellness, but also school employee wellness,\u201d said Mateo-Gaxiola. \u201cAs school employees gain insight into trauma-informed practices, they are better able to form compassionate responses to a student\u2019s symptoms of trauma. Attention to resiliency and trauma-informed practices is often overlooked as an important part of school employee development; we see it as essential.\u201d \nThe expansion of the RISE project started with the opening of the 2017-2018 school year in 20 schools located in California, Colorado and Georgia \u2014 communities served by Kaiser Permanente, the nation\u2019s largest integrated health system. \nLAEP is an education nonprofit that works in high-poverty and under-resourced communities to foster schools that support the personal and academic success of students. LAEP coaches, one for each school participating in the RISE project, will work with a school site leadership team made up of teachers, counselors, administrators and others. The coaches and leadership teams will be revisiting school policies and practices to improve school climate, participating in ongoing professional development for all school staff, and supporting implementation of school employee wellness practices. \n\u201cWe are thrilled to be part of this project for many reasons,\u201d said Ellen Pais, president and CEO, LAEP. \u201cFirst, it allows us to extend our resilience practices in Los Angeles to school districts in other parts of Southern California, Northern California, Colorado and Georgia. But what\u2019s equally exciting is the evaluation component, provided by the Center for School Mental Health. We expect the results will show that in areas where traumatic events greatly impact students\u2019 ability to learn, trauma-informed and resiliency practices can largely improve these learning environments, as well as reduce stress for the administration, teachers and staff who work with these students.\u201d \nKaiser Permanente Thriving Schools is a comprehensive effort to create a culture of health and wellness for students, staff and teachers in K-12 schools. When it began, it promoted healthy eating and active living in schools, and has since expanded to also encourage mental health for staff, teachers and students, in part through the RISE project. Thriving Schools serves as part of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s ongoing mission to provide high-quality, affordable health care services to improve the well-being of its members and the communities it serves. \nAbout Kaiser Permanente Kaiser Permanente is committed to helping shape the future of health care.

News & Views Press Release Kaiser Permanente Medicare Health Plans Rated Among Nation\u2019s Best for Quality, Service For the eighth consecutive year, Kaiser Permanente receives high scores from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in its Medicare star quality ratings October 12, 2017 Add to Collection \nOAKLAND, Calif. \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m on bonus time, there\u2019s absolutely no question about that,\u201d said George Wittemyer, reflecting on the care he received from physicians and nurses during an emergency cardiac event and subsequent surgery. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy. Here I am, thanks to Kaiser Permanente.\u201d \nWittemyer\u2019s experience of seamless care, expert medicine and top-notch service represents one of the many reasons the organization\u2019s Medicare health plans have once again received high scores by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \nIn CMS\u2019 Oct. 11 announcement of the 2018 Medicare star quality ratings, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Medicare health plans in Northern and Southern California, Colorado, Hawaii, Northwest and Mid-Atlantic States received 5 out of 5 stars each. Kaiser Permanente in Georgia and Washington earned 4.5 out of 5 stars. \nAccording to CMS, Kaiser Permanente represents five of 15 Medicare health plans (with Parts C and D) that earned 5 out of 5 stars, the highest overall rating. Moreover, of the nearly 2 million beneficiaries enrolled in those 5-star plans nationwide, 72 percent are Kaiser Permanente Medicare members. Wittemyer is one of more than 1.5 million Medicare beneficiaries who rely on Kaiser Permanente for high-quality health care with service that is convenient, personalized and simple to use. \nThe \u2018turbine\u2019 \nWittemyer, 77, a Kaiser Permanente Medicare health plan member in Portland, Oregon, knew something was wrong when after increasing episodes of weakness and shortness of breath, he could hardly walk up his driveway. Thanks to quick action by his internist, Wittemyer was soon in urgent care for treatment, and then conferring with his physicians about surgery to attach a left ventricular assist device, or \u201cLVAD,\u201d to his heart. \nAfter much discussion and deliberation, Wittemyer made the decision with his doctors to proceed with the surgery. Surgery and recovery were both a success, and Wittemyer credits his entire care team \u2014 including his \u201cpeerless\u201d surgeon, \u201cmarvelous\u201d physicians and \u201cincredible\u201d nurses \u2014 with providing expert care and support throughout his experience. \nPerhaps because he grew up on a working farm, Wittemyer calls his LVAD \u201cthe turbine.\u201d With his new turbine in place, Wittemyer is back to driving his tractor, chopping trees and doing other chores on his acreage. \u201cI\u2019m back to being a normal person,\u201d he said, smiling. \n\u201cBy providing excellent, compassionate care, our physicians and care teams are helping our members achieve and maintain total health,\u201d said Michael Kanter, MD, executive vice president of quality and chief quality officer for The Permanente Federation, the national organization for more than 21,000 physicians who provide care to Kaiser Permanente\u2019s 11.8 million members. \u201cOur patients partner with their doctors to make personalized treatment decisions together so they can live full, active lives. The CMS ratings reflect the success of our person-centered approach to delivering safe and effective care.\u201d \nAs the nation\u2019s largest integrated health system, Kaiser Permanente connects its care teams to members via digital tools, technology and a range of care settings so that members can access care whenever and wherever they need. \nHigh performance \nKaiser Permanente Medicare plans have consistently received high ratings since the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services began the Medicare stars program, and have maintained high performance in all states in which the health plan operates. For CMS\u2019 2018 star ratings: Kaiser Permanente Colorado received the highest possible rating of 5 out of 5 stars for the eighth year in a row. Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California received the highest possible rating of 5 out of 5 stars for the seventh year in a row and is the highest rated plan in the state.* Kaiser Permanente Northwest, which includes Oregon and southwest Washington, received the highest possible rating of 5 out of 5 stars for the seventh year in a row. Kaiser Permanente Mid-Atlantic States, which includes Maryland, Virgina and Washington, D.C., received the highest possible rating of 5 out of 5 stars for the sixth year in a row. Kaiser Permanente Hawaii received the highest possible rating of 5 out of 5 stars and is the highest rated plan in the state. Kaiser Permanente Georgia received 4.5 out of 5 stars. Kaiser Permanente Washington received 4.5 out of 5 stars. \n*Northern and Southern California regions rated together as they represent one CMS contract. \nA rating system to make choice easier \nCMS created the Medicare star quality rating system to provide beneficiaries with a way to assess Medicare plans based on quality of care and service delivery, so they can make an informed decision when choosing a plan. CMS uses the star ratings system to rank Medicare health plans on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars representing the highest quality. \nKaiser Permanente Medicare health plans have consistently received high ratings since CMS began awarding them in 2009. \n\u201cOur high star ratings year after year reflect the dedicated work of providers and staff throughout our organization to ensure the best care and service experience for our members,\u201d said Patrick Courneya, MD, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals. \u201cKaiser Permanente\u2019s integrated model enables a seamless, coordinated care experience for members, and our commitment to evidence-based practices and prevention measures means we are our patients\u2019 partner in becoming their healthiest selves.\u201d \nA leader in quality \nKaiser Permanente\u2019s high rating by CMS is the latest of several quality recognitions the organization has achieved this year. In the \u201cNCQA Health Insurance Plan Ratings 2017-2018\u201d report, the National Committee for Quality Assurance lists all seven Kaiser Permanente Medicare plans as the highest rated or ranked, or tied-for-highest, in the markets they serve \u2014 for the sixth year in a row. And for the fifth consecutive year, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Medicare website, kp.org/Medicare, was rated one of the top Medicare websites in the nation for providing consumers with an easy, positive and high-value experience. \nMedicare beneficiaries can learn more about the star ratings and Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Medicare health plans by visiting kp.org/medicarestars . \nAbout Kaiser Permanente Kaiser Permanente is committed to helping shape the future of health care.

For more information, go to: kp.org/share . \nFast facts: Medicare quality stars \nWhat they measure: The overall scores for Medicare quality stars are based on care and service quality measures (Parts C and D) across nine categories, including staying healthy, member satisfaction, managing chronic conditions, customer service and pharmacy services. The star ratings also measure health plans\u2019 compliance performance. \nMethodology: Star ratings are calculated each year and may change from one year to the next.

News & Views Kaiser Permanente Colorado Medicare Health Plan Rated Among Nation\u2019s Best for Quality, Service October 12, 2017 Add to Collection \nDENVER \u2014 \u201cI have a family history of melanoma. So, when I saw a nasty looking mole, I was a little worried,\u201d said Martha Johnson, a long-time Kaiser Permanente Medicare member. \u201cLuckily, my Kaiser Permanente providers took care of me quickly. From biopsy and surgery to my follow-up appointment, the kindness and compassion that I felt was huge. Real impressive, first rate, gold-plated care.\u201d \nJohnson\u2019s experience is just one of the many reasons why the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rated Kaiser Permanente Colorado\u2019s Medicare Senior Advantage plan 5 out of 5 stars \u2014 the highest overall rating for quality and service \u2014 for 2018. This is the eighth consecutive year Kaiser Permanente Colorado has received this rating. \n\u201cFor eight straight years, we\u2019ve been recognized by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services with 5 out of 5 stars. I\u2019m proud of our 7,000 physicians, nurses, and staff who work to make this prestigious designation from the CMS possible. Our employees strive each day to help our members live their healthiest, happiest and longest lives,\u201d said Roland Lyon , president of Kaiser Permanente Colorado. \nAccording to CMS, Kaiser Permanente Colorado is the only Medicare health plan in Colorado that earned 5 out of 5 stars, the highest overall rating. Johnson is one of more than 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries in the state who rely on Kaiser Permanente for high-quality health care with service that is convenient, personalized and simple to use. \nFast facts: Medicare quality stars \nWhat they measure: The overall scores for Medicare quality stars are based on care and service quality measures (Parts C and D) across nine categories, including staying healthy, member satisfaction, managing chronic conditions, customer service and pharmacy services. The star ratings also measure health plans\u2019 compliance performance. \nMethodology: Star ratings are calculated each year and may change from one year to the next. The methodology CMS uses for the star ratings is dynamic and continues to change. This means that Medicare health plans must stay ahead of the curve on measures that may be included in the 5-star portfolio, and continually improve their performance to achieve 5 stars. \n\u201cWe\u2019re proud of this 5-star rating from CMS. With a rapidly growing senior population in Colorado, our physicians know the importance of leveraging coordinated care, the most up-to-date technology and convenient care options which help our members live healthier and longer lives,\u201d said Margaret Ferguson , MD, president and executive medical director for the Colorado Permanente Medical Group \u2014 one of the state\u2019s largest medical groups that provides care for the 680,000 Kaiser Permanente members in Colorado. \nCMS created the Medicare star quality rating system to provide beneficiaries with a way to assess Medicare plans based on quality of care and service delivery, so they can make an informed decision when choosing a plan. CMS uses the star ratings system to rank Medicare health plans on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars representing the highest quality. \nAlong with high-quality care and service, another benefit of 5-star plans is a longer enrollment opportunity. Medicare beneficiaries may change to a 5-star Kaiser Permanente individual Medicare plan through a CMS 5-star Special Enrollment Period from Dec. 8, 2017 to Nov. 30, 2018, without having to wait until the next annual enrollment period. \nMedicare beneficiaries can learn more about the star ratings and Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Medicare health plans by visiting kp.org/medicarestars . \nAbout Kaiser Permanente Colorado Kaiser Permanente Colorado is the state\u2019s largest nonprofit health plan, working to improve the lives and health of all Coloradans for 48 years.

News & Views Statement from Bernard J. Tyson, Chairman and CEO, on October 12, 2017 Executive Order October 12, 2017 Add to Collection \nKaiser Permanente believes that changes to our nation\u2019s health care laws and regulations should increase access to high-quality, affordable care and coverage for as many people as possible. Unfortunately, today\u2019s executive order on health care puts in motion several steps that may be counterproductive to that goal. \nThe executive order could undercut important consumer protections, increase costs for older people and those with serious medical conditions, and eliminate access to important coverage for mental health, substance abuse, maternity care and prescription drugs. It could also compound uncertainty in both the individual and small group markets. \nWe strongly encourage policymakers to continue the commitment in current law to consumer protections at the state and federal level. In addition, as priorities for any additional proposals around health reform are considered, we would recommend that policymakers focus on stabilization of the current marketplace and the 30 million Americans currently without coverage.

News & Views Kaiser Permanente Washington Launches Statewide Commitment to Healthier, Thriving Schools Kaiser Permanente and Seattle Children\u2019s Theatre begin statewide tour with play on bullying October 13, 2017 Add to Collection A scene from a Kaiser Permanente Educational Theatre production. \nSEATTLE \u2014 Studies show that theater helps kids take in and retain health information, aiding positive behavior change. That\u2019s why Kaiser Permanente Washington is launching, with a $600,000 investment, the Kaiser Permanente Educational Theatre Program , expected to reach more than 18,000 students across the state this school year. \nIn Washington, the program takes shape through a partnership with Seattle Children\u2019s Theatre , where professional artists work closely with our health care providers, as well as with teachers and students, to develop plays and workshops that inspire healthy choices and build stronger communities. \nWhile the program is new here, it is not new to Kaiser Permanente. What began as a single play for elementary school children has become a series of award-winning theatrical productions, experiential learning workshops, and youth engagement programs across the country. In 2016, more than 250,000 students were reached in 330 K-12 schools nationwide. \n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to bring this programming to Washington as we partner with our local schools to address the physical and emotional health issues that are most pressing to students,\u201d said Susan Mullaney, president, Kaiser Permanente Washington. \nBullying is focus of \u2018Above Between Below\u2019 \nThe first play in Kaiser Permanente Washington, \u201c Above Between Below ,\u201d was developed for middle-school students and focuses on bullying. The play shows how aggression and shaming on social media can hurt others and helps the audience understand how they can help prevent and stop bullying. \n\u201cThis play shows how vulnerable we all are,\u201d says Wellesley Chapman, MD, a physician with Washington Permanente Medical Group and a member of the Educational Theatre Program advisory group. \u201cWe can all identify with the characters \u2014 the bullied person, the one who is bullying and the onlooker \u2014 which makes its message really hit home.\u201d \nOver the course of the school year, the play will tour 31 schools statewide throughout King, Pierce, Snohomish, Spokane and Whitman counties. The multifaceted program also includes a conflict-resolution program for elementary school students, offering an immersive and supportive platform to explore health and community. \nPart of a larger vision for Thriving Schools \nA long-standing focus of Kaiser Permanente efforts to improve health, and schools continue to be one of the best places to reach members and the community. \nThe Educational Theatre Program is just one aspect of how Kaiser Permanente Washington is bringing Thriving Schools \u2014 a broader national health effort directed toward students, staff and teachers in K-12 school districts served by the organization \u2014 to life in Washington. \nHere are just a few of the other ways Kaiser Permanente Washington is taking action: Participating in a nationwide digital campaign to promote health and wellness for school faculty. Launched last week, the #TeachersTake5 campaign targets teachers, administrators and school employees in over 20,000 schools in the U.S. to take five minutes a day with their colleagues to be healthier. #TeachersTake5 provides free resources, trainings and assistance for employee wellness practices and programs. Installing \u201cBuddy Benches.\u201d Kaiser Permanente Washington will install 30 benches this year in Spokane-area schools to promote inclusion and social connection among students. The first benches were installed in the Freeman School District in September. Providing more than $2 million in care for more than 7,500 students through school-based clinics at eight locations in King County and at Orion Health Center, where we reach 1,000 homeless and at-risk youth. \nAbout Kaiser Permanente Kaiser Permanente is committed to helping shape the future of health care.

Cooler weather also tends to keep people indoors, thus increasing a person\u2019s exposure to germs and ultimately, increasing their risk of illness.\u201d \nDr. Khoury adds that there are some Halloween-specific reasons people also become ill at this time of year. \n\u201cKeep in mind that flu and cold germs spread from person to person by way of coughing, sneezing or simply talking. When we attend gatherings \u2013 including Halloween parties \u2013 we risk being in close contact with others who may be ill. So, if your child is feeling sick, it\u2019s best that he or she stay home. Not only will rest help him or her feel better, but it will also protect other children from becoming ill. Last, while one late night out may not do much harm, it\u2019s important that we ensure our children are getting a good night\u2019s rest every night. Lack of sleep can weaken a child\u2019s immune system.\u201d \nIn addition, says Dr. Khoury, it\u2019s especially important for children who suffer from chronic respiratory conditions, like asthma, to stay healthy. Both a cold and the flu can trigger an asthma attack, cause shortness of breath, lead to serious infections like pneumonia, or result in other life-threatening complications. \nThe best way to ward off the flu? Get flu shots for you and your family. It can take up to two weeks for the body to develop immunity, so it\u2019s important to vaccinate as early in the season as possible. Also, when shopping for that perfect costume, take advantage of the time to review germ prevention strategies with your children. This includes avoiding touching their eyes, nose or mouth. They should also wash their hands frequently \u2013 and if soap and water are not available, encourage children to use an alcohol-based hand gel. \n\u201cI tell kids to wash their hands for as long as it takes to sing the \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 song twice,\u201d says Dr. Khoury. \u201cI also tell them to cough \u2013 or sneeze \u2013 into their arm like Dracula.\u201d Related News ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "margaret k", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "khoury", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kaiser permanente southern california flu vaccination program", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T06:14:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cee871046b91bb59d703234dfb3b346917e5411f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUoMpq3uv5OP5ASL.kW8n8nzT9EwkFJDksCH.YVKL4p_9S9tyWi8WVT0AElNVlRmXqeueefPGmj6T", "site_full": "share.kaiserpermanente.org", "site": "kaiserpermanente.org", "site_section": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/category/rss-feed/feed", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "rss-feed \u2013 Kaiser Permanente Share", "title": "Innovative Breast Reconstruction Through Fat Grafting", "title_full": "Innovative Breast Reconstruction Through Fat Grafting", "published": "2017-10-18T00:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Joyce-breast-cancer-feature-548x336.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1935, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cee871046b91bb59d703234dfb3b346917e5411f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUoMpq3uv5OP5ASL.kW8n8nzT9EwkFJDksCH.YVKL4p_9S9tyWi8WVT0AElNVlRmXqeueefPGmj6T", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karen Hershenson", "published": "2017-10-18T00:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Innovative Breast Reconstruction Through Fat Grafting", "text": "  Innovative Breast Reconstruction Through Fat Grafting Kaiser Permanente plastic surgeon uses minimally invasive surgery with natural materials from a patient\u2019s body. The result? Faster recovery and less scarring and muscle damage. October 17, 2017 After much research Joyce, a Kaiser Permanente member, opted for fat grafting for her breast reconstruction. \n\u201cI would do anything to avoid getting cancer \u2014 anything.\u201d \nThat\u2019s how Sarah, a Kaiser Permanente member, steadfastly explains her response to learning that she has a mutation in her BRCA2 gene \u2014 putting her at increased risk for breast and ovarian cancers. \nThe 42-year-old married mother of two from Vancouver, Washington, put a lot of thought, prayer and research over the past couple of years into her decision to have a preventive double mastectomy, followed by breast reconstruction using fat from her own body. \nOne of the few in the world \nSince 2015, Jennifer Murphy, MD, a board-certified plastic surgeon and chief of plastic surgery at Kaiser Permanente Northwest, has been one of the few plastic surgeons in the world to innovate the use of fat-grafting techniques for total breast reconstruction. Jennifer Murphy, MD \nBefore Sarah\u2019s double mastectomy, she and Dr. Murphy discussed treatment options, including fat grafting versus silicone implants. Fat grafting won out because of its use of natural material from her body, and the associated benefits from minimally invasive surgery \u2014 such as faster recovery, less scarring and no muscle damage. \u201cI chose the path that was right for my body,\u201d says Sarah. \n\u201cI knew that fat grafting for total breast reconstruction is performed by just a handful of plastic surgeons, so I was delighted to discover that Dr. Murphy offers this option.\u201d \nWhat is fat grafting? \nFat grafting involves removing fat from the thighs, abdomen and buttocks and using it to create additional volume in the breast. For total breast reconstruction, Dr. Murphy builds up the foundation of the breast a little bit at a time. Most patients require one to three surgeries over the course of a year or more. \nIn Sarah\u2019s case, Dr. Murphy worked closely with fellow surgeon Christopher Moran, MD, who performed Sarah\u2019s mastectomy. After removal of her breasts, Dr. Murphy implanted fat from Sarah\u2019s abdomen into the site. In addition, thanks to a procedure performed by Dr. Moran, Sarah\u2019s nipples are intact and have retained slight sensation. Patients who don\u2019t receive the nipple preservation step typically receive a referral to an outside tattoo artist who specializes in creating 3D-appearing nipples for plastic surgery patients. \n\u201cBoth surgeons and their teams did a fabulous job,\u201d says Sarah. \u201cDr. Murphy was amazing to work with. Her communication style is forthright, with no false expectations.\u201d \nSarah has two or three more fat transfers yet to go. She received confirmation that \u201cthings are looking good\u201d when a nurse who was helping her dress was \u201cstunned to find out that I had had a double mastectomy.\u201d \nSarah\u2019s elation is matched by other patients who have also had the procedure. \n\u201cAfter a lot of research, I chose fat grafting because it seemed like the best choice for me even though it was not a quick process,\u201d says Joyce, another Kaiser Permanente patient. \u201cI cannot begin to tell you how excited I was when I was all finished because not only do my breasts look fantastic, they also feel very natural.\u201d \nA passion for helping patients \nDr. Murphy says that total breast reconstruction helps women to feel normal after having had a mastectomy. She has a passion for helping patients erase the visual reminder of the trauma their bodies endured in response to a cancer diagnosis, or in Sarah\u2019s and Joyce\u2019s cases, a genetic likelihood of a cancer diagnosis. \u201cI find joy in helping them conquer their disease.\u201d \n\u201cGrateful\u201d is the word Sarah uses to describe her current state, adding, \u201cI am so lucky to be in a time and place to learn about the latest treatments \u2014 and to access them right here, in my own community, from Kaiser Permanente.\u201d \n>> Learn more about our commitment to cancer care .

And they were getting brighter, closer and bigger. \nAt Benjamin\u2019s urging, his wife Macy Huggins, RN, a Kaiser Permanente pediatric nurse, left their house an hour before it burned down and evacuated to a friend\u2019s home in Petaluma. Benjamin, meanwhile, continued to care for his critically ill patient until the man was safely placed into an ambulance and transferred to another hospital out of harm\u2019s way. \nIt was time to refocus their energy on the baby, who was already overdue by two days. \nHope is born \n\u201cThe next day it kind of hit us,\u201d Macy said. \u201cNow we have nothing, and we\u2019re bringing this baby into the world, and we had all this stuff that was going to be so perfect, and these ideas and perceptions about how it was going to be with her.\u201d \nWith the Santa Rosa Medical Center closed due to fires burning in the area, the couple searched for a new Kaiser Permanente hospital for Macy to deliver their baby. \nThey chose the Kaiser Permanente Roseville Medical Center\u2019s Women and Children\u2019s Center because the air quality in the Sacramento Valley was more favorable than in the Bay Area. \nAnd that\u2019s where the baby, aptly named Hope, was born on Saturday, Oct. 14, weighing a healthy 8 lbs., 4 oz. and measuring 21.5 inches long. \nWhat happened next was nothing short of amazing. \nA generous gift \nA couple of hours after Hope entered the world, another mother was giving birth a few rooms away. This mother had been certain her baby would be a girl \u2014 so the family had prepared an entire nursery for a daughter. \nBut the mom delivered a boy. \nThe mom laughed about her situation and asked two nurses, Carrie Jarvis, RN, and Stephanie Harriot, RN, if they had any idea what to do with so much girl clothing that their boy would never wear. \nThat\u2019s when Assistant Nurse Manager Elana Brennan, RN, made the connection between the moms. \nThe next day, the family down the hall donated its entire collection of baby-girl clothes and toys to the Santa Rosa family that had lost everything in the fire. \n\u201cIt was very touching and generous and overwhelming,\u201d Macy said, while sitting on the hospital bed with Benjamin and Hope a day after giving birth. \nBenjamin and Macy, who are saddened that co-workers also lost their homes and that dozens of people have died in several Northern California fires, don\u2019t yet know where in the Santa Rosa area they will live. \nFor now, they\u2019re staying with friends and dedicating their time to Hope. \n\u201cIn the face of this tragedy, we\u2019re now able to welcome this little baby into the world,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really all that matters to us now.\u201d Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephanie harriot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carrie jarvis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macy huggins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin huggins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elana brennan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hope", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa rosa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kaiser permanente santa rosa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intensive care unit of kaiser permanente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente roseville medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa rosa medical center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "petaluma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa rosa", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T06:05:22.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4dfc80d1b0a2a3954c0905e68047b8b4520c207f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUveGveQX.WTMIEB9fygdyN5uChiBrSF6Qyi2MCmB90JSZGuR3Q9xcga7fN1cqBVeSU40GngRozIVqUnYDjULbN7rAF_n.SrCP_lEa6f5AC2Jf3Nf40eMUt4tTlK6ABCjyBziq.j9soJR", "site_full": "share.kaiserpermanente.org", "site": "kaiserpermanente.org", "site_section": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/category/rss-feed/feed", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "rss-feed \u2013 Kaiser Permanente Share", "title": "Patients with Serious Mental Health Conditions Receive Preventive Care at Rates Similar to Those Without These Conditions", "title_full": "Patients with Serious Mental Health Conditions Receive Preventive Care at Rates Similar to Those Without These Conditions", "published": "2017-10-19T07:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenings-feature-548x336.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1935, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 111}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4dfc80d1b0a2a3954c0905e68047b8b4520c207f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUveGveQX.WTMIEB9fygdyN5uChiBrSF6Qyi2MCmB90JSZGuR3Q9xcga7fN1cqBVeSU40GngRozIVqUnYDjULbN7rAF_n.SrCP_lEa6f5AC2Jf3Nf40eMUt4tTlK6ABCjyBziq.j9soJR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karen Hershenson", "published": "2017-10-19T07:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Patients with Serious Mental Health Conditions Receive Preventive Care at Rates Similar to Those Without These Conditions", "text": "Read Disclaimer \nYour collection will not be saved on this site once your current session expires after an hour of inactivity.

News & Views Press Release Patients with Serious Mental Health Conditions Receive Preventive Care at Rates Similar to Those Without These Conditions October 18, 2017 Add to Collection \nPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 People with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder received preventive health screenings at rates similar to or higher than people without mental illnesses, according to a study of more than 800,000 patients published today in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. \nNearly 10 million people in the United States live with a serious mental health condition, and they have higher early death rates compared to those without these conditions. In fact, one study found that patients with schizophrenia were 3.5 times more likely to die early, compared to the general population. \nThe disparity is largely due to preventable causes such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and heart disease, and to modifiable risk factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking and medications that cause weight gain. \nResearchers hypothesized that people with mental illnesses might receive less preventive care than people without these illnesses. However, this study, which included patients within the Kaiser Permanente system and patients who get their care from safety-net clinics, found just the opposite. \nKaiser Permanente patients who were diagnosed with a mental health condition received between 80 and 81 percent of the recommended preventive care, while people with no diagnosis of a mental health condition received about 80 percent of the preventive care recommended for them. \nIn safety-net clinics, there was a larger difference between the two groups. Patients diagnosed with mental health conditions received between 62 and 70 percent of the preventive services recommended for them, while patients without a diagnosis of a mental health condition received about 60 percent of the recommended care. \n\u201cWe were pleased to learn that people with mental health conditions received as many or more preventive services as people without these conditions,\u201d said Bobbi Jo Yarborough PsyD, lead author and researcher with the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research. \nHowever, Yarborough added, the finding doesn\u2019t answer the question of why, according to national statistics, these people die earlier. \n\u201cIt may be that people with mental illnesses aren\u2019t getting the support and treatment they need to prevent chronic disease. For example, we know that the medications people take to manage serious mental illnesses can cause rapid weight gain, but there are few programs to help these people manage their weight while they are on the medications,\u201d said Yarborough. \nTo address this need, Yarborough and her colleagues developed a successful weight loss and diabetes risk reduction program , but she says few health systems implement these types of programs. \nFor the current study, researchers compared the proportion of recommended preventive screenings received among more than 100,000 adults who had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar or affective psychosis, or other mental health conditions such as anxiety or major depressive disorder, to the proportion of recommended screenings received among nearly 700,000 adults without a diagnosis of mental illness. \nStudy subjects were members of the Kaiser Permanente Northwest health system, or patients who received care in clinics that serve low-income individuals and those without health insurance. During 2012-2013, the researchers examined the medical records of these patients to find out if they were eligible for and had received 12 preventive services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. \nThe services included screening for obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, colorectal cancer, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, as well as the pneumococcal and flu vaccines. And for women, screening for breast and cervical cancer, and chlamydia and osteoporosis were also included. \nThe study was funded by a grant (R01 MH096795) from the National Institute of Mental Health. In addition to Yarborough, study authors include: Nancy A. Perrin, PhD, Scott P. Stumbo, MA, and Carla A. Green, PhD, MPH, of the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research; and John Muench, MD, MPH, of Oregon Health & Science University. \nAbout the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research The Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research, founded in 1964, is a nonprofit research institution dedicated to advancing knowledge to improve health.

She felt joy and a zest for life but also deep despair, almost at the same time. At times, Allen just didn\u2019t want to exist. \nYears later, after graduating college, Allen had panic attacks she said felt like a heart attack, and felt so depressed she sometimes couldn\u2019t get out of bed. \nBut things are different for her now. She found a combination of medication and therapy that worked for her and believes her experience can bring hope to others. Which is why when Kaiser Permanente put out a call, both inside and outside its organization, asking people to share their stories about depression and other mental health conditions, she volunteered right away. \nKaiser Permanente has partnered with StoryCorps, a national oral history project, to capture intimate conversations between two people who know each other well. In a short recording, Beth, a Kaiser Permanente graphic designer who lives in San Francisco, talks with her boyfriend, Shawn Smith. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people who feel depressed to know that there are other people out there who feel the same way,\u201d Allen said about why she participated. \u201cI\u2019d like to help people not be ashamed or embarrassed to talk about how they feel.\u201d \nThe partnership is part of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s public health awareness campaign called Find Your Words, which launched in 2016 and aims to break the silence and reduce stigma around depression and other mental health conditions. \nBeth and Shawn\u2019s conversation \u2014 along with mental health resources, a self-assessment tool and information on how to get help \u2014 are available on findyourwords.org . \nIn the coming months, more conversations will be added, including one in Spanish. Each recording eventually will be accompanied by an animation of the story. \nThis is the first time StoryCorps has devoted recordings solely to depression and other mental health issues. \n\u201cMental health is a big issue in our society and one that we\u2019ve touched upon in many of our recordings ever since we began 14 years ago,\u201d said Braden Lay-Michaels, chief external relations officer with StoryCorps. \u201cWe are hoping this partnership and this sharp focus on mental health will help people understand it and create empathy for those struggling with mental health conditions.\u201d \nThe partnership, Lay-Michaels added, aligns well with the StorpCorps\u2019 mission, which is to preserve and share experiences and stories to build connections between people and create a more just and compassionate world. \nDon Mordecai, MD, the Kaiser Permanente national leader on mental health and wellness, is hoping these recordings will help fight the stigma that prevents many people with depression from getting help. \n\u201cStigma breeds silence and prevents people from getting support. We want to end the silence,\u201d Dr. Mordecai said. \u201cOur hope is that hearing these stories of people who have successfully managed their mental health issues will help people feel encouraged to talk to a friend or loved one and seek help.\u201d \nAllen is no longer suffering. She\u2019s with Shawn, who accepts her in a way no boyfriend has. She finds joys in little things and is grateful for what she has. \n\u201cIt\u2019s calming to know you are not alone. You are not alone,\u201d Beth said at the end of her story. \u201cAnd just remember that.\u201d Related News", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "beth alle", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "beth allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shawn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shawn smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "braden lay-michaels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lay-michaels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don mordecai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mordecai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kaiser permanente sparks conversations on mental health through storycorps partnership   kaiser permanente sparks conversations on mental health through storycorps", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "storycorps", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T01:25:50.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f65ffa3d3b0ea0108ad367e87f2aa940f2ba023c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUjr6ZOhsO_5zSPOop5WCORp3HM_YrJ7znyeQ0831yz_qYkJW1s6zLYv1SMFrc3V0GI3YnO_q0Lbe0iQYcXXvNKo-", "site_full": "share.kaiserpermanente.org", "site": "kaiserpermanente.org", "site_section": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/category/health-research/feed", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "Health Research \u2013 Kaiser Permanente Share", "title": "Kaiser Permanente Study Finds a More Effective Way to Test for HPV", "title_full": "Kaiser Permanente Study Finds a More Effective Way to Test for HPV", "published": "2017-10-20T20:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/tewari_devansu-hpv-study.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1935, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f65ffa3d3b0ea0108ad367e87f2aa940f2ba023c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUjr6ZOhsO_5zSPOop5WCORp3HM_YrJ7znyeQ0831yz_qYkJW1s6zLYv1SMFrc3V0GI3YnO_q0Lbe0iQYcXXvNKo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karen Hershenson", "published": "2017-10-20T20:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kaiser Permanente Study Finds a More Effective Way to Test for HPV", "text": "  Kaiser Permanente Study Finds a More Effective Way to Test for HPV October 20,   \nA study of more than 850 women demonstrated it is effective to conduct a human papillomavirus test in the same preservative fluid as a Pap test. This has the potential to increase efficiency and decrease waste. The findings were published online Oct. 13, 2017 in the Journal of Clinical Pathology. Devansu Tewari, MD \nAs a result of the findings, organizations such as Kaiser Permanente can consider transitioning to single collection of a Pap test and HPV test, rather than sending two different samples to the lab, said lead author, Devansu Tewari, MD, MBA, a gynecologic oncologist at Kaiser Permanente in Orange County, California. \nHPV infections are the most common sexually transmitted infections in the United States and are the main cause of cervical cancer in women. Both the Pap and HPV test are used to screen for cervical cancer. This research is a step toward making testing for HPV infections more simple and straightforward. \n\u201cThe opportunity to move toward primary HPV screening would not have existed with the method we currently use,\u201d Dr. Tewari said. \u201cAs future studies build upon this one, that potential of primary HPV screening is within reach. It is one of many ways we are working to enhance cervical cancer screening.\u201d \n\u2018Always innovating\u2019 \nThis research fills an unmet need for the medical community, said Michael Kanter, MD , executive vice president and chief quality officer for The Permanente Federation, the national umbrella organization for the more than 21,000 physicians who provide care to Kaiser Permanente\u2019s more than 11.8 million members. \n\u201cThis research shows we are always innovating and finding ways to improve care delivery for our members, which highlights our commitment to shaping   care,\u201d Dr. Kanter said. \nLast year, research at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California led to FDA approval of the first HPV test that can be used with cervical cells obtained for a Pap test and collected in a specific preservative fluid. The study published online was the basis of that FDA approval. \nBefore FDA approval in 2016, a different HPV test had to be collected into an FDA-approved medium, leading to the need for two collection samples: one for HPV and one for Pap. Like a Pap test, an HPV test is done on a sample of cells collected from the cervix. \nIdentifying women at highest risk \nIn addition to allowing for a single collection, other findings in this study showed that the test gives clinicians the opportunity to identify whether the HPV virus type is one of the most carcinogenic. The HPV genotypes 16 and 18 cause approximately 70 percent of cervical cancers worldwide. \n\u201cThis test not only allows health care providers to identify more women at highest risk for developing cervical cancer and to intervene earlier, but knowing the specific HPV type empowers providers to be more effective and accurate in their education and counseling of patients. This could lead to greater patient understanding as well as improved compliance with surveillance and treatment,\u201d said Christina Hong, MD, a study co-author and assistant chief of service of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department at Kaiser Permanente Orange County. \nThe study also found that there was a reliable performance of the test in a highly HPV-vaccinated population. \n\u201cThe next step will include pilot studies to further expand on the recent study, while continuing to enhance our high-quality cervical cancer screening program,\u201d Dr. Tewari said. \n\u201cThis is an example of how the power of our integrated delivery model of care can meet national needs in health care while optimizing the health of our own patients,\u201d Dr. Tewari said. \u201cKaiser Permanente\u2019s diverse member base and electronic health records were key to this work, which has the power to transform practices and health care organizations approach to screening.\u201d \nCo-authors in the study were: Susan Novak-Weekley, PhD, Southern California   Regional Reference Laboratories, North Hollywood; and Shagufta Aslam, PhD, and Catherine M.

Kaiser Permanente facilities throughout the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Region, in partnership with local law enforcement agencies, are encouraging community members to participate in the 14th \u201c National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day \u201d on Saturday, Oct. 28, 2017, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The service is free, easy and anonymous. \n\u201cEvents like this offer health care providers and law enforcement an opportunity to raise awareness about the benefits of properly storing and disposing of prescription medication,\u201d said Alan Kiyohara, vice president, Pharmacy Operations and Services for Kaiser Permanente Southern California. \u201cOur ultimate goal is to assure high-quality care by providing appropriate medications and ensuring patient safety, and this effort is right in keeping with that goal.\u201d \nPrescription drug take-back programs address vital public safety and public health issues while providing local residents with a convenient way to safely dispose of expired, unwanted, or unused medicines. Medicines that languish in home cabinets are highly susceptible to diversion, misuse and abuse \nAt the last Drug Take-Back event in April, Kaiser Permanente facilities in Southern California collected more than 7,000 pounds of unwanted medications. Properly disposing prescription drugs reduces the risk of abuse, accidental poisonings and environmental damage. \nRates of prescription drug abuse in the U.S. are alarmingly high, as are the number of accidental poisonings and overdoses due to these drugs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, opioids (including prescription opioids and heroin) killed more than 33,000 people in 2015 alone. Studies show that a majority of abused prescription drugs are obtained from family and friends, often from home medicine cabinets. \nPeople unable to participate on Oct. 28 can properly dispose of unwanted medications at drug disposal kiosks in Kaiser Permanente facilities throughout Southern California. Kiosks are available at Kaiser Permanent locations for public use during regular service hours. A listing of additional kiosks available for public use can found on the Drug Enforcement Administration website . \nAbout Kaiser Permanente Kaiser Permanente is committed to helping shape   care.

But what if you could fracture a bone just by bumping into something, rolling over in bed, or even sneezing? For people born with osteogenesis imperfecta, also known as \u201cbrittle bone disease,\u201d fragile bones are just part of life. \nOI is a rare genetic disorder that affects an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 people in the United States. How severely someone is affected can vary greatly, ranging from a few broken bones or fractures, to several hundred over their lifetime. \nJessica Minor, a program coordinator working in Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Mid-Atlantic States Region, was diagnosed with OI at 9 months. As the name suggests, people with OI have fragile skeletons, but for Jessica, the fragility stops there. She\u2019s confident, compassionate and doesn\u2019t let her disability define or limit her. Outside of work, she loves cooking, yoga, travel and spending time with her husband, family and friends. She embodies \u201cUnbreakable Spirit,\u201d the official slogan of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation . \nThis is her story \nI have one of the least severe types of OI so I\u2019ve had relatively few fractures and breaks, which is when the bone breaks all the way through, compared to others with OI who have had hundreds. Like most people with the disorder, I have metal rods in my leg bones to make them straighter and stronger, and for most of my life, I\u2019ve relied on a walker or a wheelchair to get around. \nI don\u2019t remember my parents ever sitting me down to talk about living with OI, what that meant for my future, what could happen, or what I could or couldn\u2019t do. As a family, we just dealt with my experiences as they happened. \nI do remember that my parents were always advocating for me. This was incredibly important because with a disorder like OI, you\u2019re combating strong assumptions and stereotypes about your limitations and your abilities. My parents taught me to speak up for myself at an early age. I was taught to ask for what I needed to be successful, and to make sure people understood that I knew what was best for me and what I was capable of, even at a very young age. Jessica Minor with her sister, Sally Finkel, in Greece. \nCreating awareness a critical step forward \nIn elementary and middle school, I would get up in front of my class at the beginning of every year and explain to them about my disability. In high school, this seemed like the wrong approach, so I started educating teachers and friends individually. This is great and has been very successful, but I know that educating people about OI is a lifelong project. \nBecause it\u2019s so rare, most people who hear \u201cbrittle bone disease\u201d immediately assume that you can\u2019t do anything without hurting yourself. The reality is that you can live a very normal life with OI and I want to emphasize that people with OI are their own best judges. Even if you think they are taking risks or doing things that are dangerous for them, you have to let them live their lives. That is the most critical part of my awareness campaign. \nHowever, the aspect of OI that people don\u2019t realize is that it\u2019s a collagen disorder and has a much broader effect on the body than just bones. In fact, as you age with OI, you usually have fewer fractures and broken bones \u2014 instead other issues surface, such as respiratory and joint problems. \nBuilding a career at Kaiser Permanente \nThroughout elementary, middle and high school, I always had amazing and supportive teachers and every accommodation I needed to be successful. When I went away to college, I was lucky to live in a small community where people quickly learned about my disability. Not only did I receive great support from my professors and the university overall, but the university police were kind enough to salt the walkway near my building so I could get to and from class in my wheelchair. \nWhen I moved to Washington, D.C., for my first job at the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, I was fortunate to connect with wonderful mentors who helped me navigate the challenges of living in the big city and find internships that helped build the foundation for my future career. \nI had a similar situation with Kaiser Permanente. I started as a student fellow with the Mid-Atlantic States\u2019 Community Benefit organization, supporting the Community Health Needs Assessment, and loved the work. After completing the fellowship and then working for another company for a year, my team at Kaiser Permanente hired me full-time as a Community Benefit program coordinator. And   been wonderful in meeting my accommodation needs \u2014 especially my manager, who reached out to me before I even started to determine my needs, and Marc Wilkerson, my disability case manager, who was incredibly professional and supportive. \nEmbracing the benefits of yoga \nGrowing up with a disability was challenging, especially one that people didn\u2019t understand, but my disability helped me find my path. \u2026 Overcoming these challenges, and others, helped me gain the confidence to attend college in Cincinnati and to move halfway across the country to Washington, D.C., a city where I didn\u2019t know anyone. And it has given me the confidence to pursue so many things that I\u2019ve achieved in life. \nWhen I was younger, I participated in multiple clinical trials involving pills and IVs over a period of years, with minimal results. I can\u2019t say that my bones are stronger now than when I was young, but I definitely have fewer breaks and fractures. I attribute this partially to better balance, paying more attention and increasing my core strength through yoga.

Patients were transferred to other Kaiser Permanente facilities and community hospitals in the area. The entire evacuation took about three hours. \n\u201cOur main focus that morning was to do everything that we could to ensure that our patients were evacuated safely and transferred to the appropriate level of care where they could continue to be treated and heal,\u201d said Josh Weil, MD, assistant physician-in-chief for Kaiser Permanente Santa Rosa. \nWhile the medical center was not damaged by the fire, due to the fire\u2019s proximity to the building the hospital has undergone extensive cleaning, restocking and evaluation prior to reopening. \n\u201cOur commitment to the health and safety of our patients and staff is our highest priority,\u201d explained Judy Coffey, RN, senior vice president and area manager, Kaiser Permanente Marin-Sonoma. \u201cWe are grateful to our wonderful physicians, nurses and staff \u2014 over 200 of whom lost their homes in this disaster \u2014 for their ongoing commitment and dedication, and are pleased to reopen our doors to the community.\u201d \nKaiser Permanente medical offices at 401 Bicentennial Way reopened on Monday, Oct.16.

This is especially true at Kaiser Permanente, because in the organization\u2019s integrated care model, pharmacists work closely with physicians, nurses and other care providers to optimize the effectiveness of medications and promote the total health of patients and members. \nKaiser Permanente members receive care from approximately 5,000 pharmacists nationwide serving in a variety of settings, including hospitals, outpatient pharmacies, clinics, infusion centers, call centers, central prescription filling facilities \u2014 even through virtual visits. \nFrom tracking medication adherence for patients with chronic conditions to making sure that patients discharged from the hospital are transitioned with the right medication plan, pharmacists are often the voice and face of Kaiser Permanente. \nWith Kaiser Permanente\u2019s electronic health record and other networked technologies, pharmacists and other care providers have access to a patient\u2019s entire health history, prescription lists, allergies and diagnosed conditions, all of which are used to maximize opportunities to ensure that patients are taking the right medication, at the right time, and at the right dose. \nPharmacists leverage technology to monitor for problematic medication interactions and dosing that appears to be outside of recommended ranges. They also lead a variety of programs designed to improve medication safety, from identifying drugs that are high risk for the elderly to ensuring the safe and appropriate use of opioids. \n\u201cWith the increasing complexity of many new drug therapies, coordination of care is more important than ever,\u201d said Amy Gutierrez, vice president and chief pharmacy officer, Kaiser Permanente. \u201cThe more patients interact with their pharmacists and the more pharmacists are connected with other care providers in an integrated system, the more medication effectiveness, quality and safety are enhanced.\u201d \nAdvancing the profession \n  recognized as a national pharmacy leader. Earlier this year \u2014 for the seventh year in a row \u2014 the organization earned the Pharmacy Quality Alliance\u2019s Excellence in Quality Award for high achievement in medication safety and appropriate use. \nPharmacists at Kaiser Permanente conduct ground-breaking research on new drug therapies and treatment innovations, contributing to hundreds of published studies each year that advance patient care as well as the pharmacy profession as a whole. \nKaiser Permanente also contributes to the pharmacy profession with its Pharmacy Residency Programs, which provide new pharmacy graduates invaluable experience in a variety of care settings. Many of these new pharmacists choose to begin their careers with Kaiser Permanente because they experience first-hand the ability to provide total health support to patients in an integrated system. \nLearn more about American Pharmacists Month and the evolving role of pharmacists.

Kaiser Permanente member Shelly Gonzalez, left, with nurse Karen Shampine, who noticed her tumor on Facebook. \nAs a professional health and wellness coach, Shelly Gonzales\u2019 clients, friends, family and even strangers look to her Facebook page for inspiration to help them eat right and stay active. One post dramatically changed her life \u2014 and potentially others. \nIn January, while going through a divorce, Shelly created a video about how to handle life\u2019s twists and turns. One viewer, whom Shelly had not met, messaged her and said, \u201cI hope this doesn\u2019t sound too forward. I am a nurse and I was watching your video and noticed a huge bulge in your neck. I wonder if you have had your thyroid checked.\u201d \nShelly was angry, disbelieving and scared. After all, she was healthy. \nAfter examination by her primary care physician and specialists, and an ultrasound test, the dreaded \u201cC\u201d word \u2014 cancer \u2014 entered her vocabulary for the first time. Soon after, her thyroid was surgically removed at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Westside Medical Center in Oregon. \nA stranger and a guardian angel \nShelly considers the stranger her guardian angel and thanks her for being bold enough to speak out. She\u2019s also grateful for her Kaiser Permanente care team, which provided all the expertise, skill and compassion to achieve a good outcome. \n\u201cEveryone was wonderful,\u201d she says. \u201cThe cancer specialists recognized the urgency in my case and did everything possible to get me into surgery as soon as possible. Fortunately, I didn\u2019t need chemotherapy or radiation.\u201d \nShelly also says that during conversations with her providers, \u201cThey focused on me, not on the clock, nor on their next patient. They made sure all my questions were answered.\u201d \nA team behind every treatment \nPatients such as Shelly who have thyroid cancer receive care from Sunshine Dwojak, MD, otolaryngologist, a member of Kaiser Permanente Northwest\u2019s Head and Neck Surgery department. Dr. Dwojak also leads a regional Head and Neck Cancer Task Force, which ensures best practices for patient care. \nPatients with head and neck cancer receive care from a team consisting of medical, radiation, and surgical oncologists, anesthesiologists, speech therapists, registered nurses, nurse navigators, physician assistants, dentists, physical therapists and other professionals. \nThis team cares for patients who have diseases and conditions of the ear, nose and throat. One cancer in particular, oropharyngeal cancer, caused by HPV (human papillomavirus), is on the rise across the US. Despite the increase, the prognosis in general remains very good, according to Dr. Dwojak. \u201cPatients benefit from our very strong system of care. For example, we have a new best-practices staging system that allows patients to get the treatments they need, without harmful overtreatment.\u201d \nPatients also benefit from robotic surgery to remove cancerous tissue. This advanced surgical technique means shorter hospitalization, less pain and discomfort, and faster recovery. \nFocus on recovery and learning \n\u201cWe know that a cancer diagnosis can cause great fear and anxiety for patients and family members,\u201d says Dr. Dwojak. \u201cWe want patients to know that   equipped to treat complex, advanced cancers with leading technology and techniques delivered by highly trained clinicians.\u201d \nAs for Shelly, the woman whose thyroid cancer was diagnosed by a stranger, she\u2019s optimistic that her suffering is behind her. She leads a joyful life and uses her Facebook platform to inspire others to achieve health and wellness, and overcome life\u2019s challenges. \n\u201cI\u2019m a cancer survivor and I have a lot to live for,\u201d she says.

The flu vaccination clinics will be held at 112 schools across four counties \u2013 Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and San Diego \u2013 through mid-December. Internal risk mapping, a method used to identify below-average flu vaccination rates in Kaiser Permanente membership, enabled Kaiser Permanente to target the specific geographic locations. \n\u201cSchool-based vaccination clinics promote community immunity by helping to prevent influenza among children where outbreaks often start,\u201d said Margaret Khoury, MD , pediatric infectious disease specialist and the regional lead of the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Flu Vaccination Program. \u201cThis helps close health inequity gaps in our communities, as well as decrease influenza-related illness that causes students to miss school.\u201d \nThe campus clinics also make it more convenient for parents who do not need to take time off work to get the shots. \nInfluenza is the leading cause of illness in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. School-age children have the highest annual flu rates \u2013 as high as 42 percent, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases. \nMore than 8,500 students are expected to receive the flu vaccination this year through the Teach Flu a Lesson program. Nursing students from 16 nursing programs affiliated with Kaiser Permanente will administer the vaccines while gaining community health experience as part of their community health rotations. \nParticipating school districts by county include the following: Los Angeles County: Baldwin Park and El Rancho. Orange County: Anaheim, Buena Park, Santa Ana, and Savana. San Bernardino County: Yucaipa.

News & Views Your Questions About Breast Cancer Screening Answered October 27, 2017 Add to Collection \nConfused about breast cancer screening and mammograms? You are not alone, says Susan Kutner, MD , general surgeon and chair of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Northern California Breast Care Task Force. As new research emerges, mammography guidelines shift. Still, Dr. Kutner stresses that mammography is the best screening tool for breast cancer right now. \n\u201cThe purpose of a mammogram is to detect cancer early. If we detect cancer in its earliest stage and treat it immediately, side effects are less intense and survival rates are higher,\u201d she says. \nDr. Kutner recently shared the top questions she receives from patients, as well as the information and advice she frequently provides. \nWhen should women start getting mammograms and how often should they get them? \nOverall, it is important to look at each individual woman\u2019s risk. What we\u2019re learning is that we can\u2019t just say \u201ca mammogram every year is good for everyone\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s too much for some. We rigorously review all evidence every two years. It\u2019s important to have a conversation with your primary care provider about your risk factors, which include previous biopsy results, previous cancers, your personal history and your family history. You should only get a mammogram if it is going to be beneficial to you and your health. Susan Kutner, MD \nThere is a lot of controversy surrounding women who fall into the 40-50 age group. Our evidence has shown that, as a group, not all women need to start getting mammograms at age 40. Talk to your primary care provider about the benefits and risks, specific to you. In the 50-74 age group, we see the greatest incidence of breast cancer and the greatest benefit of mammography. Typically, women in this age group have a mammogram every one-two years. For women over the age of 75, the risk of developing breast cancer continues, but they may be more at risk of developing other diseases that get in the way of early cancer detection. \nAre mammograms safe? \nMammography is an X-ray. There is a very low level of radiation exposure during each mammogram. However, X-ray exposure is a cumulative process over a lifetime. Therefore, each mammogram you do get should serve a purpose to you and your health. \nIn addition to screenings, how can women be proactive about decreasing their risk of developing breast cancer? \nEven before age 40, women should learn about and know their individual risks of developing breast cancer, and discuss with their primary care physician to tailor a screening plan specific to them. Women who have an immediate family history (mothers, sisters and aunts) of breast and ovarian cancer, especially below the age of 40, should be offered an evaluation by a genetic counselor to see if they need to start screening at an earlier age. The next step in being proactive involves making healthy lifestyle choices. These include getting regular exercise (30 minutes of aerobic exercise a day, five times a week), managing weight, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, and maintaining a healthy diet as much as possible. \nWhat does the future of breast cancer screenings look like? \nIt\u2019s possible that breast cancer screenings in the future will not be imaging tests. Since breast tissue is so variable, we may need to look at other ways to screen for breast cancer that have not been fully addressed before, such as a blood test for cancer markers. Overall, in the next phase of intervention and research, we will continue to improve \u2014 we\u2019ve already gone from analog images to digital, and 3D is now emerging. It takes 10-20 years to see what works and to test equipment, and we want the next step to be valuable. \nWe need to be careful about what we\u2019re doing, continue to reevaluate, and ultimately ask, \u201chow can we detect cancer early?\u201d We don\u2019t want to over-diagnose or over-treat cancers. We are routinely looking at research to answer, \u201cwhat are the recommendations?\u201d and \u201chow do screenings impact women at different ages?\u201d \nFor example, some ask why self-exams have gone out of favor and why we don\u2019t stress that like we used to. With self-exams, it is difficult to detect cancer early because cancer usually starts a little deeper in the breast, which makes it harder to feel it. This doesn\u2019t mean we should ignore our bodies and subtle signs or that self-exams don\u2019t have value. \nBreast cancer dramatically affects women and their families. We need to continue to get better at treating it. We also need to keep in mind that whatever we do to improve breast cancer risk and decrease the likelihood of dying from it, we must invest in a woman\u2019s ability to get the information she needs to make a personal plan for her care.
