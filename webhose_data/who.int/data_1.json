Urgent action is needed to protect communities, prevent transmission and control outbreaks. \nThe GTFCC\u2019s new plan, Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030 , recognizes that cholera spreads in endemic \u201chotspots\u201d where predictable outbreaks of the disease occur year after year. \nThe Global Roadmap aims to align resources, share best practice and strengthen partnerships between affected countries, donors and international agencies. It underscores the need for a coordinated approach to cholera control with country-level planning for early detection and response to outbreaks. By implementing the Roadmap, up to 20 affected countries could eliminate cholera by 2030. \n\"WHO is proud to be part of this new joint initiative to stop deaths from cholera. The disease takes its greatest toll on the poor and the vulnerable \u2013 this is quite unacceptable. This roadmap is the best way we have to bring this to an end,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. \n\"Every death from cholera is preventable with the tools available today, including use of the Oral Cholera Vaccine and improved access to basic safe water, sanitation and hygiene as set out in the Roadmap,\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus. \u201cThis is a disease of inequity that affects the poorest and most vulnerable. It is unacceptable that nearly two decades into the 21st century, cholera continues to destroy livelihoods and cripple economies. We must act together. And we must act now.\u201d \nAdvances in the provision of water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) services have made Europe and North America cholera-free for several decades. Today, although access to WASH is recognized as a basic human right by the United Nations, over 2 billion people worldwide still lack access to safe water and are potentially at risk of cholera. Weak health systems and low early detection capacity further contribute to the rapid spread of outbreaks. \nCholera disproportionally impacts communities already burdened by conflict, lack of infrastructure, poor health systems, and malnutrition. Protecting these communities before cholera strikes is significantly more cost-effective than continually responding to outbreaks. \nThe introduction of the oral cholera vaccine has been a game-changer in the battle to control cholera, bridging the gap between emergency response and longer-term control. Two WHO-approved oral cholera vaccines are now available and individuals can be fully vaccinated for just US$6 per person, protecting them from the disease for up to three years. \nThe Global Roadmap provides an effective mechanism to synchronize the efforts of countries, donors, and technical partners. It underscores the need for a multi-sectoral approach to cholera control with country-level planning for early detection and response to outbreaks. \nBy strengthening WASH in endemic \"hotspots\", cholera outbreaks can be prevented. By detecting cholera outbreaks early, and responding immediately, large-scale uncontrolled outbreaks like the one observed in Yemen can be avoided \u2013 even in crisis situations. Note to editors \nThe Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) is a network of more than 50 organizations bringing together partners involved in the fight against cholera across all sectors and providing a strong framework to support countries in intensifying efforts to control cholera. \nThe Launch of the Global Roadmap is supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Fondation M\u00e9rieux and WaterAid.   \nTel: +41 22 791 2272 Mobile: +41 79 506 5217 E-mail:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tedros adhanom ghebreyesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tarik jasarevic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tedros adhanom gebreyesus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "melinda gates foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gtfcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global roadmap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wateraid", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "roadmap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:14:04.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4fd60214d4ef93805d726cc5ecd1628cd5ee8345", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5Ee7niqTlXMhLICzWwUwQ4X4uwRvRrgAnVCOS7HM2mM7_wLZN0p8iyMz", "site_full": "www.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://who.int/feeds/entity/mediacentre/news/en/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "WHO news", "title": "New WHO leadership team announced", "title_full": "New WHO leadership team announced", "published": "2017-10-03T15:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.who.int/about/Logo-WHO.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4fd60214d4ef93805d726cc5ecd1628cd5ee8345", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5Ee7niqTlXMhLICzWwUwQ4X4uwRvRrgAnVCOS7HM2mM7_wLZN0p8iyMz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "New WHO leadership team announced", "text": "New WHO leadership team announced \nWHO statement 3 October 2017 \nThis morning, WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced his senior leadership team. \nThe new team includes former ministers of health, some of the world\u2019s leading physicians, scientists and researchers, and programmatic experts in universal health coverage, health emergencies, communicable and noncommunicable diseases, climate and environmental health, and women\u2019s, adolescents\u2019 and children\u2019s health.

Hauspurg \nRoutine immunization coverage has declined in the WHO European Region as a whole over the past 5 years, creating increased risk of new outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. National immunization programmes across the Region are eager to reverse this trend. However, to develop successful interventions they must first understand the underlying determinants of their populations\u2019 vaccination behaviours \u2013 what drives people to vaccinate, and what may pose a barrier. \nTo help countries identify and address the causes of low vaccine uptake, WHO/Europe and the University of Erfurt, Germany, teamed up to offer a Behavioural Insights Summer School (BISS). The first-ever BISS took place at the University of Erfurt on 18\u201322 September 2017. \nThrough a varied programme that included academic-level plenary presentations and group exercises, the BISS demonstrated how immunization programmes can listen to communities and obtain behavioural insights in order to tailor their services and plan interventions to increase vaccine uptake. \nThe week-long course gathered representatives of Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, Finland, France, the Republic of Moldova, Serbia and Sweden, and PhD students in the fields of psychology, communication science and behavioural economics. Together they worked to build the capacities of countries and academia to analyse and understand the barriers and drivers to vaccination among key target groups, as well as how to respond to them. \nThe BISS placed special emphasis on applying qualitative research methods and monitoring and evaluating interventions. Participants\u2019 learning process was evaluated based on 5 learning objectives. Follow-up assessments to determine whether their new knowledge has been retained and used in practice will continue for the coming year. TIP approach \nThe BISS also served as an introduction to WHO\u2019s tailoring immunization programmes (TIP) approach. A group assignment on a fictitious case led participants through each step of the TIP process. To further the global use and adaptation of the TIP approach, the BISS included participants from Argentina, the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the WHO Country Office in Burkina Faso and WHO headquarters. Innovative training \nThe BISS is the first of its kind in the immunization field. It not only facilitates the sharing of experiences and ideas across cultural contexts and disciplines, but also enables practice\u2013theory exchange and peer-to-peer learning among professionals and academics from different technical fields. \nOne participant noted that the course was \u201cexcellent and well-organized ... There was something useful for all participants, regardless of their background and experience.\u201d \nBased on the initial feedback from participants, the BISS will run annually to build capacity and inspire and initiate discussions on behavioural insights and behaviour-change projects among Member States, academia and professionals in the field.

The tool, which can be used online or on paper, consists of 14 simple questions, which range from the topics of feeling safe to traffic and parking to social contact. \nThe user rates their answers on a scale of 1 to 7 using a specially prepared diagram. These answers then offer a detailed picture of whether a place is fulfilling the needs of those who use it and supporting their health and well-being. \nThe workshop and masterclass was kicked off by Shona Robison, Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport in the Scottish Government, who said, \u201cNew communities have to provide economic and social opportunities for their residents \u2013 and they have to meet our aspirations for greener lifestyles. In any new development the aim should be to address these many important issues at the same time\u201d. Simple but effective \nThe participants experienced the Place Standard tool first-hand when they went out and conducted their own assessments, which were analysed the following day. Belfast City councillor Geraldine McAteer, who is also Chief Executive of the West Belfast Partnership Board, echoed the views of many participants when she commented, \u201cActually using the tool for ourselves really brought home how simple but effective it is.

Local authorities in Thailand organise physical activity programmes to promote health and beat avoidable noncommunicable diseases Angthong Municipality \nIn 2011, when she was 64, Umpun, from Thailand\u2019s northern Angthong Municipality, was diagnosed with high levels of cholesterol and the dietary fat triglyceride. This raised the threat of suffering from a cardiovascular disease, Thailand\u2019s \u2013 and the world\u2019s \u2013 leading cause of death, including of people aged under 70. \n\u201cMy doctor advised me to start physical activity and change my diet, and after I started exercising I later found that my triglycerides and cholesterol level had decreased,\u201d says Umpun, now 70 and a village health volunteer. \u201cI enjoyed very much this physical activity and I felt much stronger and healthier so I continue with it.\u201d \nSo much so she joined a government-led drive to help fellow Thais increase levels of physical activity to curb the threat of heart and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which combined are responsible for 7 in 10 deaths in Thailand. Government strategies to increase physical activity \nNew cycle paths have been installed around the country. Popular media, from SMS and social media campaigns, to promotions in cinemas and rock concerts, are calling for an increase in physical activity, like 10 kilometre runs in the capital, Bangkok, and 20 other locations around the country. Public parks are becoming beacons for health, with tai chi, yoga, dancing and other healthy programmes the norm. Thailand is promoting cycling to help address noncommunicable diseases Angthong Municipality \nGlobally, cardiovascular diseases, like stroke and heart attacks, killed an estimated 17.7 million people annually, and almost half of the worldwide death toll associated with NCDs. The other main NCDs are cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes. \nEach shares four common, modifiable risk factors \u2013 physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, tobacco and harmful use of alcohol. Combined, they are responsible for 40 million annual deaths, including 15 million people aged between 30 and 70. \nEach shares four common, modifiable risk factors \u2013 physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, tobacco and harmful use of alcohol.

WHO is developing a new global action plan to promote physical activity, a key focus being to promote better environments and more opportunities for people of all ages and abilities to be more physically active. \nWHO\u2019s new plan will support a target, approved by governments, to cut the global prevalence of insufficient physical activity by 10% by 2025. This is one step in a broader push to reduce premature NCD deaths by one-third by 2030 in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. \nWHO recommends adults aged 18 and over do at least 75 minutes of vigorous - or 150 minutes of moderate intensity - physical activity per week. Children and adolescents aged 5-17 years should do at least 60 minutes of daily moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity. \nThailand\u2019s physical activity movement has been gaining momentum, championed by the country\u2019s prime minister, Gen. Prayuth Chan-o-cha, who launched a weekly programme, each Wednesday, for civil servants to take one hour to be physically active at work. In 2016, Thailand hosted the 6th congress of the International Society for Physical Activity and Public Health. \nDr Fiona Bull, who leads WHO\u2019s unit on physical activity and healthy diets, says Thailand is showing regional leadership by developing a national physical activity action plan and leading similar initiatives to prompt countries to scale up action. \n\u201cLike other countries in the region, and around the world, rapid changes in Thailand in how people travel, work and play are leading to less active lifestyles,\u201d says Dr Bull. \u201cThailand is focusing on changing how we think about physical activity and how we can, and should, make it part of our everyday lives.\u201d \nAngthong Municipality is doing just that. Programmes for various age groups, including 0-5, 6-17 and 18-59, and over 60 year-olds are helping thousands be more physically active. Community and religious leaders are promoting these activities among local communities. \nRungtiwa Makim, director of Angthong Municipality\u2019s division of public health and environment, says left untreated, the NCD challenge will escalate and affect families and communities, adding to higher national expenditure on healthcare along with economic, social and mental problems for patients and their caretakers. \n\u201cIn Angthong, it has been easy for people to increase physical activity in their daily routines,\u201d says Ms Makim. \u201cBy walking or cycling to work, or buying groceries and running errands, it makes a big difference to your health.\u201d Physical activity", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T14:04:55.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "182c067be9f57335ba81ecad4dadc239797b25f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPXRuRLHsTPYe33bT54hew.58ULZ.cPpf5aysxFi0_oNCPLFZwiZaCkWA--", "site_full": "www.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://www.who.int/feeds/entity/mediacentre/news/en/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "WHO news", "title": "WHO provides 1.2 million antibiotics to fight plague in Madagascar", "title_full": "WHO provides 1.2 million antibiotics to fight plague in Madagascar", "published": "2017-10-06T16:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.who.int/entity/hac/crises/mdg/sitreps/madagascar-plague2-2017.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1692, "comments": 0, "shares": 1692}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 45}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "182c067be9f57335ba81ecad4dadc239797b25f3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPXRuRLHsTPYe33bT54hew.58ULZ.cPpf5aysxFi0_oNCPLFZwiZaCkWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T16:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "WHO provides 1.2 million antibiotics to fight plague in Madagascar", "text": "WHO provides 1.2 million antibiotics to fight plague in Madagascar \nNews release \n6 October 2017 | ANTANANARIVO, MADAGASCAR - WHO has delivered nearly 1.2 million doses of antibiotics and released US$1.5 million dollars in emergency funds to fight plague in Madagascar. \n\"Plague is curable if detected in time.

It is a real pleasure to be with you today. \nI congratulate the government of Pakistan for the hard work you have put in over many months to develop this National Hepatitis Strategic Framework. \nWithout vision, progress is impossible. Without goals, we go nowhere. \nI am encouraged, therefore, by the bold vision of this framework and the goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat by 2030. \nThe numbers are sobering. Hepatitis kills more than 1.3 million people globally each year, and more than half of those deaths are in south and east Asia. \nHere in Pakistan, more than 8 million people are living with hepatitis C \u2013 more than 10% of the world\u2019s total -- and 4 million with hepatitis B. \nPakistan is one of the few countries in the world where transmission is still ongoing on a large scale. \nUrgent action is required. \nBut there are encouraging signs that you are on the right track. \nOnce-unaffordable medicines are now within reach, thanks to your success in reducing prices through local manufacturing. \nAs a result, the number of people receiving treatment for hepatitis C has more than doubled. \nMy message to you is: don't stop. \nTesting and treatment must continue to be expanded to everyone who needs it. \nBut it is futile to attempt to mop up a flood. We must turn off the tap by taking action to prevent infections. \nThat means ensuring that health care is safe, with a particular focus on infection control, blood safety and injection safety, including the safe disposal of needles and syringes. \nNo one should be infected when seeking care, and no health worker should be infected while delivering care. \nRoutine vaccination must be strengthened, including at birth. \nAnd we must scale up harm reduction services for people who inject drugs. \nBecause we will not reach our goal until we reach the most marginalised communities. That is what it means to leave no-one behind. \nLadies and gentlemen, \nThe world is full of frameworks, roadmaps and action plans that sit on shelves collecting dust, and never make a difference to people. \nI urge you, starting now, to translate your good intentions into concrete actions that transform the health of your people. \nSustained political commitment is essential to turn this national strategy into actionable, costed provincial plans, including monitoring and evaluation. \nUltimately, this strategy must become part of a broader vision for achieving universal health coverage in Pakistan. \nYour horizon must not be only the elimination of hepatitis as a national health threat, but a nation in which all people can access the health services they need, when and where they need them, without facing financial hardship. \nRest assured that WHO stands ready to support you every step of the way. \nI thank you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "saira afzal tarar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud fikri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "b.  pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national hepatitis strategic framework launch of national hepatitis strategic framework", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pakistan  honourable minister for national health services", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T18:32:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ea54d8621e9e925ef12ccea802777dfeb20e49e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5Ee7niqTlXMhLICzWwUwQ4X4ZCF.tUCt2YO4sNb5d2m18vB6ExRsyv6q", "site_full": "www.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://who.int/feeds/entity/mediacentre/news/en/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "WHO news", "title": "WHO to establish high-level commission on noncommunicable diseases", "title_full": "WHO to establish high-level commission on noncommunicable diseases", "published": "2017-10-10T03:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.who.int/about/Logo-WHO.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 330, "comments": 0, "shares": 330}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 140}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ea54d8621e9e925ef12ccea802777dfeb20e49e5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5Ee7niqTlXMhLICzWwUwQ4X4ZCF.tUCt2YO4sNb5d2m18vB6ExRsyv6q", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T03:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "WHO to establish high-level commission on noncommunicable diseases", "text": "WHO to establish high-level commission on noncommunicable diseases \nWHO statement 10 October 2017 \nDr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), announced today the establishment of a new High-level global Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs). The announcement came at the 64th Session of WHO\u2019s Regional Committee for the Eastern Mediterranean being held in Islamabad, 9-12 October. \nThe commission\u2019s aim is to identify innovative ways to curb the world\u2019s biggest causes of death and extend life expectancy for millions of people. The commission will support ongoing political efforts to accelerate action on cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes and respiratory disease, as well as reducing suffering from mental health issues and the impacts of violence and injuries. \nThe High-level global Commission will be chaired by Dr Sania Nishtar, a prominent global advocate for action against NCDs, former Federal Minister of the government of Pakistan and civil society leader. Dr Nishtar has also previously served as co-chair of the WHO Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity. \nNCDs kill approximately 40 million people globally each year, accounting for 70% of all deaths. About 15 million of those deaths are in people between the ages of 30 and 69. Low- and middle-income countries are particularly affected by NCDs with more than 80% of all deaths from NCDs occurring in these countries. Violence and injuries take an overwhelming toll on young people, particularly boys. \nIn 2015, world leaders committed to reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one third by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals. Recent WHO reports indicate that the world will struggle to meet that target. \n\u201cWe urgently need new approaches and action on a dramatically different scale if we are to stop people dying unnecessarily from noncommunicable diseases,\u201d said Dr Tedros. \n\u201cI am committed to engaging the very best people in the world to address our health challenges,\u201d he added. \u201cSo, I am especially pleased that Dr Nishtar has agreed to lead this commission. I know she will bring impressive knowledge, credibility, and commitment to this effort.\u201d \nLater this month ministers and other health leaders from around the world will review progress in Montevideo, Uruguay at the WHO Global Conference on Noncommunicable Diseases, co-hosted by WHO and the President of Uruguay. Governments and other stakeholders will meet again at the third United Nations High-level meeting on NCDs in 2018.

In addition, four deaths from previously reported cases were reported. Details of the cases xlsx, 53kb \nAmong the nine newly reported cases, one was associated with a MERS cluster in Dawmet Aljandal City, Al Jawf region, Saudi Arabia reported previously. \nGlobally, 2090 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV including at least 730 related deaths have been reported to WHO. Public health response \nThe source of infection of the cases reported are under investigation by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Agriculture (when dromedaries are involved) in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health has identified and is following up health care workers and household contacts of known MERS patients. As per Saudi Arabian policy, listed contacts were not allowed to attend Hajj. WHO risk assessment \nMERS-CoV causes severe human infections resulting in high mortality. Close direct or indirect contact with infected dromedaries is the main source of primary human infections. MERS-CoV has demonstrated the ability to transmit between humans. So far, human-to-human transmission has occurred mainly in health care settings. \nThe notification of additional cases does not change the overall risk assessment. WHO expects that additional cases of MERS-CoV infection will be reported from the Middle East, and that cases will continue to be exported to other countries by individuals who might acquire the infection after exposure to animals or animal products (for example, following contact with dromedaries) or human source (for example, in a health care setting). \nWHO continues to monitor the epidemiological situation and conducts risk assessment based on the latest available information. WHO advice \nBased on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns. \nInfection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are non-specific. Therefore, health-care workers should always apply standard precautions consistently with all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures. \nCommunity and household awareness of MERS and MERS prevention measures in the home may reduce household transmission and prevent community clusters. \nUntil more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. Therefore, in addition to avoiding close contact with suspected or confirmed human cases of the disease, people with these conditions should avoid close contact with animals, particularly camels, when visiting farms, markets, or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. General hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals and avoiding contact with sick animals, should be adhered to. \nFood hygiene practices should be observed. People should avoid drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked. \nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

If current trends continue, more children and adolescents will be obese than moderately or severely underweight by 2022, according to a new study led by Imperial College London and WHO. \nThe study was published in The Lancet ahead of World Obesity Day (11 October). It analysed weight and height measurements from nearly 130 million people aged over five years (31.5 million people aged five to 19, and 97.4 million aged 20 and older), making it the largest ever number of participants involved in an epidemiological study. More than 1000 contributors participated in the study, which looked at body mass index (BMI) and how obesity has changed worldwide from 1975 to 2016. \nObesity rates in the world\u2019s children and adolescents increased from less than 1% (equivalent to five million girls and six million boys) in 1975 to nearly 6% in girls (50 million) and nearly 8% in boys (74 million) in 2016. Combined, the number of obese five to 19 year olds rose more than tenfold globally, from 11 million in 1975 to 124 million in 2016. An additional 213 million were overweight in 2016 but fell below the threshold for obesity. Food marketing, policies, pricing behind obesity rise \nLead author Professor Majid Ezzati, of Imperial\u2019s School of Public Health, says: \u201cOver the past four decades, obesity rates in children and adolescents have soared globally, and continue to do so in low- and middle-income countries. More recently, they have plateaued in higher income countries, although obesity levels remain unacceptably high.\u201d \nProfessor Ezzati adds: \"These worrying trends reflect the impact of food marketing and policies across the globe, with healthy nutritious foods too expensive for poor families and communities. The trend predicts a generation of children and adolescents growing up obese and at greater risk of diseases, like diabetes. We need ways to make healthy, nutritious food more available at home and school, especially in poor families and communities, and regulations and taxes to protect children from unhealthy foods.\" More obese than underweight 5 to 19 year olds by 2022 but underweight persists in poor regions \nThe authors say that if post-2000 trends continue, global levels of child and adolescent obesity will surpass those for moderately and severely underweight youth from the same age group by 2022. In 2016, the global number of moderately or severely underweight girls and boys was 75 million and 117 million respectively. \nNevertheless, the large number of moderately or severely underweight children and adolescents in 2016 (75 million girls and 117 million boys) still represents a major public health challenge, especially in the poorest parts of the world. This reflects the threat posed by malnutrition in all its forms, with there being underweight and overweight young people living in the same communities. \nChildren and adolescents have rapidly transitioned from mostly underweight to mostly overweight in many middle-income countries, including in East Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. The authors say this could reflect an increase in the consumption of energy-dense foods, especially highly processed carbohydrates, which lead to weight gain and poor lifelong health outcomes. \nDr Fiona Bull, programme coordinator for surveillance and population-based prevention of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) at WHO, says: \u201cThese data highlight, remind and reinforce that overweight and obesity is a global health crisis today, and threatens to worsen in coming years unless we start taking drastic action.\u201d Solutions exist to reduce child and adolescent obesity \nIn conjunction with the release on the new obesity estimates, WHO is publishing a summary of the Ending Childhood Obesity (ECHO) Implementation Plan. The plan gives countries clear guidance on effective actions to curb childhood and adolescent obesity. WHO has also released guidelines calling on frontline healthcare workers to actively identify and manage children who are overweight or obese. \nDr Bull adds: \u201cWHO encourages countries to implement efforts to address the environments that today are increasing our children\u2019s chance of obesity. Countries should aim particularly to reduce consumption of cheap, ultra-processed, calorie dense, nutrient poor foods. They should also reduce the time children spend on screen-based and sedentary leisure activities by promoting greater participation in physical activity through active recreation and sports.\u201d Note for Editors: \nThe paper presents the first ever comprehensive data on underweight through to obesity for children and adolescents aged five to 19 years and provides startling findings on the increasing numbers and rates of young people being affected by obesity. \nThe study calculated and compared body mass index (BMI) among children, adolescents and adults from 1975 to 2016, and made projections based on current trends in obesity rates. \nBMI is a measure of a person\u2019s weight and body fat mass for their height, and indicates whether their weight is healthy. \nCalculating BMI is the simplest way to assess a person\u2019s weight status, and the most common tool used to determine under-, healthy- and overweight and obesity. For children and adolescents, their BMI is adjusted for age and sex using WHO\u2019s growth reference curves. \nAction to curb obesity is a key element of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 commits the world to reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one-third by 2030, including through prevention of obesity. SDG target 2.2 commits the world to ending all forms of malnutrition by 2030, including overweight and obesity. Also, the goal of the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025) is to promote collaboration across all sectors and stakeholders to end malnutrition in all its forms. \nThe findings also showed that: Global data for obesity and underweight \nIn 2016, there were 50 million girls and 74 million boys with obesity in the world, while the global number of moderately or severely underweight girls and boys was 75 million and 117 million respectively. \nThe number of obese adults increased from 100 million in 1975 (69 million women, 31 million men) to 671 million in 2016 (390 million women, 281 million men). Another 1.3 billion adults were overweight, but fell below the threshold for obesity. Regional/Country data for obesity, BMI and underweight Obesity: \nThe rise in childhood and adolescent obesity rates in low and middle income countries, especially in Asia, has recently accelerated. On the other hand, the rise in childhood and adolescent obesity in high income countries has slowed and plateaued. \nIn 2016, the obesity rate was highest in Polynesia and Micronesia in boys and girls, at 25.4% in girls and 22.4% in boys, followed by the high-income English-speaking region, which includes the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United Kingdom. \nThe areas of the world with the largest increase in the number of obese children and adolescents were East Asia, the high-income English-speaking region, and the Middle East and North Africa. \nNauru was the country with the highest prevalence of obesity for girls (33.4%), and Cook Islands had the highest for boys (33.3%). \nIn Europe, girls in Malta and boys in Greece had the highest obesity rates, comprising 11.3% and 16.7% of the population respectively. Girls and boys in Moldova had the lowest obesity rates, comprising 3.2% and 5% of the population respectively. \nGirls in the UK had the 73rd highest obesity rate in the world (6th in Europe); boys had the 84th highest obesity in the world (18th in Europe). \nGirls in the USA had the 15th highest obesity rate in the world; boys had the 12th highest obesity in the world. \nAmong high-income countries, the United States of America had the highest obesity rates for girls and boys. BMI: \nThe largest rise in BMI of children and adolescents during the four decades was in Polynesia and Micronesia for both boys and girls, and in central Latin America for girls. The smallest rise in the BMI of children and adolescents during the four decades covered by the study was seen in Eastern Europe. \nThe country with the biggest rise in BMI for girls was Samoa, which rose by 5.6 kg/m2, and for boys was the Cook Islands, which rose by 4.4 kg/m 2 . Underweight: \nIndia had the highest prevalence of moderate and severe underweight throughout these four decades (24.4% of girls and 39.3% of boys were moderately or severely underweight in 1975, and 22.7% and 30.7% in 2016). 97 million of the world\u2019s moderately or severely underweight children and adolescents lived in India in 2016.

We face many formidable challenges, but the commitment and talent of so many people are the best assets we have. \nAnd we all have a role to play. \nAs you know, the Western Pacific Region is home to almost 1.9 billion people \u2013 one quarter of the world\u2019s population. \nFrom the steppes of Mongolia to the fiords of New Zealand; from the Himalayas to the Australian outback, this is an enormous and remarkably diverse region of our planet. \nThe health challenges you face are equally diverse, from the ballooning epidemics of obesity, to deadly outbreaks of new viruses, and the ever-increasing health impacts of climate change. \nAs you know, I have recently begun an initiative to support small island developing states \u2013 many of which are in this region \u2013 to adapt to the health effects of climate change. \nA few weeks ago I sent my representatives to Cook Islands to meet with representatives of the Pacific Islands, and just a fortnight ago I had a very positive meeting with the small island states in the Caribbean. \nAlthough these islands are the least responsible for climate change, they are the most at risk. We owe it to them to do everything we can to help them prepare for the future that is already washing up on their shores. \nLadies and gentlemen, \nThe Western Pacific Region is home to some remarkable success stories. \nChina\u2019s progress in expanding health coverage to its vast population is an inspiring illustration of what is possible in even the biggest, most complex countries. \nNine out of 10 women in this region have access to modern family planning methods, the highest of all WHO regions. \nSuicide rates are decreasing regionally, and especially in the Republic of Korea, thanks to the banning of a particularly lethal pesticide. \nIn Papua New Guinea, death and disease from malaria has dropped significantly. \nAnd I am very pleased to be here today to celebrate the elimination of trachoma in Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nEarlier this year, WHO validated both countries as having eliminated trachoma as a public health problem, after more than a decade of commitment and efforts on the part of government, donors, and WHO. \nThis is a remarkable public health achievement, and a great gift to the people of both nations. \nI hope I will get to celebrate achievements like every time I come to WPRO! \nBut of course, challenges remain. \nYou still have an enormous burden of tuberculosis. \nAlcohol consumption is increasing. \nMore people smoke in this region than anywhere else in the world, and although countries such as Australia are setting the standard for plain packaging, in other areas you are falling behind. \nOnly four countries from the Western Pacific have signed the Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products: China, Fiji, Mongolia and the Republic of Korea. Only Mongolia has ratified it. \nFrankly, that is embarrassing. \nIf we serious about tobacco control, we must walk the talk. \nAnother 9 countries need to ratify the protocol for it to come into force by July 2018. I urge those of you who have not yet signed the protocol to sign, and those who have signed but not yet ratified the protocol to do so. \nLadies and gentlemen, \nLast Saturday marked my one-hundredth day in office. \nI am proud of everything we have accomplished together in the past 3 months. \nI have advocated for universal health coverage and health security at the highest political levels, including the G20 and the UN General Assembly. \nI\u2019ve introduced a new approach to WHO\u2019s emergency response operations, including daily briefing notes, and established a WHO Health Security Council which meets fortnightly that I chair, in which we review the status of all health emergencies globally, and how WHO is responding to them. \nI have launched the process of transforming WHO to make it more focused on delivering results. \nAnd we have appointed the largest and most diverse leadership team in WHO\u2019s history, 60% of whom are women. \nI am especially proud to have 3 members of my senior management team from the Western Pacific: Dr Peter Salama of Australia, Dr Naoko Yamamoto of Japan, and Dr Ren Minghui of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nIt also gives me great pleasure to announce today the appointment of Elizabeth Iro, the Secretary of Health in the Cook Islands, as Chief Nurse at WHO. \nWHO leadership now looks exactly as the world looks. Elizabeth will bring valuable experience, and contribute to our efforts to ensure all countries have a fit-for-purpose health workforce. Her appointment also means the Pacific region will be represented in WHO\u2019s senior leadership. \nLadies and gentlemen, \nIn my first 100 days I have met some of the richest and poorest people in our world. I have met the most powerful, and the most vulnerable. \nI have listened to you, our Member States. I have listened to our staff, who I have said repeatedly are WHO\u2019s greatest asset. I have listened to our partners. I have listened to the voice of age and experience, and I have listened to the voice of youthful enthusiasm. \nAnd I have come to realise that the world expects WHO to do 3 things: \nTo keep the world safe, to improve health, and to serve the vulnerable. Let me repeat that: the world expects WHO to keep the world safe, to improve health, and to serve the vulnerable. \nThat is our mission. \nAnd in many ways, we already do all 3. But we can and must do better. \nFor that reason, I have taken the decision to accelerate the process of shaping the next General Programme of Work from 24 months to 12 months. \nOur work is too urgent to wait. We have no time to lose. \nThe concept note on the new GPW has already been discussed at the other 5 regional committee meetings. \nI have been very encouraged by the feedback we have received. \nNow it\u2019s your turn. \nShortly, you will hear more about our ideas for the next 5 years, and we are looking forward to getting your input. \nBut allow me take a few moments just to give you the outline. \nThe GPW describes several key priorities that will define our work in the years to come. In fact, these priorities have evolved even in the course of the regional committee meetings. \nLet me summarize them like this: health coverage, health security, health SDGs. \nFirst, WHO\u2019s core business is to help countries progress towards universal health coverage. \nWHO was founded on the conviction that health is a human right. It is a conviction I share. No one should get sick and die just because they are poor, or because they cannot access the health services they need. \nWHO is not in the business of prescribing the exact steps countries must take to reach universal health coverage. \nBut for all countries, it must be built on the foundation of strong health systems, including primary care that delivers health services designed to meet the needs of people, not the needs of providers. \nThe second priority is to strengthen global health security. When an outbreak becomes an epidemic, the world looks to WHO. \nWe must accelerate our evolution towards being more responsive to emergencies. When disaster strikes, our partners expect us to be shoulder-to-shoulder with them on the frontlines, not shouting instructions from the side-lines. \nWe are on the right track. Today, we are on the ground in countries like Yemen, Bangladesh and Madagascar, delivering much-needed assistance. \nOutbreaks are inevitable, but epidemics are preventable. That is why I have taken action to work with our partners \u2013 including the Wellcome Trust \u2013 to map global emergency response capacities, and global R&D capacities, in order to multiply the capacities we have. \nIf we are able to deploy emergency medical teams rapidly, and swiftly engage the world\u2019s R&D machinery to develop new tests and vaccines, millions of lives can be saved. \nAnd the third priority is to drive progress towards the SDGs. The Sustainable Development Goals will be the foundation for all our work. They are the priorities on which the world has agreed, and must also be our priorities. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. \nBut the World Health Organization is also the custodian of several specific SDG targets, and we will focus our attention on four specific areas: protecting against the health impacts of climate change and environmental problems; improving the health of women, children and adolescents; ending the epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and hepatitis (the big 4); and preventing premature deaths from noncommunicable diseases, including mental health. \nAnd to address the enormous burden of noncommunicable diseases in this region, and all over the world, I have established a new High-Level Global Commission on Noncommunicable Diseases, to be led by Dr Sania Nishtar, which we announced from Islamabad yesterday. \nIn order to fulfil our mission and mandate, I believe that WHO needs to make several big shifts in the way we work. That starts from planning and the GPW is being prepared accordingly. \nFirst, we must become far more focused on outcomes and impact. WHO must be results-oriented. \nToo often we are focused simply on outputs and processes, without thinking carefully enough about whether we are truly making a difference to public health. \nThis must change. In order to make progress, we must be able to measure progress. \nThe second major shift we must make is that WHO will become more operational, especially in fragile, vulnerable and conflict areas. \nI believe that WHO must be relevant in all countries. No country\u2019s health system is perfect. There is always room for improvement. So in all countries, we will engage in regular policy dialogue to identify gaps and solutions. \nIn addition to policy dialogue, some countries will require our technical assistance, in the form of the practical tools, experience and know-how we offer. \nA third group of countries will require policy dialogue, technical support and operational support to deliver services where nobody else will or can. \nAt the same time, we will continue to play our normative, standard-setting role \u2013 and indeed we will strengthen those functions. \nThe third shift is that we must put countries at the centre of WHO\u2019s work. This seems obvious, but it bears repeating. Results don\u2019t happen in Geneva or in regional offices; they happen in countries, in the frontlines. Our role is to support you, our Member States, and to enable you to strengthen your health systems, achieve universal health coverage for your people and protect against epidemics in your countries. To do that, you must be in the driver\u2019s seat. \nAnd fourth, WHO must provide leadership by advocating for health at the highest political levels. The importance of mobilising political commitment for health is clear to all of us. Our technical work may be excellent, but it will not bear fruit unless we engage politically to create the demand for it. A balance of technical and political interventions will bring better results. \nI know, and you know, that political will is the key ingredient for change. It is not the only ingredient, but without it, change is much harder to achieve. For a paradigm shift, we need political intervention. \nFrom the G20 in Hamburg to the General Assembly in New York last month, I have been very encouraged by the support I see for health at the highest political level. \nWHO should not be shy about engaging with world leaders. Our cause is too important; the stakes are too high. \nMeaningful change happens when political leaders are engaged. WHO must therefore not be afraid to go beyond the technical to the political in pursuit of its mission. \nMy friends, \nWe stand on the threshold of a new era in global health. \nThe SDGs give us the political mandate to drive significant change. \nWe are seeing unprecedented momentum for the twin priorities of universal health coverage and health security. \nBut the clock is ticking. We have just 13 years to keep the promises we made to the world\u2019s people. \nHistory will be our judge. Will our grandchildren admire our achievements? Or will they say we had a lot of meetings, and wrote a lot of reports, but didn\u2019t achieve very much? \nAs I embark on my voyage as Director-General, I have never been more optimistic about the potential for the World Health Organization to make a meaningful and measurable difference. \nBut we cannot do it alone. \nA safer, fairer and healthier world can only be realized through collaboration, cooperation, solidarity and joint action. \nI especially want to thank my brother Dr Shin once again for his hospitality and leadership. I look forward to working with him and with you all to make our shared vision a reality. \nThank you so much. Xie xie. Arigat\u014d gozaimashita. Merci beaucoup!

With this announcement, Dr Tedros fulfils a commitment he made during his transition to the Director-General role to appoint a nurse to his senior team. \n\u201cI am thrilled to welcome Ms Iro to our team as WHO\u2019s Chief Nursing Officer,\u201d said Dr Tedros. \u201cNurses play a critical role not only in delivering healthcare to millions around the world, but also in transforming health policies, promoting health in communities, and supporting patients and families. Nurses are central to achieving universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals. Ms Iro will keep that perspective front and centre at WHO.\u201d \nMs Iro has more than 30 years of experience in public health in the Cook Islands and regionally. As Secretary of Health, she has implemented health reforms to strengthen the country\u2019s health system. These include developing the country\u2019s National Health Roadmap 2017-2036, the National Health Strategic Plan 2017-2021, and the Health Clinical Workforce Plan. \nShe had previously served as the country\u2019s Chief Nursing Officer and Acting Director of Hospital Health Services. For the first 25 years of her career, she was a staff nurse, midwife and charge midwife at hospitals in the Cook Islands and New Zealand. \nThis appointment is the latest addition to the senior leadership team Dr Tedros announced last week, which includes representatives from every WHO region and is 60% women.

There are now an estimated 422 million adults with diabetes globally. Among its serious complications, people living with diabetes can suffer vision loss. Often by the time a person notices a problem with his or her vision, the damage is irreversible. \nDiabetic retinopathy, which contributes to 2.6% of blindness in the world, can be a challenging disease for many countries to manage, because doing so involves two different parts of the health system, that which cares for patients with diabetes and that which cares for patients with vision loss. A lack of coordination can lead to people missing out on essential services, enduring long waits or traveling far from home to receive care. \nTo help countries better ensure timely diagnosis and access to treatment for diabetic retinopathy, WHO developed the Tool for Assessment of Diabetes and Diabetic Retinopathy or \u201cTADDS\u201d in 2015. Among the first countries to make use of this new tool was Nepal, where the Ministry of Health had been concerned by the increase in diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, and wanted to use TADDS to make sure it was taking the appropriate actions in response. \nMr Sailesh Kumar Mishra, National Programme Coordinator of the Apex Body for Eye Health in the Ministry of Health said \u201cAt the time Nepal had taken a step forward by listing noncommunicable diseases as a priority health concern, but it was lacking the specific health policies, plans and programmes to address diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in particular. TADDS has helped move us in the right direction.\u201d \nThe assessment was made possible through the direct assistance provided by the WHO Country Office in Nepal to the Ministry of Health; the Office supported the field work, monitored the progresses and provided effective and timely feedback to the WHO HQ in Geneva. \nTADDS was used to collect data and information about the current situation in the country, including the level of coordination \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 across the two services, the extent to which data are shared, and the ways that patients are educated on how to manage their diabetes and prevent vision loss from diabetic retinopathy. \nThe findings of the assessment were not surprising. There had been insufficient collaboration between the diabetes management and eye care sectors, making it difficult for health care providers to know when and how they should be working together. There were also some areas where disease management guidelines needed to be updated to reflect current best practice. It was also clear that patients needed to be better educated about how to manage diabetes and diabetic retinopathy. \nWith support from WHO, a national policy discussion was held in MONTH YEAR based on the report during which immediate actions were defined for the Ministry of Health and its partners, including patient associations, to rectify shortcomings in the system. \nSince then, the Government of Nepal has been making good progress. A National Strategy for the Integration of Diabetic Retinopathy Eye Care Services into the Public Health System and several clinical guidelines for managing diabetic retinopathy have been developed in part based on WHO guidance and are about to be approved. Diabetic retinopathy has also been included in the National Eye Health Policy which is also nearing completion. \nWork has been done too to build the capacities of health care workers, with diabetic retinopathy included in curriculum developed for primary care assistants who focus on noncommunicable diseases. In fact the Ministry of Health is promoting a new model for its workforce in communities which supports better integration and referrals in primary eye care, with diabetic retinopathy one of the key issues addressed. \nTo complement these ongoing efforts, the Ministry of Health has initiated public awareness campaigns targeted at people with diabetes on the importance of having their eyes checked regularly for any sign of vision loss. \nMr Mishra noted \u201cWe now know best where to place our energies, so that people with diabetes get the eye care they need to prevent any unnecessary loss of vision. And we have been able to do this because we made sure we had the buy in of all the stakeholders involved.\u201d \nThe Ministry of Health is expecting to conduct the TADDS assessment again in two years. This will help monitor the progress of specific actions, and make sure that future work continues to address the most important needs. \nExperiences from countries like Nepal in implementing TADDS and other similar WHO tools for glaucoma, refractive errors and vision rehabilitation will help to inform WHO\u2019s World report on vision which is currently under development, and scheduled for release in late 2018.

I come from the Kajiado County in Kenya, and I am originally from a Maasai tribe. Since 2016 I have been a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) Civil Society Task Force on TB. \nIn 2011, I realized that something was wrong with my health when I started losing weight while my stomach was constantly swollen. I had a whole body scan at the hospital in Nairobi and the doctors told me that they saw a big mass in my upper abdomen which had to be removed. It turned out it was pus, and when I woke up after a 7-hour surgery, the doctors told me that I had TB and that I had probably been infected by drinking unpasteurized milk or eating raw meat from cattle infected with TB. \nMy first reaction was utter shock: I had no idea that animals could have TB. Then I started worrying about my community: Maasai tribes have been eating raw meat and drinking blood and blood-milk mixtures from cattle for hundreds of years! At that moment I realized the seriousness of the issue. I suddenly felt that I wanted to take the medicines to be cured and to educate my people on how to prevent and fight TB. After 7 months of treatment I was finally able to stand up and walk and I started to inform my community about TB and the risks of getting it from infected cattle. \nInitially people wouldn\u2019t believe me, so I told them my experience. Eventually a few men started coming to me to tell me that they had lost someone in their family who had the same symptoms I had described. Gradually more and more people started listening to me. When I talk to my communities, I tell them that TB is airborne and I explain the importance of ventilation. As a TB survivor and advocate, I also emphasize the importance of supporting TB patients: if you are not loved when taking medication you may give up on it. \nIn the past couple of years I\u2019ve seen a lot of changes in these communities. Today, if people see someone coughing, they refer him to a hospital. They now know that TB is curable and preventable and that medication is free because our government provides for the treatment. The only problem we face is X-rays. Unfortunately this service is not free of charge, and if a person with TB symptoms comes from a poor community, he or she will not be able to afford it. This is why I ask my government to cover also this important service. \nAs a TB survivor and advocate, my hope is to bring change, not only to the Kajiado County, but also to the whole of Kenya.

Though he survived the experience and now lives in Turkey, he and many other health staff from northern Syria bear psychological scars. For those still in the country, the constant pressure translates into a clear need for mental health support. \nA doctor still working in northern Syria, who prefers to use the name Abulaman, says he has experienced a 180 degree turn in his life since the conflict began. Before the conflict, he remembers going for walks with his family after work. Now, he says, \u201cMany days we can\u2019t speak to our families when we get home, because of what we see [at work]\u2026 When we get home, we can\u2019t look at our children. We think, \u2018What if this happens to them?\u2019\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re doctors but we\u2019re also human,\u201d he concludes. \nAs renewed fighting makes the situation in northern Syria ever more challenging, WHO and its health partners continue to develop ways to mitigate the mental toll taken on health workers. The mental health impact of working in danger zones \n\u201cI feel depressed because of the traumatic experiences of the people I help\u201d and \u201cI find it difficult to separate my personal life from my life as a helper\u201d\u2013 these are 2 of the statements gathered from a WHO psychological assessment survey taken by more than 200 Syrian health workers. The survey measures burnout, defined as \u201cwork-related hopelessness and feelings of inefficacy\u201d, as well as the effects of secondary exposure to extremely stressful events \u2013 for example, seeing images of the victims of an attack. \nThe survey found differences between Syrian health workers inside northern Syria and those working in neighbouring Turkey. This is partly related to health workers in northern Syria being under direct attack: more than 62 verified attacks were carried out on health-care facilities in the first half of 2017 alone. \nHowever, the conflict has had serious consequences for both groups. According to Dr Manuel de Lara, Public Health Officer for WHO\u2019s field office in Gaziantep, Turkey, secondary stress can include being afraid, having difficulty sleeping, having images of the upsetting event pop into your mind, or avoiding things that remind you of the event. Dr de Lara also points out that many humanitarian workers feel frustrated by the fact that the lives of Syrians are not improving, in spite of all they are doing to help. \nThe survey is part of ongoing activities led by the WHO field office in Gaziantep, located close to the Syrian border. WHO work aims to address and reduce the psychological toll that the crisis is taking on aid workers. These efforts include: seminars for medical and humanitarian staff to reinforce good self-care (i.e. what aid workers can do for themselves to stay healthy and handle stress); a workshop held in May 2017 encouraging local non-governmental organizations to prioritize staff care and resulting in a common policy; a training manual entitled Self-care among humanitarian aid workers in Turkey, developed by WHO and partners; plans to create a 24-hour hotline offering counselling and support for Syrian humanitarian aid workers who are working and living in Turkey; plans to train trainers who can then lead workshops on self-care for humanitarian aid workers. \nThis focus on self-care and staff care complements WHO\u2019s ongoing work to support the mental health of Syrians. In the early months of 2017, WHO trained hundreds of family physicians, community health workers and mental health staff in both Turkey and northern Syria in its Mental Health Gap (MHGap) programme, helping them identify and treat common psychological conditions.This activity was carried out with support from the Ministry of Health of Turkey. Discouraging isolation, encouraging interaction \nBoth self-care and staff care are urgently needed in the context of the Syrian response. \u201cSo many health staff are themselves displaced,\u201d says Dr Fuad Almossa, a Syrian psychiatrist. \u201cWe encourage them not to be isolated. We say, \u2018Don\u2019t just see patients. At least one day a week, socialize with family and friends.\u2019\u201d \n\u201cWe need to support the well-being of humanitarian staff,\u201d emphasizes Dr de Lara. For supervisors of stressed-out workers, something as simple as starting a one-on-one meeting by asking \u201cHow are you?\u201d can make a difference. Improving staff care can have an important ripple effect. \u201cIf we as doctors get psychological support, we can deal better with our patients,\u201d says a Turkish doctor who attended a MHGap course. World Mental Health Day 2017: mental health in the workplace \nThis year, World Mental Health Day, marked on 10 October annually, focuses on mental health in the workplace. A recent WHO-led study estimates that depression and anxiety disorders cost the global economy US$ 1 trillion each year in lost productivity. Some jobs may carry a higher personal risk than others (e.g. first responders and humanitarian workers), which can have an impact on mental health and be a cause of symptoms of mental disorders, or lead to harmful use of alcohol or psychoactive drugs. Risk may be increased in situations where team cohesion or social support are lacking. \nAdditionally, this year\u2019s World Health Day \u201cLet\u2019s Talk\u201d campaign focused on raising awareness about depression and reducing stigma by educating people about how to support those living with depression \u2013 including through the simple act of talking with them and having an open dialogue about what they are experiencing. \nWHO Gaziantep\u2019s mental health programmes are supported by the Department for International Development (United Kingdom) and European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T15:19:00.882+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a0c0569879f5257768a16d6868862c0f97625680", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4Jur2eNdWxOHHmop4qyiGd1HssEoWOvjel9Ql2qQWKUTmUrxMJunmwYEOE8AuSAAxGAPIb_BMfWCRb9FDJFcvFEdT7bt70FHWWttpA.ftRfL9tz6n_UzLlKmZiL0.GCeibIrsFdQ8ZHgXvkA96usLyq_gWNE.qJLWWV4IE1ghsEv62Zp9gDUJ4_RPtmSLwbpkUU0bOXOTNHvk-", "site_full": "www.euro.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/who/euro/rss/en", "site_categories": ["europe", "womens_health", "travel", "mens_health", "health", "herbs_for_health", "senor_health"], "section_title": "WHO/Europe | News feed", "title": "Official from the Belgian Federal Ministry of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment visits WHO/Europe", "title_full": "Official from the Belgian Federal Ministry of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment visits WHO/Europe", "published": "2017-10-13T13:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/image/0005/243581/who-europe-250.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a0c0569879f5257768a16d6868862c0f97625680", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4Jur2eNdWxOHHmop4qyiGd1HssEoWOvjel9Ql2qQWKUTmUrxMJunmwYEOE8AuSAAxGAPIb_BMfWCRb9FDJFcvFEdT7bt70FHWWttpA.ftRfL9tz6n_UzLlKmZiL0.GCeibIrsFdQ8ZHgXvkA96usLyq_gWNE.qJLWWV4IE1ghsEv62Zp9gDUJ4_RPtmSLwbpkUU0bOXOTNHvk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T13:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Official from the Belgian Federal Ministry of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment visits WHO/Europe", "text": "Official from the Belgian Federal Ministry of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment visits WHO/Europe 13-10-2017 WHO \nOn 9 October 2017 Mr Tom Auwers, President of the Board of Directors, Belgian Federal Ministry of Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment, made his first visit to the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen.

Bring \n11 October is World Obesity Day. Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally, with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese. In the WHO European Region, an estimated 23% of women and 20% of men have obesity. Overweight and obesity are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. They can also lead to overweight bias and obesity stigma, as outlined in a new brief from WHO/Europe. \nObesity stigma is ubiquitous, with one recent study from a country in western Europe showing that 18.7% of people with obesity experienced stigma. For people with severe obesity, the figure was much higher \u2013 38%. Individuals with obesity experience stigma from educators, employers, health professionals, the media and even from friends and family. \nStigma is a fundamental cause of health inequalities, and obesity stigma is associated with significant physiological and psychological consequences, including increased depression, anxiety and decreased self-esteem. It can also lead to disordered eating, avoidance of physical activity and avoidance of medical care. Obesity stigma hits children especially hard \nThe effects of weight bias and obesity stigma can be particularly severe for children. Studies indicate that school-aged children with obesity experience a 63% higher chance of being bullied. When children and youth are bullied or victimized because of their weight by peers, family and friends, it can trigger feelings of shame and lead to depression, low self-esteem, poor body image and even suicide. \nWeight-biased attitudes from teachers can involve lower expectations from students, which can lead to low education outcomes for children and youth with obesity. This can, in turn, affect children\u2019s life chances and opportunities, and ultimately lead to social and health inequities. Policies are needed to prevent weight-victimization in schools, and parents can advocate for their children with teachers and principals by expressing concerns and promoting awareness of weight bias in schools. Ethical considerations and the importance of social environments \nOver-simplifying the causes of obesity and implying that easy solutions will lead to quick and sustainable results \u2013 for example, \u201ceat less, be more active\u201d\u2013 contribute to weight bias and can set unrealistic expectations, masking the challenges people with obesity can face in changing behaviour. Additionally, this often focuses discussion around individual behaviours and perceived failures, while neglecting to take into consideration important social and environmental factors. \nIt is important to understand the causes of obesity and for governments to invest in prevention and early intervention measures to halt its worrying rise. But, at the same time, it is vital to recognize that government and society have ethical obligations to act \u2013 particularly on behalf of children \u2013 to reduce not only the health but also the social consequences of obesity. Failure to do so will impact the social and health capital of future generations and increase inequities in Europe and beyond. \nWHO/Europe aims to work with countries in many different ways and through several policy frameworks to ensure that weight bias and obesity stigma among children and adults are addressed appropriately in national public health activities, notably through: further research; knowledge exchange at national and local levels; prioritizing concerns around weight bias and obesity stigma in public policy, notably education and health care. \nThe new brief from WHO/Europe outlines specific actions that countries can consider taking to address the issues of weight bias and obesity stigma.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T15:20:22.107+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a30687fddacd90bfd47738d9ad629eca0ccee5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPX8kEwtTIr9NH6a0wp05HqmFt73SktRgikaonIvKhwyxA-", "site_full": "www.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/SyriaNews-GoogleNews", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "syria news - Google News", "title": "Attack on vaccines sets back immunization efforts in eastern Syria - World Health Organization", "title_full": "Attack on vaccines sets back immunization efforts in eastern Syria - World Health Organization", "published": "2017-10-13T23:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.who.int/about/Logo-WHO.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3112, "comments": 0, "shares": 3112}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 30}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a30687fddacd90bfd47738d9ad629eca0ccee5b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPX8kEwtTIr9NH6a0wp05HqmFt73SktRgikaonIvKhwyxA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-13T23:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Attack on vaccines sets back immunization efforts in eastern Syria - World Health Organization", "text": "Attack on vaccines sets back immunization efforts in eastern Syrian Arab Republic \nNews release \n13 October 2017 | GENEVA - WHO has received reports of an attack on medical facilities in eastern Syrian Arab Republic that has destroyed the only vaccines cold room in al-Mayadeen district, Deir Ezzor Governorate. \nMore than 100,000 doses of measles vaccines and 35,000 doses of polio vaccines were stored in these facilities, alongside equipment, syringes, and stocks for all vaccine-preventable childhood diseases. \nIf confirmed, this would set back the efforts of WHO and health partners to protect the children of Deir Ezzor from preventable childhood diseases, including polio.

This outbreak caries a moderate risk of spread to neighbouring Indian Ocean islands. This risk has been mitigated by the short incubation period (the time from exposure to onset of symptoms) of pneumonic plague and the institution of exit screening measures at the airport and other major ports. For more information, see the latest situation report available from: Plague outbreak situation reports \nOn 10 October 2017, the Seychellois Ministry of Health notified WHO of a probable case of pneumonic plague. The probable case is a 34-year-old man who had visited Madagascar and returned to Seychelles on 6 October 2017. He developed symptoms on 9 October 2017 and presented to a local health centre. Based on a medical examination and reported history of recent travel to Madagascar, pneumonic plague infection was suspected and he was immediately referred to hospital where he was isolated and treated. \nA rapid diagnostic test (RDT) preformed within the country on 11 October on a sputum sample was weakly positive. Since then he has been treated as a probable case until confirmation by a WHO plague reference laboratory is completed. The specimen is being sent to Institut Pasteur in Paris, France for confirmation. The patient continues to be hospitalized in isolation until completion of the antibiotic treatment. He is currently asymptomatic and in stable condition. \nBetween 9 and 11 October 2017, eight of his contacts developed mild symptoms and have been isolated. Two other suspected cases, without any established epidemiological link to the probable case, have also been identified isolated and are on treatment. \nIn total 10 laboratory specimens have been collected from the probable case, his contacts and the two suspected cases and are being shipped to Institut Pasteur in France for testing. \nOctober 13 was the last day of monitoring of over 320 contact persons of the probable case, including 41 passengers and seven crew from the flight, 12 close family members, and 18 staff and patients from the health centre visited by the probable case. All were provided a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent the disease. \nIn addition, 577 children and 63 teachers in potential contact with one of the individual identified by contact tracing were given antibiotics as a prophylaxis precautionary measure. Thus contact tracing is done thoroughly. \nCurrently only eleven (11) close contacts and one foreign national who was not in contact with the probable case but recently arrived from Madagascar, are hospitalised as precautionary measure and will remain in the hospital on treatment although they do not present signs of respiratory distress. Public health response \nA Crisis Emergency Committee was established on 10 October, and has since then, been meeting daily to coordinate surveillance, contact tracing, case management, isolation and supplies. \nA hotline was revived on 12th October. \nThe Government has allocated funds to support the Committee interventions, enabling the setting up of a temporary isolation ward (whilst the existing ward is expanded), procurement of key supplies, contact tracing, and expanded contact tracers training next week, etc. \nAir Seychelles flights to-from Madagascar were stopped from 8 October to reduce likelihood of further importation of cases from Madagascar. \nWHO does not recommend restrictions on travel and trade, based on the currently available information. \nOn 10 October 2017, Madagascar Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, has implemented exit screening at the international airport in Antananarivo to prevent international spread. Further support from WHO and partners is being planned to strengthen measures at points of entry to avoid international spread. \nWHO has deployed three epidemiologists and one risk communication officer to support the Country Office and Ministry of Public Health in responding to the current situation. WHO risk assessment \nPlague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis , a zoonotic bacterium, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or animals or by inhalation. \nThere are three forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. \nPneumonic plague is the most virulent form of plague and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person with secondary pneumonic plague may form aerosolized infective droplets and transmit plague to other humans. Plague is treatable disease; however, untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal. \nPlague has never been reported in Seychelles, and at this stage, no cases have been definitively confirmed. The case reported above being considered as probable until final classification according to the laboratory results that will be performed at Institut Pasteur in Paris. \nThe Seychelles Government has established precautionary measures including, enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contact. \nThe risk of further spread in the Seychelles (should the case be confirmed) is considered as low and the overall regional and global risk levels as very low. WHO travel advice \nAt this stage, there is a very low risk international travellers would come into contact with plague in Seychelles.

He is a champion in the fight against NCDs. \nBefore I go any further, I would like to reflect my deep sadness, and shock, for the passing yesterday of my brother, and colleague, Dr Mahmoud Fikri, the WHO Regional Director for the Eastern Mediterranean Region. \nThe World Health Organization is grieving today, from here in Montevideo, to Geneva and Cairo, and throughout the region where Dr Fikri had strived for decades to improve the health of others. \nI extend my, and WHO\u2019s, deepest condolences to Dr Fikri\u2019s family, his loved ones, and colleagues, and offer our love and support to them at this very difficult time. \nPlease allow me to lead a minute\u2019s silence for our friend and brother, Dr Fikri. \nDear friends, \nNoncommunicable diseases affect us all. \nWe all know someone whose life was cut short by heart disease and cancer. \nWe all have parents, relatives or friends who live with diabetes. \nWe all have someone we love whose memory was robbed by Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \nNoncommunicable diseases account for 7 of the top 10 causes of death globally, and are responsible for 70% of all deaths worldwide. \nTragically, every year, NCDs kill 15 million people aged between 30 and 70. \nThe vast majority of these premature deaths do not occur in rich nations, but among the poorest people in the poorest countries. \nEach death deprives a family of a loved one. But it also deprives a nation of a worker. \nThe tragedy of NCDs is that many are caused by forces beyond our control \u2013 exposure to second hand smoke, cheap foods high in sugar, salt and trans fats, built up areas that don\u2019t cater for physical activity. \nIn the name of free trade, we allow multinational corporations to market junk food to children. \nIn the name of economic development, we allow the tobacco industry to poison billions of people. \nIn the name of entertainment, we allow our children to spend more and more time in front of television and smartphone screens, rather than playing outside. \nWhen will we say enough is enough? \nAt what point do we take a stand and push back? \nTo manufacturers of these products, I pose several questions to them, some of whom might be in this room today: \n\u201cWould you knowingly feed your own children unhealthy foods and drinks high in salt, sugar and trans fats, in doing so steering them from an early age onto a course of heightened health risk, from diabetes, obesity, cancer and cardiovascular diseases?\u201d \nIf the answer is \u201cno,\u201d so how can food and soft drink makers market and sell their products to the masses of children around the world, seeing them more as opportunities for profit, and turning a blind eye to the spiralling rates of childhood obesity and early onset diabetes. \nEven if they are not your biological children, you must see them as your children \u2013 we are all part of the same human race. We should lift up those who need our support, not condemn them to futures of ill-health and limited opportunities. \nAt this important Conference, I urge us all to reflect very deeply on such realities, and to commit to solutions that promote health, protect people and prevent avoidable death and suffering. \nThe children who are facing all these challenges are our children, they are our future, and we really need to care for them, and our future. \nSuch solutions must be grasped and led by the highest level of state and implemented by all arms of government and society. \nWhile some NCDs, like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, pose complex scientific questions for which we don\u2019t yet have answers, the majority of these diseases are commonplace. \nWho in this room today does not know someone who has suffered needlessly, or passed away far too soon, from a NCD? \nAnd for most NCDs, we know exactly what the answers are. \nStop tobacco use.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tedros adhanom ghebreyesus", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dr fikri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fikri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vasquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmoud fikri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tabar\u00e9 vasquez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uruguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cairo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern mediterranean region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montevideo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T09:54:12.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "242fedab831d33e605ff95a359bcf82b850a7a79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4JKEuzQ67s4ZAMGGEbkctYthm6vGT7XJQF6rsRRaywKOVy2HtqkSUdndKS4pidcWxsmwbSGYW6Tx365rgX.Grs.o8mSmmvD85CuiwYYLZhLuonua6KIgyr51IajvTgj7O0BU8hnifk5EyjqYsK3XUUlfqHumar0A5GPrleFSdXdZZFdqZt29nGncYVnyNtX3Pk", "site_full": "www.euro.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/who/euro/rss/en", "site_categories": ["europe", "womens_health", "travel", "mens_health", "health", "herbs_for_health", "senor_health"], "section_title": "WHO/Europe | News feed", "title": "European Region makes huge gains in NCD response, but needs faster progress", "title_full": "European Region makes huge gains in NCD response, but needs faster progress", "published": "2017-10-19T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/image/0005/243581/who-europe-250.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 19, "comments": 0, "shares": 19}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "242fedab831d33e605ff95a359bcf82b850a7a79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4JKEuzQ67s4ZAMGGEbkctYthm6vGT7XJQF6rsRRaywKOVy2HtqkSUdndKS4pidcWxsmwbSGYW6Tx365rgX.Grs.o8mSmmvD85CuiwYYLZhLuonua6KIgyr51IajvTgj7O0BU8hnifk5EyjqYsK3XUUlfqHumar0A5GPrleFSdXdZZFdqZt29nGncYVnyNtX3Pk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "European Region makes huge gains in NCD response, but needs faster progress", "text": "European Region makes huge gains in NCD response, but needs faster progress 19-10-2017 WHO/Malin Bring Hypertension management in primary health care is key to further reduce premature death among men. \nThe WHO European Region\u2019s response to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) has brought it on track to achieve some of the global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Global Monitoring Framework on NCDs and Health 2020 targets, notably reducing premature mortality and hypertension. These results are set out in the latest edition of the annual Monitoring noncommunicable disease commitments in Europe, launched at the WHO Global Conference on enhancing policy coherence to prevent and control NCDs in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 18\u201320 October. \nThe report shows that because of the rapid decline in premature deaths related to NCDs, the Region is likely to achieve SDG target 3.4 to reduce premature mortality from NCDs by one third by 2030 earlier than 2030, and will most probably exceed it significantly. \nThe report also highlights, however, that tobacco use and alcohol consumption are declining too slowly, and prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising rapidly, so the targets in those areas are unlikely to be achieved. Robust assessment of other selected targets \u2013 such as salt reduction, physical activity and access to essential medicines and technologies \u2013 is currently not possible owing to limited comparable data. Monitoring progress in policy implementation \nThe annual publication reports on the progress made in the WHO European Region in the fight against NCDs. Each edition focuses on a different topic: this year\u2019s theme is progress towards implementation of \u201cbest buys\u201d\u2013 highly effective, low-cost interventions \u2013 for the governance, surveillance and prevention of NCDs: the so-called \u201cprogress monitoring indicators\u201d. \nThe report demonstrates that implementation of progress monitoring indicators has improved significantly over the last two years in the Region. Between 2015 and 2017 the proportion of full implementation of indicators in countries increased on average from 34% to 42%; Bulgaria, Turkey and the United Kingdom have the highest share of fully implemented indicators in 2017. The proportion of at least partial implementation of indicators increased from 69% to 76%. \nThe effort to implement the most effective policy interventions, along with the major decline in mortality, opens an opportunity to accelerate achievement in all countries, irrespective of income levels. It allows countries with a higher burden to hasten their progress by applying good practices from the experience of other countries in the Region that overcame similar challenges decades ago. Inequalities in premature deaths \nThe evidence shows that large inequalities in premature mortality levels remain between and within countries, and reveals strong gender inequity: most premature deaths occur among men and are caused by cardiovascular diseases. \nRecognizing this, countries have identified a gender-sensitive approach: masculinities and hypertension management in primary health care are two important areas of action to further accelerate the decline in premature mortality. Preliminary analyses indicate that eliminating excess male and cardiovascular disease mortality would reduce absolute inequalities between countries by approximately 50% and contribute substantially to Health 2020 and SDG targets. \nDr Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO Regional Director for Europe, presenting the report about the Region\u2019s progress at the Global Conference, emphasized the need for Member States to continue making timely interventions. \u201cAlthough the WHO European Region as a whole has achieved substantial progress in reducing premature mortality from NCDs, there is no time for complacency. Governments need to act resolutely and implement the \u2018best buys\u2019 that have a rapid effect on mortality, such as controlling the price, availability and marketing of tobacco and alcohol.\u201d Gaps in surveillance of NCD risk factors \nSurveillance of NCD risk factors has improved significantly in the eastern part of the WHO European Region in the last two years, thanks to a generous grant from the Government of the Russian Federation and efforts by the WHO European Office for the Prevention and Control of NCDs in Moscow, Russian Federation. \nIt is nevertheless worrying that it is not currently possible definitively to assess indicators on physical activity, salt intake, drug therapy and counselling to prevent heart attacks and strokes, and availability of affordable basic technologies and essential medicines. Implementation of health examination surveys is also declining in the Region and even some of the wealthiest countries in the world are not currently conducting such surveys, leading to a lack of data for monitoring trends. Accelerating progress \nCountries have a lot more to do to achieve the health targets within the SDGs. \u201cIn order to accelerate progress we need to engage the whole of society in the implementation of multisectoral solutions, with participatory governance for health,\u201d said Dr Gauden Galea, Director of the Division of NCDs and Promoting Health through the Life-course at WHO/Europe. \u201cStrengthening health systems\u2019 response to NCDs is the key to achieving universal health coverage in the Region, but our work needs to go beyond that and tackle the root causes \u2013 the social, economic, environmental and commercial determinants of health. This will lead to improved health outcomes and reduced inequalities, and will contribute to the sustainability of universal health coverage in the Region.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zsuzsanna jakab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gauden galea", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "who european region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who european office for the prevention and control of ncds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "promoting health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who global conference", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "government of the russian federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russian federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uruguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montevideo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T18:15:57.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "447ff9952182af9f11526e0549573813b3a8f3c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPX00PQqoGcKh75uuro8gUfMZfJyG.xY3_ez63FJ1FeFpc-", "site_full": "www.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://who.int/feeds/entity/mediacentre/news/en/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "WHO news", "title": "7 000 newborns die every day, despite steady decrease in under-five mortality, new report says", "title_full": "7 000 newborns die every day, despite steady decrease in under-five mortality, new report says", "published": "2017-10-19T04:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.who.int/entity/maternal_child_adolescent/newborns/every-newborn/newborns-stillbirths-75percent-preventable.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1809, "comments": 0, "shares": 1809}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "447ff9952182af9f11526e0549573813b3a8f3c4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPX00PQqoGcKh75uuro8gUfMZfJyG.xY3_ez63FJ1FeFpc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T04:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "7 000 newborns die every day, despite steady decrease in under-five mortality, new report says", "text": "Contacts 7 000 newborns die every day, despite steady decrease in under-five mortality, new report says At current trends, 30 million newborns will die within first 28 days of life between 2017 and 2030 \nNews release \n19 October 2017 | NEW YORK/GENEVA/WASHINGTON DC - Every day in 2016, 15 000 children died before their fifth birthday, 46% of them \u2013 or 7 000 babies \u2013 died in the first 28 days of life, according to a new UN report. \nLevels and Trends in Child Mortality 2017 , reveals that although the number of children dying before the age of five is at a new low\u2013 5.6 million in 2016, compared with nearly 9.9 million in 2000 \u2013 the proportion of under-five deaths in the newborn period has increased from 41% to 46% during the same period. \n\u201cThe lives of 50 million children under-five have been saved since 2000, a testament to the serious commitment by governments and development partners to tackle preventable child deaths,\u201d said UNICEF Chief of Health, Stefan Swartling Peterson. \u201cBut unless we do more to stop babies from dying the day they are born, or days after their birth, this progress will remain incomplete. We have the knowledge and technologies that are required \u2013 we just need to take them where they are most needed.\u201d \nAt current trends, 60 million children will die before their fifth birthday between 2017 and 2030, half of them newborns, according to the report released by UNICEF, the World Health Organization, the World Bank and the Population Division of UNDESA which make up the Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (IGME). \nMost newborn deaths occurred in two regions: Southern Asia (39%) and sub-Saharan Africa (38%). Five countries accounted for half of all new-born deaths: India (24%), Pakistan (10%), Nigeria (9%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (4%) and Ethiopia (3%). \n\u201cTo achieve universal health coverage and ensure more newborns survive and thrive, we must serve marginalized families,\" says Dr Flavia Bustreo, Assistant Director-General for Family, Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health at WHO. \"To prevent illness, families require financial power, their voices to be heard and access to quality care. Improving quality of services and timely care during and after childbirth must be prioritized.\u201d \nThe report notes that many lives can be saved if global inequities are reduced. If all countries achieved the average mortality of high-income countries, 87% of under-five deaths could have been averted and almost 5 million lives could have been saved in 2016. \n\u201cIt is unconscionable that in 2017, pregnancy and child birth are still life-threatening conditions for women, and that 7 000 newborns die daily,\u201d said Tim Evans, Senior Director of Health Nutrition and Population at the World Bank Group. \u201cThe best measure of success for Universal Health Coverage is that every mother should not only be able to access health care easily, but that it should be quality, affordable care that will ensure a healthy and productive life for her children and family. We are committed to scaling up our financing to support country demand in this area, including through innovative mechanisms like the Global Financing Facility (GFF). \u201d \nPneumonia and diarrhea top the list of infectious diseases which claim the lives of millions of children under-five globally, accounting for 16% and 8% of deaths, respectively. Preterm birth complications and complications during labour or child birth were the causes of 30% of newborn deaths in 2016. In addition to the 5.6 million under-5 deaths, 2.6 million babies are stillborn each year, the majority of which could be prevented. \nEnding preventable child deaths can be achieved by improving access to skilled health-professionals during pregnancy and at the time of birth; lifesaving interventions, such as immunization, breastfeeding and inexpensive medicines; and increasing access to water and sanitation, that are currently beyond the reach of the world\u2019s poorest communities. \nFor the first time, mortality data for older children age 5 to 14 was included in the report, capturing other causes of death such as accidents and injuries. Approximately 1 million children aged 5 to 14 died in 2016. \n\u201cThis new report highlights the remarkable progress since 2000 in reducing mortality among children under age 5,\u201d said UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Mr. LIU Zhenmin. \u201cDespite this progress, large disparities in child survival still exist across regions and countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet many deaths at these ages are easily preventable through simple, cost-effective interventions administered before, during and immediately after birth. Reducing inequities and reaching the most vulnerable newborns, children and mothers are essential for achieving the SDG target on ending preventable childhood deaths and for ensuring that no one will be left behind.\u201d \nThe report also notes that: In sub-Saharan Africa, estimates show that 1 child in 36 dies in the first month, while in the world\u2019s high income countries, the ratio is 1 in 333. Unless the rate of progress improves, more than 60 countries will miss the UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to end preventable deaths of newborns by 2030 and half would not meet the target of 12 neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births by 2050. These countries account for about 80% of neonatal deaths in 2016. Notes to editors \nBroadcast quality images and b-roll available here . Download the report here .

Today, NCDs kill 40 million annually, more than any other cause of death. Of these deaths, 15 million occur prematurely among people aged 30-70 years, and 7 million in low- and low-middle income countries. \n\u201cIt is shocking to see the growing toll that diseases like cancer and diabetes are taking on the people who can least afford healthcare,\u201d said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Ad-hanom Ghebreyesus. \n\u201cGovernments must act on pledges to prevent these diseases in the first place, and to en-sure that people can obtain services to treat them,\u201d he added. \u201cFailure do to this imposes massive costs on individuals and communities. It totally contradicts global commitments to sustainable development.\u201d \nCo-conference organizer, President of Uruguay Dr Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez, said the Montevideo Roadmap represented a bold commitment by governments to intensify action to protect people from the harms of NCDs. \n\u201cGovernments should be fully committed to reducing the toll from NCDs, as the human and economic costs are far too great to ignore,\u201d said Dr V\u00e1zquez. \u201cThis places a heavy responsi-bility on governments to act. But by taking determined action to protect people from the main risks causing NCDs, we will make it easier for people to enjoy healthier lives, while supporting communities and countries to grow and develop strongly.\u201d \nThe Montevideo Roadmap highlights the need for coordinated and coherent action from all sectors and the whole of society, as many of the main drivers of ill health lie outside the control of health ministries, systems and professionals. Non-State actors, including civil so-ciety and industry, have important roles to play. \nIt also points out that the bulk of NCD deaths could have been prevented by action against tobacco, air pollution, unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol \u2013 as well as by improved disease detection and treatment. \nDr V\u00e1zquez added: \u201cBeating NCDs, and promoting health, are issues for everyone and across every area of government. Finance ministries save lives by taxing tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks, by cutting consumption and raising revenues to treat NCDs. Trade and investment agreements should not be used as an excuse to look the other way, wash our hands and not protect the public health of our citizens. Education ministries need to ensure our youth are well informed and taught how to make the healthy choice, that schools make available healthy food and provide opportunities for play and recreation.\u201d \nThe Montevideo Roadmap identifies a range of challenges, including: uneven and insufficient progress to reduce premature deaths from NCDs; influence of the private sector on governments to prioritize trade over public health goals; lack of high-level political leadership to ensure that health promotion and NCD pre-vention and control are part of all areas of government policy. \nDr Tedros, who last week announced the launch of a new WHO high-level commission on NCDs, added: \u201cThis conference is a critical opportunity to accelerate efforts to get ahead of noncommunicable diseases.

Thank you Dr V\u00e1zquez, \nThe Commission has an important part to play in ensuring the world meets targets set within the global sustainable development agenda, and in creating a safer, fairer and more prosperous future. It will be a guiding force in our preparations for next year\u2019s UN General Assembly High-level Meeting on NCDs. \nBecause if we don\u2019t overcome the scourge of the NCD epidemic, we will never be able to ensure that today\u2019s children have a safe, fair, and prosperous future. \nHow can we claim the world is secure when NCDs kill 15 million people every year in the prime of their lives? \nHow can we claim the world is fair when the healthiest food is out of reach of the poorest people, when companies put profit before health, and the cheapest food is the most hazardous? \nHow can we hope for a prosperous future when the lost productivity and treatment costs of NCDs impoverish families and hold nations back? \nFriends, the NCD epidemic is playing out like a horror story before our very eyes. Hundreds of millions of children are obese and overweight. \nMost of those children would not be obese if they could eat a healthy diet and be physically active. \nUnless we act now, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and lung diseases lie ahead. \nAnd it is shocking to see the growing toll that NCDs are taking on the people who can least afford healthcare. \nAnd in more and more countries of the world, the double burden of malnutrition \u2013 where overweight and underweight children live in the very same communities \u2013 is providing a stark example of the challenges we all here need to address, that being the provision of and access to healthy, nutritious food. \nBut this can only happen if there is committed and enlightened leadership from the highest levels of government. \nGovernments must act on pledges to prevent NCDs in the first place, and to ensure that people can obtain services to treat them. \nFailure to do this imposes massive costs on individuals and communities, and is in total opposition to global commitments to sustainable development. \nGovernments like Uruguay\u2019s are examples to the world, where the leadership from the very highest level strives to defend and advance the sovereign right of protecting the health of their people. \nThese are not empty words \u2013 not in the least. Uruguay places prevention and control of NCDs very seriously. \nYou just have to look at what it has done to implement strict tobacco controls to protect people in the first place from cancers, heart and lung diseases. \nIt is also among a group of countries to have ratified the protocol to control the illicit trade of tobacco, part of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. Just nine more countries need to ratify this protocol for it to come into effect, and I urge countries in this room to join with Uruguay and others to make this happen. \nBy doing so, they will provide the world with another powerful legal tool to protect people from the evils of tobacco. \nAt the same time, Uruguay has taken seriously the need to ensure its people have access to health care, very much in the spirit of universal health care \u2013 which is a core objective of mine to advance globally. \nI am honoured to be joined by President Mugabe, of Zimbabwe, a country that places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all. \nToday I am also honoured to announce that President Mugabe has agreed to serve as a goodwill ambassador on NCDs for Africa to influence his peers in his region to prioritize NCDs. \nParaguay is taking real action on cardiovascular diseases by reducing the amount of sodium bakers put into the bread they make and sell. And in Chile, world-leading front of package labelling that clearly identifies the levels of salt, sugar, fats and calories in foods, is helping people make well informed, healthy choices on what they buy and serve for themselves and their families. \nIn Morocco, I am glad our Royal Highness joins us, and the outstanding cancer programmes they are leading are very, very important. \nThis is responsible, health-minded governance at work. \nI am tremendously encouraged by the demonstration of leadership I have seen here today. \nWith appropriate investment both from domestic resources and greater foreign aid, we can reverse the tide. \nLadies and gentlemen, \nMany people hope for an opportunity to make a difference. You hold that opportunity in your hands. \nI call on us all to commit to three solemn goals: Let us commit to protecting all people from the products that threaten their health \u2013 this means implementing best buy interventions that control tobacco, cut back on unhealthy foods, promote physical activity and reduce access to alcohol, including taxation on alcohol, sugary drinks and tobacco. Let us regard the promotion of health, and the control of NCDs, as a responsibility for us all \u2013 not just health ministers and nurses \u2013 but all sectors of government and society. And let\u2019s lead this revolution for universal health and reducing premature death from NCDs from the highest levels of government. Political commitment is the rule of the game to mobilize all sectors. \nIt is within your power to improve the quality of the food people eat, the air they breathe, and the spaces where people can play and be active. \nThis Conference is a critical opportunity to jump-start our efforts to beat back the burden of noncommunicable diseases, and in doing so give countries a better chance for sustainable, prosperous futures. \nWe must be prepared to have some tough conversations, and to take brave action. And we must be prepared to do this now. \nThank you very much. Muchas gracias.

Laboratory testing at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) confirmed the cause of death as MVD. \nThe woman\u2019s brother had also died of similar symptoms three weeks earlier and was buried at a traditional funeral. He worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave inhabited by Rousettus bats, which are natural hosts of the Marburg virus. \nOne suspected and one probable case are being investigated and provided with medical care. An active search for people who may have been exposed to or infected by the virus is underway. \nThe Ministry of Health has sent a rapid response team to the area supported by staff from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFNET). \nWHO is providing medical supplies, guidance on safe and dignified burials, and has released USD 500 000 from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies to finance immediate response activities. \n\u201cWe are working with health authorities to rapidly implement response measures,\u201d said Ibrahima-Soce Fall, WHO Regional Emergency Director for the Africa region. \u201cUganda has previously managed Ebola and Marburg outbreaks but international support is urgently required to scale up the response as the overall risk of national and regional spread of this epidemic-prone disease is high.\u201d \nMarburg virus disease is a rare disease with a high mortality rate for which there is no specific treatment. Notes to editors \nMarburg virus disease (MVD) is a severe and highly fatal disease caused by the Marburg virus from the Filoviridae family; the same family as the Ebola virus. This virus is among the most virulent pathogens known to infect humans. The incubation period is 2-21 days, and symptom onset is sudden and marked by fever, chills, headache, and myalgia. Although MVD is rare, it can result in large outbreaks with high case fatality rates (CFR range from 23 to 90%). The disease is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats). \nIn Uganda, the following MVD outbreaks have been recently documented: 2007: 4 cases, including 2 deaths, in Ibanda District, Western Uganda 2008: 2 unrelated cases in travelers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda 2012: 15 cases, including 4 deaths, in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda 2014: 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda.

When it comes to NCDs and mental health, real change starts at the top. \nBut here in Montevideo we have achieved even more. Around 400 people have participated in rich, powerful sessions and workshops. The lessons we have learned from you will help guide our response going forward. \nI want to thank and congratulate you for sharing your wisdom and enthusiasm. \nThe Conference has offered a stark reminder of the urgent need for accelerated action to protect people today and tomorrow from NCDs and their causes, from tobacco to foods and drinks high in salt, sugar and trans fats. Action on improving mental health also took centre stage. \nParticipants have truly provided wisdom and insights that will enrich and inform our work going forward. I am satisfied, but the most important thing will be the action. \nAnd where are we going? \nNext year\u2019s 3rd United Nations High-level Meeting on NCDs and mental health in New York presents countries, WHO and the broader UN system a litmus test. \nThis effort will need the support of four key parties. \nFirst, a major feature of preparations for the UN NCDs meeting will be the work of the WHO High-level Commission on NCDs and Mental Health, that we are honoured to have President Vazquez co-chair with Dr Sania Nishtar, from Pakistan. \nTheir leadership of the Commission will be vital for the process WHO will lead to prepare for the UN meeting. \nTo President Vazquez and Dr Nishtar, we are grateful for your support, and very much looking forward to the results of your work. I felt humbled and honoured when you accepted my call, Mr President and Sania. Everybody has confidence in both of you. I count on you to make a big difference. \nSecond, we will be recruiting even more high-level champions and ambassadors from all regions of the world to help drive this process forward. We will need many champions and influencers to mobilize everybody. \nWe saw in 2011 that 34 heads of state and government participated in the first UN High-level Meeting on NCDs and mental health, but at the second meeting in 2014 there were none? It is this apparent leadership vacuum that we have focused on here in Montevideo, and which we are determined to fill next year in New York. \nThis way, we will go into 2018 in full force, demonstrating real gains and deciding on even more ambitious action going forward to protect people and safeguard society from NCDs and promote mental health. \nThird, we will benefit in this process from the commitment of the UN Secretary-General, a strong supporter of addressing NCDs and promoting the mental health and well-being of all people. I have been so impressed by his commitment to NCDs and mental health. \nBut, this whole effort leading up to New York in 2018 will rely heavily on the fourth part of this equation: the collaboration of civil society, academia, and philanthropies. Everybody is needed, we have to work together. I have met with civil society twice, and I was so encouraged by their level of engagement, and the concrete work we will do together going forward. No one should be left behind, everyone should be a player. \nThe networks, expertise and resources they bring is critical to our efforts to win the NCD fight and promote mental health is key. They can mobilize the whole society. \nI have learned much from several meetings I have had with you over these three days, and I look forward to collaborating with you on the process to prepare for the UN High-level meeting. \nI also must mention the private sector. We want to build bridges to new communities, but not at any cost. We see great potential for food and beverage makers, for example, to produce healthier options to the market. The solutions exist. But is there the will to change? I believe so. \nBecause without change, the epidemic of NCDs and improving mental health will continue to kill and maim millions needlessly, and hinder national development. Who wants that? \nThe death toll from cancer is equivalent to that of malaria, HIV and tuberculosis combined. Seventy percent of all deaths are due to NCDs, including 15 million dying between 30 and 70. More than 300 million people are living with depression, an increase of more than 18% from 2005 to 2015. \nThis is unacceptable. \nBut much of this is avoidable. It all starts from belief. \nThis is why the political declaration to be issued in New York next year needs to be a game changer. We must work differently. \nIt is clear we need to do more. Solutions are in our grasps and are readily implementable, but they are sitting on the shelves of many governments. \nBut with determined and committed leadership, all this can change. WHO will work side by side with all governments to help them embrace new ways of working. \nThe time to act is now. Our lives depend on it, as do those of our loved ones today, and the children of the future. \nAnd from what I have seen this week, I truly believe we can succeed. I see success and determination in the President\u2019s eyes, and in what he says. \nI commend you all for your participation in this Conference, your commitment to beating NCDs and improving mental health, and your valuable contributions to the advancement of global public health. \nThank you so much.

People can contract plague if they are in bitten by infected fleas, and develop the bubonic form of plague. Sometimes bubonic plague progresses to pneumonic plague, when the bacteria reaches the lungs. Person-to-person transmission is possible through the inhalation of infected respiratory droplets of a person who has pneumonic plague. Common antibiotics are efficient to cure plague, if they are delivered very early, because the course of the disease is usually rapid. Fact sheet on plague \nWhat are the types of plague and how do people become infected? \nThere are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic. All forms are treatable and curable if detected early enough. Bubonic plague is the most common form of plague globally and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus, Y. pestis, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a \"bubo\". At advanced stages of infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with puss. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare. Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called Pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague \u2013 or lung-based plague \u2013 is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated early, is fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms). \nWhat are the symptoms of plague? \nSymptoms typically include sudden onset fever, chills, head and body aches and weakness, vomiting and nausea. Painful and inflamed lymph nodes can also appear during bubonic plague. Symptoms of the pneumonic form appear quickly after infection (sometimes less than 24 hours), and include severe respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath and coughing, often with blood-tainted sputum. \nHow does pneumonic differ from bubonic plague? \nBubonic plague is the most common form of plague, but cannot be easily transmitted between people. Some people with bubonic plague will develop pneumonic plague, meaning the infection spreads to their lungs. Pneumonic plague can be transmitted between people through coughing. Bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30% to 60%, while the pneumonic form is fatal in the absence of treatment. Both types have good recovery rates if people are treated in time. \nHow can I protect myself from being infected with plague? \nTo prevent the spread of pneumonic plague, avoid close contact (under 2 meters) with someone who is coughing, and reduce time spent in crowded areas. To prevent bubonic plague, do not touch dead animals and wear insect repellent while in plague endemic areas. \nWhat should I do if I suspect I have plague? \nIn case of sudden symptoms of fever, chills, painful and inflamed lymph nodes, or shortness of breath with coughing and/or blood-tainted expectoration, people should immediately contact a medical provider for an evaluation. (Travellers who have left plague-affected areas should inform their health worker of their travel history to a plague-affected area.) People should avoid self-medication, including using antibiotics, unless they are diagnosed by a health worker. \nHow do you diagnose plague? \nHealth workers make an evaluation based on symptoms. Confirmation is based on laboratory testing from a sample of blood, sputum (fluid coughed up from inside the lungs) or pus from a bubo. \nHow can plague be treated? \nPlague can be treated with antibiotics, and recovery is common if treatment starts early. In areas where there is a plague outbreak, people with symptoms should go to a health centre for evaluation and treatment. Patients with pneumonic plague must be isolated and treated by trained medical staff wearing personal protective equipment. \nIf I am in an area with an active plague outbreak, should I wear a mask to protect myself? \nIt depends on your level of exposure to sick people. People living in communities where there is a plague can wear masks if they wish, but masks must be used and disposed of properly so they do not become a source of infection themselves. Masks may help to reduce the spread of pneumonic plague if they are used correctly by people who are sick (to reduce the spread of droplets), and by health care workers (to protect themselves). \nDo dead bodies spread plague? \nThe body of someone who has died after being infected with plague can infect people who are in close contact, such as those who are preparing the body for burial. The source of infection is the bacteria that are still present in body fluids.

Achieving this back in 2002 was a vital step forward for both the Region and the world on the path towards global eradication of this crippling disease. While this target is now closer than ever before, the threat from polioviruses still hangs over the Region, and maintaining and improving vaccination coverage is as important as ever. \nAccording to Professor David Salisbury, Chair of the Global Certification Commission and European Regional Certification Commission for Poliomyelitis Eradication, \u201cThe threat from polioviruses and the possibility of outbreaks remains very real. The Region must not ease up on either its actions or its political commitment to preserving its polio-free status.\u201d Polio immunization coverage often falling short \nAs long as polio circulates anywhere in the world, there is a risk of importation into the European Region. Vaccination coverage across the Region is generally high: some countries reach 98% coverage with the third dose of polio vaccine. Nevertheless, far too many Member States fall short of the 95% recommended coverage for all vaccines. Overall, 1 in 15 children in the Region is not receiving the full set of routine immunizations on time, and vaccination coverage overall has decreased in the last five years. \n\u201cAs we get closer to interrupting poliovirus transmission, countries will need to look carefully at their own circumstances and make assessments of their own risks and the appropriate actions,\u201d continues Professor Salisbury. \u201cWhere population immunity is low, wild virus or vaccine-derived virus transmission can happen.\u201d Next step: containment \nSuccess in the current phase of poliovirus eradication will require sustained and painstaking effort on the part of every Member State in the Region to minimize the risk of a polio outbreak. This includes ensuring high vaccination coverage to prevent possible circulation of the virus, high-quality disease surveillance to detect any cases and effective poliovirus containment. \nThe WHO European Region has the highest number of poliovirus research and manufacturing facilities in the world. Breaches in containment occurred in Belgium in 2014 and the Netherlands in 2017. Professor Salisbury explains: \u201cWe have had two instances of failures of containment in this Region. The Regional and Global Commissions will need to have the evidence required to allow us to continue to declare that the European Region is free from polio, and I trust that each country will make the efforts necessary to maintain this status.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "salisbury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david salisbury", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european regional certification commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global certification commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-24T10:17:48.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dccf1473c246130847ce311c8157de805560776d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4JKEuzQ67s4ZAMGGEbkctYtnCEdbl_Rq8Tk3aHNnHawF9SLtUWtHbTdkv0se9GXcTM5ebeYeqXcsm18_EW9KiA1OFR7LqBvDE2_PUfdYXLA_zePEfc9sRteeV1_17PJ3IR9OPv2MQ4m5NWevbhzDCil7iI9ikVfqPrgA_y4dSbwyo17VKCnec5WzLQDZP.baFNR5PN6udpW64pD5rVvn_2U66EimER9OgaOUrmRJbILXk-", "site_full": "www.euro.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/who/euro/rss/en", "site_categories": ["europe", "womens_health", "travel", "mens_health", "health", "herbs_for_health", "senor_health"], "section_title": "WHO/Europe | News feed", "title": "WHO supports polio vaccination campaign for nearly 200 000 Syrian children from Turkey", "title_full": "WHO supports polio vaccination campaign for nearly 200 000 Syrian children from Turkey", "published": "2017-10-24T09:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/image/0005/243581/who-europe-250.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dccf1473c246130847ce311c8157de805560776d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4JKEuzQ67s4ZAMGGEbkctYtnCEdbl_Rq8Tk3aHNnHawF9SLtUWtHbTdkv0se9GXcTM5ebeYeqXcsm18_EW9KiA1OFR7LqBvDE2_PUfdYXLA_zePEfc9sRteeV1_17PJ3IR9OPv2MQ4m5NWevbhzDCil7iI9ikVfqPrgA_y4dSbwyo17VKCnec5WzLQDZP.baFNR5PN6udpW64pD5rVvn_2U66EimER9OgaOUrmRJbILXk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-24T09:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "WHO supports polio vaccination campaign for nearly 200 000 Syrian children from Turkey", "text": "WHO supports polio vaccination campaign for nearly 200 000 Syrian children from Turkey 24-10-2017 Syria Immunization Group After receiving a polio vaccine, a Syrian child shows her vaccination certificate. \nIn response to a poliomyelitis (polio) outbreak in the eastern part of Syria in June 2017, WHO/Europe procured vaccines from its field office in Gaziantep, Turkey, for a vaccination campaign that reached nearly 200 000 children in north-western Syria. These cross-border activities are part of the UN\u2019s \u201cWhole of Syria\u201d approach to provide humanitarian assistance, including health services, to populations across the entire country. \nThe campaign, serving an area where conflict has disrupted regular medical services and immunization, used the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Given by injection, the IPV provides protection against all 3 strains of the disease: types 1, 2 and 3. Concern for spread of polio in Syria \nSince the start of the conflict in 2011, WHO and other health partners have carried out vaccination campaigns to stem the spread of infectious diseases such as polio. However, ongoing unrest has prevented programmes from operating on a regular basis. \nIn March 2017, more than 45 children in north-eastern Syria with symptoms of paralysis were diagnosed, and then laboratory-confirmed, with a vaccine-derived form of type 2 polio. This form of polio can emerge on rare occasions when immunization coverage is low. \nIn June 2017, WHO declared a polio outbreak in the eastern part of Syria. With conflict causing many families to flee from other areas of Syria to the north-west, health experts worried that polio could spread to the north-western area as well. Joint efforts to immunize children in north-western Syria \nTo address these challenges, in summer 2017 WHO/Europe and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) procured large quantities of the IPV. WHO/Europe\u2019s field office in Gaziantep, Turkey, and its partner the Syria Immunization Group (SIG) drew up a plan to use the IPV to protect hundreds of thousands of children against all forms of polio. \nPreparations for the campaign, implemented by SIG, involved extensive social mobilization in September 2017. Announcements from loudspeakers, mosques, portable 2-way radio systems, and via mobile phone messages reached huge numbers of Syrians. Posters, banners and cards inserted in packages of bakery bread alerted parents about where and when to bring their children to be vaccinated. \nThe IPV campaign started in areas of north-western Syria such as Idleb and western Aleppo in late September. Children between 2 and 23 months of age were vaccinated at fixed sites including schools, mosques and local council buildings. \n\u201cThis is a big success story,\u201d says Dr Moustapha Loutfy, a polio immunization specialist and consultant for the WHO office in Gaziantep. \u201cPolio is preventable.

WHO Virus in fewer places than ever \nIn 1988 when WHO became part of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, polio paralysed 10 children for life every 15 minutes, in nearly every country in the world.

Even within these countries, the virus is cornered into fewer districts than ever before, with just 15 districts infected since last World Polio Day, compared to 29 between October 2015 and 2016. \n\u201cWithin these vulnerable districts, more children than ever are being vaccinated,\u201d says Michel Zaffran, WHO Director, Polio Eradication. \u201cThese are hopeful signs that we are closer to reaching our goal, but there is more to be done.\u201d In Karachi, Pakistan, hard working vaccinators have won the hearts of communities as they vaccinate children against polio.

It requires committed, hardworking frontline healthcare workers to deliver doses of the oral polio vaccine to every single child, multiple times, so that they develop full immunity. \nIt relies on community leaders, parents, medical personnel, traditional healers and surveillance officers to search for symptoms of polio \u2013 most often a floppy arm or leg \u2013 and to make sure that the child is tested for the poliovirus. \nThese two tactics \u2013 reaching every last child and finding every last virus \u2013 are the pillars to success, giving the virus no place to hide. Once no children remain under-immunized, the virus will die out \u2013 and the world will be free of polio. Vaccinators in the Syrian Arab Republic deliver polio vaccines to children despite conflict. WHO WHO staff keep eyes peeled for virus \nWHO staff play an important role in polio eradication from district to global levels. Surveillance Officers keep their eyes peeled for the virus in over 70 countries. \nOne of these is Somalia, a polio-free country still alert to the threat of the virus. Poverty, internal displacement, conflict, and weak health systems mean that vaccination levels are low. If the virus were to return from an endemic country, immunity would not be high enough to stop another outbreak. \nThinking outside the box to overcome challenges, WHO Surveillance Officers in Somalia have trained a network of more than 500 parents, students, and community leaders to identify every case of acute flaccid paralysis so that if polio returns, it will be found \u2013 and stopped \u2013 immediately. \n\u201cSuccess in polio eradication depends on the close and strong collaboration between all partners including national and local governments, public and private health providers, civil society, religious institutions, and most importantly community members themselves,\u201d said Dr Eltayeb Elfakki, manager of polio eradication efforts for WHO Somalia. Polio eradication volunteers in Somalia walk through a camp for internally displaced persons. UNICEF Committed partners \nTo end polio, WHO works alongside Rotary International, UNICEF, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Rotary International had the vision of a polio-free world nearly three decades ago, and millions of Rotarians have committed over US$ 1.6 billion to the effort to date. \nThrough these efforts, more than 16 million people are walking today who would otherwise have been paralysed for life. More than 400 million children are vaccinated every year. In 2016, nearly 220 000 stool samples were tested for polio in WHO-accredited laboratories. Rotary Polio workers respond to other health needs \nPolio eradication paves the way to meet a plethora of other health needs. Since last year, polio workers have contributed to fighting cholera in Nigeria, responded to Meningitis outbreaks, strengthened routine immunization, and brought other broader benefits to communities. \n\u201cUntil polio is eradicated everywhere, every country remains vulnerable,\u201d says Zaffran. \u201cTo build a world where future generations are free of polio, much work remains, all of it needing continued political and financial support: we must find every last virus and vaccinate every last child.\u201d At a hard-to-reach health care camp in norther Nigeria, a health care assistant delivers routine vaccinations alongside polio vaccines.

The Ministry for Health officially declared the outbreak on 19 October 2017. \nAs of 24 October, five cases have been reported \u2013 one confirmed case, one probable case with an epidemiological link to the confirmed case, and three suspected cases including two health workers. \nChronologically, the first case-patient (probable case) reported was a male in his 30s, who worked as a game hunter and lived near a cave with a heavy presence of bats. On 20 September, he was admitted to a local health centre with high fever, vomiting and diarrhoea, and did not respond to antimalarial treatment. As his condition deteriorated, he was transferred to the referral hospital in the neighbouring district, where he died the same day. No samples were collected. He was given a traditional burial, which was attended by an estimated 200 people. \nThe sister (confirmed case) of the first case-patient nursed him and participated in the burial rituals. She became ill and was admitted to the same health centre on 5 October 2017 with fever and bleeding manifestations. She was subsequently transferred to the same referral hospital, where she died. She was given a traditional burial. Posthumous samples were collected and sent to the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). On 17 October, Marburg virus infection was confirmed at UVRI by RT-PCR and it was immediately notified to the Ministry of Health. \nThe third case-patient (suspected case) is the brother of the first two cases. He assisted in the transport of his sister to the hospital, and subsequently became symptomatic. He refused to be admitted to hospital, and returned to the community. His whereabouts are currently not known though there is an ongoing effort to find him. \nTwo health workers who were in contact with the confirmed case have developed symptoms consistent with Marburg virus disease and are under investigation (suspected cases). Laboratory results to rule out Marburg virus disease are pending. \nContact tracing and follow-up activities have been initiated. As of 23 October, 155 contacts including 66 who had contact with the first case and 89 who had contact with the second case-patient have been listed in the two affected districts, including 44 health care workers. The number of family and community contacts is still being investigated. Public health response The Ugandan Ministry of Health has rapidly responded to the outbreak, with support from WHO and partners. A rapid response field team was deployed to the two affected districts within 24 hours of the confirmation. To coordinate response activities, the National Task Force has convened, an Incident Management System (IMS) framework implemented with an Incident Manager appointed, a District Task Force has been established, and an emergency rapid response plan has been developed. Marburg virus disease response activities have been initiated, including surveillance, active case search, contact tracing and follow-up, as well as monitoring within affected communities and healthcare centres. Personal protective equipment has been deployed in the affected districts. Healthcare workers have been put on high alert and training sessions are planned, including a thorough review of infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols and capacity. An isolation facility is being prepared at the health centre and the hospital. Training of teams for safe and dignified burials has been conducted in affected districts. Community engagement and awareness campaigns are ongoing to reduce stigma, encourage reporting and early healthcare seeking behaviours, and acceptance of prevention measures. Information, education and communication materials and messages have been updated and are being produced. International partners and stakeholders have been engaged at country level, and internationally to provide support and technical assistance for the response as needed. WHO has deployed additional staff, and six viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) kits. Funding has been provided from the WHO Contingency Fund for Emergencies to ensure immediate support and scale up the response. WHO has alerted partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and is coordinating international support for the response. UNICEF is assisting with communication activities, and community engagement. M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has deployed to support setting up of treatment centres. WHO risk assessment \nMarburg virus disease is an emerging and highly virulent epidemic-prone disease associated with high case fatality rates (case fatality rate: 23\u201390%). Marburg virus disease outbreaks are rare. The virus is transmitted by direct contact with the blood, body fluids and tissues of infected persons or wild animals (e.g. monkeys and fruit bats). \nCandidate experimental treatments and vaccine are being reviewed for potential clinical trials. \nUganda has previous experience in managing recurring viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks including Marburg virus disease. Cases have historically been reported among miners and travellers who visited caves inhabited by bat colonies in Uganda. Marburg virus disease outbreaks have been documented during: 2007 \u2013 4 cases, including 2 deaths in Ibanda District, Western Uganda; 2008 \u2013 2 unrelated cases in travellers returning to the Netherlands and USA, respectively after visiting caves in Western Uganda; 2012 \u2013 15 cases, including 4 deaths in Ibanda and Kabale districts, Western Uganda; and 2014 \u2013 1 case in healthcare professional from Mpigi District, Central Uganda. \nAs of 24 October, five cases have been identified \u2013 one confirmed case, one probable case, and three suspected cases, and the outbreak remains localised. Ugandan health authorities have responded rapidly to this event, and measures are being rapidly implemented to control the outbreak. The high number of potential contacts in extended families, at healthcare facilities and surrounding traditional burial ceremonies is a challenge for the response. In addition, hospitalised cases were handled in general wards without strict infection control precautions, and one probable case refused to be hospitalised for a period of time. \nThe affected districts are in a rural, mountainous area located on the border with Kenya, about 300km northeast of Kampala on the northern slopes of Mount Elgon National Park. The Mount Elgon caves are a major tourist attraction, and are host to large colonies of cave-dwelling fruit bats, known to transmit the Marburg virus. The close proximity of the affected area to the Kenyan border, and cross-border movement between the affected district and Kenya and the potential transmission of the virus between colonies and to humans, increases the risk of cross-border spread. \nThese factors suggest a high risk at national and regional level, requiring an immediate, coordinated response with support from international partners. Tourism to Mount Elgon including the caves and surrounding areas should be noted and appropriate advice given and precautions taken. The risk associated with the event at the global level is low. WHO advice \nHuman-to-human transmission of Marburg virus is primarily associated with direct contact with blood and body fluids, and Marburg virus transmission associated with provision of health care has been reported when appropriate infection control measures have not been observed. \nHealth-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Marburg virus should apply infection control precautions to avoid any exposure to blood and body fluids, and unprotected contact with possibly contaminated environment. \nSurveillance activities, including contact tracing and active case search must be strengthened within all affected health zones. \nRaising awareness of the risk factors for Marburg infection and the protective measures individuals can take to reduce human exposure to the virus, are the key measures to reduce human infections and deaths. Key public health communication messages include: Reducing the risk of bat-to-human transmission arising from prolonged exposure to mines or caves inhabited by fruit bats colonies. During work or research activities or tourist visits in mines or caves inhabited by fruit bat colonies, people should wear gloves and other appropriate protective clothing (including masks). Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission in the community arising from direct or close contact with infected patients, particularly with their body fluids. Close physical contact with Marburg patients should be avoided. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing should be performed after visiting sick relatives in hospital, as well as after taking care of ill patients at home. Communities affected by Marburg should make efforts to ensure that the population is well informed, both about the nature of the disease itself to avoid community stigmatization, and encourage early presentation to treatment centres and other necessary outbreak containment measures, including burial of the dead. People who have died from Marburg should be promptly and safely buried. \nWHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on Uganda or the affected area based on the current information available on this event. Travellers to the Mount Elgon bat caves are advised to avoid exposure to bats and contact with non-human primates, and, to the extent possible, to wear gloves and protecting clothing, including masks . \nFor further information on Marburg virus disease and prevention and control measures is available in the WHO Marburg virus disease factsheet.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ugandan ministry of health", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry for health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uganda virus research institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "m\u00e9decins sans fronti\u00e8res", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unicef", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastern uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibanda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western uganda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpigi district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kween district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kabale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount elgon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kampala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibanda district", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount elgon national park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T07:47:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9ed9b3ae9a1409c0c7abbe03fc1ff8573007a7c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.WQbt3wAa1sB.syl_4_wVXLz9gTyjFNlnXtM5Izmsh6rdkg8gjBJQXKKGQqytAGV_A--", "site_full": "www.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://www.who.int/feeds/features/en/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "WHO features", "title": "Personal Stories from TB Survivors - My Journey fighting TB", "title_full": "Personal Stories from TB Survivors - My Journey fighting TB", "published": "2017-10-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.who.int/features/2017/SouthAftica_TB_Patient_Ingrid.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 87, "comments": 0, "shares": 87}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9ed9b3ae9a1409c0c7abbe03fc1ff8573007a7c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.WQbt3wAa1sB.syl_4_wVXLz9gTyjFNlnXtM5Izmsh6rdkg8gjBJQXKKGQqytAGV_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-26T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Personal Stories from TB Survivors - My Journey fighting TB", "text": "Personal Stories from TB Survivors - My Journey fighting TB \nOctober 2017 \nTuberculosis (TB) is the world's top infectious killer today. It is airborne and can affect any one of us. Over 5 000 women, men and children still die each day from TB. The social and economic impacts are devastating, including poverty, stigma and discrimination. This disease is curable and preventable, yet global actions and investments fall far short of those needed to end the global TB epidemic. \nThese are the stories of TB survivors from around the world on their journey fighting and beating TB. These survivors have experienced the side effects of TB medication, the difficulties of undergoing treatment, the mental and psychological impact, and want to raise awareness about this disease, including the importance of getting tested and adhering to treatment. \nTheir voices provide important perspectives and are a powerful tool for advocacy to accelerate the TB response and reach all affected people with prevention and care. Thandiwe, from Ethiopia \nMy name is Thandiwe, I am Ethiopian and I have a form of tuberculosis (TB) which is resistant to many different drugs \u2013 known as multidrug resistant TB, or MDR-TB. \nIt all started over six months ago. I was coughing a lot but I thought it was a simple case of flu. When I went to the hospital I was given antibiotics and syrup for the cough but after two weeks I had to go back because I didn\u2019t see any improvement. I was sent to a clinic where my sputum was tested for tuberculosis (TB) and shortly after doctors confirmed that I had TB. I was then referred to the local health centre where I was prescribed treatment. \nI believe that I contracted TB while working as ticket attendant on buses. Although we always try to keep the windows open, most passengers prefer to keep them closed because they worry about catching a cold, so buses are often poorly ventilated. \nI immediately started the TB treatment but after two months I developed side effects from the medication, such as severe weakness and a yellow tinge to the whites of the eyes. I was then sent to another clinic, where I was diagnosed with MDR-TB and placed on a different treatment. \nSince then I have received very good counselling, have learnt a lot about TB, and have begun to recover. I now know that TB is curable and preventable and I am hopeful for the future. After three months of treatment, the TB symptoms are gone, I only have some joint inflammation, but I was told to stay in the clinic until I am fully recovered. \nThe medical staff do a great job and I have excellent relationships with some of the personnel. I also made some friends among other TB patients; we always share and eat food together, and this has helped me emotionally. I also feel very lucky because as a civil servant I am covered by social protection and still receive my monthly salary even though I had to stop working six months ago. My salary will be covered for up to eight months.

Details of the case-patients \nOn 8 September 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient is a 67-year-old male from Hunan province who developed symptoms on 27 August 2017, and was admitted to hospital on 2 September due to severe pneumonia. He was reported to have had exposure to a live poultry market. \nOn 15 September 2017, the NHFPC reported one laboratory-confirmed human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China. The case-patient is a 54-year-old male from Liaoning province who developed symptoms on 3 September 2017, and was admitted to hospital on 11 September due to severe pneumonia. He was reported to have had occupational exposure to live poultry on a farm. \nTo date, a total of 1564 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported through IHR notification since early 2013. Public health response \nThe Chinese government assessment is that although newly infected human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported less frequently in recent weeks, it is still likely that sporadic cases will continue to occur in China taking into consideration the previous epidemic situation and recent patterns. Thus the government at national and local level continues to take preventive measures which include: Guiding the provinces to strengthen surveillance to ensure timely and effective detection and response to outbreaks. Guiding the provinces to make use of the present low-incidence period to review the prevention and control efforts taken, to facilitate implementation of long-term measures. Continuing to carry out risk communication and issue information notices to provide the public with guidance on self-protection. The agricultural sector has started to extensively vaccinate poultry with influenza A(H5) and A(H7) bivalent vaccines. The government has cautioned provinces that infection prevention and control cannot be treated lightly, and that they should stay alert to ensure that cases can be identified and managed in a timely and effective manner. WHO risk assessment \nAs seen in previous years, the number of weekly reported cases has decreased over the summer months. The number of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus and the geographical distribution in the fifth epidemic wave (i.e. onset since 1 October 2016) however has been greater than earlier waves. This suggests that the virus has spread, and emphasizes that further intensive surveillance and control measures in both the human and animal health sector remain crucial. \nMost human cases are exposed to avian influenza A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets. Since the virus continues to be detected in animals and environments, and live poultry vending continues, further human cases can be expected. Additional sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in provinces in China that have not yet reported human cases are also expected. Similarly, sporadic human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) detected in countries bordering China would not be unexpected. Although small clusters of cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus have been reported, including those involving patients in the same ward, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans. Therefore the likelihood of further community level spread is considered low. \nClose analysis of the epidemiological situation and further characterization of the most recent viruses are critical to assess associated risk and to adjust risk management measures in a timely manner. WHO advice \nWHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should, if possible, avoid poultry farms, contact with animals in live poultry markets, entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered, or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water, and follow good food safety and food hygiene practices. \nWHO does not advise special screening at points of entry, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions, with regard to this event. As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling in, or soon after returning from, an area where avian influenza is a concern. \nWHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns; ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR 2005; and continue national health preparedness actions.

This outbreak carries a moderate risk of spread to neighbouring Indian Ocean islands which is mitigated naturally by the short incubation period of pneumonic plague and the institution of exit screening measures at the airport and other major ports. For more information, see the latest situation report available from: Plague outbreak situation reports \nOn 10 October 2017, the Seychellois Ministry of Health notified WHO of a probable case of pneumonic plague. The probable case had visited Madagascar and returned to Seychelles on 6 October 2017. He developed acute respiratory symptoms on 9 October 2017 and presented to a local health centre. Based on a medical examination and reported history of recent travel to Madagascar, pneumonic plague infection was suspected and he was immediately referred to hospital where he was isolated and treated. \nOn 11 October 2017, a rapid diagnostic test was performed in country on a sputum sample and was weakly positive. From 9 through 11 October 2017, eight of his contacts developed mild symptoms and were isolated. Two other suspected cases, with no travel history to Madagascar and no established epidemiological link to the probable case, were also identified, isolated and placed on treatment. \nTen samples from suspected cases, including the probable case, were collected and sent to the Institut Pasteur Paris and all tested negative on 17 October 2017. \n13 October was the last day of monitoring of over 320 contact persons of the probable case, including 41 passengers and seven crew members from the flight, 12 close family members, and 18 staff and patients from the health centre visited by the probable case. All were provided a prophylactic course of antibiotics to prevent the disease. \nOverall, a total of 1223 contacts had been registered and were followed up. Of these, 833 contacts were given prophylactic antibiotics. Four suspected cases were identified from among the contacts and were put on treatment. \nFollowing the negative test results from Institut Pasteur Paris, all contacts who were isolated in the hospital, including the probable case, have been discharged. Antibiotic prophylaxis to the identified contacts, including monitoring of their health for symptom development has been discontinued. Public health response \nA Crisis Emergency Committee was established on 10 October 2017, to coordinate surveillance, contact tracing, case management, isolation and supplies. \nThe government has allocated funds to support the Committee interventions, enabling the setting up of a temporary isolation ward (whilst the existing ward is expanded), procurement of key supplies, contact tracing, and expansion of contact tracers\u2019 training. \nAir Seychelles flights to and from Madagascar had been stopped on 8 October 2017 to reduce likelihood of further importation of plague cases from Madagascar. WHO does not recommend restrictions on travel and trade. Since 10 October 2017, the Madagascar Ministry of Health, with support from WHO, has implemented exit screening at the international airport in Antananarivo to prevent international spread. Further support from WHO and partners is being planned to strengthen measures at points of entry to avoid international spread. \nWHO is advising the Government of Seychelles on the implementation of public health measures that are in line with the WHO International Health Regulations, such as enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contacts. WHO risk assessment \nPlague is a treatable infectious disease caused by Yersinia pestis , a zoonotic bacterium, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. Humans can be contaminated by the bite of infected fleas, through direct contact with infected materials or animals or by inhalation. \nThere are three main forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic, septicaemic and pneumonic. \nPneumonic plague is the most virulent form of plague and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets. Incubation period can be as short as 24 hours. Typically, the pneumonic form is caused by spread to the lungs from advanced bubonic plague. However, a person can acquire primary pneumonic from a symptomatic pneumonic plague patient by inhalation of infectious respiratory droplets. Plague is a preventable and treatable disease; however, untreated pneumonic plague is always fatal. \nPlague has never been reported in Seychelles, and at this stage, no plague cases have been confirmed in Seychelles. None of the previously reported probable or suspected cases have died. The Seychelles Government has established precautionary measures including, enhanced surveillance, isolation and treatment of suspect cases, contact tracing and prophylactic treatment of potential contacts, and screening at major ports of entry. Training of additional healthcare workers and volunteers in contact tracing was conducted on 17 October 2017 with WHO support. The risk of pneumonic plague in the Seychelles is considered as low and the overall regional and global risk levels as very low. WHO travel advice \nAt this stage, Seychelles has not confirmed any plague case on its territory, and there is a very low risk that international travellers would come into contact with plague in Seychelles. WHO advises against any restriction on travel or trade on Seychelles or Madagascar based on the available information. \nOn 3 October 2017, WHO published advice for international travellers in relation to the outbreak of plague in Madagascar, which should also be followed for travellers to Seychelles. Plague - Madagascar Information for international travellers \nOn 11 October, the Ministry of Health announced several measures against pneumonic plague in a press release on its website. As many of these measures significantly interfere with international traffic, on 13 October, the Ministry of Health informed WHO that it will provide the scientific evidence and public health rationale for these measures, as required by Article 43.3 of the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yersinia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seychellois ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crisis emergency committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institut pasteur paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madagascar ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "seychelles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madagascar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antananarivo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institut pasteur paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T03:35:35.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0d8d6c454e02d707b81ad3f56bcd6d42183e7bbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPXfsvpEwtnUnxB._YAUx6HMCMRCbjy.tAbPoswADGsqvM-", "site_full": "www.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://who.int/feeds/entity/mediacentre/news/en/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health"], "section_title": "WHO news", "title": "Substantial decline in global measles deaths, but disease still kills 90 000 per year", "title_full": "Substantial decline in global measles deaths, but disease still kills 90 000 per year", "published": "2017-10-26T21:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.who.int/features/2017/nigeria-measles-vaccination.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1260, "comments": 0, "shares": 1260}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 24}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0d8d6c454e02d707b81ad3f56bcd6d42183e7bbf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9youSRw9Lj.ZaCGaj3UtZ_A1.UAmvV5EfVWI7WnITN7WTnDyFhSuPXfsvpEwtnUnxB._YAUx6HMCMRCbjy.tAbPoswADGsqvM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-26T21:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Substantial decline in global measles deaths, but disease still kills 90 000 per year", "text": "Substantial decline in global measles deaths, but disease still kills 90 000 per year \nJoint news release CDC/GAVI/UNICEF/WHO \n26 October 2017 | GENEVA/NEW YORK/ATLANTA - In 2016, an estimated 90 000 people died from measles \u2013 an 84% drop from more than 550 000 deaths in 2000 \u2013 according to a new report published today by leading health organizations. This marks the first time global measles deaths have fallen below 100 000 per year. \n\u201cSaving an average of 1.3 million lives per year through measles vaccine is an incredible achievement and makes a world free of measles seem possible, even probable, in our lifetime,\u201d says Dr Robert Linkins, of the Measles and Rubella Initiative (MR&I) and Branch Chief of Accelerated Disease Control and Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. M&RI is a partnership formed in 2001 of the American Red Cross, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF, and WHO. \nSince 2000, an estimated 5.5 billion doses of measles-containing vaccines have been provided to children through routine immunization services and mass vaccination campaigns, saving an estimated 20.4 million lives. \n\u201cWe have seen a substantial drop in measles deaths for more than two decades, but now we must strive to reach zero measles cases,\u201d says Dr Jean-Marie Okwo-Bele, Director of WHO\u2019s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals. \u201cMeasles elimination will only be reached if measles vaccines reach every child, everywhere.\u201d \nThe world is still far from reaching regional measles elimination goals. Coverage with the first of two required doses of measles vaccine has stalled at approximately 85% since 2009, far short of the 95% coverage needed to stop measles infections, and coverage with the second dose, despite recent increases, was only 64% in 2016. \nFar too many children \u2013 20.8 million \u2013 are still missing their first measles vaccine dose. More than half of these unvaccinated children live in six countries: Nigeria (3.3 million), India (2.9 million), Pakistan (2.0 million), Indonesia (1.2 million), Ethiopia (0.9 million), and Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.7 million). Since measles is a highly contagious viral disease, large outbreaks continue to occur in these and other countries in Europe and North America, putting children at risk of severe health complications such as pneumonia, diarrhoea, encephalitis, blindness, and death. \nAgencies noted that progress in reaching measles elimination could be reversed when polio-funded resources supporting routine immunization services, measles and rubella vaccination campaigns, and surveillance, diminish and disappear following polio eradication. Countries with the greatest number of measles deaths rely most heavily on polio-funded resources and are at highest risk of reversing progress after polio eradication is achieved. \n\u201cThis remarkable drop in measles deaths is the culmination of years of hard work by health workers, governments, and development agencies to vaccinate millions of children in the world\u2019s poorest countries,\u201d said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, one of the world\u2019s largest supporters of measles immunization programmes. \u201cHowever we cannot afford to be complacent. Too many children are still missing out on lifesaving vaccines. To reach these children and set ourselves on a realistic road to measles elimination we need to dramatically improve routine immunization backed by strong health systems.\u201d Note to editors: \nMeasles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or other defined geographical area for more than 12 months, in the presence of a well-performing surveillance system. \nLaunched in 2001, the Measles & Rubella Initiative (M&RI) is led by the American Red Cross, the United Nations Foundation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UNICEF and the   M&RI is committed to ensuring that no child dies from measles or is born with congenital rubella syndrome, reducing measles deaths by 95% by 2015, and achieving measles and rubella elimination in at least five WHO regions by 2020. The WHO Region of the Americas has sustained measles elimination since 2002, and the European and Western Pacific regions have made significant elimination progress. All six WHO regions have established measles elimination goals. \nThe latest data is published in this week\u2019s WHO\u2019s Weekly Epidemiological Report and in CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

TB remains the top infectious killer in 2016. TB is also the main cause of deaths related to antimicrobial resistance and the leading killer of people with HIV. Progress in most countries is stalling and is not fast enough to reach global targets or close persistent gaps in TB care and prevention. \n\"While the world has committed to ending the TB epidemic by 2030, actions and investments don\u2019t match the political rhetoric. We need a dynamic, global, multisectoral approach.\" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. \"The good news is that we finally have two great opportunities to move forward: the first WHO Global Ministerial Conference to End TB in Moscow in 2017, followed by the first UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting on TB in 2018. These will build momentum, get different sectors engaged, and accelerate our efforts to make TB history.\" High global burden of disease and death in 2016 \nIn 2016, there were an estimated 10.4 million new TB cases worldwide, 10% of which were people living with HIV. Seven countries accounted for 64% of the total burden, with India bearing the brunt, followed by Indonesia, China, Philippines, Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa. An estimated 1.7 million people died from TB, including nearly 400 000 people who were co-infected with HIV. This is a drop by 4% compared to 2015. \nMultidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis and a health security threat. WHO estimates that there were 600 000 new cases with resistance to rifampicin \u2013 the most effective first-line drug, of which 490 000 had MDR-TB. Almost half of these cases were in India, China and the Russian Federation. \n\"The sheer numbers of deaths and suffering speak for themselves \u2013 we are not accelerating fast enough,\" said Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of the WHO Global TB Programme. \"Prompt action towards universal health coverage and social protection, as well as breakthroughs in research and innovations \u2013 will be critical to enable access to patient-centered care of the highest standards for all, especially the poorest, most disadvantaged people everywhere.\" Persistent gaps in care and financing \nTackling the epidemic requires action to close gaps in care and financing. It also requires progress in a particular subset of high TB burden countries (1) . Underreporting and underdiagnosis of TB cases continues to be a challenge, especially in countries with large unregulated private sectors and weak health systems. Of the estimated 10.4 million new cases, only 6.3 million were detected and officially notified in 2016, leaving a gap of 4.1 million. India, Indonesia and Nigeria accounted for almost half of this global gap. Only one in five MDR-TB cases were started on treatment. India and China accounted for 39% of the global gap. Treatment success remains low, at 54% globally. Of the almost half a million reported cases of HIV-associated TB, 15% were not on antiretroviral therapy (ART) as recommended by WHO. Most of the gaps related to HIV-associated TB were in the WHO African Region. TB preventive treatment is expanding in two priority risk groups - people living with HIV and children under 5 years. However, most people eligible for TB preventive treatment are not accessing it. For TB care and prevention, investments in low- and middle-income countries fall almost US$ 2.3 billion short of the US$ 9.2 billion needed in 2017. In addition, at least an extra US$ 1.2 billion per year is required to accelerate the development of new vaccines, diagnostics, and medicines. \n\"Shortfalls in TB funding are one of the main reasons why progress is not fast enough to be on track to reach the end TB targets,\" said Dr Katherine Floyd, Coordinator of WHO\u2019s Monitoring and Evaluation Unit at the Global TB Programme. \"We have a double challenge. More domestic funding is needed in middle-income countries, and more international donor support is needed to support low-income countries\". Political commitment and multisectoral action \nEnding the TB epidemic requires action beyond the health sector to address the risk factors and determinants of the disease. For the first time the Global TB Report presents results from a new multisectoral monitoring framework that identifies linkages with the TB epidemic across seven   Goals (SDGs). Analysis of the latest status of the indicators for the 30 high TB burden countries show that most will be challenged to reach SDG targets. \nIn order to increase multisectoral action, plans to galvanize all sectors and secure attention at the highest levels have resulted in the WHO Global Ministerial Conference on Ending TB in the   Era, in Moscow, 16\u201317 November 2017. This will be followed by the very first UN General Assembly High-Level Meeting on TB in 2018, which will seek commitment from heads of state. \n(1) The ten countries were: India, Indonesia, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China and the United Republic of Tanzania.   \nPru Smith WHO Department of Communications, Geneva Telephone: +41 22 791 4458 Mobile : +41 79 477 1744 Email: \nWHO Global TB Programme, Washington, DC Communications and Technical Officer Mobile : +41 79 477 0435 Email:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T02:19:35.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "141415af161311f649f79cd63b650390c97a737d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4JKEuzQ67s4ZAMGGEbkctYtqRrsLXlw9wvOZ4junXsjhMBMNDj0TorznpWg5MmEZmwQynBO.tAcvGYM5IX8k_vaKhtRa5WSn2v9YBv0fcaiC3pEcCuNS71LGAEuY2NDbXbWPwB1Tih.6fzgeQQ1XjLPHAxM0riMh_5", "site_full": "www.euro.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/who/euro/rss/en", "site_categories": ["europe", "womens_health", "travel", "mens_health", "health", "herbs_for_health", "senor_health"], "section_title": "WHO/Europe | News feed", "title": "Turkey withdraws plans to loosen tobacco control laws", "title_full": "Turkey withdraws plans to loosen tobacco control laws", "published": "2017-10-31T16:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/image/0005/243581/who-europe-250.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 76, "comments": 0, "shares": 76}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "141415af161311f649f79cd63b650390c97a737d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4JKEuzQ67s4ZAMGGEbkctYtqRrsLXlw9wvOZ4junXsjhMBMNDj0TorznpWg5MmEZmwQynBO.tAcvGYM5IX8k_vaKhtRa5WSn2v9YBv0fcaiC3pEcCuNS71LGAEuY2NDbXbWPwB1Tih.6fzgeQQ1XjLPHAxM0riMh_5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-31T16:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Turkey withdraws plans to loosen tobacco control laws", "text": "Turkey withdraws plans to loosen tobacco control laws 31-10-2017 WHO WHO and health academics standing firm against the tobacco industry\u2019s proposed new strategy during a press conference in Ankara, Turkey. \nIn a public statement made at the Turkish Grand National Assembly Commission on Planning and Budget on 17 October 2017, Minister of Finance Naci A\u011fbal stated that plans to allow the importation and production of heat-not-burn tobacco products and electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) in Turkey were withdrawn. He confirmed that these products would not be sold or produced in the country. \nThe announcement followed a press conference and strong public reaction to the threats posed by the tobacco industry\u2019s proposals to begin importing and producing heat-not-burn and ENDS products in the country. The press conference, held on 17 October in Ankara, Turkey, saw WHO and prominent academics and health specialists jointly voicing their condemnation of the tobacco industry\u2019s proposed new strategy. WHO, academia and health specialists respond to tobacco industry\u2019s arguments \nThe press conference was called as a reaction to an announcement made earlier by tobacco company Philip Morris International stating its intentions to support the establishment of a new entity, the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World. As part of this initiative, the tobacco industry planned to introduce a new range of harmful products. \nThese heat-not-burn and ENDS products pose serious challenges to public health due to their high levels of nicotine. Electronic cigarettes, one of the most popular of such products, are devices that do not burn or use tobacco leaves but instead vaporize a solution that users inhale. The consumption of these products in recent years has increased at an alarming rate among youth and young adults, raising the probabilities of higher numbers of cigarette smokers in the future. \nWarning against the risks of loosening tobacco control laws, WHO Representative to Turkey Dr Pavel Ursu stressed the importance of the political commitments made under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). Making reference to the intended amendment to the Law on the Organization and Duties of the Tobacco and Alcohol Market Regulatory Authority, he stated: \u201cWe would like to stress that the proposed amendments clearly contravene the global consensus \u2026 For the continuation of the success of Turkey in tobacco control, we need a firm commitment by all stakeholders rejecting the recent influence of the tobacco industry.\u201d \nDuring the press conference, health specialists and academics joined WHO in its stand against the tobacco industry. Professor Mustafa Necmi \u0130lhan, Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Gazi University, stressed the importance of having all stakeholders play a part in a strong response against the tobacco industry: \u201cTo be able to struggle with these efforts, the Government should work hand-in-hand with academia and nongovernmental organizations while our national policies are formed and shaped,\u201d he said. \nProfessor Hilal \u00d6zcebe, Public Health Specialist and professor at Hacettepe University, remarked on the efforts of the tobacco industry to hide the real effects that these new products have on health: \u201cThe tobacco industry states that electronic products have fewer negative effects on public health but this is a totally false argument.\u201d She explained that \u201celectronic devices have the same level of nicotine as widely used products [such as cigarettes], causing similar vascular disorders and cardiovascular diseases\u201d. \nMr \u0130dris Baykan, Head of the Ankara Branch of the Turkish Green Crescent Society, highlighted the remarkable efforts made by Turkey in the last decade to implement the WHO FCTC. He stressed that such progress was not achieved with the support of tobacco industry-funded foundations, but rather \u201cby raising public awareness, with the support of the Turkish Government, civil society and organizations such as Green Crescent\u201d. Turkey among the countries leading global tobacco control efforts \nThe tobacco epidemic is one of the largest public health threats the world has ever faced, killing more than 7 million people a year worldwide. More than 6 million of those deaths are the result of direct tobacco use while around 890 000 are the result of non-smokers being exposed to second-hand smoke. In order to fight this global epidemic, the WHO FCTC came into force in February 2005. \nIn 2004, Turkey became one of the first countries in the world to ratify the WHO FCTC. Following this ratification, Turkey made great achievements in the implementation of the treaty by introducing smoke-free environments in restaurants, bars and cafes, gradually increasing taxes on tobacco products and including graphic health warnings on cigarette packages. This sustained political commitment to tobacco control has turned Turkey into a global leader in tobacco control and an important example of WHO FCTC implementation.

A record 3 million people were able to obtain treatment for hepatitis C over the past two years, and 2.8 million more people embarked on lifelong treatment for hepatitis B in 2016. \n\"We have seen a nearly 5-fold increase in the number of countries developing national plans to eliminate life-threatening viral hepatitis over the last 5 years,\" says Dr Gottfried Hirnschall, Director of WHO's Department of HIV and Global Hepatitis Programme. \"These results bring hope that the elimination of hepatitis can and will become a reality.\" \nHosted by the Government of Brazil, the World Hepatitis Summit 2017 is being co-organized by WHO and the World Hepatitis Alliance. The Summit aims to encourage more countries to take decisive action to tackle hepatitis, which still causes more than 1.3 million deaths every year and affects more than 325 million people. \n\"We cannot lose sight of the fact that last year 194 governments committed to eliminating viral hepatitis by 2030. For sure we are still a long way from this goal but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s some unattainable dream. It\u2019s eminently achievable. It just requires immediate action,\" says Charles Gore, President of World Hepatitis Alliance. \"The World Hepatitis Summit 2017 is all about how to turn WHO\u2019s global strategy into concrete actions and inspire people to leave with a \u2018can do\u2019 attitude.\" \n\"Brazil is honored to host the World Hepatitis Summit 2017 \u2013 and welcomes this extraordinary team of experts, researchers, managers and civil society representatives to discuss the global health problem posed by viral hepatitis,\" says Dr Adele Schwartz Benzaken, Director of the Brazilian Ministry of Health\u2019s Department of Surveillance, Prevention and Control of STIs, HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis.\"Brazil is committed to taking recent advances in its response to hepatitis forward \u2013 on the road to elimination.\" Progress in treatment and cure \nMany countries are demonstrating strong political leadership, facilitating dramatic price reductions in hepatitis medicines, including through the use of generic medicines\u2014which allow better access for more people within a short time. \nIn 2016, 1.76 million people were newly treated for hepatitis C , a significant increase on the 1.1 million people who were treated in 2015. The 2.8 million additional people starting lifelong treatment for hepatitis B in 2016 was a marked increase from the 1.7 million people starting it in 2015. But these milestones represent only initial steps \u2013 access to treatment must be increased globally if the 80% treatment target is to be reached by 2030. \nHowever, funding remains a major constraint: most countries lack adequate financial resources to fund key hepatitis services. Diagnosis challenge \nTo achieve rapid scale-up of treatment, countries need urgently to increase uptake of testing and diagnosis for hepatitis B and C. As of 2015, an estimated 1 in 10 people living with hepatitis B, and 1 in 5 people living with hepatitis C, were aware of their infection. Countries need to improve policies, and programmes to increase awareness and subsequent diagnosis. Prevention gaps \nCountries need to provide a full range of hepatitis prevention services that are accessible to different population groups, particularly those at greater risk. \nLargely due to increases in the uptake of hepatitis B vaccine, hepatitis B infection rates in children under 5 fell to 1.3% in 2015, from 4.7% in the pre-vaccine era. \nHowever, the delivery of other prevention services, such as birth-dose vaccination for hepatitis B, harm reduction services for people who inject drugs, and infection control in many health services, remains low. This has led to continuing rates of new infections, including 1.75 million new hepatitis C cases every year. Need for innovation \nInnovation in many aspects of the hepatitis response must continue. New tools required include a functional cure for hepatitis B infection and the development of more effective point-of-care diagnostic tools for both hepatitis B and C. \n\"We cannot meet the ambitious hepatitis elimination targets without innovation in prevention interventions and approaches, and implementing them to scale,\u201d said Dr Ren Minghui Assistant Director-General for Communicable Diseases, WHO. \u201cThe great successes of hepatitis B vaccination programmes in many countries need to be replicated and sustained globally in the context of moving forward to universal health coverage.\" Implementation of elimination strategy \nThe World Hepatitis Summit 2017 will be attended by over 900 delegates from more than 100 countries, including Ministers of Health, national programme managers, and representatives from organizations of people affected by viral hepatitis. The Summit will review progress and renew commitments by global partners to achieve the elimination of viral hepatitis by 2030 \u2013 a target reflected in WHO's elimination strategy and the UN   Goals.   \nTunga Namjilsuren Mobile: +41 79 203 3176 Email:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ren minghui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tunga namjilsuren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gottfried hirnschall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adele schwartz benzaken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles gore", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministers of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global hepatitis programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of health\u2019s department of surveillance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world hepatitis alliance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "s\u00e3o paulo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T17:41:30.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f13621f4dbb7e0c800e125b0f57158a503d71ed4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4Jur2eNdWxOHFefg5luUBOTELkg9.iCUmxTaMer0urnanfzWIK0XAR4WNQ54WRIte9dGaDXbfZM6_WU._HKnWpfYIQh3BkTg7v", "site_full": "www.euro.who.int", "site": "who.int", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/who/euro/rss/en", "site_categories": ["europe", "womens_health", "travel", "mens_health", "health", "herbs_for_health", "senor_health"], "section_title": "WHO/Europe | News feed", "title": "The eHealth journey in Latvia", "title_full": "The eHealth journey in Latvia", "published": "2017-11-02T11:41:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "CH", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/image/0005/243581/who-europe-250.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2410, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f13621f4dbb7e0c800e125b0f57158a503d71ed4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_XIiaa2Yn9u9ynqS6zyz4Jur2eNdWxOHFefg5luUBOTELkg9.iCUmxTaMer0urnanfzWIK0XAR4WNQ54WRIte9dGaDXbfZM6_WU._HKnWpfYIQh3BkTg7v", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-11-02T11:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "The eHealth journey in Latvia", "text": "The eHealth journey in Latvia 02-11-2017 \nIn a journey that started over a decade ago, the Ministry of Health of Latvia demonstrated its commitment to achieving universal health coverage by creating a national programme of electronic health (eHealth). This effort is in line with the 2013 World Health Assembly resolution on eHealth standardization and interoperability. As part of an ambitious, long-term national health reform agenda, the eHealth programme has been a key element of ensuring that Latvian people receive the right care in the right place and at the right time. \nIn the past, concerns such as data privacy and confidentiality were a barrier to converting Latvia\u2019s fragmented, paper-based system into a modern, efficient and accessible eHealth system. Now, several comprehensive improvements, aided by technical support from the WHO Country Office in Latvia, have helped the eHealth system reach a high level of reliability and acceptance. \nFrom January 2018, use of the electronic platform will become mandatory for all health-care providers for issuing a number of medical documents such as prescriptions and sick-leave certificates. Efforts by the Government are also underway to incorporate a range of additional eHealth services such as electronic referrals. Collaboration with WHO key to successful eHealth adoption \nDr Anda \u010cak\u0161a, Minister of Health of Latvia, highlights the multiple advantages of the new system: \u201cIf we are speaking about a transparent, clear and traceable health-care system, which is convenient both for patient and doctor and in which information doesn\u2019t disappear but where the same information is accessible to different specialists \u2013 then eHealth offers all of that.\u201d \nShe says the technical assistance from WHO was vital to helping Latvia implement the system it has in place today. At the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO/Europe convened a national eHealth forum to support the country\u2019s transition to the use of the eHealth services platform. \n\u201cWHO technical assistance was requested at a very critical time for the Ministry of Health,\u201d says Dr Aiga R\u016br\u0101ne, Head of the WHO Country Office in Latvia. \u201cThis engagement not only helped dispel some misconceptions about the implementation, but also directly led to a positive change in attitudes for adopting eHealth.\u201d \nThe team of WHO and national experts concluded that the eHealth system in Latvia is ready for public use. It has every capability to ensure health-care service and payment transparency, to improve access to health-care services and to encourage patients\u2019 participation in their health care. A bright future for eHealth in Latvia \nHealth-care providers already using the eHealth system note some of its key benefits: it allows them to track a patient\u2019s medical history, including past examinations and tests, and helps avoid duplication. \u201cIt is very important, both in terms of practicality and patient safety,\u201d says Dr Ren\u0101te Smite, Chief Doctor at the Children\u2019s Clinical University Hospital in Riga. \nAll hospitals, nearly all pharmacies and half of general practitioners in Latvia have now established contracts to implement the eHealth system. It appears that the country will be ready for the compulsory adoption of eHealth in 2018 and that the future of eHealth in Latvia \u2013 supported by the WHO Country Office \u2013 is very bright.
