Einstein did not believe they could ever be measured. \nWeiss also said that the win affirmed the importance of the scientific process at a worrying time \"when rational reasoning associated with evidence isn't universally accepted.\" \n___ \n1:30 p.m. \nKip Thorne, one of three scientists sharing this year's Nobel Physics Prize for their discovery in gravitational waves, says the award is \"a win for the human race as a whole.\" \n\"These gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe - not for the next few years or decades but for the next few centuries,\" Thorne, of the California Institute of Technology, told The Associated Press. \nThorne shared the award with Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish, also of Caltech, for their observation of faint ripples flying through the universe called gravitational waves. The waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but Einstein was convinced they could never be measured. \nThorne said he was a \"little disappointed\" that thousands other scientists who have worked on the project did not get to share the prize, adding: \"Nevertheless I'm tremendously pleased to accept this\" on their behalf. \n___ \n1:20 p.m. \nClifford Will, a gravitational-wave expert at the University of Florida, says it was \"fabulous\" that the Nobel Physics Prize went to three scientists for their discovery in gravitational waves. \nObserving gravitational waves is important because they offer a new way to observe the universe, beyond light and particles, Will said. When two black holes merge, for example, they don't give off observable light. But with gravitational waves, \"you can see these events.\" Or rather, hear them, since they are detected as if they were chirping sounds. \nWill said that in the merger of the two black holes that triggered the prize-winning detection, the event gave off more energy in the last two-tenths of a second than all the stars in the visible universe combined emitted during the same period. But on Earth, that was \"very difficult to detect\" and required extremely precise instrumentation, he said. \n\"There's a very loud future for gravitational waves,\" he said. The next detections might come from the merger of two ultra-dense neutron stars, or a neutron star colliding with a black hole, he said. \n___ \n1 p.m. \nBarry Barish, one of the scientists sharing this year's Nobel Physics Prize, said he had set an alarm in anticipation of a call from the Nobel team \u2014 though when it did come it beat his alarm. \nBarish, speaking by phone from Santa Monica, California, said he and his colleagues knew there was a good chance they would get recognized by the Nobel team. The call came at 2:41 a.m., beating his own alarm by 4 minutes. \n\"There was some anticipation. But, the Swedish Academy is so secretive,\" he told The Associated Press. \nHe added Tuesday's announcement was \"a win for Einstein, and a very big one.\" \nBarish shared the award with Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology for their discoveries in faint ripples flying through the universe called gravitational waves. The waves were first predicted by Albert Einstein a century ago, but Einstein was convinced they could never be measured. \n___ \n11:55 a.m. \nThe Nobel Physics Prize 2017 has been awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in gravitational waves. \nThe three are Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of the California Institute of Technology. \nThe German-born Weiss was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount and Thorne and Barish will split the other half. \n___ \n7:10 a.m. \nThe Nobel Physics Prize honors big discoveries involving materials often too small to be seen by the naked eye. \nThe 2017 prize being announced Tuesday by Sweden's Royal Academy of Sciences comes with 9 million kronor ($1.1 million). For the past 25 years, the prize has been shared among multiple winners. \nThe 2016 prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids. In 2014, a Japanese and a Canadian shared the physics prize for studies that proved that the elementary particles called neutrinos have mass. \nThis year's Nobel medicine prize went Monday to three Americans studying circadian rhythms \u2014 better known as body clocks: Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael W. Young. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Less common. \nThe last time 760 Spruce was for sale, the year was 1968. Now, it\u2019s for sale again, at $1.2 million. \nHistory \nDr. John and Eunice Jackson moved to Berkeley from Philadelphia in 1957. Eleven years later, with a growing family, they purchased 760 Spruce. The four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 2,635-square-foot home suited them so well that they never left. Eunice appears in the gallery above, looking very much like the proud owner she is. \nListing agent Deidre Joyner says, \u201cAccording to the Jacksons, this modernist home was built in 1955 by a local architect, custom built for his mother and her caretaker with a no-step entry.\u201d \nOn this entry level are three bedrooms (one of which is the master), the living room with fireplace, dining room, eat-in kitchen, laundry, and access to the patio and yard. \nDownstairs is another legal bedroom and bathroom, but, with its fireplace and added bar, this lower level worked better as a recreation room for the Jacksons, the perfect place for teenagers to \u201cspin their vinyl and dance.\u201d \nBecause of its separate access, potential exists for conversion of this rec room\u2013fourth bedroom into a rental \u2014 perhaps a draw for today\u2019s buyer. \nPreservation \nAmong original mid-century details in this home are the hardwood floor and vaulted wood-planked ceilings. The Jacksons left the original wood unpainted. The wall of glass in the living room and dining area is also a classic hallmark of modernist design. \nThe kitchen is particularly vintage. Here, the side-by-side GE ovens and sconces are original. Again, the cabinetry\u2013also original\u2013 is unpainted, and the Jacksons kept the built-in desk and mixer stand. The light fixture above the eat-in kitchen is a George Nelson Bubble Lamp; so, not an original item, but appropriately retro. \nThe property \nAt 4,500 square feet, this property runs from Spruce to Montrose. On Montrose is access to the garage. This home joins many in this area of architectural and historical interest. It\u2019s also close to many of Berkeley\u2019s best parks and natural areas. \nMystery Architect \nWho was this \u201clocal architect\u201d who built the home for his mother so long ago? The city of Berkeley did not have records. Calls to the Berkeley Historical Society were not returned by the time this blog post went live. But whoever it was, he built something timeless enough that it still looks modern and inviting today. \nAnna Marie Erwert writes from both the renter and new buyer perspective, having (finally) achieved both statuses.

(AP) \u2014 R. Doorn Tower was just out of high school and studying at the General Motors Institute in Michigan when he was drafted into the Army. It was 1944, and he'd just turned 18. \nWhile he was overseas, Tower traipsed across Europe, fighting out of foxholes and bunkering in a forest for a long, cold winter. Through the rest of his life, he would never forget his time in the military. \nDecades later, one of his children, Kristen Snoddy, a lecturer at Indiana University Kokomo, is putting her father's war experience to use in the classroom. \nSnoddy is using a memoir Tower wrote before his death in 2003 to enhance her class World War II film and literature class, which she will teach for the second time this spring. Snoddy is taking a sabbatical this semester to work on the class, and she's using her father's history to do it. \n\"The purpose of the course is that we have names that are synonymous with WWII - generals, of course Adolf Hitler - but we really try to stress the impact and the contributions of the everyday person,\" Snoddy said. \"My dad is a good example of that. I can use his story to help students understand the sacrifices that people like he made.\" LATEST NEWS VIDEOS You know you are from Oakland if... sfgate Security increase at Bay Area events this weekend KTVU You know you are from Oakland if... sfgate An Asteroid Will Give Earth A Close Shave On October 12 GeoBeats Pat Robertson Links Vegas Shooting To 'Profound Disrespect' For Trump GeoBeats Judge OKs OPD decision to not discipline commanders in sexual exploitation case KTVU Novato woman missing in Las Vegas Fox5Atlanta Bay Area residents recount Las Vegas shooting FoxM9NJ Study: Life On Earth Began After Meteorites Landed In Warm Ponds GeoBeats Report: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's Charter Flights Under Investigation GeoBeats \nThe memoir, titled \"What did you do in the war, Grandpa?\" is geared toward a young audience. It explains what his experience was like in a way that won't traumatize readers, Snoddy said. \n\"So he wrote it with the idea that it was for the grandchildren,\" Snoddy said. \"There's a sense of honesty there, but he doesn't go into a lot of detail. You would grow up awfully fast. Think about him just being an 18 year old kid and what he went through.\" \nUsing his memoir, Snoddy went on two European trips this year, once over the summer with another professor and once this fall with her sister, tracking her father's movements through Europe and learning more about what he did during the war. She visited Normandy, where he landed a few months after D-Day, and several small towns he mentions in his memoir. \n\"It was extremely moving to be where our father was,\" Snoddy said. \"It was a blessing because it allowed (us) to actually stand some places that he stood and just appreciate what that meant.\" \nWhile he was away, Tower sent countless letters to his girlfriend, Joyce Marie. He initially wanted to propose before going overseas, but she told him to return home and then propose. He returned on February 9, 1946, and he proposed on Valentine's Day. \nSeveral years later, the two sat down and re-read all the letters they'd sent each other while he was overseas. Then, they tossed them into a fire. \n\"I think they thought they were personal and a time in their lives that was certainly significant, but they felt in some ways they were putting that to rest,\" Snoddy said. \"I certainly respect that. In some ways, it would have been a wonderful keepsake to have those letters, but I respect their wish to keep them between themselves.\" \nSnoddy hopes to connect with a publisher to turn her father's memoir into some sort of non-fiction young adult book, either a biography or possibly a graphic novel. She also hopes to upload her father's story to the Library of Congress Veterans History Project, which allows people to upload information related to veterans. \nShe said she's also looking forward to presenting her updated course next semester, and she said students have seemed especially interested in it. \n\"Sometimes I think this generation, the grandchildren of these veterans, there's some criticism that they don't care enough about history, but I saw the opposite,\" Snoddy said. \"This is a war that their grandparents fought in, and they've heard bits and pieces about it but they want to know more about it. So that has motivated me to obviously whenever I can to increase my knowledge, ability to teach the course.\" \n___ ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:56:58.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c9e2b0ef93e3dbe75b218188b1d4404ef7dcbe62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsVy8iyHywapVJPHQY1hq6SEnpSoBIlboJ.CSg2dljfX3CdVZSX3MgzF5egY.Yj1OKra2VPHwrZU52BFVSr9.oJERmBmDSVfRNmw--", "site_full": "www.sfgate.com", "site": "sfgate.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "social"], "section_title": "", "title": "TX Brownsville TX Zone Forecast - SFGate", "title_full": "TX Brownsville TX Zone Forecast - SFGate", "published": "2017-10-03T12:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.246, "main_image": "http://www.sfgate.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 943, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c9e2b0ef93e3dbe75b218188b1d4404ef7dcbe62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsVy8iyHywapVJPHQY1hq6SEnpSoBIlboJ.CSg2dljfX3CdVZSX3MgzF5egY.Yj1OKra2VPHwrZU52BFVSr9.oJERmBmDSVfRNmw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T12:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "TX Brownsville TX Zone Forecast - SFGate", "text": "TX Brownsville TX Zone Forecast Published 2:05 am, Tuesday, October 3, 2017 \nTX Brownsville TX Zone Forecast for Monday, October 2, 2017 \n\nZone Forecasts for Deep South Texas \nNational Weather Service Brownsville TX \n356 AM CDT Tue Oct 3 2017 \nTXZ253-040300- \nIncluding the cities of McAllen, Edinburg, Pharr, Mission, \nand Weslaco \n356 AM CDT Tue Oct 3 2017 \n.TODAY...Partly sunny with chance of showers and thunderstorms in \nthe morning, then showers and thunderstorms likely in the \nafternoon.

(AP) \u2014 An immigration judge has vacated the deportation order for a woman who sought sanctuary at a North Carolina church. \nThe Greensboro News & Record reports Minerva Cisneros Garcia left the Congregational United Church of Christ for the first time since June on Monday, after her attorney Helen Parsonage received notice of the vacated order. \nCisneros entered the United States from Mexico in 2000 along with two sons, one who's blind and one who has since died of leukemia. The Winston-Salem woman has no criminal record and was given a stay of removal by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency due to her son's needs in 2013, but was ordered to leave the country this year. \nICE doesn't enter churches or schools.

Many people have bought surgical masks and other supplies at pharmacies, raising concerns about a shortage of medicine. \nThe World Health Organization says at least 114 people have been infected and that, unlike past plague outbreaks in Madagascar, the current one is affecting large urban areas.

It comes as the U.S. seeks to protect its own diplomats from unexplained attacks that have affected at least 21 Americans in Havana, in some cases harming their hearing, cognition, balance and vision. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed the plan Monday with President Donald Trump. The State Department was expected to formally announce the decision Tuesday, officials said, though they cautioned no decision was formalized until publicly announced. The officials weren't authorized to discuss the plan publicly and requested anonymity. \nThe United States will formally tell Cuba to pull the diplomats, but won't expel them forcibly unless Havana refuses, the officials said. \nCuba's Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. \nSen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, applauded the administration's step, saying in a Twitter post that the move to expel two-thirds of \"Castro regime employees\" from the Cuban Embassy in Washington \"was the right decision.\" \nPresident Raul Castro's government denies involvement in the attacks, and is likely to view the move as unwarranted retaliation. Yet U.S. officials said the goal wasn't to punish the communist-run island, but to ensure both countries have a similar number of diplomats in each other's capitals. \nTensions between the two neighbors have been escalating amid serious U.S. concern about the unexplained attacks. \nOn Monday, The Associated Press reported that U.S. spies were among the first and most severely affected victims. Though bona fide diplomats have also been affected, it wasn't until intelligence operatives, working under diplomatic cover, reported bizarre sounds and even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, several individuals familiar with the situation said. \nThe mysterious \"health attacks\" started within days of President Donald Trump's election in November, the AP has reported. But it wasn't until last Friday that the United States ordered more than half its embassy staff to return home. \nDelivering a one-two punch to U.S.-Cuba relations, the U.S. last week also delivered an ominous warning to Americans to stay away from Cuba, a move that could have profound implications for the island's travel industry. The U.S. said that since some workers had been attacked in Havana hotels, it couldn't assure Americans who visit Cuba that they wouldn't suffer attacks. \n\"Because our personnel's safety is at risk, and we are unable to identify the source of the attacks, we believe U.S. citizens may also be at risk and warn them not to travel to Cuba,\" the United States said in a formal travel warning. \nCuba had called that \"hasty\" and lamented that it was being taken without conclusive investigative results. But several U.S. lawmakers had said the move by Washington didn't go far enough, because President Raul Castro's government was being permitted to keep all of its diplomats in America. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had called the one-sided action \"an insult\" in an AP interview. \nUltimately, the U.S. decided to take reciprocal action, too, bringing the two countries yet closer to the chilly state of relations they endured for decades until 2015, when they restored formal ties and re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington. \nThe U.S. previously had roughly 50 American workers at its embassy in Havana, so the 60 percent reduction will bring the figure down to roughly 20. It wasn't immediately clear how many Cuban diplomats will have to leave Washington to bring the two countries' rosters to parity. \nAt least 21 U.S. government workers in Havana and their relatives have been affected. Diagnoses include permanent hearing loss and mild traumatic brain injury. \nAlthough at first the U.S. called them \"incidents\" and avoided the word \"attacks,\" the terminology changed last week and the United States is now comfortable asserting that they were deliberate attacks that targeted Americans, officials said. \nStill, the administration has pointedly not blamed Cuba, and officials have spent weeks weighing how to minimize the risk for Americans in Cuba without unnecessarily harming relations or falling into an adversary's trap. After all, there are several countries in addition to factions of Cuba's government that would have an interest in driving a wedge between Washington and Havana. \nTwo years ago, President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro restored diplomatic ties, ordered embassies re-opened and eased travel and commerce restrictions. Trump has reversed some changes but has broadly left the rapprochement in place. \nTo medical investigators' dismay, symptoms have varied widely. In addition to hearing loss and concussions, some people have experienced nausea, headaches and ear-ringing. The Associated Press has reported that some now suffer from problems with concentration and common word recall. \nThe incidents stopped for a time. They recurred as recently as late August. \n___ \nReach Josh Lederman on Twitter at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAP and Matthew Lee at http://twitter.com/APDiploWrite r Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Era algo que hizo mucho da\u00f1o al penetrar en el cuerpo\u201d. \nEl cirujano dijo que hab\u00eda visto heridas similares en el pasado, pero \u201cpor supuesto, nunca tantos pacientes\u201d. \nEl agresor, Stephen Paddock, un contable retirado de 64 a\u00f1os, se suicid\u00f3 cuando las autoridades entraban en su habitaci\u00f3n del hotel. \nTen\u00eda 23 armas _algunas con miras_ en su cuarto del Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, donde se alojaba desde el jueves. Rompi\u00f3 dos ventanas para crear posiciones de francotirador desde las que descarg\u00f3 un aluvi\u00f3n de balas sobre las 22.000 personas que asist\u00edan al concierto a unas 500 yardas de distancia, seg\u00fan las autoridades. \nDos de las armas se hab\u00edan modificado para hacerlas totalmente autom\u00e1ticas, seg\u00fan dos funcionarios estadounidenses familiarizados con la investigaciones, que hablaron bajo condici\u00f3n de anonimato porque la pesquisa segu\u00eda en marcha. \nLas autoridades encontraron en casa de Paddock otras 19 armas, explosivos y miles de cartuchos. En su auto tambi\u00e9n hab\u00eda varias libras (kilos) de nitrato de amonio, un fertilizante que puede utilizarse para fabricar explosivos. \nSe cree que Paddock actu\u00f3 solo. Aunque no parec\u00eda tener historial delictivo, su padre fue un atracador de bancos que estuvo en la lista de los m\u00e1s buscados del FBI en la d\u00e9cada de 1960. \n\u201cNo podemos preocuparnos por las v\u00edctimas\u201d, dijo un agente a las 22:15. \u201cNecesitamos detener al agresor antes de que haya m\u00e1s v\u00edctimas. Todos los ojos sobre \u00e9l. Detengan al tirador\u201d. \nLa multitud, expuesta en un espacio abierto y abarrotado, ten\u00eda pocos lugares donde cubrirse y ninguna salida f\u00e1cil. Las v\u00edctimas ca\u00edan mientras otros hu\u00edan en p\u00e1nico. Algunos se escondieron tras puestos de comida o se arrastraron bajo autos estacionados. \nLa confusi\u00f3n y la conmoci\u00f3n marcaba los rostros de los asistentes, y la gente lloraba y gritaba. Algunos heridos fueron alcanzados por metralla. Otros fueron pisoteados o se lesionaron al saltar cercas. \n\u201cEra un caos... gente corriendo por su vida. Gente que intentaba echarse al suelo. Intentando llegar a sus seres queridos que hab\u00edan sido alcanzados\u201d, dijo Shaun Topper. \u201cEra solo, ya sabe. Era un caos\u201d. \nPronto surgieron historias de hero\u00edsmo y compasi\u00f3n: un hombre estrech\u00f3 la mano de un extra\u00f1o para consolarlo mientras mor\u00eda, incapaz de apartarse a pesar del peligro. Otro tom\u00f3 prestada una camisa franela de un desconocido para hacer un torniquete a una chica a la que no conoc\u00eda. \nLas parejas corrieron cogidas de las manos. Los sanos llevaban a los que sangraban.

(AP) \u2014 Around 100 baby loggerhead sea turtles recently hatched on Assateague Island National Seashore in Maryland and successfully made their way out to sea. \nThe National Park Service said in a statement that although multiple sea turtle nesting attempts have taken place within the national seashore in past years, this is the first confirmed hatch. It's also rare for loggerheads, an endangered species, to nest north of Virginia. \nThe statement approximately 100 hatchlings made their way from a single nest site in a Maryland zone. \nBill Hulslander is chief of resource management for the National Seashore. He says the hatching underscores \"the increasing importance of undeveloped beaches along Assateague Island to sea turtles and other federally threatened and endangered species.\" Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Photo: Bill Kostroun, AP Double Play: Judge takes swing at MVP and Rookie of the Year 1 / 11 Back to Gallery \nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The jury is out on AL MVP. And when a verdict comes in later this fall, giant slugger Aaron Judge has a great chance to join a very small club. \nFred Lynn (1975) and Ichiro Suzuki (2001) are the only major leaguers to win Most Valuable Player and Rookie of the Year awards in the same season. To match that rare achievement, the 6-foot-7 Judge must fend off a little competition. \nIn a baseball version of David and Goliath, the biggest challenger to the New York Yankees' 282-pound slugger for American League MVP honors is tiny Houston Astros second baseman Jose Altuve. \nThat means the main man standing in Judge's way is generously listed at 5-6 and 165 pounds. \n\"It's the beauty of baseball. There's not a whole lot of limitations,\" Tampa Bay pitcher Chris Archer said. \"You can be 5-5 or you can be 6-8 and a monster and be really talented at this game, so I love it.\" \nDespite his diminutive stature, Altuve packs plenty of punch and has the numbers to prove it after hitting .346 for his third career batting crown. He also led the league in hits (204) and finished with 24 home runs, 81 RBIs and 32 steals for the AL West champions. \nJudge, of course, clocked an AL-best 52 homers to break a rookie record that lasted 30 years. He ranked first in runs (128) and walks (127) while helping the Yankees reach the playoffs as the league's No. 1 wild card. \nThe knocks against Judge are his 208 strikeouts \u2014 only five times has a player whiffed more in one season \u2014 and extended slump after winning the All-Star Home Run Derby. But he rebounded with a huge September when New York really needed it, leading the AL in homers (15), RBIs (32), runs (29), on-base percentage (.463) and slugging percentage (.889). \nJudge finished the season with a 1.049 OPS to .957 for Altuve, and the big guy is no one-dimensional player. He ran the bases well and played solid defense in right field while appearing in 155 games. \n\"One of my goals was I wanted to be a consistent part of this lineup,\" Judge said. \"I wanted to be in there every day playing for my team through the good times and the bad times.\" \nFanGraphs ranks Judge first in Wins Above Replacement, while Baseball Reference favors Altuve. \nCleveland infielder Jose Ramirez also warrants consideration. So does perennial Angels contender Mike Trout, who figures to finish outside the top two for the first time after missing six weeks with an injury. \nBut the court's decision is Judge over Altuve. \n\"It's tough not to say that Aaron Judge is the MVP. What he's doing, rookie or not, the numbers he's putting up in the division that he's in and in a playoff race is impressive, man,\" Rays third baseman Evan Longoria said last week. \"He's having a special year.\" \nLynn and Suzuki, get ready for some company. \nAll rise! Here comes the Judge. \n\"I'm sure it's something he hasn't imagined in his wildest dreams,\" said Longoria, the 2008 AL Rookie of the Year. \"To be able to do both would be out of this world.\" \nVoting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America is held before the postseason begins, and results will be announced in November. \nHere are our selections for the other big awards: \nNATIONAL LEAGUE MVP: There are several worthy candidates from playoff teams: Colorado third baseman Nolan Arenado and outfielder Charlie Blackmon, plus Arizona first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, twice a runner-up. Extra points for them. But the incredible season Miami slugger Giancarlo Stanton had (MLB-best 59 homers and 132 RBIs) shouldn't be discounted just because his team went 77-85. Same goes for Joey Votto of the last-place Cincinnati Reds, for that matter. So the pick here is Stanton, thanks to those astounding power numbers. \"They make your jaw drop,\" Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman said after wrestling with his choice. \"Just kind of have to give it to him.\" \nAL CY YOUNG: Earlier in the season, it seemed nobody could catch Boston newcomer Chris Sale. Cleveland ace Corey Kluber did. Sale (17-8, 2.90 ERA) faded in the final two months but still racked up 308 strikeouts. Kluber (18-4, 2.25, 265 Ks) bounced back from an early injury and dominated the rest of the way. He wins his second Cy Young Award in four years, leaving Sale without one. \nNY CY YOUNG: Hard to separate Washington ace Max Scherzer (16-6, 2.51 ERA) and Dodgers lefty Clayton Kershaw (18-4, 2.31), other than the fact that Kershaw missed time with an injury. So he finished with 202 strikeouts in 175 innings to Scherzer's 268 Ks in 200 2/3 innings. \"I'd have to go Scherzer because he's been healthy all year,\" Freeman said. In this case, agreed. Scherzer gets the nod in a repeat from last year and joins Kershaw as three-time Cy Young winners. The right-hander won the AL prize in 2013 with Detroit. \nAL ROOKIE OF THE YEAR: An easy ruling for Judge. \nNL ROOKIE OF THE YEAR: Also a runaway, by Los Angeles Dodgers bopper Cody Bellinger. \nAL MANAGER OF THE YEAR: Hall of Famer Paul Molitor took the wild-card Twins (85-77) to the playoffs after they had the worst record in the majors last season at 59-103. That made Minnesota the first team in history to lose 100-plus games and qualify for the postseason the following year. Pretty impressive. \nNL MANAGER OF THE YEAR \nMilwaukee wizard Craig Counsell edges Colorado newcomer Bud Black and rookie skipper Torey Lovullo, who guided the Diamondbacks (93-69) to the top NL wild card after they went 69-93 a year ago. \n___ \nAP freelance writer Scott Orgera contributed to this report. \n___ \nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The big-serving Canadian has withdrawn from five events this year, and conceded walkovers at two others.\n\"It's been very frustrating,\" said Raonic, who started the year at No. 3 and has slipped to No. 12 in the rankings. \"I've had more than a dozen different injuries and reasons that have kept me away from tournaments. That hasn't been fun because I haven't been able to focus on tennis, I've been focusing on 'Can I play today or can't I?' rather than, 'What do I need to do with my tennis game?'\"\nRaonic knows tennis isn't a sport that's easy on the body, and the travel and length of the season are demanding, too.\n\"I believe out of those of us that finished top five last year, I'm the only guy still trying to play this year, and none of the top five played the U.S. Open,\" Raonic said. \"Maybe it's testament to some kind of reform being needed for the sake of players' careers, and being able to provide a certain caliber of tennis for spectators.\n\"Scheduling, the length of the year and how spread out \u2014 geographically and throughout the year \u2014 the tournaments are, especially the top tournaments for the top players, is something that deserves a second look. It's hard to peak four times of the year for Grand Slams, let alone for other tournaments.\"\nThe 11-month season has long been an issue for players, something the men's and women's tours have taken some steps to address.\nEven the biggest stars on the men's tour, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, had injury layoffs before returning to win two major titles each this season.\nRaonic thinks a more compact season would help the competition across the board.\n\"Give the players that really stand out mandatory events, give them a chance to play everything within a seven-month period so they can really focus on themselves health-wise, but also on improving, because you need that time,\" Raonic said. \"We're the only sport, outside of golf maybe, that plays as spread out as we do without any time for rest.\"\nRaonic next plays Yuichi Sugita, who took the first set 6-4 from Benoit Paire when the Frenchman retired with fatigue.\nHome-crowd favorite Taro Daniel was thumped by Yen-hsun Lu of Taiwan 6-1, 6-3 and gave his backing to Raonic's review call.\n\"It's ridiculous the way the tour's scheduled,\" Daniel said.\n\"You see how many people are injured right now. Half the top 10's out, 80 percent of players have some sort of pain right now. There needs to be a bit more space between the tournaments; there are players doing crazy stuff like playing in the U.S. one week, China the next week, and after Roland Garros playing 15 weeks in a row.\n\"It's a great opportunity for us to play different places around the world, and it's really exciting, but it's a little too hard.

Two Democratic members of Congress requested the investigation.

Price resigned on Friday. \nZinke said Friday that \"taxpayers absolutely have the right to know official travel costs,\" but he dismissed criticism of his flights as \"a little BS over travel.\" \nNo commercial flight was available from Las Vegas at the time he planned to fly for a speech to Western governors the next day in Whitefish, Montana, Zinke said. \nZinke, a former Montana congressman, was in Las Vegas to speak to the Vegas Golden Knights, the city's new National Hockey League team. The team's owner, Bill Foley, contributed to Zinke's congressional campaigns. \nZinke also traveled by private plane in Alaska in May and to the U.S. Virgin Islands in March. Zinke wants to expand energy production in Alaska, while the Interior Department oversees the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nZinke said he also went on a military flight with Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue to view wildfires in Montana in August. \nAll of his travel was approved in advance by Interior's ethics officials \"after extensive due diligence,\" Zinke said, adding that he works hard to \"make sure I am above the law and I follow the law.\" \nZinke's office did not provide the costs for his Alaska or Virgin Island trips, but it said in a statement that commercial flights were not available in either case. \nDemocratic Reps. Raul Grijalva of Arizona and Donald McEachin of Virginia requested the investigation. Grijalva is the senior Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, while McEachin is top Democrat on the panel's subcommittee on oversight and investigations. \nThe Trump administration \"tells us there's no money for Medicare, Medicaid, public education or enforcing environmental standards, but there's plenty for them taking twelve-thousand-dollar flights instead of sitting in coach,\" Grijalva said. \nThe flap over private flights echoes a controversy over improper travel expenses submitted by Zinke when he was a Navy SEAL. \nA 1999 report by the Navy faulted Zinke for improper travel expenses submitted for two flights to Montana, including one in which he reimbursed the Navy for $211. The other trip, from training in Washington state to his Whitefish home, did not require reimbursement. \nZinke told The Associated Press in 2014 that he \"learned a valuable lesson that I still hold today, that you are always accountable for your actions.\" \nZinke was a candidate for Congress at the time. He won the single seat representing Montana in the House that year and re-election in 2016 before being named Interior secretary. \nZinke said the travel disputes occurred because his commanding officer disagreed with his belief that Montana should be used for SEAL training. \nZinke's office did not respond to requests for comment. \nSen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said she welcomed the investigation, adding that if it concludes Zinke misused public funds, \"he should promptly reimburse the taxpayers.\" Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

(AP) \u2014 The Kentucky Division of Forestry is preparing for fall wildfire season.

Last fall, there were 420 fires that burned about 52,000 acres. Most of the fires started in November. \nThe Division of Forestry says in a release it is against the law to do any open burning within 150 feet of any woodland or brushland between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. during the fall and spring forest fire hazard seasons. Those seasons run from Oct. 1 to Dec. 15 and Feb. 15 to April 30. \nLast fire season, 70 people were given citations for illegal burning and 14 were arrested and charged with setting fires.

It's hard to tell with these two, who somehow manage to whiplash among sincerity, sarcasm and humor in a three-word response.\nIn a recent interview with the AP it is clear, however, that Ford and Gosling are genuinely amused by one another, even if Ford might not actually know how old his co-star is.\n___\nPhoto: Joel Ryan, Joel Ryan/Invision/AP Image 1 of / 3 Caption\nClose\nImage 1 of 3 FILE - In this Sept. 21, 2017 file photo, actors Harrison Ford, left, and Ryan Gosling pose for photographers during the photo call for \"Blade Runner 2049\" in London.

No. I met him once or twice casually. But I knew his work. I loved his ambitions. I loved his choices. I loved the filmmakers he chose to work with when he could have had much more obvious choices and I loved what it produced. ... But the producers had been thinking about him anyway so it didn't matter what I thought.\nAP: You had some pretty harrowing stunts, including a big set piece in a water tank.\nGOSLING: It was a lot like it looks like on camera.\nFORD: Things go a lot slower when you're working with mechanical beasts and wave machines. The time between the time it takes to take the takes takes. ... Let me say that again: The time between the time it takes to take the takes, it's not the time it takes to take the takes, it's the time between it takes to take the takes that takes the time.\nGOSLING: Is this what peyote feels like?\nFORD: (laughs) I wouldn't know.\nAP: People have made a big deal about you accidentally punching Ryan, but what was it like to perform that long fight sequence?\nGOSLING: Squirrely.\nFORD: It's complicated.\nGOSLING: Touch and go.\nFORD: It's complicated\nGOSLING: Hit or miss.\nFORD: It was a lot of hitting and only one failure to miss. But the camera was moving, Ryan was moving backward, I'm moving forward. I'm the one who can see where the camera is. There are strobe lights going on at the same time. He's reacting to the punches. It was complicated and that's fun. It's physical but it's fun. I remember that couple of days being great until I had to humiliate myself with an apology.\n(Gosling laughs)\nFORD: I had to crawl to your dressing room carrying a bottle of scotch.\nGOSLING: He came in and said, \"I forgive you.\"\nFORD: Yeah.\nGOSLING: Which was interesting that he describes it as crawling to my dressing room to say, \"I forgive you.\"\nFORD: I didn't need to say that.\nGOSLING: No, you didn't! That was big of you.\nFORD: A lot of guys wouldn't have made the effort. But I reached out.\nGOSLING: It warmed my heart.\nAP: Ryan now is basically the same age you were when you became very famous. Ryan, do you hope to follow in Harrison's footsteps and still be doing this when you're 75?\nFORD: Let's call it tracks, not footsteps.\nGOSLING: His experience is so unique to him. The fact that he, at my age was, well, not beginning, he'd been doing it for a long time before, but at the same time you were a fully formed person before this whole other element got introduced. I guess I can't really say that ...\nFORD: You're being generous. I was a late bloomer. It took me a long time to get me to where you are. I don't know how old you are. I really don't. But I think I was about 25 or 26 when I was under contract at Columbia. However much past 25 you are. ... It takes more now. You have to be a lot more real than the business is.\nGOSLING: Really?\nFORD: Back then it was more business than reality. They just wanted to twist you into a shape that resembled something else, something successful. They didn't give a rat's ass about what was individual about you. Anything that might potentially be interesting about you was just not of interest. The business has matured a lot since then and has attracted more mature artists.\nAP: Is there anything that worries you about the state of Hollywood or where it's going?\nFORD: I'm not a generalist. There is no such thing as Hollywood anyway. It's an imagination. There are movies being made all over the world, stories being told. Incredible films being made in countries you've never even heard of that are just as advanced and emotionally interesting. Hollywood is a state of mind. It's a tourist attraction. But, having said that, there are still enormous resources available for filmmakers. There are opportunities. There are people in the movie business who have a keen understanding of the business and an appreciation for the work and the work that the workers do. But the notion of Hollywood is kind of broken.\nAP: What do you think, Ryan?\nGOSLING: I'm learning. I'm taking notes, too.\nAP: Ryan, does this film have you thinking about whether you'd revisit any of your characters some 35 years later?\nGOSLING: The thing is any actor would be lucky to create one character in their career that anyone would want to revisit, let alone multiple times, let alone multiple characters. It's pretty unparalleled what he's doing.\nFORD: Participating in my own luck, that's what I'm doing. I grew up in a lucky time in \"Hollywood.\"\nGOSLING: Like I said, I'm just taking notes.\n___\nFollow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbah r", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gosling", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey bahr", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ford", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sfgate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:57:34.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "21b0d5c19633c0e6e6e16dc3578ff88fd0af8516", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV_JLDjIlFT6D5pua4zaBKlxbGrIRmkUrHjUbTCIF_ptfSalBTEB6_EaUACU5ikM798sJZeulTX1lEBXzWLyKNoZCD1Tz39HBZCikc_DRqB2crGrstAX73bI-", "site_full": "www.sfgate.com", "site": "sfgate.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "social"], "section_title": "", "title": "Man gets 20 years for fatal drunken driving crash - SFGate", "title_full": "Man gets 20 years for fatal drunken driving crash - SFGate", "published": "2017-10-03T10:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.125, "main_image": "http://www.sfgate.com/img/pages/article/opengraph_default.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 943, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "21b0d5c19633c0e6e6e16dc3578ff88fd0af8516", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_vCLDx9iTsV_JLDjIlFT6D5pua4zaBKlxbGrIRmkUrHjUbTCIF_ptfSalBTEB6_EaUACU5ikM798sJZeulTX1lEBXzWLyKNoZCD1Tz39HBZCikc_DRqB2crGrstAX73bI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T10:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "Man gets 20 years for fatal drunken driving crash - SFGate", "text": "Man gets 20 years for fatal drunken driving crash Updated 12:18 am, Tuesday, October 3, 2017 \nNAPLES, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for a fatal drunken driving crash. \nThe Naples Daily News reports that 42-year-old Rene Miles was sentenced Monday. He was convicted in June of DUI manslaughter and DUI causing serious bodily injury. \nProsecutors say Miles was speeding and driving drunk in December 2015 when he rear-ended an SUV, which then slammed into a minivan. The crash killed 33-year-old James Riner and injured three others. Authorities say Miles never called 911, didn't render aid and drove a quarter of a mile before stopping. \nMiles' blood alcohol content was recorded as 0.139 to 0.14 percent more than six hours after the crash. Florida law considers a driver impaired at 0.08 percent.

Sydney was visiting from Australia's National Basketball League in the first game between the two leagues in an NBA preseason game. \nThe Jazz began a new era for the franchise without All-Star Gordon Hayward, who spent his first seven seasons with the team. Hayward signed with Boston as a free agent. Second leading-scorer George Hill went to Sacramento as a free agent. \nNewly acquired Ricky Rubio and Joe Ingles started in place of the pair alongside second-team All-NBA center Rudy Gobert, Hood and Derrick Favors. Gobert finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. \nHood knocked down four 3-pointers as he attempts to pick up the scoring slack left by Hayward. \n\"Just coming in and being aggressive,\" Hood said. \"My teammates are constantly preaching that to me. We're going to go as Ricky goes, and we've got to be open for him. We've got to cut hard for him. We've got to get to open spots.\" \nFormer Kansas star Perry Ellis scored a game-high 19 for Sydney while teammates Kevin Lisch and Jason Cadee added 13 apiece. \nThe Jazz led by 19 at the end of the first quarter and never trailed. Sydney did cut the lead to single digits much of the second quarter, to the chagrin of Jazz coach Quin Snyder. \n\"Awful,\" Snyder said about the second-quarter defense. \"It's like anything, even something you think you can be good at, if you're not attentive to it and you don't honor it, you won't be good at it. They got a couple open looks that we didn't contest and they made them. And they got a couple offensive rebounds ... and suddenly they got confidence. Pretty soon they're hitting some tougher shots.\" \nTIP-INS \nKings: Sydney coach Andrew Gaze faced Snyder when Gaze played for Seton Hall and Snyder was at Duke. ...

He also said he smoked a lot throughout his life and the harmonica group was suggested to him to assist with his breathing. \nThe group struggled through a couple of songs together not necessarily due to their breathing issues, but because they were becoming accustomed to the harmonica and songs. \n\"This is going to get better. I can feel it,\" Landers said. \nAnd they did. By the end of the session the group completed \"Mary Had A Little Lamb\" with ease. The goal is to be able to perform \"Jingle Bells\" in front of an audience by December. \nOthers without severe respiratory issues are already considering stopping by for a session. \nJud Sanders, of Ottawa, also attended for the first time in August to help with her asthma. She said her husband is considering joining just because he's interested in learning to play the harmonica. \nLanders said anyone interested in joining the group can attend the sessions and group members hope to be able to attract someone with harmonica experience to help lead the group in training. \nEach song was bookmarked with a lot of laughter and a few coughs as participants worked through some of the more difficult songs and notes. \nAs it happens, getting out of the house and sharing some laughs is part of the medicine too. \n\"Our goal is to get them out and get them engaging,\" Landers said. \"As soon as they come and they start engaging with one another it becomes a social event.\" \n___ \nSource: The (Ottawa) Times, http://bit.ly/2x4JJ4v \n___ \nInformation from: The Daily Times, http://www.mywebtimes.com \nThis is an AP-Illinois Exchange story offered by The (Ottawa) Times.

(AP) \u2014 A Tennessee man convicted of stabbing his ex-wife 47 times will get the chance for parole after a jury could not come to an agreement on his punishment. \nMedia outlets report the Knox County Criminal Court jury declared a deadlock Monday in the case of 38-year-old Tyler Enix. A judge then imposed a sentence of life with the possibility of parole. He would become eligible after serving 51 years for first-degree murder. \nThe jury on Friday convicted Enix in the October 2015 stabbing death of 36-year-old Kimberly McFarland Enix. Tyler Enix was captured in Ohio that month while fleeing with his 2-year-old daughter. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Photo: Ed Zurga, AP Overreaction: Bills and Rams are heading to the playoffs 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nOrder those playoff tickets, Bills and Rams fans. \nTwo of the NFL's longest playoff droughts will end this season. The Bills (3-1) and Rams (3-1) are surprise division leaders at the one-quarter point. Both teams are coming off impressive road wins that proved they're no fluke. \nBuffalo handed the reigning NFC champion Falcons their first loss , 23-17. Los Angeles outlasted Dallas 35-30 . \nThe Bills haven't reached the postseason since 1999. They're one game ahead of the Patriots and Jets in the AFC East. \nThe Rams were in St. Louis the last time they advanced to the playoffs in 2004. They're one game ahead of the Seahawks and Cardinals in the NFC West. \nAll it took for both teams to become winners was to hire rookie coaches named Sean. \nSean McDermott was Carolina's defensive coordinator before going to Buffalo. The 31-year-old Sean McVay was Washington's offensive coordinator before becoming the youngest coach in the league. \nPerhaps they'll meet each other in February. \nHere are more overreactions following Week 4: \n___ \nOVERREACTION: The Browns (0-4) will go 0-16. \nREALISTIC REACTION: It took Cleveland 15 games to get a win last season. Let's start the winless watch at midseason. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: Todd Gurley is the best all-around back in the NFL. \nREALISTIC REACTION: He's off to an excellent start, but don't forget Le'Veon Bell. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: The Patriots (2-2) won't make the playoffs. \nREALISTIC REACTION: Tom Brady and the offense are just fine. The defense has talent but must correct mistakes. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: LeGarrette Blount is the new Beast Mode. \nREALISTIC REACTION: Blount has been excellent for the Eagles. But Marshawn Lynch isn't done yet. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: Deshaun Watson is the best rookie in the league. \nREALISTIC REACTION: Kareem Hunt and Leonard Fournette are pretty good, too. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: The Saints (2-2) have the most-improved defense in the league. \nREALISTIC REACTION: They shut out the Dolphins, who scored only 25 points in their first two games. \n___ \nOVERREACTION: Joe Flacco is done. The Ravens should've signed Colin Kaepernick to start. \nREALISTIC REACTION: Flacco missed training camp and the preseason.

He had been facing a first-degree arson charge and 30 years in prison. \nAuthorities say Johnson set a mattress on fire at his Auburndale home following an argument with a woman who also lived there. Officials say five dogs were in the home when Johnson set the fire. Two of them were found dead, tied up with leashes, after firefighters extinguished the blaze. Rescuers led the other three dogs from the home and treated them with oxygen. \n___ You know you are from Oakland if... sfgate Security increase at Bay Area events this weekend KTVU You know you are from Oakland if... sfgate An Asteroid Will Give Earth A Close Shave On October 12 GeoBeats Pat Robertson Links Vegas Shooting To 'Profound Disrespect' For Trump GeoBeats Judge OKs OPD decision to not discipline commanders in sexual exploitation case KTVU Novato woman missing in Las Vegas Fox5Atlanta Bay Area residents recount Las Vegas shooting FoxM9NJ Study: Life On Earth Began After Meteorites Landed In Warm Ponds GeoBeats Report: Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's Charter Flights Under Investigation GeoBeats \nInformation from: The Ledger (Lakeland, Fla.), http://www.theledger.co m Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

(AP) \u2014 The city of Hartford says it has filed a counterclaim against the one-time developers of a minor league baseball stadium and ended an agreement with them to develop the surrounding area. \nCenterplan Construction filed a lawsuit against the city last year after they were terminated from the stadium project following construction delays. \nThe city said Monday that it was countering that suit with claims of fraud and announced that Centerplan and DoNo Hartford LLC were being dropped as developers for the Downtown North neighborhood. A lawyer for Centerplan tells the Hartford Courant that the city cannot justify the move. \nThe city says Centerplan took public money intended to pay subcontractors on the stadium project and instead paid unrelated debts. The company said it did nothing wrong. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Friday, extension forester with the University of Hawaii at Manoa's College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources. \"There are still a lot of forests not infected . this is only one detection in all of Kohala . but there's no district on the island we now don't have positive (detection).\" \nTrees with the disease were found Sept. 15 on a private ranch. Researchers collected 10 samples at the site, eight of which tested positive for Ceratocystis, the more harmful of two newly identified fungal species that cause the disease in ohia. \nExperts aren't yet sure how the fungus arrived to the island's northernmost district. Crews are sampling more trees in the infected area during the coming weeks to better assess its cause and how much it has spread.

Partch, University of California, Santa Cruz Updated 1:03 am, Tuesday, October 3, 2017 \n(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.) \nCarrie L. Partch, University of California, Santa Cruz \n(THE CONVERSATION) Circadian rhythms control when we\u2019re at our peak performance physically and mentally each day, keeping our lives ticking in time with Earth\u2019s day/night cycle. This year\u2019s Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to three American scientists, Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash of Brandeis University and Michael Young of Rockefeller University, for shedding light on how time is measured each day in biological systems, including our own bodies. \nFrom Darwin\u2019s finches on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands to modern city dwellers, organisms adapt to their environment. Regular 24-hour cycles of day and night on Earth led to the evolution of biological clocks that reside within our cells. These clocks help us unconsciously pick the best time to rest, search for food, or anticipate danger or predation. \nThe field of modern circadian biology got its start in the 1970s, when geneticist Seymour Benzer and his student Ron Konopka undertook a revolutionary study to track down the genes that encode biological timing in fruit flies. With that gene in their sights, the labs of Hall, Rosbash and Young ushered in the molecular era of circadian biology as they untangled the molecular mechanisms of biological timekeeping.

This developmental process, called eclosion, served as a powerful tool to study the complicated biological process of circadian rhythms. Because Drosophila pupae only emerge at a specific time of the day, Konopka could measure the timing between rounds of eclosion for different strains of flies and identify those that had a bad clock. By isolating fly strains with timing problems, they hoped to be able to zero in on the relevant genes that controlled this internal clock. \nIn the end, Konopka found three mutant strains: one that had a short, 19-hour day, one with a long, 28-hour day, and one mutant that appeared to have no clock at all. Using genetic tools, he was able to show that each of the responsible mutations lay remarkably close on the same chromosome, suggesting that they were all located within a single gene, which Benzer and Konopka named period for its apparent control over clock timing. \nThen the race was on and in 1984, two teams finally identified this so-called clock gene period in flies: the labs of Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash working in close collaboration at Brandeis, and Michael Young\u2019s lab at Rockefeller. \nWith the gene in hand, these groups then aimed to figure out how period fit into a biological clock. The first clue came when Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash discovered that the protein encoded by this gene (called PER) increased during the night and decreased during the day, suggesting that levels of the protein might somehow communicate time information to the rest of the cell. \nIf you just imagine how a biological clock might best keep track of time over a day, you might jump to a mental picture of an hourglass timer. Sand gradually disappears over time; when all the sand is gone, it could signal the process to begin again. Was PER the substance that kept biological time by gradually changing throughout the day? \nOne key insight came when Hall and Rosbash reasoned that this PER protein might actually block the activity of the period gene, turning itself off each day. As levels of PER build up over the course of the night, less and less new PER protein would be made. Eventually the protein levels drop and the process starts over again. This is called a negative feedback loop. It\u2019s the same type of biological balancing act that keeps everything from your blood sugar levels to your circadian rhythms in line throughout your body. \nThis kind of negative feedback system is similar to how a thermostat controls the temperature of a room. If the temperature drops below the set point, the thermostat turns on the heater. When the room gets too toasty, the thermostat turns off the furnace. Here, negative feedback \u2013 a build up of heat \u2013 works to control the heater and maintain a constant temperature. \nNow imagine having to repeat this process over and over each day with nearly exact timing. Biological clocks use negative feedback from clock proteins like period to turn themselves on and off again each 24 hours. Additional studies in the Young lab identified other key genes \u2013 dubbed Timeless and Double-Time \u2013 that fit into this puzzle by controlling how PER travels around the cell to turn itself off each day. \nWork over the last two decades has rounded out a much deeper understanding of circadian rhythms to show how most organisms have clocks based on feedback loops similar to Drosophila. Rosbash\u2019s lab identified part of the PER protein known as the PAS domains that we now find in many clock proteins from fungi and plants to humans. PAS domains help clock proteins like PER pair up with their partners to control the negative feedback loop. \nBy comparing differences in the structures of PER PAS domains of Drosophila and mice, scientists are now beginning to learn how the protein \u201ccogs\u201d of the molecular clock fit together to tell time. Understanding circadian rhythms at atomic resolution like this allows us to explain how newly identified mutations in PER lead to changes in clock timing and open the door to therapeutics that could harness the power of circadian rhythms to improve human health. \nWe now have a much greater appreciation for the central role that circadian rhythms play in coordinating our lives with Earth\u2019s day, controlling everything from your metabolism to the timing of sleep. Young\u2019s lab recently identified a prevalent mutation in a human clock gene, cryptochrome 1, that lengthens the cellular clock and makes it difficult to get to bed before midnight. This inherited \u201cnight owl\u201d gene is estimated to be pretty common, found in nearly 1 out of 75 of us. \nUnderstanding the powerful regulation of biology by circadian rhythms is beginning to lead to far-reaching changes in policy. For example, rather than arbitrarily force our sleep schedules into routines that require early morning wake times, some researchers are showing that adjusting our schedules to fit our natural rhythms may pay off at work and school. This is particularly true for adolescents, who have a natural \u201cnight owl\u201d tendancy \u2013 delaying school start times by even just one hour can significantly improve academic performance. \nThe science is now far enough along in our understanding of circadian clocks that researchers are working to optimize work and sleep schedules with our biology in mind. And all these policy innovations are built on the foundation of the Nobel-winning research with those tiny fruit flies. \nThis article was originally published on The Conversation.

(Sept. 29) Media: Associated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is preparing to ask Cuba to withdraw 60 percent of its diplomats from Washington, U.S. officials said Monday, in response to last week's U.S. move to cut its own embassy staff in Havana by a similar amount. \nThe U.S. request marks yet another major setback for relations between the United States and Cuba, two countries that only recently renewed diplomatic relations after a half-century of hostility. It comes as the U.S. seeks to protect its own diplomats from unexplained attacks that have harmed at least 21 Americans in Havana with ailments that affected their hearing, cognition, balance and vision. \nThe State Department is expected to announce the decision Tuesday, officials said, though they cautioned no decision was formalized until publicly announced. The officials weren't authorized to discuss the plan publicly and requested anonymity. \nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson discussed the plan Monday with President Donald Trump, one of the officials said. \nCuba has denied involvement in the attacks. Though Havana is likely to view the move as unwarranted retaliation, U.S. officials said the goal wasn't to punish the communist-run island, but to ensure both countries have a similar number of diplomats in each other's capitals. The United States will formally ask Cuba to pull the diplomats, but won't expel them forcefully unless Havana refuses, the officials said. \nTensions between the two neighbors have been escalating amid serious U.S. concern about the unexplained attacks on Americans in Havana. \nOn Monday, The Associated Press reported that U.S. spies were among the first and most severely affected victims. Though bona fide diplomats have also been affected, it wasn't until U.S. spies, working out of the embassy under diplomatic cover, reported hearing bizarre sounds and experiencing even stranger physical effects that the United States realized something was wrong, several individuals familiar with the situation said. \nThe mysterious \"health attacks\" started within days of President Donald Trump's election in November, the AP has reported. But it wasn't until Friday that the United States ordered more than half its embassy staff to return home. \nDelivering a one-two punch to U.S.-Cuba relations, the U.S. last week also delivered an ominous warning to Americans to stay away from Cuba, a move that could have profound implications for the island's travel industry. The U.S. said that since some workers had been attacked in Havana hotels, it couldn't assure Americans who visit Cuba that they wouldn't suffer attacks if they stay in hotels there. \nCuba had blasted the American move as \"hasty\" and lamented that it was being taken without conclusive investigation results. But several U.S. lawmakers had said that move by Washington didn't go far enough, because President Raul Castro's government was being permitted to keep all of its diplomats in the U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., had called the one-sided action \"an insult\" in an AP interview. \nThere was no immediate reaction from Cuba's Embassy in Washington late Monday after word emerged that the U.S. planned to ask Cuban diplomats to leave. Yet the move will bring the two countries closer to the chilly state of relations they endured for decades until 2015, when they restored formal ties and re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington.

People may have had different kinds of accounts in their names, so the number of customers affected may differ from the account total. \nThe scandal was the biggest in Wells Fargo's history. Sloan's predecessor, John Stumpf, testified twice in front of Congress last fall. His poor performance was widely chastised, and the scandal led to his ouster. The bank's once-sterling industry reputation was in tatters, and it ended up paying $185 million to regulators and settled a class-action suit for $142 million.

In between snarling over rank and territory, they gulp down their rations. \nPura Besakih, known as the \"Mother Temple\" by locals, is usually busy with thousands of tourists and rows of stalls hawking spicy meatball soup, but it is now deserted \u2014 bar its canine residents. \nAn animal welfare organization founded by a Californian woman who has made Bali her home is making daily forays into the danger zone around the menacing volcano to feed the hungry temple dogs and rescue village dogs left behind by fleeing communities. \nJanice Girardi, who has lived on the Indonesian tourist island for more than 30 years, said she's a little nervous about getting close to Mount Agung, but is still making sure the animals are treated humanely.

Luis Severino pitches for the Yanks \u2014 he's 23, he averaged 97.6 mph on his fastball, tops among qualified starters. Twins starter Ervin Santana is 34, and hasn't been in the playoffs since 2004. \nFEELING OK? \nAs on Monday, Twins manager Paul Molitor said he hadn't decided on the status of All-Star third baseman Miguel Sano. The slugger has been recovering from a stress reaction in his left shin and missed 38 games before returning to action Friday. He was replaced by a pinch-hitter Sunday after feeling some discomfort in the leg. \n\"Whether he's going to start or not, I still haven't inked it in yet,\" Molitor said. \nPICK 'EM \nTorey Lovullo is managing in the playoffs for the first time, and is putting together Arizona's roster for the NL wild-card game at home Wednesday vs. Colorado. He said he talked to other skippers who have been in one-and-done matchups \u2014 Kansas City's Ned Yost and San Francisco's Bruce Bochy \u2014 seeking their thoughts on whether to carry another pitcher or go with a bench player. \n\"That's one thing that Ned Yost did tell me. He said that it would be his preference, he would go with the extra position player. He felt like the starter was James Shields, he was going to have enough there with James, and Boch said the same thing. He said his starter was going to be Madison Bumgarner, and he felt strong he needed the extra position player. And we have a great candidate in Zack Greinke,\" Lovullo said. \nVACANCY \nThe Atlanta Braves are looking for a new general manager after John Coppolella was forced to resign because an investigation by Major League Baseball revealed serious rules violations in the international player market. Braves president John Hart will take over GM duties while the team searches for a full-time replacement. \nHart said the Braves cooperated when they first learned of the investigation \"in the past couple weeks.\" He didn't reveal details of the rules violations, and said they didn't involve criminal activity.

(AP) \u2014 A man charged in a deadly shooting after a fight at a Pennsylvania bar has pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. \nThe trial for Grover Lyons was scheduled to start Tuesday, but he accepted a plea deal Monday after prosecutors turned over new documents to his lawyers. \nLyons was charged with shooting 28-year-old Darrin Germany Jr. on a street in Erie on Dec. 31. Police say the two had been involved in a fight at a nearby bar. \nThe Erie Times-News reports that charges including aggravated assault and reckless endangerment were dropped as part of the deal. Lyons' lawyer called it a fair resolution.

Photo: Charlie Riedel, AP Butker's field goals send Chiefs to 29-20 win over Redskins 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) \u2014 After Harrison Butker missed the first field-goal attempt of his NFL career, Chiefs coach Andy Reid walked over to the rookie and prepared to instill a little bit of confidence. \n\"He said, 'I got it. I got it. I was just off a tad,'\" Reid recalled of their brief exchange. \"He kind of gives you that feeling that everything's going to be OK.\" \nBetter than just \"OK.\" \nButker responded to his first-half miss Monday night by drilling three field goals in the second half, the last a go-ahead 43-yarder with 8 seconds remaining that helped Kansas City beat the Washington Redskins 29-20 and remain the only unbeaten team in the NFL. \n\"I didn't have butterflies. I felt confident,\" said Butker, who was claimed off the Carolina practice squad to replace injured kicker Cairo Santos. \"I knew it was going to come down to a field goal. I felt pretty calm. I was excited; I wasn't nervous.\" \nThe Chiefs (4-0) an exclamation point on the win when linebacker Justin Houston picked up a fumble as the Redskins (3-2) were trying to keep the game alive and returned it for a game-ending touchdown. \nThe last time there was only one unbeaten team through the first four weeks of the season was 2010, when the Chiefs were the final team standing. They went on to win the AFC West. \n\"I mean, it's the NFL. It's any given Sunday for a reason,\" said Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, who had seven catches for 111 yards and a score. \"All these teams are scheming everybody up. It's a testament to this team for especially not only being 4-0, but the way we've won.\" \nAlex Smith threw for 293 yards with touchdowns on the ground and through the air, and his 37-yard strike to Albert Wilson on a broken play that set up Butker's go-ahead kick. Kareem Hunt added 101 yards on the ground for the rookie's fourth straight 100-yard effort. \n\"Winning is more meaningful,\" Hunt said with a smile. \"I could have 50 yards as long as we win.\" \nKirk Cousins had 220 yards passing and two touchdowns for Washington, but his throw to the end zone with 50 seconds left was dropped by Josh Doctson and forced the Redskins to kick a field goal. \nThat missed opportunity came back to haunt them less than a minute later. \n\"We'll go back and try to look at different plays throughout the game that could have made a big difference,\" Cousins said. \"A tough one to lose. Felt like we had a chance there and didn't get it done.\" \nThe Redskins stunned the Chiefs early when Cousins found Terrelle Pryor over star cornerback Marcus Peters for a 44-yard touchdown pass, then drove to the goal line before settling for a field goal. \nBut the plucky Chiefs slowly fought their way back into the game. \nSmith started to find his athletic tight end down the seam, then hit Kelce with a 17-yard TD strike late in the first half. The two connected again on third down shortly after the break, and Smith scored a few plays later when he fooled the defense with a quarterback-keeper. \nThe Redskins needed fewer than 2 minutes to answer: Cousins' 69-yard pass to Vernon Davis set up a short throw to Ryan Grant, who also beat Peters, for a touchdown and a 17-14 lead. \nBut that's when injuries began to take their toll: The Redskins lost cornerbacks Josh Norman, Montae Nicholson, Kendall Fuller and Quinton Dunbar along with safety Deshazor Everett, and in the fourth quarter had just four available defensive backs. \n\"I was looking up and I'm like, 'Man, we've got all backups in,\" Redskins safety D.J. Swearinger said. \"If you're number is called, you've got to step up. We've got to get better at that as well.\" \nIt was 17-all after Butker made his first field goal, and his 32-yard kick gave Kansas City the lead back. The Redskins tied the game once more when Dustin Hopkins hit from 40 yards with 47 seconds left, but that turned out to be enough time to get Butker in position for the winning kick. \n\"He has a leg,\" Hunt said, \"so I wasn't too worried. Just make it routine. He had a rough start but honestly, I believed in him, that he was going to bounce back.\" \nPREGAME TRIBUTE \nFlags flew at half-staff and there was a moment of silence before the game for victims of the Las Vegas shooting. The Redskins then locked arms for the national anthem, while everyone on the Chiefs side stood with the exception of cornerback Peters and linebacker Ukeme Eligwe. \nINJURY WATCH \nNorman left in the second quarter with a rib injury and could miss several ribs, while running back Rob Kelley joined the Redskins' defensive guys on the sideline with an ankle injury.

But in many respects the massive project is more than just about basketball. \nTeam and arena executives want to get major entertainment acts to stop in Milwaukee. They want the arena to be a driver for ambitious downtown redevelopment. \nAnd to do that, they have to go out to market and sell Milwaukee. \n\"We want to create an international destination with talent. We want to compete with every major city, we want to be on every tour stop,\" team president Peter Feigin said. \"We have this one window of time to tell our story and our narrative around the world.\" \nThat is exactly what Feigin, along with team and arena officials, planned to do this week in London. They were meeting with concert promoters and artist management firms in hopes of bringing major international acts to Milwaukee. \nThe groundwork was laid in part when the Bucks named Raj Saha as general manager of the Wisconsin Entertainment & Sports Center. He managed the O2 arena in London for arena giant AEG, and also helped stage the 2012 London Olympics and 2014 World Cup in Brazil. \nThe Bucks view the $524 million arena project, which was partially financed by public funding, as a centerpiece of downtown revitalization. The facility will replace the 30 year-old BMO Harris Bradley Center, which sits next to the project. \nWhile the Bradley Center did draw its share of major acts, Feigin and Saha said there were limitations to the aging arena. \nThe steel trusses and infrastructure at the new arena have been built to carry and support the weight needed for the elaborate-style productions used in major concerts, Feigin said. The arena has 200,000 pounds of rigging capability, according to the Bucks. \nWith a seating capacity of 17,500 for basketball and 500 more for concerts, the arena has 10,000 seats in the lower bowl, which planners say will help audio-visual experiences. Two-thirds of the seats in the Bradley Center are in the upper level. \nAnd Feigin says that the Bucks have placed a premium on acoustics, including a roof designed to lower reverberation and reduce echoes. The arena also has what's called \"specialized low frequency absorption\" for bass notes allowing for cleaner bass sound. \n\"It's secondarily about basketball, probably the only thing that's secondarily about basketball is how you design this so it's a surreal acoustic experience, as well as a visual experience,\" Feigin said. \nIn Saha's experience, only a handful of U.S. arena executive have traveled to London to talk to promoters. Consider this trip another way in which the Bucks, who have New York-based ownership, are thinking big. \nThe area already has a reputation as a music destination with Milwaukee's Summerfest music festival. The demographics are different in Milwaukee from Chicago and Minneapolis, Saha said. \nThe first new sign of how things are changing popped up this summer. The Bucks moved into a new, state-of-the-art practice facility downtown, across the street from the arena construction site. \n\"It's amazing. It's refreshing to walk in here every day,\" guard Malcolm Brogdon said after the first practice last week. \"Everything in here is just made to perfection.\" \nThe facility and new arena give the Bucks two new draws with which to attract or retain players in the future. With the young team itself on the rise after two playoff appearances in three seasons, Milwaukee's image as an NBA outpost is starting to disappear. \nSimilarly, the Bucks see the new arena as an avenue to open new inroads into Milwaukee, music and otherwise. \n\"We don't think there's any reason why \u2014 especially logistically, geographically, monetarily \u2014 we (couldn't) get the music acts. Part of the reason we haven't is because we haven't been out there to tell our story, to market, to sell,\" Feigin said. \"That's really what we're doing.\" \n___ \nMore AP NBA: www.apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketbal l Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

North Korea has launched intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially strike the U.S. mainland and a month ago conducted its largest ever underground nuclear explosion. It has threatened to explode another nuclear bomb above the Pacific. \nAmid all the threats, however, some level of U.S.-North Korean diplomacy has survived.

But officials close to Tillerson insisted that the pair were on the same page, and that Trump was merely sending a message to North Korea that it would have to show up in serious negotiating mood to any diplomatic talks. \nWhatever the intent, confusion was the result. \nAnd on Monday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders compounded the impression that the White House views diplomacy as a dead end. \nThe only conversations the U.S. is willing to have with North Korea are about the fate of the three Americans being held there, she said. Back-channel talks in the spring led to the release of college student Otto Warmbier, who returned home with brain damage and died days later. \n\"Beyond that there will be no conversations with North Korea at this time,\" Sanders said. \nWhile the episode represents the latest example of the president appearing to step on his top diplomat's toes, even if advertently, perhaps more concerning for the United States is the lack of results Trump's hardnosed approach or Tillerson's softer tack have produced. \nTrump's \"bad cop\" may have galvanized action by China, the North's traditional diplomatic protector and main trading partner, which has agreed to tough new U.N. sanctions on its ally's primary sources of revenue for weapons development. The measures include banning imports of North Korean coal, iron ore and textiles, and new limits on crucial oil and petroleum supplies. \nBut none of the economic pressure has forced Kim's government to even slow down a nuclear acceleration that could soon put the entire United States within range. \nTillerson's \"good cop\" has hardly fared better. The North professes to not even be interested in diplomacy unless the U.S. abandons its \"hostile policy.\" \nDuring his meetings in Beijing, the Chinese assured Tillerson they would implement the U.N. sanctions and press their local authorities near North Korea's border to stamp out banned activity, according to a State Department official familiar with the talks. China wants the North to halt its nuclear and missile tests, however remote the goal, and is eyeing the winter months when there are no U.S.-South Korean military exercises that often exacerbate tensions on the divided Korean Peninsula. The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded anonymity. \nEven that appears a remote possibility. Analysts and even governments in between say Trump is making it increasingly difficult for the North to have confidence in any diplomatic effort with the United States, given his threats to demolish a 2-year-old arms control pact with Iran. \nAnd back-channel diplomacy between senior U.S. and North Korean diplomats \u2014 primarily aimed at freeing detained Americans \u2014 hasn't helped repair any trust. In fact, the two sides have barely communicated for the last couple of weeks and there is no sign North Korean wants to re-engage, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions. \nThe \"good cop, bad cop\" ploy is unlikely to work, said Evans Revere, a former State Department official who took part in unofficial talks in Switzerland with North Korean officials last month.

Tucker during the first half in Game 1 of a second-round NBA basketball playoff ... more Photo: Tony Dejak, AP Cavaliers moving Love to center, Thompson to reserve role 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nCLEVELAND (AP) \u2014 Cavaliers All-Star Kevin Love is being moved after all \u2014 from forward to center. \nLove, who has been the subject of trade speculation for three years in Cleveland, will be the club's new starting center, coach Tyronn Lue announced Monday night after the team played an intra-squad scrimmage at Quicken Loans Arena. \nLue has experimented with Love at center during training camp and believes the new-look lineup will create matchup problems for opposing centers as well as open the floor for LeBron James, Derrick Rose and others. \n\"He's a great passer,\" Lue said of Love. \"Fives (centers) have to get out and try to guard him on the pick and roll with LeBron and D-Rose and those guys making plays, so it's going to be tough for those guys. We liked it.\" \nCenter Tristan Thompson will come off the bench, and newly acquired forward Jae Crowder will take Love's former spot, Lue said. Crowder, acquired this summer in the Kyrie Irving trade, is a strong defender. \nLue said he spoke to Thompson about the switch and \"it was great.\" Thompson started all 78 games at center for Cleveland last season. In 2016, he made just 33 starts and the Cavs went on to win the NBA title. \n\"I told him I'm one guy you don't have to worry about,\" Thompson said. \"I'm a team-first guy. I understand that at the end of the day it's about winning and if you win, we all look good \u2014 whether you come off the bench or you start. And it's not about who starts the game, it's about who is in the game in the fourth and who is finishing it. So, I'm not worried. The last time I came off the bench, if history repeats itself, we had a parade in June. So, I'll take it. \n\"I'm going to go for Sixth Man of the Year, put myself in position to do that.\" \nLue has more options this season after Cleveland's roster was overhauled with Irving being traded to Boston and the additions of Rose, Crowder, Dwyane Wade, Isaiah Thomas and Jeff Green. \nWade will likely be Cleveland's backup point guard until Thomas recovers from a hip injury, but Lue said he hasn't committed to that idea just yet. \nAs for Crowder, Lue said his defensive presence will free up James. \n\"With Jae starting at the four, LeBron's able to roam freely on the defensive end,\" Lue said. \"Jae will take the toughest matchup between the 3s and the 4s and LeBron will be able to roam and kind of quarterback our defense. Being that back line defense, talking, communicating, and also being able to pick off passes when guys are throwing bad passes. I like LeBron in that role because he's great at being the help guy, being in the right spots at the right places, so I think it will be good for us.\" \nFor now, James is sidelined with a sprained left ankle sustained last week in practice. Lue said the three-time champion will not play in Wednesday night's exhibition opener against Atlanta. James' injury is not believed to be serious, and the Cavs will make sure he's full healed before he plays. \nLue said he expects James on the court at some point in the preseason.

So too, surely, do Minnesota's fans. \nAround the rest of the Twins clubhouse, though, it may as well be ancient history. \nBack in the playoffs for the first time in seven years, Mauer and upstart Minnesota will face New York in the AL wild-card game Tuesday night hoping to turn around what has been a one-sided postseason rivalry. \nNew York eliminated the small-market Twins in the Division Series four times from 2003-10, repeatedly dashing the World Series aspirations of a largely homegrown lineup. \n\"Somebody asked me earlier, 'Does it feel like seven years?'\" Mauer said. \"I said, 'Yes, and all of that.'\" \nMauer is the only holdover from that era. Minnesota now has a new batch of budding young stars, and it's a group that's already wrecked some history. Powered by Miguel Sano and Byron Buxton, these Twins became the first team ever to go from 100 losses one year to the playoffs the next. \n\"I'm really excited for this group to experience this,\" Mauer said. \"There's a lot of guys in our clubhouse that this is their first go-round. I was just real happy. It's been a special year to see these guys kind of grow.\" \nThis time, Minnesota won't be running into playoff-proven Yankee greats like Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera. \nLike the Twins, New York has been fueled by its burgeoning big leaguers. AL MVP hopeful Aaron Judge headlines the crew, which also includes Tuesday's starter Luis Severino and catcher Gary Sanchez. Only Brett Gardner, Greg Bird, Didi Gregorius and Chase Headley started for New York in their previous wild-card appearance, a 3-0 loss to Dallas Keuchel and the Astros in 2015. \n\"The faces have changed so much,\" said Yankees manager Joe Girardi, who managed New York past Minnesota in the 2009 and '10 ALDS. \nThe 6-foot-7 Judge set a rookie record with 52 homers this year and has become the new face of the franchise. He even has his own cheering section at Yankee Stadium \u2014 The Judge's Chambers in right field, which will host a group of Bronx school kids Tuesday. \nLimiting Judge may be the most pivotal task for Twins starter Ervin Santana. \n\"Have to be careful with him,\" Santana said. \"Don't try to leave any cookies right there.\" \nHere's some more to chew on before New York and Minnesota vie to face the reigning AL champion Indians in an ALDS: \n___ \nDECIDING ON SANO \nAs of Monday afternoon, Twins manager Paul Molitor hadn't decided on Sano's status for the game, although he was optimistic Sano would play. The slugger has been recovering from a stress reaction in his left shin. \nSano missed 38 games before returning to action Friday, and then he was pinch hit for Sunday after feeling some discomfort in the leg. \nMolitor thinks Sano will at least be available off the bench. \n\"Whether he's going to start or not, I still haven't inked it in yet,\" Molitor said. \nGUESSING GAME \nThe 23-year-old Severino starts the wild-card game after going 14-6 with a 2.98 ERA in a breakout regular season. He averaged 97.6 mph on his fastball \u2014 tops among qualified starters by nearly 2 mph \u2014 and paired it with a powerful slider and improved changeup. \nMolitor, a member of the 3,000-hit club as a player, said he'd suggest that his hitters do more guessing at the plate than usual to combat Severino's overpowering arsenal. \n\"I don't think that you go up there trying to hit all three of his pitches because that's usually not a good mix,\" Molitor said. \"A guy that was comparable for me in his prime was Pedro (Martinez). I couldn't hit all three pitches. I just had to try to own something.\" \nMinnesota faced Severino two weeks ago, chasing the right-hander after three runs in three innings. Severino labored through a 46-pitch third inning, including a 13-pitch at-bat against Mauer that ended in an RBI single. It was the longest at-bat of the 2009 AL MVP's career. \nMORE FUN WITH FUNDAMENTALS \nSo how did Minnesota go from 59-103 in 2016 to the playoffs this year? A big key was a renewed focus on fundamentals. \nIn spring training, the Twins packed players into classrooms to talk baserunning and defense. \n\"We cleaned a lot of that up,\" leadoff hitter Brian Dozier said. \nSure did. Minnesota finished 10th in the majors with 17 defensive runs saved after finishing 28th at minus-49 runs in 2016. \nThe Twins also led the majors with 28 bunt hits, according to Baseball Info Solutions, and they were the best team on the bases in the majors this year, according to Fangraphs' advanced baserunning metric. \nBuxton was key in all those areas. The 23-year-old is a Gold Glove Award candidate in center field, led the team with 11 bunt hits and was the best baserunner in baseball this year, as measured by Fangraphs. \n\"He just has a lot of ways to impact the game,\" Molitor said. \"He might not get a hit and might be the most important player on the field, and there's not a lot of people who can fill that bill.\" \nWHAT A RELIEF \nThe Yankees have a trio of All-Stars at the back of their bullpen in Aroldis Chapman, Dellin Betances and David Robertson, plus two of baseball's best middle relievers in Chad Green and Tommy Kahnle. In a winner-take-all game, Girardi figures to get to those arms sooner than usual. \nHe also says he won't hesitate to use Betances, who has struggled with his control this year. \n\"I do feel good about Dellin,\" Girardi said. \nOn the other side, Molitor may use starter Jose Berrios out of the bullpen. Berrios made his first relief appearance in the majors Friday, getting the win with 1 1/3 scoreless innings against Detroit. \n___ \nFollow Jake Seiner on Twitter at https://twitter.com/jake_seiner \n___ \nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

The fishery was shut down in 2013 amid concerns about poor reproduction and declining population. \nThe shrimp have been largely unavailable to American consumers since the shutdown, though they are also harvested by Canadian fishermen. They were a popular winter seafood item before the fishery was closed. Fishermen also formerly brought some to land in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. \nScientists say environmental conditions have been inhospitable for the shrimp off of New England.

With starter workloads continuing to shrink, these playoffs could be when those middle men become household names. \nThere's Yankees fireballer Chad Green, who has a 1.83 ERA but routinely pitches in the fifth or sixth innings. Same with Houston's Chris Devenski, an All-Star who worked up to four innings per outing this season. The Cubs have a steady long man in Mike Montgomery (2.49 ERA in relief), Arizona can call on Archie Bradley (1.73 ERA), and Colorado's Chris Rusin (2.65 ERA) has reliably gotten six or more outs in the middle innings, too. \n\"Especially with what you saw with Miller last year, sometimes the big out is in the fifth inning,\" Green said. \"That might be the big inning.\" \nThe threat of playoff elimination is often a catalyst for creativity. Last year, traditional one-inning closers like Kenley Jansen and Aroldis Chapman were stretched for eight or nine outs at times, Dodgers manager Dave Roberts called on ace Clayton Kershaw for a save in Game 5 of an NL Division Series, and Cubs lefty Jon Lester made his first relief appearance in nearly a decade during Game 7 of the World Series. \nFrancona is as bold an innovator as any manager, and Miller might be his most fruitful playoff trial. Miller's transition to middle relief last fall keyed Cleveland's run to the Series, with Miller \u2014 formerly an elite closer \u2014 eagerly entering games as soon as the fifth and powering through two-plus innings. \nMiller's success has put long relief in a new light. \n\"It is changing the perception, for sure,\" said Montgomery, who has split time between the bullpen and rotation the past two seasons. \n\"I guess people look at long relief as the mop-up duty,\" he added. \"I guess him and maybe with the help of me, we're changing it to where you can pitch long relief in higher leverage situations.\" \nPitcher usage is changing across the board. Starters covered an all-time low 5.5 innings per game this year, and teams have been even quicker with the hook in recent postseasons. Some of that is about pitch counts and injuries, but it's also because managers want certain relievers in the game sooner. \nTake it from the hitters' perspective: facing someone like Miller, Green or Devenski isn't much of a reward for chasing away those starters. \nGreen has been particularly dominant in those middle innings this season. The 26-year-old has quietly dominated in a bullpen headlined by All-Stars Chapman, Dellin Betances and David Robertson. He has the best ERA out of that group this year despite averaging more than five outs per appearance. \nGreen has struck out 40.7 percent of his batters, trailing only closers Craig Kimbrel, Jansen and Corey Knebel among pitchers with at least 60 innings. He's also earned manager Joe Girardi's trust in big spots by consistently throwing strikes. \n\"He doesn't beat himself,\" Girardi said. \nA starter in the minor leagues, Green hasn't ruled out a return to the rotation one day \u2014 he says he'll go wherever New York wants him. In the meantime, he's bought into the idea that he can make critical contributions in the middle of games. \n\"Games can be won or lost in the fifth or sixth innings because you're getting to guys in the back of the bullpen that are lights out,\" he said. \"Teams might use their pinch hitter in the fifth or sixth and not wait until the ninth.\" \nA look at some of the other fireman relievers who could shine this postseason: \n___ \nCHRIS DEVENSKI, HOUSTON ASTROS \nDevenski grabbed baseball's attention by opening the season with a pair of overpowering four-inning relief appearances and pitched his way into the All-Star Game. A right-hander with a devastating changeup, he's thrown over 80 innings out of the bullpen each of the past two years and ranks seventh among relievers with 3.6 wins above replacement in that span, per Fangraphs . The names ahead of him? Jansen, Miller, Roberto Osuna, Kimbrel, Chapman and Betances. \nDevenski has become a fan favorite in Houston, too, despite only saving five games in his career. He got his own bobblehead doll in June, and some supporters have even worn \"energy dome \" hats, popularized in the 1980s by the band DEVO, as a nod to Devenski's \"Devo\" nickname. \nAlso of note: Devenski isn't Houston's only quality long relief option. Joe Musgrove has a 1.44 ERA as a reliever this season while working 1.4 innings per relief outing. \nARCHIE BRADLEY, ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS \nThe bush-bearded Bradley has a 1.73 ERA over 73 innings, averaging more than three outs per appearance while pitching anywhere between the fifth and ninth innings. He's been used in a more traditional setup role of late, but after throwing 182 1/3 innings last year, Bradley should have the stamina for a heavy workload in the playoffs. \nMIKE MONTGOMERY, CHICAGO CUBS \nMontgomery got a one-out save in Game 7 of last year's World Series, but he also had three multi-inning relief outings in the playoffs and could get even more of those this year after an impressive season of bullpen work. Montgomery moved in and out of the rotation but had a 2.49 ERA while pitching 61 1/3 innings over 30 relief outings. \nCHRIS RUSIN, COLORADO ROCKIES \nRusin has been a workhorse in Colorado's bullpen, finishing second in the majors with 85 relief innings while posting a 2.65 ERA, including 1.88 away from Coors Field. The left-hander is a groundball machine and keeps his pitch count down by challenging hitters early. Four times this year, he pitched at least three innings out of the bullpen without topping 37 pitches, and he's even gone multiple innings while throwing on consecutive days. \nDAVID PRICE, BOSTON RED SOX \nPrice's situation is different, but his impact could be similar. \nPrice has struggled, been hurt and feuded with the media this year. But since ending his most recent DL stint, he's proven useful in the bullpen, pitching shutout ball over 8 2/3 relief innings in September. Long relief might not be the role Boston envisioned when Price signed a $217 million, seven-year deal prior to the 2016 season, but the 2012 AL Cy Young Award winner could be an asset there. Plus, he has experience as a playoff reliever \u2014 in 2008 as a rookie with Tampa Bay and in 2015 ALDS Game 4 with Toronto. \n___ \nAP writer Andrew Seligman contributed from Chicago. \n___ \nFollow Jake Seiner on Twitter: https://twitter.com/jake_seiner \n___ \nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Frates wryly countered by posting a short video of himself lying in a hospital bed with Pearl Jam's \"Alive\" playing in the background. \nUsing a computer system that lets him type out words through eye movements, Frates has been tweeting about his progress to his nearly 30,000 followers, along with regular musings about his family and friends, living with ALS and Boston sports. \n\"lots of down days as you can imagine with als, sometimes you don't feel human,\" he tweeted Sept. 23. \"Today I am definitely feeling sorry for myself, sukxx. but I will bounce back. Eff! you als.. Friggin a hole!!\" \nIn the weeks since his July health scare, the 32-year-old has re-emerged to accept honors and accolades across his home state of Massachusetts. \nLast month, he joined Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, Red Sox officials and the Boston College baseball team on the steps of City Hall to declare Sept. 5 \"Pete Frates Day\" in Boston. \nAnd former Red Sox slugger David Ortiz and other Boston sports legends feted Frates at Fenway Park to mark the release of a new book on his life, \"The Ice Bucket Challenge: Pete Frates and the Fight Against ALS.\" Half the proceeds benefit Frates and his family. \nFrates' wife, Julie, said it's been a difficult and busy few months, but she couldn't persuade her husband to slow things down even if she wanted to. \"He's the one pushing to be out there,\" she said. \"We take all the lead from him.\" \nThe ice bucket challenge had been around for almost a year to benefit various causes. But Frates is credited with helping focus it on ALS specifically and taking it global using his wide network of supporters as an established ALS advocate. \nThe challenge raised roughly $220 million in 2014, of which $115 million went to the ALS Association. A sequel campaign the next summer raised just over $1 million, according to the association. \nThe ALS Association says it has committed more than $89 million of the 2014 windfall to research. \n\"New, exciting research is just starting to pan out, and that's drawing new talent to ALS research, and a lot of companies are now interested in ALS,\" said Dr. Nazem Atassi, a Massachusetts General Hospital neurologist whose ALS research benefited from ice bucket challenge money. \"It's the perfect environment for drug discovery.\" \nAmong the most promising developments to come out of research funded by the challenge has been the identification of at least four genes that contribute to the disease, a critical step toward developing new treatments, said Kevin Eggan, a professor at Harvard University who specializes in ALS. \nAnother development that gives the Frates family hope is Radicava, a drug approved in May by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration following testimony from the Frates and other advocates. It's the first new treatment approved specifically for ALS in 22 years. \nFrates' mother, Nancy, said they're applying to get her son on the drug, even though it's not clear how it might help, given his advanced condition. The medication, which was developed in Japan without funding from the ice bucket challenge, has been shown to slow the disease in recently diagnosed patients. \n\"You just want it to stop,\" Nancy said. \"You want someone to say this disease is not tearing through your loved one's body anymore.\" \nALS is still finding new ways to attack Frates, said his father, John, a city councilor in Beverly who quit his financial services job to help care for his son after he was diagnosed in 2012. \nFrates' bladder stopped working last year, requiring his urine now to be drained with a catheter every three hours, John Frates said. \n\"It's amazing he's tolerating all of it. It just shows the courage, will and determination he has to be with us,\" Frates' father said. \"He's as incapacitated as a human being can be. That's his quality of life.\" \n___ \nFollow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.
