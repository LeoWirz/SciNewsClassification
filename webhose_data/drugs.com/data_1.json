But over the past 15 years, the disease has gained a new foothold in the United States, likely due to parents choosing not to vaccinate their children, a new study suggests. \nFrom 2001 to 2015 measles cases in the United States remained very low (less than 1 case per million people), but there's still been a signficant rise, the study found. \nOverall, measles incidence doubled -- from 0.28 per million in 2001 to 0.56 per million in 2015. Infants and young children were hit hardest, and most cases were among the unvaccinated, the research showed. \nThe findings suggest that, \"being unvaccinated rather than failure of vaccine is the main driver of measles spread,\" said lead researcher Nakia Clemmons, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe good news is that most parents are still protecting their children from measles by getting them the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, she said. \n\"Thanks to high vaccination rates, measles cases among Americans has remained rare since the disease was eliminated,\" Clemmons said. \nMeasles outbreaks, however, can and do still occur in the United States, she said. \n\"Measles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world. Unvaccinated U.S. residents returning from overseas travel and foreign visitors to the U.S. may develop measles and expose people in United States. When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people, outbreaks are more likely to occur,\" Clemmons said. \nThe best way to protect children against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is to ensure they are up to date on vaccines, she said. \n\"Getting vaccines at the recommended ages protects children at the earliest age possible from serious vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Clemmons said. \nDr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"The reason measles has come back is not because the virus has mutated. It's not because the vaccine isn't effective. It's because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\" said Offit, who wasn't involved with the study. \nMeasles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \"It's now spreading from one American to another.\" \nOffit, however, doesn't expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \"We used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \"Measles was a scourge in this country.\" \nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it's the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \"It's the canary in the coal mine,\" he said. \nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found. \nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said. \nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States. \nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said. \nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed. \nOffit said it's not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines. \nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don't see and using biological fluids most people don't understand, he said. \n\"It's not surprising there's been pushback. Vaccines are a victim of their own success,\" Offit said. \nThe report was published as a letter in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . \nMore information \nFor more information on measles, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul offit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "offit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakia clemmons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mmr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaccine education center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:59:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e874c9d680087a24e504fde8885f28e647ade31d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obJ30tkUmrSN7VTdzRzI16tdWkCTdelVluPf67nssIf4PNIF8f3RNaEGxLGJ97pKS.ukw6bJ3dsW.wn8ziJBNkSA--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "title_full": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "published": "2017-10-03T15:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e874c9d680087a24e504fde8885f28e647ade31d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obJ30tkUmrSN7VTdzRzI16tdWkCTdelVluPf67nssIf4PNIF8f3RNaEGxLGJ97pKS.ukw6bJ3dsW.wn8ziJBNkSA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 -- Career couch potatoes, take heart: Just one hour a week of any kind of exercise may lower your long-term risk for depression , new research suggests. \nThe finding comes from a fresh analysis of a Norwegian survey that tracked exercise habits, along with depression and anxiety risk, among nearly 34,000 adults. \nAfter a closer look at the data, a team of British, Australian and Norwegian analysts determined that people who engage in just an hour of exercise per week -- regardless of intensity level -- face a 44 percent lower risk for developing depression over the course of a decade than those who never exercise at all. \n\"The key finding from this study is that doing even a small amount of regular exercise seems to protect adults against future depression,\" said study author Samuel Harvey. \n\"This was not a case of more is better; the vast majority of the mental health benefits of exercise was realized when individuals moved from doing no regular activity to 1 or 2 hours per week,\" Harvey explained. \n\"Also, the mental health benefits were there regardless of the intensity of the physical activity,\" he added. \"There is great evidence that there are many physical health benefits to more regular exercise, but the mental health benefits leveled out after 2 hours.\" \nHarvey is an associate professor with the School of Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. \"The important point here is that any type of physical activity -- even just walking -- had similar levels of mental health benefits,\" he concluded. \nThe original survey was launched between 1984 and 1986. In that timeframe, participants (who were about 45 years old, on average) underwent physical exams, and filled out lifestyle and medical questionnaires. Mental health assessments were also completed. \nThe Norwegian pollsters conducted a follow-up survey between 1995 and 1997 among roughly two-thirds of the original participants. \nAbout 7 percent of those tracked through 1997 had developed depression, while about 9 percent had developed clinical levels of anxiety, the findings showed. \nExercise did not appear to have any impact on anxiety risk. But investigators found that, regardless of gender or activity intensity, regular exercise lasting at least an hour per week was linked to a lower risk for developing depression over time. \nThe study authors calculated that roughly 12 percent of the depression cases might have been prevented if those who had become depressed had previously routinely engaged in one hour of low-intensity activity a week. \nExercising more than one hour per week did not, however, appear to substantially decrease depression risk even further; the lion's share of the protective impact appeared to max out at the one-hour mark. \nBut as to how and why such a minimal amount of regular exercise might help stave off depression, the study team wrote that \"the bulk of the observed protective effect remains unexplained.\" And the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and lower risk of depression. \nHarvey and his colleagues reported their observations in the Oct. 3 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry . \nSimon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said that \"there are probably many mechanisms at play that could explain how this works. But it doesn't have the same effect on anxiety, so we just don't know yet exactly what's happening.\" \nHowever, Rego added, \"What we do know is that what they've identified is a very low bar of entry. We're talking about just an hour of activity a week. And it doesn't have to be vigorous or intense. You don't need to go out to a spin class or sign up for a running club.

Getting fit doesn't have to be expensive or complicated. In fact, it can be as simple as putting one foot in front of the other. \nStarting a walking program can get you on the path to better health. All you need to get going are supportive athletic shoes, comfortable clothes, a safe place to walk, and the OK from your doctor if you're out of shape or have any chronic conditions. \nWhen you're new to exercise, it's important to start slowly. Try walking for 5 to 10 minutes a day for the first few weeks. Gradually add more time and distance. Eventually, pick up the pace -- your goal is to walk briskly for at least 30 minutes on most days. \nOne way to help you stay motivated to reach your fitness goals is to keep track of how many steps you take each day. You can do this with an inexpensive pedometer or a fitness program on your smartphone or smartwatch. Aim to reach 10,000 steps. \nThat might sound like a lot, but you can add to your daily total in many small ways. Besides your daily walk, work in extra steps by moving whenever you can. Walk to your co-worker's desk to talk about that big project instead of sending an email. Take the stairs instead of the elevator whenever possible. \nWarm-ups and cool-downs are important parts of every fitness plan, even walking. Before and after your workout, walk slowly for 5 minutes. At the end of every walk, gently stretch your muscles. Don't skip these steps -- they can help prevent injury. \nFor fun and fitness, round up your office staff or some neighbors for a walking club. Walking in a group will also keep you motivated to continue. \nMore information \nThe U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases has more about the benefits of walking and how to create a daily walking program suited to beginners. \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. national institute of diabetes and digestive", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:59:07.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a4a3e8c10931c74eedb64a9ddca8a69d5aff0d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob6R_wUpJhCjd02BgZKy9OtCf5J2qSUViMf06D.FmSBGeOUyDRor.WP_A0JWm031sKjBN.kfc0kreniSUWM2n2HA--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "1 in 5 Have Been Hit By a Medical Error, Survey Shows", "title_full": "1 in 5 Have Been Hit By a Medical Error, Survey Shows", "published": "2017-10-03T12:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a4a3e8c10931c74eedb64a9ddca8a69d5aff0d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob6R_wUpJhCjd02BgZKy9OtCf5J2qSUViMf06D.FmSBGeOUyDRor.WP_A0JWm031sKjBN.kfc0kreniSUWM2n2HA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T12:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "1 in 5 Have Been Hit By a Medical Error, Survey Shows", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 -- One-fifth of American adults have been at the receiving end of a medical error, a new survey finds. \nThe nationwide poll included more than 2,500 adults. The survey also found that one in three people said another person whose care they were closely involved with had experienced a medical error. \nMost medical errors were associated with diagnosis and patient-provider communications. Outpatient settings were a common site of medical errors. \nOn average, respondents who experienced a medical error identified at least seven different factors that caused the error. Nearly half of those who noted an error told medical staff or other workers at the health care facility about it. \nMost people feel that health care providers have the prime responsibility for patient safety. But survey participants also said that patients and their families have a role, too. \nStill, most people said they didn't worry personally about patient safety, the survey found. \nWhen medical errors occur, they often have lasting impact on the patient's physical and emotional health, finances, or family relationships. \nThe survey was done by the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute and NORC at the University of Chicago. \n\"The survey results show that Americans recognize that patient safety is a critically important, but complex, issue,\" Dr. Tejal Gandhi, chief clinical and safety officer, IHI, and president of the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute, said in an organization news release. \nMore information \nThe American Academy of Family Physicians offers tips to prevent medical errors . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tejal gandhi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american academy of family physicians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ihi/npsf lucian leape institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ihi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:59:09.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66e460a795958b4eaea6e98138f370f3f5a369e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obNRHbPDwFSwEmQ5hAwkwu3xcRrOVjSEwbktED8BmQXd.dMAvjup_0lwfjUMtrsHd_jT85Gqjieq_g.TsV6OKx4Q--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Apologies Go a Long Way When Medical Errors Occur", "title_full": "Apologies Go a Long Way When Medical Errors Occur", "published": "2017-10-03T12:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66e460a795958b4eaea6e98138f370f3f5a369e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obNRHbPDwFSwEmQ5hAwkwu3xcRrOVjSEwbktED8BmQXd.dMAvjup_0lwfjUMtrsHd_jT85Gqjieq_g.TsV6OKx4Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T12:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Apologies Go a Long Way When Medical Errors Occur", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 -- Hospitals that take responsibility for medical mistakes aren't at increased risk for lawsuits or more expensive settlements, a new study finds. \nTo come to that conclusion, researchers reviewed 989 medical mistakes that occurred at six hospitals in Massachusetts between 2013 and 2015. The hospitals were part of a program that informs patients about medical errors, apologizes for them, pledges to investigate and correct the problem, and offers compensation. \nOnly 5 percent of the medical errors led to malpractice claims or lawsuits, according to the report. When the program led to compensation, the median payment was $75,000. In 2015, the median payment nationwide when plaintiffs won malpractice lawsuits was about $225,000. \nThe study was published Oct. 2 in the journal Health Affairs . \n\"Our findings suggest that communication-and-resolution programs will not lead to higher liability costs when hospitals adhere to their commitment to offer compensation proactively,\" lead author Michelle Mello, a professor of health research and policy, and of law at Stanford University in California, and colleagues wrote. \nMedical errors are a leading cause of death in the United States, and the lawsuits they can trigger are a major concern for hospitals and doctors, the study authors noted. \nNot only did the responsibility program examined in the study reduce liability costs, it also led to major improvements in patient safety, the researchers said. \n\"In these programs, hospitals scrutinize every serious harm event to answer the question, 'What can we learn?' \" Mello said in a university news release. \"Traditionally, a risk manager's focus has been on the patients who complain about the care or threaten to sue.

The TMV formulation was compounded by Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., located in Ledgewood, New Jersey. \nHORV is a rare, potentially blinding postoperative complication that has been observed in dozens of patients who have received intraocular injections of vancomycin (anti-infective) formulations toward the end of otherwise uncomplicated cataract surgeries. \nBACKGROUND : Many ophthalmologists use intraocular vancomycin during cataract surgery with the intent of preventing postoperative endophthalmitis. FDA is unaware of any adequately controlled studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of intraocular vancomycin in preventing endophthalmitis. There is no FDA-approved vancomycin formulation for intraocular injection. The formulation is usually prepared at the surgical site or obtained in advance of surgery from a compounding pharmacy. \nThe use of intraocular vancomycin has recently been associated with the newly described condition HORV. Characteristics of HORV include a delayed onset (up to three weeks) of sudden painless decreased vision, intraocular inflammation, intraretinal hemorrhage (bleeding within the retina), retinal vasculitis (inflammation within retinal vessels), vascular occlusion (blockage of retinal vessels), and retinal ischemia (lack of sufficient blood supply to the retina). If vancomycin is administered to both eyes, legal blindness is a likely consequence of HORV. \nNo cases of HORV were reported in a retrospective analysis of medical records of 922 patients (1541 eyes) who underwent cataract surgeries with intravitreal injections of compounded TMV formulations from November 2013 to December 2015. However, this chart review of non-controlled data is limited in its ability to identify rare events and may not necessarily be generalizable to a larger population who may undergo cataract surgery. The adverse event being reported here serves as a reminder that intraocular administration of vancomycin, including when the vancomycin is one of multiple active ingredients in a compounded drug, can result in HORV. \nRECOMMENDATION : The prophylactic use of intraocular vancomycin, alone or in a compounded drug combining multiple active ingredients, during cataract surgery is generally not recommended because of the risk of HORV. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:26:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d928785ca0aefb83eb08e92b0327624e0c2313b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obqJjY8sb3K7SD5brXtr9gGhdYgK4KG6T8dNhWbEIeBLD8geIOkAaXEf3oeoSdY9ahdpu2LlZPiK.8YQnHhMTKHsiyec0YFdbd5N.JfICVjRw-", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Americans More Open About Mental Health Issues, But Stigma Lingers", "title_full": "Americans More Open About Mental Health Issues, But Stigma Lingers", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 42, "comments": 0, "shares": 42}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d928785ca0aefb83eb08e92b0327624e0c2313b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obqJjY8sb3K7SD5brXtr9gGhdYgK4KG6T8dNhWbEIeBLD8geIOkAaXEf3oeoSdY9ahdpu2LlZPiK.8YQnHhMTKHsiyec0YFdbd5N.JfICVjRw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Americans More Open About Mental Health Issues, But Stigma Lingers", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 -- Americans may be more willing to talk about mental health issues these days, but misperceptions and stigmas persist, a new survey finds. \nThe survey, of more than 3,000 U.S. adults, found that 70 percent said they feel people are more open to discussing mental health compared with a decade ago. \nMost respondents also said they'd want to help a family member or friend struggling with depression or other mental health conditions. \nOn the other hand, age-old misperceptions were still common. Many people, for example, thought that mental health disorders were at least partially driven by \"personal failings.\" \n\"That's certainly disappointing,\" said Dr. Don Mordecai, director of mental health and addiction medicine services at Kaiser Permanente, in Oakland, Calif., which commissioned the poll. \n\"These are true brain conditions,\" Mordecai said, \"and we have to get away from the blaming.\" \nIn reality, he explained, mental health disorders are rooted in factors like genetics, traumatic experiences and imbalances in brain chemicals. \nDr. Jeffrey Borenstein, a psychiatrist who was not involved in the survey, agreed. \n\"Psychiatric conditions are not moral weaknesses or character flaws,\" said Borenstein, president of the New York City-based Brain & Behavior Research Foundation. \nBorenstein said he was surprised by how many survey respondents mistakenly believed that character was involved. Over 60 percent thought that personal weaknesses were at least partly responsible for depression, for example. \n\"We clearly have a long way to go in educating the public,\" Borenstein said. \"These conditions are equal to any other medical condition. In this case, the organ affected is the brain.\" \nThe poll, conducted online in August, included a nationally representative sample of just over 3,000 U.S. adults. \nWhen asked about the national climate around mental health, 70 percent said they thought Americans were now more open to discussing it. \nPeople also appeared willing to talk about their own struggles. Nearly 40 percent said they'd faced a mental health \"issue\" at some point, and nearly all of those people -- 92 percent -- had sought some kind of help. \nIn another positive finding, 70 percent of respondents said they would be comfortable offering support if someone they knew had a mental health condition. \nBut the poll also uncovered inconsistencies. \nThree-quarters of respondents felt at least somewhat informed about mental health conditions, while a similar percentage said the disorders should be treated no differently from physical health problems. \nYet they also thought personal character was a factor in many mental health conditions. Fully 80 percent thought that was true of people with alcohol or drug addiction. \nAnd a significant number thought \"most people\" with mental health disorders can get better on their own. That included one-quarter of millennials, Mordecai pointed out -- which is concerning. \n\"You wouldn't walk around with a broken leg, thinking, 'I'll just heal this myself,'\" he said. \nIn another concerning finding, more than half of respondents said they thought a family member or friend was silently struggling with a mental health condition -- out of \"fear of stigma\" or shame. \nIn those cases, Borenstein said, people can try to be proactive -- telling their friend that they are concerned and ready to offer help if it's wanted, for example. \nMordecai pointed to one of the bright spots in the survey: \"If you're dealing with a mental health issue, these results show that there are people around you who stand willing to help,\" he said. \nRecognizing when you have symptoms, and speaking up about it, are the first steps toward treatment and recovery, Mordecai said. \n\"We have effective treatments,\" he stressed -- from \"talk therapy\" to medications. \nBorenstein agreed. \"These are conditions that no one should be ashamed of,\" he said. \"It's very important that people seek help, or encourage others to seek help when they need it.\" \nMore information \nVisit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for more on mental health. \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeffrey borenstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don mordecai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mordecai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borenstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york city-based brain & behavior research foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:08:59.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "594ff4bc4501d28cd13ab3e267267b61dfc26d59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obPOXsbcqdIm7XXXAkVSDW56_dWPXks2UrZj6XpGS1q7X.R6LjHpTdQvpax2mbhjW0kiOGsWUs3dB6v8zaFg2UFg5hlhlPPfFe", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "title_full": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "594ff4bc4501d28cd13ab3e267267b61dfc26d59", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obPOXsbcqdIm7XXXAkVSDW56_dWPXks2UrZj6XpGS1q7X.R6LjHpTdQvpax2mbhjW0kiOGsWUs3dB6v8zaFg2UFg5hlhlPPfFe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 -- New research finds the number of American women who've lost their lives to breast cancer has fallen precipitously in the past 25 years, with more than 322,000 lives saved in that time. \nOverall, advances in care have led to a 39 percent drop in breast cancer deaths of between 1989 and 2015, according to new research from the American Cancer Society (ACS). \nOne specialist who works with breast cancer patients daily was heartened by the news. \n\"Early screening and better treatments are finally starting to pay off with better outcomes,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \nHowever, the ACS was quick to point out that not every segment of Americans benefited equally. Despite some closure of the racial \"gap\" in breast cancer survival, black women are still more likely to die of the disease than their white peers, the study found. \nEven though the rate of breast cancer diagnosis was slightly lower among black women than whites between 2010 and 2014, over about the same time period, black breast cancer patients were still 42 percent more likely to die of the disease than their white peers. \nAccording to breast cancer specialist Dr. Cynara Coomer, that's probably due to a combination of factors. Black patients are more prone to be affected by aggressive, tough-to-treat breast tumors, she noted. But they also often lack access to the targeted treatments that can best fight these tumors. \nSo, when it comes to surviving breast cancer, \"there remains a disparity between black women and white women across the country,\" said Coomer, who directs the Florina Rusi-Marke Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. \nThe vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed among women aged 50 and older, the ACS found, and older women account for most deaths from the disease as well. \nStill, race seemed to play a role here, as well. The median age of diagnosis for women overall in the United States is 62, but the disease tends to strike black women at a younger age, the report showed. \nThe median age for breast cancer deaths is 68, but black patients died younger -- at 62, on average. \nAll of this means that, overall, breast cancer kills more black women than white women in the United States. \nThere was reason to hope, however, because this health disparity may be stabilizing in some parts of the country, the ACS said. For example, breast cancer death rates among black women ranged from 22 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the report found. \nBut in seven states the researchers saw no significant difference in death rates between black and white patients -- showing that the racial gap can be closed. \nWhile genetics and differences in overall health play a big role in the survival gap between blacks and whites, so do \"social and structural factors,\" said Carol DeSantis, of the ACS's surveillance and health services research branch. \n\"Increasing access to health care to low-income populations\" might shrink this racial gap even further across the country, she explained. \nCoomer agreed, saying that black women with aggressive tumors, in particular, \"would be better served with health care teams or centers that provide comprehensive breast treatment.\" \nAccording to Bernik, progress is being made. \n\"The fact that we are finally seeing a close in the gap between our excellent outcomes between black and white women is also encouraging,\" she said, \"especially since black women are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancers.\" \nExcluding skin cancers, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women, trailing only lung cancer. It's estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and 40,610 will die from the disease. \nThe research was published Oct. 3 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Breast Cancer Facts & Figures . \nMore information \nThe U.S. National Cancer Institute provides more information on breast cancer . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coomer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie bernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carol desantis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cynara coomer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rusi-marke comprehensive breast center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staten island university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:09:00.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd46c8665750d3299a462892861fd925d12fba39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob6k4Wu8KgylQ41LlB4bXdnX.PDV5Axvi143rJ5Urqj.XSDub_P2hZzbT20Dr6LTfy", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "title_full": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd46c8665750d3299a462892861fd925d12fba39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob6k4Wu8KgylQ41LlB4bXdnX.PDV5Axvi143rJ5Urqj.XSDub_P2hZzbT20Dr6LTfy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 -- There's a link between obesity and 40 percent of all the cancers diagnosed in the United States, health officials reported Tuesday. \nThat doesn't mean too much weight is causing all these cancer cases, just that there's some kind of still-to-be explained association, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nStill, the study findings suggest that being obese or overweight was associated with cancer cases involving more than 630,000 Americans in 2014, and this includes 13 types of cancer. \n\"That obesity and overweight are affecting cancers may be surprising to many Americans. The awareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and overweight is not yet widespread,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC deputy director, said during a midday media briefing. \nThe 13 cancers include: brain cancer ; multiple myeloma; cancer of the esophagus; postmenopausal breast cancer; cancers of the thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus and colon, the researchers said. \nSpeaking at the news conference, Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said early evidence indicates that losing weight can lower the risk for some cancers. \nAccording to the new report from the CDC and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, these 13 obesity-related cancers made up about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014. \nAlthough the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, increases in overweight and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress, the researchers said. \nOf the 630,000 Americans diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight or obesity in 2014, about two out of three occurred in adults aged 50 to 74, the researchers found. \nExcluding colon cancer , the rate of obesity-related cancer increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. During the same time, rates of non-obesity-related cancers dropped, the findings showed. \nIn 2013-2014, about two out of three American adults were overweight or obese, according to the report. \nFor the study, researchers analyzed 2014 cancer data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and data from 2005 to 2014. \nKey findings include: Of all cancers, 55 percent in women and 24 percent in men were associated with overweight and obesity. Blacks and whites had higher rates of weight-related cancer than other racial or ethnic groups. Black men and American Indian/Alaska Native men had higher rates of cancer than white men. Cancers linked to obesity increased 7 percent between 2005 and 2014, but colon cancer decreased 23 percent. Screening for colon cancer is most likely the reason for that cancer's continued decline, Schuchat said. Cancers not linked to obesity dropped 13 percent. Except for colon cancer, cancers tied to overweight and obesity increased among those younger than 75. \nThe new report was published online Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . \nDr. Farhad Islami is strategic director of cancer surveillance research for the American Cancer Society. \nHe said it's \"important to note that only a fraction of the cancers included in the calculation in this report are actually caused by excess body weight.\" \nAccording to Islami, \"many are attributable to other known risk factors, like smoking, while for many others, the cause is unknown. Obesity is more strongly associated with some cancers than others.\" \nThe World Cancer Research Fund estimates that \"20 percent of all cancers in the United States are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol, and poor nutrition. The American Cancer Society is currently doing its own extensive calculation of the numbers and proportions of cancer cases attributable to excess body weight, the results of which will be published soon,\" he said. \nMore information \nLearn more about cancer and obesity at the U.S. National Cancer Institute . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "farhad islami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schuchat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne schuchat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa richardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "world cancer research fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cancer prevention and control", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:09:01.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bcd60fe0476b2a0e36ccee5b5db51b8b6b42ad5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obU6iAfoQfZkAvQUBwA8jF9MxWyX9XGRuAreaQzWwPT1ythx9d0jl9ZpffO2H_ebac", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Blood Thinners Can Come With Dangerous Side Effects", "title_full": "Blood Thinners Can Come With Dangerous Side Effects", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 48, "comments": 0, "shares": 48}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bcd60fe0476b2a0e36ccee5b5db51b8b6b42ad5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obU6iAfoQfZkAvQUBwA8jF9MxWyX9XGRuAreaQzWwPT1ythx9d0jl9ZpffO2H_ebac", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Blood Thinners Can Come With Dangerous Side Effects", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 -- Blood-thinning drugs can save your life by preventing a heart attack or stroke caused by artery-blocking blood clots. \nBut these are powerful drugs, and a pair of new studies detail side effects people need to understand before taking them. \nThe effectiveness of a class of blood thinners called nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) can be significantly altered through interaction with other drugs, the first study reveals. \nIn some cases, these drug interactions increase a person's risk of life-threatening bleeding in locations such as the brain and gastrointestinal tract. In other cases, the NOACs' effectiveness is reduced, robbing patients of some protection against stroke and heart attack. \n\"NOACs alone do not pose a significant risk of bleeding, but the concurrent use of NOACs with certain drugs that share the same metabolic pathways may cause increased risk of major bleeding,\" said study lead researcher Dr. Shang-Hung Chang, an associate professor of cardiology with Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taoyuan, Taiwan. \nMeanwhile, a second study found that blood thinners can greatly increase a person's risk of finding blood in their urine. \nAs a result, patients might unnecessarily wind up in the hospital or emergency room, or undergo an unneeded invasive procedure, said senior researcher Dr. Robert Nam. He is a professor of surgery and head of genitourinary oncology with Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto. \n\"Patients and physicians need to discuss this, to try and prevent patients having to be hospitalized or come to the emergency room in the middle of the night,\" Nam said. \nThe first study looked at the bleeding risk associated with NOAC drugs dabigatran ( Pradaxa ), rivaroxaban ( Xarelto ) and apixaban ( Eliquis ). \nThese drugs are primarily used to prevent risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation, an abnormal heart rhythm that can cause blood to pool and clot inside the heart, said Dr. Deepak Bhatt. A spokesman for the American Heart Association, he is also executive director of interventional cardiovascular programs at Brigham and Women's Hospital's Heart & Vascular Center in Boston. \nNOACs are being used more frequently because they're easier to use and produce fewer side effects than warfarin , an older anticoagulant that has many food and drug interactions, said Bhatt. \nChang and his colleagues also decided to investigate whether NOACs might have previously unknown interactions with other commonly used medications. The team analyzed health data on 91,330 Taiwanese patients with atrial fibrillation who were prescribed an NOAC. \nThe investigators found that bleeding risk increased significantly when NOACs were used in combination with amiodarone, fluconazole, rifampin and phenytoin -- four drugs that treat widely different conditions. \nThe researchers also found that other drugs dampened the effectiveness of NOACs, including atorvastatin , digoxin , and erythromycin or clarithromycin . \nBhatt said he's particularly concerned about the effect of atorvastatin ( Lipitor ) on NOACs' effectiveness. \n\"That's a very commonly prescribed cholesterol-lowering drug, especially now that it's generic,\" Bhatt said. In fact, the researchers found that atorvastatin was the drug most commonly prescribed alongside an NOAC. \n\"That's a big deal because that means all those patients on both drugs have a lower risk of bleeding, but on the flip side then would have a higher risk of stroke,\" Bhatt said. \nThe second study found that people are much more likely to go to the hospital for blood in their urine if they're taking blood thinners. \nNam and his colleagues examined medical data on 2.5 million Ontario residents, including nearly 809,000 who had been prescribed a blood thinner. \nDuring an average follow-up period of 7 years, people on blood thinners were six to 10 times more likely to wind up hospitalized or in the ER complaining of blood in their urine compared with others not taking the drugs, Nam said. \nAlthough blood in urine is alarming and requires investigation, Nam said the side effect is not immediately dangerous. Patients should be informed of the potential for blood in the urine, and counseled what to do if it occurs. \n\"The result of these findings should not affect the decision to treat with these drugs,\" Nam said. \"The benefits outweigh the risks. These are not life-threatening complications. Patients should not stop taking these drugs because of the potential side effect.\" \nIn at least one way, this side effect can be welcome, said Dr. Vincent Bufalino, an AHA spokesman and cardiologist in Naperville, Ill. \n\"Blood thinners can be an advantage because when they cause bleeding in someone on a normal dose, usually there's a medical issue,\" Bufalino said. \"It actually helps you uncover a problem.\" \nThe researchers found that rates of bladder cancer detection were twice as high in people taking blood thinners compared to the general population. The drugs made the tumor produce more blood, Nam said. \n\"Because it bled, they went in, looked, and found the bladder cancer and were able to get it earlier than would have happened waiting for a patient to develop symptoms on their own,\" Bufalino said. \"In many of these circumstances, the cancers would have been missed until they were more advanced because the patient wouldn't have known there was a problem.\" \nThe two studies were published in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . \nMore information \nTo learn more about blood thinners, visit the American Heart Association . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bufalino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eliquis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert nam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shang-hung chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deepak bhatt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent bufalino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "sunnybrook health sciences center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradaxa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chang gung memorial hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heart association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brigham and women's hospital's heart & vascular center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naperville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taoyuan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ontario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:09:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da94abccafc56ea1d3d1afa59f7311c960237a27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obqJjY8sb3K7SAQ.wvB632cjyuxkjE6ztVuiAMQ_5HhDPilwdHEaYp3ToYFSv0RAvYvYWDLIo90Gh2m0S_aGUHwf3TjYywNOCvMSbLN.KlyLE-", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "http://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Americans' Health Woes May Have Swayed 2016 Presidential Election", "title_full": "Americans' Health Woes May Have Swayed 2016 Presidential Election", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da94abccafc56ea1d3d1afa59f7311c960237a27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obqJjY8sb3K7SAQ.wvB632cjyuxkjE6ztVuiAMQ_5HhDPilwdHEaYp3ToYFSv0RAvYvYWDLIo90Gh2m0S_aGUHwf3TjYywNOCvMSbLN.KlyLE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Americans' Health Woes May Have Swayed 2016 Presidential Election", "text": "  Americans struggling with health issues may have been more likely to vote Republican in the last presidential election than they were four years earlier, a new study indicates. \n\"Across the country, we found that voters in counties with poor public health shifted dramatically towards the Republican candidate in 2016, compared with 2012, an effect that was particularly strong in states where the results changed Electoral College votes,\" said study author Dr. Jason Wasfy, from the division of cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. \n\"Although we cannot determine causality from these results, the findings raise the possibility of a role for public health status in determining voting behavior,\" Wasfy said in a hospital news release. \nPrevious studies have shown that poor mental and physical health, particularly among older people, keeps voters from casting their ballots in political elections. \nSurprising shifts among voters in several states in 2016, including Texas and Wisconsin, prompted researchers to examine the potential effect that public health may have had on voting patterns. \nThe research team from the hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology reviewed voter turnout and election results for more than 3,000 counties. That's about 95 percent of American counties. \nThis information was compared to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health information compiled by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Specifically, the researchers considered health issues, such as the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, lack of food, teen birth rates and death rates. \nThe study showed 88 percent of counties shifted towards Donald Trump in 2016 compared to Mitt Romney in 2012. The counties that shifted toward Trump tended to be rural, predominantly white, lower-income and in the West and Midwest. \nThe counties that leaned towards Trump had less violent crime but faced higher teen birth rates and age-adjusted death rates than other counties. These counties also had fewer primary care doctors per person and other health care resources than the voters who didn't favor Trump, the analysis showed.

But New Yorkers are within 3.2 miles of a clinic, while Wyoming residents must travel nearly 170 miles to access these services, according to researchers from the Guttmacher Institute in New York City. \n\"How far a woman has to travel for an abortion is a key measure of access, alongside stigma, restrictive laws and financial constraints,\" said study author Jonathan Bearak. \n\"Our findings illustrate the vast differences in access to abortion mapped across the U.S., with women in remote, rural areas facing the longest journeys for an abortion,\" Bearak added. \nThe study results were published Oct. 3 in The Lancet Public Health . \nLaws in 14 states require that women have in-person counseling followed by an 18- to 72-hour waiting period before an abortion, the researchers noted. This can pose a substantial barrier \"as women in these areas may also need to travel to and from the clinic twice,\" Bearak said in a journal news release. \nFor the study, researchers mapped the population of women of childbearing age and then looked at publicly accessible abortion clinics. They calculated how far the women would have to travel in each state and county. \nThe researchers found that on average in 2014: Women in 23 states were within 15 miles of a clinic. In 16 states, the average distance was within 29 miles, while women in eight states averaged 30 to 89 miles away from an abortion clinic. Some women in three states are more than 90 miles away from an abortion clinic. In remote areas of South Dakota, an abortion clinic could be more than 330 miles away. Between 2011 and 2014, the average distance to an abortion clinic increased by at least 30 miles for women living in remote counties in Texas, Iowa, Montana and Missouri. All of these states, except for Iowa, tightened laws restricting access to abortion, according to the study. On the flip side, the average distance to an abortion clinic for women in Kansas and Maine was significantly reduced. \nNearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and 42 percent of these end in an abortion, the authors noted. \n\"This study tells only part of the story. For women seeking specific types of providers, such as those who accept Medicaid, do abortions at later gestations, or are hospital-based, the distance might be even longer,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a commentary linked to the study. \n\"Because provider availability decreases with each week of gestation, even a week's delay can reduce the number of providers substantially,\" Upadhyay wrote. \nMore information \nThe U.S. National Library of Medicine provides more information on abortion  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:33:24.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f3a9c8b6beeed4fdceb80b34d13262c48e32acd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob5c0t.cDTmIq4Z52EAxkAHhNY24BmUdJ.kEmeF6snuOfxvWbJUwgCE2IWBtS.oLuCVclct53WQmPhwxUtQBg6nA--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "http://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Puppy Poop Infections Now Affecting 55 People in 12 States", "title_full": "Puppy Poop Infections Now Affecting 55 People in 12 States", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 26, "comments": 0, "shares": 26}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f3a9c8b6beeed4fdceb80b34d13262c48e32acd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob5c0t.cDTmIq4Z52EAxkAHhNY24BmUdJ.kEmeF6snuOfxvWbJUwgCE2IWBtS.oLuCVclct53WQmPhwxUtQBg6nA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Puppy Poop Infections Now Affecting 55 People in 12 States", "text": "  Cute, yes, but touching them might send you to the hospital. \nPuppies are transmitting potentially deadly Campylobacter bacteria infections via contaminated poop to the humans who handle them, with 55 people now sickened in an outbreak reaching across 12 states. \nIn the latest update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency says cases rose from 39 in mid-September to 55 reported by Tuesday. \n\"Evidence suggests that puppies sold through Petland are a likely source of this outbreak,\" the CDC said in a news release issued Sept 11. \"Petland is cooperating with public health and animal health officials to address this outbreak.\" \nSince mid-September, \"four more hospitalizations have been reported, bringing the total to 13,\" the CDC said in its Tuesday update, but so far \"no deaths have been reported.\" \nCampylobacter infections linked to the puppies have now been reported between September 2016 and October 2017 in Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming, the CDC said. \nCampylobacter is a bacteria that causes people to develop diarrhea (sometimes bloody), cramping, abdominal pain and fever within two to five days of exposure to the organism, said Dr. Sophia Jan, director of general pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. \nThis is a common cause of diarrhea in the United States, she said. \n\"The illness typically lasts about a week without treatment,\" Jan said. But for people with compromised immune systems, campylobacter infections can be life-threatening, she added. \nMost cases in humans occur from eating raw or undercooked chicken, or eating foods that have been cross-contaminated by infected poultry products, Jan noted. \nHowever, humans can get infected from contact with the stool of an infected puppy, she added. \nMany of the people sickened in this outbreak were Petland employees, while others had either bought a Petland puppy, shopped at Petland or visited someone who had purchased a puppy from Petland, the CDC said. \nInfected dogs may or may not show signs of illness, such as diarrhea, vomiting or a fever, so it's important to take precautions when around dogs, the CDC says. \nTo prevent catching campylobacter from dogs, the CDC advises that you: Wash your hands thoroughly after touching dogs, their poop, or their food. Take extra care that children wash their hands carefully after playing with puppies or dogs. Pick up and dispose of dog poop, especially in areas where children might play.

Acute episodes of heart failure account for more than 1 million hospitalizations each in the United States and Europe a year. \nSpanish Ministry of Health researchers led by Oscar Miro of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona used 13 factors to assess death risk in these patients. These factors included age, systolic (top number) blood pressure reading, respiratory rate, potassium level, and Barthel index score at admission, which is a scale used to assess mobility and independent daily living. \nThe researchers tested their model in more than 4,700 patients in Spain from 2009 to 2011 and validated them in another group of patients three years later. \nThe assessment was highly accurate in predicting 30-day death risk, the researchers said. This was especially true among the 10 percent of patients at very high risk (about 45 percent) and the 40 percent of patients at low risk (less than 2 percent). \nAbout 9 out of 10 acute heart failure patients visit the ER for their symptoms, but emergency physicians currently don't classify these patients based on death risk, the study team noted. \nThere are several risk scores available, but a more reliable tool is needed, the researchers said. \nThe study results were published Oct. 2 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine . \nMore information \nThe U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more on heart failure . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barthel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "annals of internal medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blood institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar miro of hospital clinic of barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:53:24.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66f04ae3af315e6e13e78bc17c8c128b35b15f4e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc9.u8fH_gRhGXmg_TryxnnOy9iBkfXi7Rjvu2z2x9R93O3gI_54r52wNpJjtXqB8PWgwGVJvyL26pE1klgDXEIHVeskW6qaQS8KoZzBa8WGkI68xmF6yknpk", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/forum/need-talk/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Need to Talk?", "title": "Norco quit 4th time hopefully last - help / advice please - Page 3", "title_full": "Norco quit 4th time hopefully last - help / advice please - Page 3", "published": "2017-09-24T17:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 26, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6d10a95e6ad77f6cf220cdd36cd3bb3a95af38d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc9.u8fH_gRhGXmg_TryxnnOy9iBkfXi7Rjvu2z2x9R93O3gI_54r52wNpJjtXqB8PWgwGVJvyL26pE1klgDXEIHVeskW6qaQS8KoZzBa8WGkIznA56suLzUNVo0.zB0CIGeKGHA4wUv9Iw--", "ord_in_thread": 24, "author": "Jelm6", "published": "2017-10-03T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Not doing great.

Valdoxan works in the melatonin receptors. I have just started today and I've yet to take the Valdoxan - after dinner, but it sounds like an interesting combo.

It may be temporary, but it's a change I'm happy to feel. All other issues persist and are possibly getting worse. But I'm happy for any positive change at this point.\nThanks for the suggestions.

I can't seem to wrap my head around how every time I went in to refill my script for Percocets they acted like I was breaking into Fort Knox, but people can go around and buy guns and thousands of rounds of ammo. It's a huge problem we're facing in this country, and I can see why you took to Starbucks and eating the wrong foods. It's not a very nice world we are living in.\nThat said, I love how you went and found the beauty that surrounded you. I think that is the real key to happiness. Finding your \"love of the day\", your \"song of the day\", your \"nature of the day\", etc. - we all need to embrace those moments of beauty, however fleeting they may be. And to continue to lift each other up, after these senseless acts of violence, after natural disasters, or even when it's not so much on a national / international level, but a friend to friend basis. If we take the time to care for and about each other, life gets easier.\nNow tell me about your daughter's homecoming dress. You know I majored in fashion design the first two years of college, so I want to hear ALL about the dress! Is girlfriend excited?

Of course that would be my song. It's been the story of my life. Only now do I realize it's another 1 of those 4 Me by Me songs. I can't believe I've done myself dirty all these years. I just pray I continue to have the endurance to keep stepping forward.\nThis past week has me Free Falling. I dug out Pandora box & had a hard time getting it shut. A lot of emotions that I thought would remind me of how far I've come only reminded me of just where I am.\nTo add to that I started to revisit some old habits. Nothing serious just all warning signs I placed up for myself. Stuff like Starbucks Mocha energy drinks, doughnuts, chocolate milk, the news, & Facebook. I over did it in the sun & then stuffed junk in my gut so physically I was off SOOOO of course once I added social justice to the mix- GAME OVER. I got myself all out of whack.\nOn the bright side, I realize it. Not so bright side- am I doing anything about it? Yes, I've justified it!!! This is bad, I know.\nNo, but really, I'm trying to fight thru it & get myself back in balance. I unplugged from the news again & limited my cyberspace time. This helped me rein back in some of the energy that was automatically released.\nYour post from the other day was a chiller thriller. I hate to even remember those little pills. I don't want to feel that kind of anxiety ever again. I don't ever want to feel like that again. I guess if I remember them like that it's good thing.\nI guess the moral of the story is to be aware of the energy around you. Be aware of the energy you receive & give out. Lack of the right kind of energy can throw you off balance & it quickly snowballs from there.\nToday....today was supposed to be uber strressful (or so I had it built up in my mind to be). No money to be found, 1 cigarette left, trip to moms to do her carpets, play date, girls from school, & dress alteration for homecoming this weekend. All to be done today & of course I over slept!!! Well, not by 2 much, I did have 5 minutes to make a coffee b4 the Magic Bus pulled out.\nMy day has been so busy that I'm just now getting the chance to realize what an amazing day it has been. Got everything knocked off the list minus the alterations (will find out here soon about that) & it's not even tune to start dinner. I'm sure by the time I finish this post it will be- but until then I'm suckin up all the Me time I can get.\nYou know I'm sitting out her swinging on my hammock. The birds are signing & the cars going by in the distance sound like waves. Right in my view are 2 Jinormace red banana tress, so it's easy for me to pretend I'm in the tropics. I really do have a slice of life here. Just as I said that a helicopter flew over my house, looked like it was tree level!!!! Scary exciting- but WOW! I'm a distance away from a military airport but I'm on their landing path so there's always something interesting flying over. We're also on the flight path that a hot air ballon takes. Sometimes it lands in the church field by the house so it gets so low we can wave at the people inside. If that's not enough for ya, there's train tracks near by. You can see it from the front but the backyard is the best view. Some years back my son & I got to see the Ringling brothers train come through. The best part is it's a dead end street. I love this part b/c I know who belongs down here & who doesn't. My house was built of a farm & the original farm house still sits on the corner. Lol- I'm right on the other side of the tracks off the beatin path. How true. Thing blew up out here in my burbs- just about every bit of farm land has been replaced with houses or business. I'm right here in the cut, my hood is from the 70's & has wide open spaces. I could go on & on but I won't- lol! Just trying to soak it all in b4 it all dies for the winter. It's already a war zone out here under these Oaks & kamikaze acorns rain down. I'm convinced that It's either the Blue Jays or the Crows throwing them at me. Bet not be my squirrels- they should know I'm on their side when it comes to Mr. Wonderful.\nSo that's that in a nutshell (pun intended grin).\nOff to go create something in the kitchen- other than a mess.

I got shorted on the fashion genes also. Myself, I'm a basic black & denim kind of girl. My dream is to one day own a denim sectional (heart eyes).\nGirlfriend is the same, her style is comfy with a flare of casual every now & then. She's also a stressor & worrier like me. I've tried my best to keep all the girls on task so the day of we can cut loose & cut up (insert DQ twirl). This is her senior year soooo we gotta make it count. Thankfully, she shops like her father. She found the dress, shoes, & accessories at one spot & we were in & out scoring everything on her list. Only issue is the dress. My mom spoke her Debbie Downer speak on the dress & as always it's the last minute & we wait. Girlfriend was betrayed (blessed I say) by her hips & booty. We just need a little nip tuck up top & we'll be straight. Seamstress I am not. My MIL was my go to but we have not seen or spoken to her in a year. All good thou, I found someone & keeping positivity it will be done by Saturday.\nOk, so the dress! It's a short little number, strapless w/an off the shoulder cuff??? Idk what u call them but they're there for looks only nothing functional about them. It's a dark emerald green velvet with taupe & mauve flowers. She's a redhead so that in itself pops it off. The shoes are nude 6 inch stilettos (worried face). Like I said she's a jeans & tshirt kind of gal & has only been in heals a handful of times. I think I came out the womb in heels & I'm afraid of them bad boys. I've been making her practice in them. They have a strap across the toes & a strap around the ankle. What worries me most is that she broke hear ankle in a car accident (with the Amigas) & has 2 screws on one side & 1 on the other. Let's all pray that the gym floor is sticky & not wet.\nShe's going all natural with the hair- down & curly. A d....the make up I was about to send the Magic Bus 4 you but I was able to secure a glam squad. Thankfully my niece has a change of plans & fit us in. Thanks & praises b/c girlfriend is talking cut creases to bring out her good & fake lashes & I don't even know what else. It is only obvious that I have no clue when it comes to make up. Give me my pressed powder, mascara, & some gloss & I'll be straight. I've dibbled & dabbled with the contouring & highlighter stuff but am in no way selfie ready.\nThe date???? I so love this Sweet Child of Mine!!! She has a BF but she dies an awesome job dividing her time between him & her Che's. The 3 Musketeers are no longer & she is back with her OG's. They're making a Girl's night if it. They said it was it was a no brainier since that's how they've rocked it since freshman year.\nWow! I just realized this will be my first homecoming where I don't have to worry about counting, cutting, & rationing pills! Give Thanks & Praises for that. I also want to give Thanks & Praises to her Guardian Angels for watching over her & guiding her while I was on some straight BS!\nHope I didn't leave any details out. I think I covered it head to toe. I'm pretty sure she'll get excited day of. For me, I'm excited & been excited. I'm trying to fine tune some dance moves just in case we run short of laughs. Keep watch on Facebook just in case I go viral! Just playin- I'm from the old school- no video proof of anything!\nMemories,\nDQ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:44:40.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ff1b0901388a3908e9c02baba4648bc9597929a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc9_DJ89CZBUpB8wTMqCNIX._O.qL29X.UrwU2nz2MxKscit0DVja3y65", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/forum/need-talk/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Need to Talk?", "title": "Me, Myself & I - Page 5", "title_full": "Me, Myself & I - Page 5", "published": "2017-09-07T22:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 27, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49e3edce6951c0bb9b90e66d0adc5467b3a8562d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc9_DJ89CZBUpB8wTMqCNIX._O.qL29X.UrwU2nz2MxKscj2RF6nMN21tMl_yXqzrDTRCp4eR20wpTg--", "ord_in_thread": 27, "author": "blondie50ish", "published": "2017-10-04T10:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Hey CC, I'm a denim lover too. Love all manner of denim - have an affinity for all things jeans whether it be jeans, jean skirts, jean purses, jean vests, jean jackets. Forever in blue jeans, that is me and my DQ! Why does that not surprise me.\nI love fabric in general. All sorts of fabric. I'm not a really fancy person myself, especially as I'm older as the newest fads,etc., don't work for me anymore. But I love dressing other people. I had two sons which is probably good for my overall financial well being - I have nieces I have spent boatloads on over the years, simply because I see things that would be perfect for them and can't resist buying.\nGirlfriend's dress sounds gorgeous. I love emerald green, and it's such a beautiful color for the fall and winter seasons. And there is not a better color for a redhead.\nOK for the heels - does she have a lower heel she can wear, or is it just the stilettos? It may be hard for her to walk in 6 inch stilettos if she has not worn heels before, especially with the ankle injury. They have so many cute shoes out now that have the platform bottom but still have the stiletto heel. Much easier to walk in then those with the thin soles. The other option is a kitten heel, super cute for young women and easier to walk in. If she has her heart set on the stilettos have her just keep practicing heel toe heel toe, with small slow steps. They also have those cute ballet slipper thingies you can stuff in a bag or a clutch, they fold up, she could throw one in her bag just in case.\nAs for the makeup, you are probably better than you know at makeup. It's not hard to do. There are a ton of youtube tutorials out there on how to do contouring, cut crease, fake lashes, etc. I wish I had got on the youtube train way back when, these girls are making bank showing makeup tips and they aren't even real makeup artists!\nI am so glad to hear she is giving as much times to her OGs as she is her BF. That is always good to hear. I always remind my nieces of my 40+ year friendships I share with 3 other women - we have about 8 marriages between us, haha, none of them have lasted but our friendships sure have! Sistas before mistas!\nCan't wait to hear more about homecoming. Hope alterations, makeup and hair go without incident. What is she doing with her hair? Some of the intricate hairstyles/updos I see these girls wearing for homecoming, wow, now that is a talent I wish I had. My son had his senior prom a couple of years ago and went with a girl who had butt length long hair - she went to someone who put it up in this fancy updo, it was gorgeous.. Took the woman like 1 1/2 hours to do - she only paid $50 which I thought was amazingly reasonable. Really sweet for special occasions.\nMy advice is to take a ton of pictures and/or videos - they grow up so fast and we are lucky to live in an age where we can capture it all on video and/or film.\nLove ya girl.

In regards to rls, I had that throughout the night that lasted for a couple months, but mind you I was coming off Methadone. Ugh, terrible time. I know rls all too well. Anyway, it did subside and for a while now I only get it when the sun comes up. I know there is still some healing that Is taking place, so I'm just waiting for this final symptom to pass. Again, it's only early morning that I get it and I can sleep okay during the night without any rls issues so it's not too bad and is bearable.

I am an extremely private person who used to wear my heart and soul on my sleeve, before the darkness hit. My parents divorced when I was young. They were amicable. No courts. Just two people who respected each other enough to not impact us kids as much as possible, by doing their best. That meant I was a latch-key kid since both my parents worked and so my sister, who is 7 years older, would walk me home from daycare/kindergarten every day (until she got her license) and be with me all day during summers and breaks. My sister is my half sister, though I've never looked at her as anything but my sister. When my parents married she was two and my father legally adopted her. He loved her as his own. The unfortunate situation with her biological father was that he simply didn't want her and left my mom eight months pregnant. But his parents and family did want to know her. So she would spend a few weeks every summer with her biological grandparents. I always remember being jealous that I never got to go. But he would be there...every year...and never look or talk to her like she was his. So my sister grew up a very unhappy, emotionally blocked young woman with the self esteem level of zero. She was kind of short and chunky until she hit her junior year and grew to 5'9 and everything \"evened out\". After that her self esteem issues showed in other ways but got better after that. She resented me. She hated me with a passion. I don't know if it was because my dad was my real dad, though honestly NEVER showed a difference in love or affection. But my sister wouldn't let anyone hug her as a young adult, just my mom. She would be so mean to me when they weren't around and ignore me when not spewing things to make sure I was a \" spoiled brat who no one liked and yadda yadda\". But when you are 5 and you hear that more than anything because your parents are barely around... I really think it affected me. Then the sexual abuse started. She would make me do things to her. I remember being a happy child that loved Jesus and wanted to do something great with my life, even at the age of 4 I remember telling my mom I wanted to be a saint so that Jesus would never get mad at me. I wasn't scared of anything because I had my mom and dad and even my sister, though she hated me. I always knew, even that young, that it wasn't personal. I knew something was wrong or something had happened to make her shell up the way she did around the time of sexual abuse starting that summer. Yes, we were kids. But not really. She was 13 years old. I was 6. She made me mad one day in the car home with my mom and like any younger sibling tried to think of the only thing I had on her to get her back. So I told my mom about our \"game\". I remember sitting in the middle seat in the back looking forward and seeing my mom's demeanor change and look at my sister, who was looking forward, and asked her if it was true. Of course she said no and I was making it up. All the way home my mom was telling me how much trouble I was about to be in when we got home and I was pleading and crying that I was telling the truth. And there's my psychopath sister, straightface and laughing in a \"uncomfortable\" way denying it. Needless to say I got in the most trouble of my young life. I had never even been grounded before. And I was getting spanked so hard I couldn't feel my butt and was just crying and swearing I was telling the truth. She told me how disgusting I was for making such a thing up.\nI changed that day. That day of betrayal. I saw my dad the next day as he was picking us up for the weekend and I was told to never speak of it again, so I didn't tell him. I told him, several before he died, when I was in my early 20s and he cried and just hugged me and said he wished he knew and he would have of course believed me because what six year old makes that up?!? My trust in women changed drastically. I was never a social butterfly again. I remember the daycare teacher asking my dad one Friday if something was wrong because I was playing with the rest of the kids like I used to. In retrospect, the signs were everywhere. All of this was blocked out by the way. It was apparently so traumatic for me that I pushed it out of my memory. I was in a deep therapy session once when I was 19 and my life was falling apart that all the memories came flooding back. I never went back to therapy after that day. I went there because I was emotionally having issues that were forming themselves physically. I was a pot smoking, drinking here and there , normal college girl. Then after that.... And after my dad, the man I lived with for 14 years, raised me after my mom got remarried when i was seven and moved two hours away, and was the closest to me in my life, married the one woman in the world threatened by me and hated me, resulting all the way to changing the dates of his funeral to where I couldn't be there....to a car accident that crushed my knee and simultaneously crushed my dream to be a EMT or walk for the next year...to finally discovering the world just beyond the pot. First is was pharmaceuticals. My doc was giving me xanax like candy for years and I was so depressed I was drinking on them and blacking out. After multiple trips in as many years to the ER for alcholo poisoning, not one family member or professional approached my self destruction. I met my husband and we did a lot of uppers together. Not like daily, but weekends. When I got pregnant, I quit everything and made it to five months, and we lost her. His family, being conservative Christian, told me it was for the best as they were removing my baby since she was still attached from the ambilical chord. I died a little that day. Over the following week I just wasn't feeling well. I thought it was the recovery and mental, so since I was depressed we did some powder. A couple days later my fever was so bad the thermometer kept reading error and could feel the heat off my body. The ER didn't even believe their machine... 105.1. I was septic. Since they didn't do a d&c after the miscarriage, I got an infection and had to be in the hospital for days with fluid antibiotics and blood transfusions. My sister actually visited me. You see, once we got older and she was becoming normal and wanting a relationship with me...I let that happen. I love my sister and have never talked to her about it. I think something happened to her, sexual abuse wise, and she casted her fear, loathing and hate onto me like she always did. I did approach my mom though and have come to realize that she was the one I was really mad at for not protecting me, listening to me and punishing me which has affected every female and sexual relationship Ive had my whole life. After 3 miscarriages, my husband and I decided to not have kids. We moved to get away from the drugs and start fresh with new memories. We moved across the country to where his family had moved. The first few years were great and drug free...will always smoke pot for my medical issues so that doesn't count to me. Then we realized after a few too many refills on a perk script that we were surrounded by them! Got a nasty, guilt ridden habit and tried to kick it with sub's. I have not had a perk in a year. The sub's I have to get on the street because I can't afford nor have time for therapy required sessions in clinics since I watch my autistic son during the day and work nights. When I run out of sub's for a day or two and can't find any, I am reminded that I'm an idiot and still addicted and now to something that will be harder to come off, especially since it helps my pain so well. Ive had unexplained health issues for years...almost a decade. Been working, if you call it that, with my primary to \"figure it out\". The idiot doesn't even know I take sub's because he has never even drug tested me. With all my symptoms an ER doc did a parasite test. I had one of the rarest parasite found in the US. In fact, it'd not even found here and all the cases in the US can be traced back to traveling to a place with this parasite in other parts of the world. And cannot be transmitted through human contact in any way. I dont travel. I have no idea how I got this. I was laughed at by the infectious disease specialist before the pathologist called him because he didn't believe it. Fortunately it is curable and even has a vaccine! However, chronic cases, like mine, the damage to the organs and tissue is done. And all the symptoms I have, I always will now. I went from 125lbs to weighing 85.3lbs yesterday. I haven't had a period in over a year. I can't move my joints or hands for at least an hour after I wake up and then just have annoying pain. I have a regular day and then my work day starts when my husband gets home and I go clean commercial buildings and offices. I currently have an order for some scans to assess the damage but my doc doesn't even like prescribing aspirin and since he didn't even know what the parasite was, shouldn't be the one to evaluate and look for damage. Got to love medicaid. I'm getting private insurance soon and can't wait! My father was in Vietnam, special forces. His parchute didn't open all the way his last jump and he landed in a bunch of trees for three days. So I've seen someone on pain meds their whole lives. His usage affected his emphysema so bad he caught pneumonia and died. I don't want to be reliant on anything to get through the day. At least anything that I won't tell if I don't take one the next day or two! I need it. My body needs it. My mind needs it. I'm down to 4mg a day. I was at 1mg last year and came back full force. I need to get down again. At least to where I can skip days. I know I might need something for pain but hear the smaller doses work better anyways. I really want off all together and really be able to assess my pain and symptoms. This is extremely hard for me and no one in my life, but my husband, knows this stuff... Any words of encouragement or just replying to talk about your struggles will help me!!\nThanks!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T23:39:38.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "93bc023ee4b7b700a42eaee69fd15a3c5cad1c93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc9.hbCjOTqv9YnxNXh6hzmM8zO5xCzI5mzHwLFoGrFXqa3aV8Qfd8LEvXRYHwhK6jjBeL.8zb508PFXgnLwopmLQOKMIP4EK0L3KpPGpe9F5bx4v0a.rixSh", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/forum/general-discussion-boards/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "General Discussion Boards", "title": "idk what I'm looking for anymore...support? someone who gives a hoot?", "title_full": "idk what I'm looking for anymore...support? someone who gives a hoot?", "published": "2017-10-04T09:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 1, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c2ffbcbecf76962d216e2991a2adc77e70c73653", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc9.hbCjOTqv9YnxNXh6hzmM8zO5xCzI5mzHwLFoGrFXqa3aV8Qfd8LEvXRYHwhK6jjBeL.8zb508PFXgnLwopmLQOKMIP4EK0L3KpPGpe9F5bykGKRJxgEyxfR6SNa5jjiQ54H9eTFDWkg--", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "sklingsheim", "published": "2017-10-04T10:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Something may have been confusing as I wasn't clear.

That compared with roughly 73 percent of rituximab patients, according to the report. \nCancer experts said the results, published in the Oct. 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , are a positive step forward. \nBut they do not necessarily mean obinutuzumab is the better choice for all patients, according to Dr. James Armitage, an oncologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha. \n\"Obinutuzumab had a modest advantage in progression-free survival,\" said Armitage, who co-wrote an editorial published with the study. \nBut the drug also tended to cause more side effects than rituximab, he pointed out. And no one knows yet whether it will ultimately help patients live longer. \nArmitage said \"reasonable people\" could disagree over which drug option is better. \nIn the United States, more than 72,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Follicular lymphoma accounts for roughly 20 percent of those cases. \nFollicular lymphoma is usually slow-growing and responds well to treatment, according to the ACS -- but most patients do eventually relapse. \nHowever, when rituximab became widely available back in 2000, it changed patients' prognosis, according to Armitage. \nThe drug is a lab-engineered antibody that latches onto a particular protein on B cells -- the type of white blood cell affected in follicular lymphoma. It's often used along with chemotherapy to get patients into remission; afterward, it can be used alone, as a longer-term \"maintenance\" therapy to keep the cancer at bay. \nWith that maintenance therapy, research has found, over 87 percent of patients are still alive after six years. \nStill, there's always a hope to do better, Armitage said. \nSo the new trial tested obinutuzumab as an alternative first-line therapy. Like rituximab, the drug is an antibody. It's already approved in the United States to treat follicular lymphoma patients who relapse or do not respond to rituximab. \nFor the study, researchers recruited 1,200 patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. One received chemotherapy plus rituximab, and if they responded, that was followed by rituximab maintenance for up to two years. \nPatients in the other group underwent a similar regimen, but with obinutuzumab. \nMost patients -- around 88 percent -- responded to the treatment, regardless of which antibody therapy was used. But obinutuzumab patients were more likely to be progression-free after three years, the study found. \nDr. Robert Marcus, the lead researcher on the study, said he thinks the results will have an immediate impact on \"real-world\" treatment. \nBased on the data so far, it's \"projected\" that patients on obinutuzumab could typically go more than nine years before seeing a progression, according to Marcus, of King's College Hospital, in London, England. \nThere are downsides, though. Both antibody drugs are given by infusion every couple of months. But obinutuzumab is more likely to cause serious infusion-related problems, including severe allergic reactions. \nThat happened to 59 percent of obinutuzumab patients in the trial, compared to 49 percent of rituximab patients. \nPlus, six patients on the drug developed a second blood cancer, while no patient on rituximab did, according to the report. \n\"That's a concerning finding that should be investigated further,\" Armitage said. \nWhen rituximab came on the scene, he noted, it made such a difference in patients' outlook, \"it changed everything.\" \nWith the newer antibody, though, the possible impact on treatment is tougher to predict, Armitage said. \n\"Incremental improvements are important, but it's less clear what to do with them,\" he explained. \nThe trial was funded by the pharmaceutical company Roche, which markets obinutuzumab under the brand name Gazyva. In August, the company announced it had submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have the drug approved as a first-line therapy for follicular lymphoma. \nMore information \nThe American Cancer Society has more on follicular lymphoma  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "non-hodgkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james armitage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armitage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert marcus", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "university of nebraska medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england journal of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king's college hospital", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "omaha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gazyva", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f3a99341747a59c0870714e8c562d1798ed99b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obY9kZla9d7FHBRqzms8q_UnKaQDdA.zyXrenvi4GAK9pSIrOAwx0el.rX_FZC_fVJkvkPcfiah.0-", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Too Little of This Vitamin Could Harm Young Hearts", "title_full": "Too Little of This Vitamin Could Harm Young Hearts", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f3a99341747a59c0870714e8c562d1798ed99b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obY9kZla9d7FHBRqzms8q_UnKaQDdA.zyXrenvi4GAK9pSIrOAwx0el.rX_FZC_fVJkvkPcfiah.0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Too Little of This Vitamin Could Harm Young Hearts", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- Bypassing leafy green veggies could take a toll on teens' heart health, new research suggests. \nTeens who ate the least vitamin K-rich foods -- such as spinach, cabbage, iceberg lettuce and olive oil -- had triple the risk for enlargement of the heart's left pumping chamber compared to their greens-eating peers, according to the study. \nChanges in the heart's left pumping chamber are usually seen in adults with chronic high blood pressure. Hearts that become bigger are less efficient and less effective, said the study authors from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. \n\"Those who consumed less [vitamin K] had more risk,\" Dr. Norman Pollock, the study's corresponding author, said in a university news release. \nFor the study, researchers asked 766 healthy teens, aged 14 to 18, to wear activity monitors for seven days and to record what they ate. Most participants tracked their diet for at least six days. The teens also underwent an echocardiography test to examine their left ventricle. \nOnly 25 percent of the study participants had even adequate intake of vitamin K, the researchers found.

It requires an outsized amount of oxygen and other nutrients,\" said Fargo, who wasn't involved with the study. \"Because of that, there's a very, very rich blood delivery system in the brain. Anything that happens to compromise that is going to compromise the overall health and function of the brain.\" \nBecause of that, it stands to reason that long-term exposure to high blood pressure could leave one more vulnerable to dementia as they enter old age, Gilsanz said. \nGilsanz and her colleagues reviewed the records of more than 5,600 patients of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system, tracking them from 1996 onward for an average 15 years to see who developed dementia. \nThey found that people with high blood pressure in their 30s did not appear to have any increased risk of dementia. \nBut women who developed high blood pressure in their 40s did have an increased risk of dementia, even after the researchers adjusted for other factors like smoking, diabetes and excess weight. \nHowever, the study did not prove that early high blood pressure caused dementia risk to rise in women, just that there was an association. \nMen did not have a similar risk from high blood pressure in their 40s, but that could be because they were more likely to die before they grew old enough to suffer from dementia, Gilsanz noted. \nOther factors such as genetic differences, lifestyle differences and sex-specific hormones also might separate men and women when it comes to dementia risk associated with high blood pressure, Fargo said. \n\"It's really interesting to see there was an association among women but not men,\" Gilsanz said. \"Given that women have higher rates of dementia than men, understanding why this may be is a large area of interest for us. Future research should really look at sex-specific pathways that might be at play, to disentangle the risk factors for men and women.\" \nFargo said it makes sense that people with long-term exposure to high blood pressure would be more likely to develop dementia. \n\"Your dementia risk is really a lifelong thing,\" Fargo said. \"People think about dementia in late life, because that's when it's common to see the clinical symptoms. But everything that is setting you up for cognitive decline is occurring throughout your life.\" \nBut Fargo sees this as an opportunity, given that high blood pressure can be controlled with medication and lifestyle changes. \n\"These modifiable risk factors are the most powerful weapons we have in our arsenal to fight dementia,\" he said. \"It's a target that is addressable.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the journal Neurology . \nMore information \nFor more on high blood pressure and dementia, visit the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fargo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilsanz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith fargo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paola gilsanz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente northern california division of research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alzheimer's association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns hopkins school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaiser permanente northern california", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:20.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72ddb5d3a49a99cd66f2bf3a0263548dee9ca7b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9objfAbqLbAST48sdfDPtYbwy42Xvj11YUcD5mkmf3PBIds0q4R49TpcimDDVix8xWM3.cT59kczqB0GLo7aETerUSX1lNtSQ1X", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Antibody Injections in Pregnancy Might Shield Fetus From Zika", "title_full": "Antibody Injections in Pregnancy Might Shield Fetus From Zika", "published": "2017-10-04T17:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72ddb5d3a49a99cd66f2bf3a0263548dee9ca7b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9objfAbqLbAST48sdfDPtYbwy42Xvj11YUcD5mkmf3PBIds0q4R49TpcimDDVix8xWM3.cT59kczqB0GLo7aETerUSX1lNtSQ1X", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T17:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Antibody Injections in Pregnancy Might Shield Fetus From Zika", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- A new antibody \"cocktail\" promises to provide effective, if temporary, protection against the Zika virus, a new study reports. \nA blend of three potent antibodies completely prevented Zika infection in a group of four lab monkeys, said senior researcher David Watkins, a professor of pathology with the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. \nRegular injections of these antibodies potentially could provide vital protection to pregnant women either living in or traveling to areas where Zika is widespread, Watkins said. \nZika can cause devastating neurological birth defects, including microcephaly, a condition in which the brain and skull are underdeveloped. \n\"I would say if you were to give a woman in the first trimester an injection and then another injection at the middle of the second trimester, that would suffice\" to protect her unborn child from Zika throughout the pregnancy, Watkins said. \nThe new study \"provides important evidence that an antibody-based therapy for Zika is potentially feasible,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \n\"If further studies -- including ones done in humans -- replicate these findings, a preventative antibody cocktail could be constructed and used to temporarily protect those traveling to Zika-prone areas,\" Adalja said. \nThis is not a Zika vaccine, Watkins noted. Vaccines teach the immune system to produce its own antibody protection against a pathogen. \nInstead, this approach belongs to a new wave of immunology called \"passive immunotherapy,\" in which people are injected with pre-made antibodies that provide immediate and direct protection against viruses. \n\"What we're doing here is simply short-cutting the vaccination,\" Watkins said. \nUnfortunately, these antibodies have a short half-life, living only weeks or months in the bloodstream before they wear out. People must receive regular injections of the antibodies to maintain their immunity, since their own immune system never learns how to make the antibodies. \nThe same approach has shown promise in protecting against HIV infection . Two research teams successfully used cloned antibodies to shield monkeys from HIV, according to findings published in the journals Science and Science Translational Medicine in September. \nAntibodies work against Zika and other viruses by blocking their entry into human cells, Watkins said. \n\"These proteins will stick to a virus and prevent it from entering into the cells of that person,\" he said. \"That's critical because a virus can't make copies of itself outside of a cell. It needs to get inside a cell to replicate and spread.\" \nFor this experiment, Watkins and his colleagues collected 91 different antibodies produced by a Zika-infected patient from Colombia. \nThey then selected three specific antibodies that seemed most potent against Zika, and cloned enough copies of the antibodies for use in injections. \nResearchers injected the antibody trio into four lab monkeys, and a day later they were exposed to the Zika virus. None of the monkeys developed Zika infection during three weeks of observation, but four control monkeys exposed to the same strain of Zika did become infected with the virus. \nFurther testing in pregnant primates will be needed before human testing can occur, the researchers said. And animal findings frequently don't produce similar results in humans. \nHowever, Watkins said he is \"cautiously optimistic\" that the antibody cocktail will be safe to both mother and unborn child. \n\"Mothers are full of antibodies already, and we know antibodies cross the placenta to provide protection to the fetus,\" Watkins said. \nThe researchers are currently seeking funding to grow large quantities of the antibodies for further primate and human testing, he said. \nThis approach to immune protection is easier than developing a vaccine and potentially more effective, since individual responses to vaccination can vary, Watkins said. \n\"I think the future of much of medicine will be administration of antibodies for infectious diseases,\" Watkins said. \nThe study appears Oct. 4 in the journal Science Translational Medicine . \nMore information \nFor more information on Zika, visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david watkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amesh adalja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adalja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zika", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "science translational medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of miami miller school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "science and science translational medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johns hopkins center for health security", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "zika share", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colombia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "46ac9a1ad188f68b15655184497410ed9bc902aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob.EqpP8VLgIHcm6NnqM4Pib4fzanPDli4rG1QxOmR20DmGCdKxl0GxtkEhTy1D_TlSH_HVNtt2ADWijyxQIT_RQ--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com -

Sun of the JC School of Public Health and Primary Care at The Chinese University of Hong Kong. \nThe investigators reported their findings in the Oct. 4 issue of Obesity Reviews . \nAccording to the International Labour Organization, any schedule that requires working between midnight and 5 a.m. is considered night-shift work. \nThe review revealed that workers who are permanently assigned to overnight work are particularly prone to accumulating excess weight, compared with those who alternate between day and night shifts. \nThe report also suggested that the longer a worker engages in regular night-shift work, the higher the risk for gaining weight. In addition, abdominal obesity risk was specifically found to shoot up by 35 percent among those who routinely work nights. \nThat particular finding could ring public health alarm bells, given that abdominal fat has long been associated with metabolic syndrome . The syndrome includes high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, and it drives up the risk for developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke . \nWhat's more, less than 3 percent of these workers adapted their sleep schedules to accommodate night-time work, suggesting that many were likely not getting a sufficient amount of sleep on a routine basis. \n\"This [has] an impact on the circadian rhythm,\" said Diekman, referring to everyone's natural 24-hour internal sleep clock. \nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, wakefulness naturally hits its lowest point between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., at the center of a standard night shift. \nNight shifts also challenge a worker's ability to access good food and exercise regularly, noted Kris-Etherton. \nOne solution, she said, is to \"bring healthy foods and snacks to the workplace to eat.\" \nAdvanced planning is key, agreed Diekman. \"Preparing dishes ahead of time is an easy way to have better options,\" she said. \n\"If your workplace does not offer good options or if you only have vending machines, think about better food choices that you could carry, and then how those choices can pair with what is available onsite,\" Diekman suggested. \n\"And, of course, remember that if you can get more movement into your workday it will help you with energy levels and possibly weight,\" Diekman added. \nMore information \nThere's more on sleep deprivation at the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "m. sun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connie diekman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris-etherton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diekman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penny kris-etherton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national sleep foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blood institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jc school of public health and primary care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinese university of hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international labour organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kris-etherton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd551e570011eda73f2248fb75c5d16a6034790e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obPOXsbcqdIm7XXXAkVSDW51ZbiQm6rjWM6uKk881zR314UR0qjmDZp04z8ClXzgnlxRy54AkDwUEKO2xoUm7V8Q--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "How Breast Cancer Gene Mutations Raise Risk of Tumors", "title_full": "How Breast Cancer Gene Mutations Raise Risk of Tumors", "published": "2017-10-04T17:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd551e570011eda73f2248fb75c5d16a6034790e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obPOXsbcqdIm7XXXAkVSDW51ZbiQm6rjWM6uKk881zR314UR0qjmDZp04z8ClXzgnlxRy54AkDwUEKO2xoUm7V8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T17:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Breast Cancer Gene Mutations Raise Risk of Tumors", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- Scientists say they've spotted how mutations in the BRCA1 gene can trigger breast cancer . \nResearchers from the Yale Cancer Center say they identified the molecular mechanism that enables the mutation to cause the BRCA1 gene to lose its DNA repair and tumor-fighting power. \n\"There have been about 14,000 papers written about BRCA1, and you would think we already know everything about the gene, but we don't,\" said study senior author Patrick Sung, a professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry and of therapeutic radiology. \nThe investigators showed that the interaction of BRCA1 with the BARD1 gene is necessary for DNA repair.

At first, it was believed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations might account for up to 8 percent of breast and ovarian cancers. \nThe researchers noted the risk is likely much higher because in many cancers there is no evidence of mutation but the expression of the BRCA genes is silenced. \n\"Understanding this mechanism will provide the predictive power for doctors trying to establish a patient's personal risk of developing cancer,\" Sung said. \nMore information \nThe American Cancer Society provides more information on breast cancer . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "patrick sung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sung", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yale cancer center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yale", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:23.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37f8d965b969eae4deb79602152e08b73d1d981f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obbeQN89wfKKp8vh_LcYu09C5J8JaSfUB374XXB8HcGzRa8SSiLoOeP05xtOr5r_E_YfMQZXL5cbB.2l6rYgdFLw--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "title_full": "Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "published": "2017-10-04T17:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "37f8d965b969eae4deb79602152e08b73d1d981f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obbeQN89wfKKp8vh_LcYu09C5J8JaSfUB374XXB8HcGzRa8SSiLoOeP05xtOr5r_E_YfMQZXL5cbB.2l6rYgdFLw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T17:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Coming Soon: A Faster Test for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- Urinary tract infections (UTIs) plague millions of Americans each year. Now, researchers say they've developed a test that can tell in minutes whether or not a particular antibiotic can clear up the problem. \nThe issue is an important one, doctors say, since many of the bacteria behind UTIs have grown resistant to certain antibiotics. And, left untreated, these infections can have serious effects, especially in the frail and elderly. \n\"We live in an era of multidrug-resistant bacteria, so-called 'superbugs' that can cause life-threatening infections,\" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Sunil Sood, who reviewed the new study. \n\"Modern molecular techniques to distinguish bacteria that are resistant from those that are susceptible to common antibiotics could be lifesaving,\" said Sood. He is chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. \nAccording to the study authors, current urine tests can rapidly spot a UTI , but it can still take days for the exact germs -- and the proper antibiotic to use against them -- to be identified. \nIn the new study, researchers led by Nathan Schoepp, of the California Institute of Technology, developed a new way of analyzing germs in urine samples. Instead of isolating germs and waiting for them to grow, the researchers used a \"DNA amplification\" technique to analyze the bacteria's genome, or \"genetic blueprint.\" \nThe investigators tested the new screen out on 51 urine samples containing either antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-susceptible strains of bacteria. \nReporting in the Oct. 4 issue of Science Translational Medicine , Schoepp's team said the new test can render results in less than 30 minutes. Those results confirmed that urine samples held germs that were either susceptible or resistant to two common antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Furadantin and Macrodantin). \nAccording to the researchers, the test might also prove useful in other areas of treatment of infectious disease. \nSood said that, if this work pans out, it could be a real advance in care. \n\"The technique used by Schoepp and colleagues has the potential to identify such bacteria within the time frame of an office or emergency room visit,\" he explained. \"If further developed, this method could help doctors to more rapidly treat infections with the right antibiotics.\" \nDr. Howard Selinger directs family medicine at Quinnipiac University's Frank D. Netter MD School of Medicine in Hamden, Conn. He agreed that the new test could speed care, but said cost is a concern, too. \n\"We must demonstrate that directed therapy delivers better value, by improving quality and lowering overall cost,\" Selinger said. \"This will allow for insurance coverage and not cause patients to bear the brunt of the cost of this new technology.\" \nMore information", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan schoepp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "selinger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunil sood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard selinger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "furadantin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schoepp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "science translational medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california institute of technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northwell health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quinnipiac university's frank d. netter md school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bay shore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.y", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southside hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:23.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1087730aece8146f9881574b470456825034f9d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obYI45sVtipwfZer43VVYn4gkSve2Ucr4CeE1fFlLdVfyn0TpGp_D0JEEQh5r_kXPe", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "title_full": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "published": "2017-10-04T15:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1087730aece8146f9881574b470456825034f9d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obYI45sVtipwfZer43VVYn4gkSve2Ucr4CeE1fFlLdVfyn0TpGp_D0JEEQh5r_kXPe", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T15:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- Infants should be put to sleep on their backs on a firm, empty surface and never placed on a sleep positioner, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says. \nThe agency warned parents and caregivers that these products, also known as \"nests\" or \"anti-roll\" supports, can prevent babies from breathing. \nThe two most common sleep positioners include two raised pillows or \"bolsters\" attached to a mat. Babies younger than 6 months old are placed on the mat between the pillows to keep them in a specific position while they are sleeping. \nBut putting babies to sleep on or near soft objects, such as positioners, toys, pillows and loose bedding, increases the risk for accidental suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), the American Academy of Pediatrics says. \nSome babies have been found in dangerous positions next to a positioner they had been placed in for sleeping. Federal officials also reported that infants have died after being placed in one of these products. In most cases, the infants got out of position, rolled onto their stomachs and suffocated, the FDA explained. \nThe agency urged parents and caregivers to always put babies on their back for naps and when they go to sleep at night. \nBabies should never sleep with a positioner, pillow, blanket, sheets, a comforter or a quilt, the FDA advised. \nInfants' sleeping surfaces should be bare and free of any loose items. Appropriate clothing keeps babies warm enough while they are sleeping. \nThe FDA regulates baby products that claim to cure, treat, prevent or reduce a disease or condition. Some sleep positioner companies claim that their products prevent SIDS. But the FDA noted it has never cleared an infant sleep positioner that promises to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS since there is no scientific evidence to back up this claim. \nSome companies market their products as helpful for easing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition that causes stomach acids to back up into the esophagus. Others suggest their positioners help prevent flat head syndrome (plagiocephaly), a deformation caused by pressure on one part of the skull. \nBut while some products were previously approved for GERD and flat head syndrome, the FDA asked these companies to stop marketing these items since the risks associated with their use outweighed any possible benefits. \nEvery year about 4,000 infants die unexpectedly while sleeping due to suffocation, SIDS or another unknown cause, according to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \nThe FDA urged parents and caregivers to talk to their child's doctor if they have questions about putting babies to sleep safely. \nMore information \nThe American Academy of Pediatrics provides more information on infant sleep safety . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eunice kennedy shriver national institute of child health and human development", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american academy of pediatrics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:24.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bdf53daa0b9fc88a6ce9fc9bf15df3821a4e8a88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9oba6hCpKleLJgty2D3.czQkOVbYdOt.UT6MpU.KIoJunBqKZkJoEe42rGP2J67u9zv", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "The Unexpected Faces of the Uninsured", "title_full": "The Unexpected Faces of the Uninsured", "published": "2017-10-04T15:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bdf53daa0b9fc88a6ce9fc9bf15df3821a4e8a88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9oba6hCpKleLJgty2D3.czQkOVbYdOt.UT6MpU.KIoJunBqKZkJoEe42rGP2J67u9zv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T15:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Unexpected Faces of the Uninsured", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- In a finding that upends conventional thinking about who is typically uninsured, new research finds that 1 in 7 residents in the suburbs don't have health coverage. \nWhen tallied up, that totaled almost 40 percent of all uninsured people in the nation, the study authors said. \n\"We rarely think about suburbs when we think about vulnerable populations,\" said lead author Alina Schnake-Mahl, a doctoral student at the Harvard T.H.

Fifteen percent of suburban residents were uninsured, and about a third had no routine annual checkup.

She is a graduate student at Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. \nAn estimated 676,000 people in the United States survive heart attacks each year, according to the American Heart Association. Many survivors are of working age: The average age of heart attack is 65 for men and 72 for women, the association says. \nThe new study examined the medical and work records of over 22,000 patients in Denmark who were employed before suffering heart attacks between 1997 and 2012. \nOf those, 91 percent returned to work within a year. But within a year of going back to work, 24 percent of the patients had left their jobs. That's three times the normal rate of leaving a job, the researchers reported. It's not clear, however, whether the heart attack survivors quit their jobs, or were fired or laid off. \nPatients aged 30 to 39 and 60 to 65, and those who had heart failure, diabetes or depression, were especially likely to leave their jobs. Workers with higher incomes and more education were more likely to stay on the job, the findings showed. \nPetersen said the percentage of heart attack patients who return to work and then leave their jobs may be even higher in the United States. \n\"In Denmark, all citizens have equal access to health care and all patients receive treatment free of charge,\" she explained. \nOne U.S. expert said the findings are sobering. \n\"The study is an important reminder that recovery is often measured in months and years, not just weeks,\" said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. \n\"To understand the impact of a heart attack requires that we fully understand people's roles and function. We should study how best to help people fully resume their prior activities and have the choice as to whether they want to continue working,\" Krumholz explained. \nKarina Davidson, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, said fatigue and an inability to perform manual labor are some of the reasons why heart attack survivors leave their jobs. \n\"Patients after a heart attack do indeed have a long road to recovery, and cardiac rehabilitation, strong family support and follow-up with their medical care are important components to ensure the best recovery possible,\" she said. \"Returning to work full-time will be realistic for some patients, but not for all.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the Journal of the American Heart Association . \nMore information \nFor details about recovering from a heart attack, visit the American Heart Association . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harlan krumholz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krumholz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karina davidson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laerke smedegaard petersen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petersen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "copenhagen university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for outcomes research and evaluation at yale-new haven hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university's center for behavioral cardiovascular health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heart association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:27.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "92c752a6fbd0216c767069127f7547b851da2530", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obsVO4niKZ.3l7WECRXLigyRFVEs2fE2pwGzwQcqQgAUxZmnQNr43n2Uj682ym5b87JkfefuMn.HQwNDZyBRhYpg--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Germs May Be Valuable Passengers on Mission to Mars", "title_full": "Germs May Be Valuable Passengers on Mission to Mars", "published": "2017-10-04T12:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "92c752a6fbd0216c767069127f7547b851da2530", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obsVO4niKZ.3l7WECRXLigyRFVEs2fE2pwGzwQcqQgAUxZmnQNr43n2Uj682ym5b87JkfefuMn.HQwNDZyBRhYpg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T12:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Germs May Be Valuable Passengers on Mission to Mars", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- Astronauts on space missions to Mars may need more germs on the ship with them to stay in good health, a new study suggests. \nAs scientists prepare for a mission to Mars in the coming decades, the health and safety of astronauts is a top priority. In this new research, scientists honed in on the microorganisms that would be living in close quarters with crews aboard spacecraft. \nResearchers from Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, led by the German Aerospace Center, enlisted a crew of six male \"Marsonauts.\" They lived inside a mock spacecraft in Moscow from June 2010 to November 2011. \nDuring the mock Mars mission, the researchers monitored how the composition of bacteria changed over time. What they found was that the diversity of germs dropped dramatically during the equivalent of a space flight to Mars. \n\"Until now, little was known about the influence of long-term confinement on the microorganisms that live inside habitats that may one day be used to travel to other planets, and whether the structure of the microbiota changes with time,\" said study author Petra Schwendner, from the University of Edinburgh. \n\"Ours is the first comprehensive long-time study that investigates the microbial load, diversity and dynamics in a closed habitat -- a mock-up spacecraft -- for 520 days, the full duration of a simulated flight to Mars,\" she said. \nDuring the mock mission, the crew never left the closed habitat. They were also subjected to a regimented lifestyle that future Mars astronauts will face. This involved a strict diet and schedule, which included cleaning the habitat and conducting scientific experiments. \nThe crew also collected 360 microbial samples from the air and various surfaces at 18 intervals. \nThe study showed communal areas, sleep areas, the gym, and the bathroom had the greatest volume and diversity of bacteria while the medical space had the least. \nThe researchers noted, however, that microbial diversity aboard the \"spacecraft\" declined dramatically during the mission. \nThe findings were published Oct. 3 in the journal Microbiome . \n\"In addition to potential health risks for the crew, some of these microorganisms could have a negative impact on spacecraft, as they grow on and might damage spacecraft material,\" Schwendner said in a journal news release. \n\"To ensure the systems' stability, countermeasures may be required to avoid development of highly resistant, adapted microorganisms, and a complete loss of microbial [germ} diversity,\" she said. \nThe crew was the main source of human-associated bacteria within the habitat, but the prolonged confinement seemed to have the most significant effect on the bacterial community, the researchers found. \nThe study authors suggested their findings provide insight on habitat maintenance and could help scientists develop strategies to ensure a healthy environment for astronauts during future deep space missions. \nMore information \nNASA has more information on the effects of space travel on the human body . \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "petra schwendner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schwendner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german aerospace center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:29.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c60ef88044182c68c917b8c9d780af0b0420bf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob_FGqvuRkUzedrQ81gpYpyc.TgsBsd4MVpmMzxEBq5yQq31KmqasItQQ_Qpckvdopin5OCgWND54-", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Could You Be Overdoing It With Sleeping Pills?", "title_full": "Could You Be Overdoing It With Sleeping Pills?", "published": "2017-10-04T12:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 44, "comments": 0, "shares": 44}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c60ef88044182c68c917b8c9d780af0b0420bf8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9ob_FGqvuRkUzedrQ81gpYpyc.TgsBsd4MVpmMzxEBq5yQq31KmqasItQQ_Qpckvdopin5OCgWND54-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T12:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Could You Be Overdoing It With Sleeping Pills?", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- More Americans are having trouble getting a good night's sleep, a national health survey found. \nAnd the number of people who use prescription sleeping pills in the quest for shuteye continues to increase -- currently about 4 percent of Americans, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nBut are they safe? And are they even effective? \nResults of studies done on the health hazards of sleeping pills vary widely, from one that found barely any elevated risk to another that found the risk of death for users is three times higher than it is for people who don't take them. \nResearch published in the American Journal of Public Health confirms that fatal overdoses are a concern. There are also possible side effects and dependency problems to consider. \nPlus, according to Consumer Reports , over the long term, sleeping pills might not even bring their intended results. \nIf you're taking sleeping pills, it's important to only use them with your doctor's OK and according to his or her instructions. If you take them too often, they can actually make your sleep problems worse. \nSo, how can you know if you're abusing sleeping pills? Here are some warning signs: You're taking extra doses to see if that works better, or a second pill in the middle of the night if you wake up. You're taking a prescription sleeping pill AND an over-the-counter sedation product at the same time. You're using sleeping pills to treat anxiety. You're taking sleeping pills during the day or when you need to be alert. You've taken a sleeping pill every night for more than 7 to 10 days, or several times a week for weeks or months. \nIf you have any of these red flags, it's time to talk to your doctor about a new plan for getting quality sleep, including regular exercise and cognitive behavior therapy to harness the power of your mind. \nMore information \nConsumer Reports has a look at sleeping pills and strategies for getting a good night's sleep. \nPosted: October 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook share", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "american journal of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:08:30.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3daaba2d540ca97fd7bfe162971d1c3efa22321", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obdVvoaKMROFFoHIq462pogPb1URXiETe_uJg6OOb5Eh_iHT26h9XELOhh47osi_dRpbjSFO_T9NGGHYxIu_8Ggw--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com - Daily MedNews", "title": "Older People May Be More Prone to Reveal Suicidal Thoughts", "title_full": "Older People May Be More Prone to Reveal Suicidal Thoughts", "published": "2017-10-04T12:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3daaba2d540ca97fd7bfe162971d1c3efa22321", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9obdVvoaKMROFFoHIq462pogPb1URXiETe_uJg6OOb5Eh_iHT26h9XELOhh47osi_dRpbjSFO_T9NGGHYxIu_8Ggw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T12:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Older People May Be More Prone to Reveal Suicidal Thoughts", "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on GooglePlus Print this page \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 -- Nearly one-quarter of older Americans who took their own lives told someone about their intentions before doing so, a new study reveals. \nResearchers reviewed 10 years of national data and found that 23 percent of people aged 50 and older who killed themselves had disclosed their suicide intent.

The donation is typically separated into transfusable components, including red cells, plasma and platelets. Red cells -- Red blood cells are the most frequently transfused part of blood. In this type of collection, only the red blood cells are collected and most of the platelets and plasma are returned to the donor. Platelet -- Platelet donations take longer than whole-blood donations. During this procedure, an apheresis machine collects platelets and returns red cells and the majority of the plasma back to the donor. Platelets are an important part of some cancer treatments and organ donation. Plasma -- For this type of donation, only plasma is collected.

The only exceptions would be cases where the mother's life is at risk or cases involving rape or incest. \nThe bill passed largely along party lines, with 237 votes for and 189 against, CNN reported. \nThe bill, known as the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, had been attempted in the House in both 2013 and 2015, but this time it has the support of the President behind it.

This approval makes the brand the first and only neurotoxin indicated for three facial treatment areas - forehead lines, crow's feet lines and glabellar lines. 1 As the category leader, Botox Cosmetic is also the only neurotoxin brand to receive approval of aesthetic indications beyond glabellar lines in the U.S. \n\"Allergan recognizes that forehead lines are a top area of concern for patients, 2 \" says David Nicholson, Chief Research and Development Officer at Allergan. \"Our goal in pursuing a third indication for Botox Cosmetic for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe forehead lines was based on our desire to study the patient selection, dosing and injection pattern to help provide optimal treatment outcomes.\" \nThe Botox Cosmetic story began in 2002 when the brand helped establish the aesthetic market with its first FDA approval to temporarily improve the appearance of moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows (glabellar lines). The momentum continued in 2013 when Botox Cosmetic was approved for the temporary improvement in the appearance of moderate to severe crow's feet lines. 3,4 The addition of this third indication furthers Allergan's mission to continue providing patients and physicians with products designed to address specific patient needs. \n\"As a physician, I've been using Botox Cosmetic since it was FDA approved in 2002,3 but for years my patients have also inquired about how to treat forehead lines. With this latest indication for Botox Cosmetic, I have an FDA-approved product I already know and trust, that can improve the appearance of the forehead, 1 \" says Dr. Steven Fagien, an Oculoplastic Surgeon in Boca Raton, Florida and lead clinical trial investigator. \"I am proud to have worked closely with Allergan to establish criteria for proper patient selection, dosing and injection pattern for forehead line treatment and am pleased to see that the company is providing extensive injector training to help ensure optimal results.\" \n\"Few products have the level of impact that Botox Cosmetic has had on the medical facial aesthetics industry,\" said David Moatazedi, Senior Vice President U.S. Medical Aesthetics at Allergan. \"Botox Cosmetic is the brand that created a new category in facial aesthetics with its first FDA approval 15 years ago. 3 Since then it has continued to be the leading neurotoxin treatment and the world's number one selling product of its kind.\" 5 \nIn clinical trials, Botox Cosmetic demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo in the reduction of the severity of forehead lines, as assessed by both the investigator and the subject at Day 30 (primary endpoint): 61% of subjects in study one and 46% of subjects in study two met the primary endpoint compared with placebo (0% in Study one and 1% in Study two). Similar response rates were seen across three treatments cycles with Botox Cosmetic. 1 \nApproved for use in over 75 countries, Botox Cosmetic is the most widely researched and studied treatment of its kind. 6,7 The safety and efficacy have been evaluated in Allergan clinical studies and described in nearly 500 peer-reviewed articles in scientific and medical journals. 7,8 Botox Cosmetic is manufactured in a state-of-the art facility under strict quality and safety standards. \nTo learn more about Botox Cosmetic please visit www.botoxcosmetic.com or www.botoxcosmetic.com/men.

Those differences may depend on specific local characteristics like public transportation, he and his colleagues reported. \nTo see whether the on-demand car services affect drunk-driving collision rates, Morrison's team looked at car crash histories and Uber availability between 2013 and 2016 in four cities: Reno and Las Vegas, Nev.; Portland, Ore.; and San Antonio, Texas. Uber is the largest ride-sharing business. \n\"Alcohol-involved crashes were reduced by about 60 percent in Portland, Oregon, but not at all in Reno, Nevada,\" said Morrison, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania's Injury Science Center. \"The surprise was that even where there is a reduction in alcohol-involved crashes, we did not detect any reduction in crashes overall.\" \nWhy that's so isn't clear, Morrison said. \"There could be something offsetting the reduction in alcohol-involved crashes, like an increase in non-alcohol involved crashes. It could also be that the decrease in alcohol-involved crashes is too small to detect within the overall crash rate,\" he said. \nCar crashes are the top cause of fatalities among Americans aged 13 to 25. In 2015 alone, about 6.3 million car crashes took place on American roadways, killing more than 35,000 and injuring more than 2.4 million. Roughly one-third of deadly crashes were fueled by alcohol, the researchers said in background notes. \nThe cities chosen for the new study had similar ride-sharing histories. Uber service was launched, discontinued and eventually reinstated. \nUber resumption was not linked to a drop in the number of serious crashes. Nor was it linked to a drop in total crash-related injuries, the researchers said. \nBut state department of transportation numbers revealed that the number of alcohol-related crashes did drop with resumption of Uber services in Portland and San Antonio. That number did not fall in Reno. \nWhy? \n\"The differences could be due to a wide range of different factors,\" said Morrison. \"One likely explanation is that local populations use public and private transport differently from city to city, and probably also use ride-sharing services differently from city to city.\" \nFor example, Portland has many more public transport options than Reno. People might choose to use these alternatives to private vehicles after having one too many, he said. \nThe upshot is \"the effects of ride-sharing on crashes will differ from city to city, so cities should consider their own local transport conditions when assessing the likely costs or benefits to public health of ride-sharing,\" Morrison said. \n\"It's not enough to look at average effects from other locations and assume they will be repeated within a given city,\" he added. \nStill, accident-prevention experts applauded the potential protective benefits of ride-sharing. \nAmy George, a senior vice president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), said ride-sharing makes it \"easier than ever to make the safe choice to not drink and drive.\" \nMADD supports \"Uber driver partners as the ultimate designated drivers, and how rideshare apps have removed the excuse to drive drunk,\" she added. \nRuss Martin is director of government relations with the Governors Highway Safety Association in Washington, D.C. It's \"not surprising that researchers are having trouble drawing conclusive results on the safety impact given the complexity of studying travel behavior and all of the difficult variables to account for,\" he said. \nAt the same time, Martin said, \"it is not surprising that ride-sharing services are making a difference, as we know that consumers are using these services as the designated driver.\" \nRide-sharing, Martin added, \"can provide a great alternative to drunk driving, and communities looking to leverage this idea should keep all of these various dynamics in mind when designing programs.\" \nThe findings were published Oct. 4 in the American Journal of Epidemiology . \nMore information \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention talks about teen drinking and driving  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher morrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russ martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mothers against drunk driving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania's injury science center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "governors highway safety association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american journal of epidemiology", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san antonio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ore.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nev.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T08:03:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd54d3ebdcc11d26304468b77c19a5b9d76e8831", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpIvuesScb9oboEiZAg4YxAsBLaBc8grLMrYB4JcRRyyyhruzjtCj853a7FCkiWmIsIFZkgfxwIO7FEZd0928OeatCLRXa20iZA--", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "http://www.drugs.com/feeds/medical_news.xml", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Drugs.com -

Hearts that become bigger are less efficient and less effective, said the study authors from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. \n\"Those who consumed less [vitamin K] had more risk,\" Dr. Norman Pollock, the study's corresponding author, said in a university news release. \nFor the study, researchers asked 766 healthy teens, aged 14 to 18, to wear activity monitors for seven days and to record what they ate. Most participants tracked their diet for at least six days. The teens also underwent an echocardiography test to examine their left ventricle. \nOnly 25 percent of the study participants had even adequate intake of vitamin K, the researchers found. And overall, about 10 percent of the teens had some level of enlargement in their left heart ventricle. \nThe study's co-first author, Mary Ellen Fain, a second-year student at the medical college, said, \"Even at that age, it seemed to make a difference in their hearts.\" \nThe findings held even after considering other possible contributing factors, such as gender, race, physical activity and blood pressure, Fain said. \nHowever, the study doesn't establish a direct causal relationship. \nVitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health.

What's crazy is I always told myself I would never go and just because you (Randy and Catrina) have explained it to me and have been there for me and have yet to let me down, I have absolutely no objections to going. I'm not even giving it another thought I'm just going to do it! Randy your honesty is what keeps bringing me back to this forum. Honesty is absolutely priceless.\nSo without further questions I will be looking for some meetings to attend. I can't thank you guys enough for opening my eyes to things I would normally would have shrugged off. If the first meeting is a bust I will make sure to push on to the next.\nAnd yes!!! My poor poor pupper! I have had him almost half a year and he's such a big part of this family now. My brother didn't have the time for him when he got him as a puppy and offered him to me and my family. He is a pure bred husky!! I have wanted one my whole life and then BAM I have one, only a couple months old at the time and one of the most beautiful dogs I have ever seen. He has truly been a blessing to this family in these darker times. I couldn't ask for a better dog. I finally have had that bond I have heard other people having with thier animals and now can't picture this family without him. On my sick days in bed he will push the door open with his nose and poke his head in to see what I'm doing, then will proceed to lay next to my bed on my side till I get up and spend some time with him. He's such a good dog!!!! I have been making sure to walk him more because huskys have lots and lots of energy and Randy and Cat are right. I feel much better when I get home and I know Bastion (my doggie) appreciated the walk also.\nThanks guys for pushing me out of my comfort zone, it truly is helping me to get outside my box and comfort to do things I usually wouldn't.\nJ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T09:43:05.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "948407b2db3a30704aebe627d0d3c7651ccd7832", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc998N9SbhfTdxM_LYEYDN5wHio._gyTerRGsl5j8XWwPvR_XfbmicTJp", "site_full": "www.drugs.com", "site": "drugs.com", "site_section": "https://www.drugs.com/forum/need-talk/", "site_categories": ["illegal_content"], "section_title": "Need to Talk?", "title": "New to this forum... - Page 4", "title_full": "New to this forum... - Page 4", "published": "2017-09-23T07:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 11, "participants_count": 3, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1290, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cceeba3c59ac1c895a62c36a87a0f562a63ab05e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSWMTwy0LxZpJo0mYKD_e4ql7bzX0Bkc998N9SbhfTdxM_LYEYDN5wHio._gyTerRGsl5j8XWwPvTqjCKjP5kZS2tI1Z4qGG5f1.OiIo5RazA--", "ord_in_thread": 11, "author": "Jgray19896", "published": "2017-10-04T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Well lady's and gentlemen.
