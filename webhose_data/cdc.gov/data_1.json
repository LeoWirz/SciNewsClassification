Donnette leads Mended Hearts with a mission to inspire hope and improve the quality of life of heart patients, like herself, and their families. Donnette Smith, President of Mended Hearts \n\u201cI was born with a heart disease called bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), in which the aortic valve that prevents the backflow of blood has two leaflets instead of three,\u201d explained Donnette. However, it was not until she was 18-years-old that Donnette was diagnosed with a heart murmur during a physical screening. Later, in 1988, at the age of 41, she was diagnosed with BAV and had her valve replaced through heart catherization. \u201cIt has been a life-long journey, but I have learned a lot being with Mended Hearts.\u201d The Flu Can Be Dangerous \nPeople with certain long-term medical conditions , such as heart disease , are at high risk of developing serious complications from flu. Complications of flu can include bacterial pneumonia, ear infections, sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of chronic medical conditions, such as congestive heart failure, asthma, or diabetes. Donnette describes one time she was diagnosed with flu, \u201cI experienced rapid heartbeat, had other symptoms, and was hospitalized with an IV. There was no room in the hospital, and I had to be placed in the chapel.\u201d Donnette was able to recover from these flu complications, and today is vigilant in her flu prevention efforts\u2014making sure to get her flu vaccine each year and encouraging others to do the same. You Have the Power to Fight Flu \nDonnette continues, \u201cYou look at the flu differently when you have an underlying health condition. I 1000% believe in the flu vaccine, and get my flu shot every year! I also make sure to wash my hands often, and avoid touching my face. If you have a congenital heart disease (CHD) or other chronic illness, you have to be more mindful of being around sick people. Furthermore, it is important you head to the doctor if you experience any signs of flu. [Taking these precautions] is like putting a protective barrier around your heart.\u201d \nWhether you have a congenital heart disease, like Donnette, other certain long-term medical conditions, or you have loved ones or care for someone with certain long-term medical conditions, it is very important to take steps to protect yourself and those around you. Get a flu vaccine. CDC recommends everyone 6 months and older get a flu vaccine every year. Flu shots are approved for use in people with medical conditions. Flu vaccination has been associated with fewer flu-related hospitalizations and complications in high risk groups. Take everyday preventive actions to help slow the spread of flu. Everyday actions, such as avoiding close contact with people who are sick and staying home when you are sick, also help protect you and others from flu. Take flu antiviral drugs if your doctor prescribes them. If you are at high risk of serious flu complications and develop flu symptoms, consult a health care provider. Antiviral drugs can make your illness milder, and make you feel better faster. They may also prevent serious health problems that can result from the flu. Treatment works best when started early (within 48 hours after symptoms start). Take it from a Super Flu Fighter \nDespite the challenges of CHD, and living through serious flu illness, Donnette Smith thrives. From leading Mended Hearts as President to volunteering at a local hospital, she stays busy. \u201cI do as much as I can for as long as I can.\u201d She will be celebrating a grandson\u2019s 20 th birthday in a few weeks, and celebrating her 70 th birthday on Thanksgiving. \n\u201cYour health is up to you. Flu can be a dangerous illness, and it can take a toll on your body if you have certain chronic conditions. Know how to keep yourself healthy. Don\u2019t be afraid to get a flu shot; it\u2019s a great shield against flu.\u201d Posted on", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donnette smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donnette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bav", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:14:16.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14bb59c27ad2ad111bcf5520bf670cef97720f41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvUKBugTBswcbVvOxK5OIbDA-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=5", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)", "title": "EARLY RELEASE: Vital Signs: Trends in Incidence of Cancers Associated with Overweight and Obesity \u2014 United States, 2005\u20132014", "title_full": "EARLY RELEASE: Vital Signs: Trends in Incidence of Cancers Associated with Overweight and Obesity \u2014 United States, 2005\u20132014", "published": "2017-10-03T19:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/mm6639e1_Vital_Signs_Trends_Cancers__Overweight_Obesity.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14bb59c27ad2ad111bcf5520bf670cef97720f41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvUKBugTBswcbVvOxK5OIbDA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "EARLY RELEASE: Vital Signs: Trends in Incidence of Cancers Associated with Overweight and Obesity \u2014 United States, 2005\u20132014", "text": "\n\u2022 Overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of at least 13 different types of cancer. \n\u2022 Overweight- and obesity-related cancers accounted for 40% of all cancers diagnosed in 2014. \n\u2022 About 55% of cancers diagnosed in women and 24% of those diagnosed in men are overweight- and obesity-related cancers. \n\u2022 The incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers (excluding colorectal cancer) increased significantly among persons aged 20\u201374 years during 2005\u20132014. \n\u2022 The findings emphasize the importance of intensifying nationwide efforts to prevent and treat overweight and obesity. \n\u2022 Multilevel approaches to comprehensive cancer control that address social determinants of health and include evidence-based interventions that address healthy weight and other cancer risk factors might help reduce the burden of cancer and other chronic diseases. \nAbstract \nBackground: Overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of at least 13 different types of cancer. \nMethods: Data from the United States Cancer Statistics for 2014 were used to assess incidence rates, and data from 2005 to 2014 were used to assess trends for cancers associated with overweight and obesity (adenocarcinoma of the esophagus; cancers of the breast [in postmenopausal women], colon and rectum, endometrium, gallbladder, gastric cardia, kidney, liver, ovary, pancreas, and thyroid; meningioma; and multiple myeloma) by sex, age, race/ethnicity, state, geographic region, and cancer site. Because screening for colorectal cancer can reduce colorectal cancer incidence through detection of precancerous polyps before they become cancerous, trends with and without colorectal cancer were analyzed. \nResults: In 2014, approximately 631,000 persons in the United States received a diagnosis of a cancer associated with overweight and obesity, representing 40% of all cancers diagnosed. Overweight- and obesity-related cancer incidence rates were higher among older persons (ages \u226550 years) than younger persons; higher among females than males; and higher among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white adults compared with other groups. Incidence rates for overweight- and obesity-related cancers during 2005\u20132014 varied by age, cancer site, and state. Excluding colorectal cancer, incidence rates increased significantly among persons aged 20\u201374 years; decreased among those aged \u226575 years; increased in 32 states; and were stable in 16 states and the District of Columbia. \nConclusions: The burden of overweight- and obesity-related cancer is high in the United States. Incidence rates of overweight- and obesity-related cancers except colorectal cancer have increased in some age groups and states. \nImplications for Public Health Practice: The burden of overweight- and obesity-related cancers might be reduced through efforts to prevent and control overweight and obesity. Comprehensive cancer control strategies, including use of evidence-based interventions to promote healthy weight, could help decrease the incidence of these cancers in the United States. Top Introduction \nIn 2013\u20132014, approximately one third of adults in the United States were overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25.0\u201329.9 kg/m 2 ) and approximately one third had obesity (BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ) ( 1 ). Approximately half of U.S. residents are unaware that adults who are overweight or have obesity are at increased risk for cancer ( 2 , 3 ). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) states that there is sufficient evidence for an association with excess body fatness, including overweight, obesity, and weight gain, and at least 13 cancers ( 3 ). These cancers include adenocarcinoma of the esophagus; cancers of the breast (in postmenopausal women), colon and rectum, endometrium (corpus uterus), gallbladder, gastric cardia, kidney (renal cell), liver, ovary, pancreas, and thyroid; meningioma, and multiple myeloma. Overweight and obesity might increase cancer risk through induction of metabolic and endocrine abnormalities, including increases in inflammation and levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factor, and sex hormones ( 4 ). \nData compiled for the United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) data set ( https://nccd.cdc.gov/uscs/ ) were used to calculate incidence rates in 2014 and trends during 2005\u20132014 for cancers associated with overweight and obesity (overweight- and obesity-related cancers). In this report, overweight- and obesity-related cancers were defined as those classified by IARC as having sufficient evidence for an association with excess body fatness. Top Methods \nThe USCS is a compilation of data from multiple sources that is used to report official federal cancer statistics through the USCS web-based report. The USCS data set includes cancer incidence data from CDC\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Data on new cancer cases diagnosed during 2005\u20132014 were obtained from population-based cancer registries affiliated with NPCR and SEER programs in each state and the District of Columbia (DC). Data from DC and all states met USCS publication criteria for 2014, covering 100% of the U.S. population; all states except Nevada met USCS publication criteria each year during 2005\u20132014, covering approximately 99% of the U.S. population.* Cancer site for cases was classified by anatomic site and histology. \u2020 Only cases of invasive cancer were included. Postmenopausal breast cancer was defined as breast cancer diagnosed in women aged \u226550 years. \nPopulation estimates for rate denominators were a modification of annual county population estimates by age, sex, bridged-race, and ethnicity, produced by the U.S. Census Bureau in collaboration with CDC and with support from National Cancer Institute, and aggregated to the state and national levels. \u00a7 Race bridging is a method used to make multiple-race and single-race data collection systems sufficiently comparable to permit estimation and analysis of race-specific statistics ( https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_135.pdf ). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals for rates are presented to allow for informal comparisons among rates, without specifying a referent group. Joinpoint regression ( https://surveillance.cancer.gov/joinpoint/ ), which allowed different slopes for more than one period, was used to calculate changes in rates; trends were quantified by average annual percent change. Because screening for colorectal cancer can reduce colorectal cancer incidence through detection of precancerous polyps before they become cancerous ( https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/colorectal-cancer-screening2?ds ), trends with and without colorectal cancer were analyzed. Rates were estimated by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and U.S. Census region. Trends were age-adjusted and estimated by cancer site, sex, and state. To examine the impact of the change in rates, the number of cases expected during 2006\u20132014 if rates had remained at 2005 levels was subtracted from the actual number of cases during this period. Top Results \nIn 2014, approximately 631,604 persons in the United States received a diagnosis of an overweight- or obesity-related cancer ( Table 1 ). This represents 40% of the nearly 1.6 million cancers diagnosed each year (55% of the 799,734 cancers among women and 24% of the 796,752 cancers among males). Overweight- and obesity-related cancer incidence rates were higher among older persons (ages \u226550 years) than younger persons and two thirds of cases occurred among persons aged 50\u201374 years. The overweight- and obesity-related cancer incidence rate was higher among females (218.1 per 100,000 population) than among males (115.0 per 100,000), partially because endometrial, ovarian, and postmenopausal female breast cancers accounted for 42% (268,091) of overweight-and obesity-related cancers. The rates also varied by race/ethnicity, with higher incidence among non-Hispanic blacks (black) and non-Hispanic whites (white) compared with other groups; however, black males and American Indian/Alaska Native males had higher incidence rates than did white males. Incidence was highest in the Northeast compared with other U.S. Census regions. \nAmong cancers affecting both males and females, incidence rates in 2014 were higher among males than among females for colorectal cancer (44.1 per 100,000 versus 33.7 per 100,000), kidney cancer (20.9 versus 10.6), pancreatic cancer (14.4 versus 11.1), liver cancer (11.2 versus 3.4), adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (5.4 versus 0.8), multiple myeloma (7.5 versus 4.9), and gastric cardia cancer (3.6 versus 0.8) ( Table 2 ). Females had higher rates than did males of thyroid cancer (21.3 versus 7.4) and gallbladder cancer (1.4 versus 0.8). Among the three overweight- and obesity-related cancers that affect females only, incidence rates were higher for postmenopausal breast cancer (92.6 per 100,000) than for endometrial cancer (26.5 per 100,000) and ovarian cancer (11.0 per 100,000). By site, incidence rates decreased significantly each year for meningioma (-3.8% per year), colorectal cancer (-2.9%), and ovarian cancer (-2.0%). Incidence rates increased significantly each year during this period for six cancers: thyroid cancer (4.0% per year), liver cancer (2.9%), gastric cardia cancer (1.2%), endometrial cancer (1.1%), pancreatic cancer (0.8%), and kidney cancer (0.7%). The incidence rates were stable for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gallbladder cancer, multiple myeloma, and postmenopausal breast cancer. The increase in risk for cancer per 1 kg/m 2 increase in BMI ranged from 1% each for thyroid and ovarian cancers to 9% for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. \nDuring 2005\u20132014, declines were observed in the overall incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers (-2%), colorectal cancer (-23%), and cancers not known to be related to overweight and obesity (-13%) (Table 2). Increased use of colorectal cancer screening tests likely contributed to the decline in colorectal cancer; when colorectal cancer was excluded from overweight- and obesity-related cancers, a 7% increase in overall incidence was observed. The trends varied substantially by age group: the rate for all overweight- and obesity-related cancers increased significantly among persons aged 20\u201349 years and 50\u201364 years, and decreased among those aged 65\u201374 years and \u226575 years; colorectal cancer rates declined in all age groups except in persons aged 20\u201349 years; and rates for overweight- and obesity-related cancers (excluding colorectal cancers) increased among all age groups except persons aged \u226575 years ( Figure 1 ). Because of reductions in colorectal cancer rates, approximately 224,800 cases have been averted since 2005. However, during this same period, 211,800 excess cases from other overweight- and obesity-related cancers have occurred. Incidence rates of overweight- and obesity-related cancers (excluding colorectal cancer) increased significantly in 32 states (0.3%\u20131.8%), and did not change in 16 states and the District of Columbia ( Figure 2 ). Top Conclusions and Comments \nOverweight- and obesity-related cancers accounted for 40% of all cancers diagnosed in 2014, and varied substantially across demographic groups. Endometrial, ovarian, and postmenopausal female breast cancers accounted for 42% of new cases of overweight-and obesity-related cancers in 2014, which is reflected in the higher overall incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers among females. For cancers that occurred among both males and females, however, the incidence of most cancers was higher in males. \nMeningioma declined the most (-3.8% per year) during 2005\u20132014; however, this cancer accounted for <1% of overweight- and obesity-related cancers among males and females. The second largest decline was in the rate of colorectal cancer, which accounted for approximately 22% of overweight- and obesity-related cancers; this trend likely influenced the overall decline in the incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers during 2005\u20132014. National data have demonstrated an increase in colorectal cancer screening ( 5 ), which might have contributed to the decline in colorectal cancer incidence through detection of precancerous polyps, which can then be removed before becoming cancerous. When colorectal cancer was excluded from the trend analysis, overweight- and obesity-related cancer incidence increased among all age groups except persons aged \u226575 years. The increase in obesity-related cancer incidence coincides with an increase in the prevalence of obesity since 1960 in the United States with larger absolute percentage increases from 1960 to 2004 than from 2005 to 2014 ( 1 ). The prevalence of overweight during this later period remained stable. These historical and current trends in overweight and obesity and cancers related to excess weight reflect the continued need for public health strategies to prevent and control overweight and obesity in children and adults and help communities make it easier for people to be physically active and eat healthfully. \nThere is consistent evidence that a high BMI is associated with cancer risk. Persons who are overweight or have obesity are nearly twice as likely as are healthy-weight (BMI = 18.5\u201324.9kg/m 2 ) persons to develop adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and cancers of the gastric cardia, liver, and kidney ( 6 \u2013 9 ). Persons who have obesity are approximately 30% more likely to develop colorectal cancer than are persons with healthy weight ( 10 ). Women who are overweight or have obesity are approximately two to four times as likely as are women with healthy weight to develop endometrial cancer ( 11 ). \nObservational studies have provided evidence that even a 5-kg (11 pound) increase in weight since early adulthood is associated with increased risk for overweight- and obesity-related cancers ( 12 ). Maintaining a healthy weight throughout life has been associated with a reduction in risk of these cancers ( 3 ). However, the population effect of weight loss interventions on cancer risk might not be observable for at least a decade ( 4 ). In studies evaluating the effect of weight change on risks for endometrial cancer and breast cancer after long-term follow-up, weight loss was associated with reduced risks for both types of cancer among postmenopausal women ( 13 , 14 ). \nWithout intensified nationwide efforts to prevent and treat overweight and obesity, the high prevalence of excess weight might impede further declines in overall cancer incidence ( 15 ). These efforts include investing in addressing both social and behavioral determinants of health, such as unemployment and disparities in education and housing, to achieve better population health ( https://nam.edu/addressing-social-determinants-of-health-and-health-disparities-a-vital-direction-for-health-and-health-care/ ). Eating a healthy diet and engaging in sufficient physical activity are important components of behavioral strategies to maintain a healthy weight. Population-based strategies to prevent and reduce overweight and obesity include helping persons of all ages meet dietary ( https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/guidelines ) and physical activity ( https://health.gov/PAGuidelines ) guidelines by supporting healthy eating and active living in a variety of settings, including communities, worksites, schools, and early care and education facilities. Strategies to provide support for these settings have been recommended by a number of public health entities including CDC ( https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5807a1.htm ), the National Academy of Medicine ( 16 ), and the Community Preventive Services Task Force ( https://www.thecommunityguide.org/topic/obesity ). Health care providers could encourage patients to maintain healthy weights throughout their lifespans. To help treat obesity, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that clinicians screen all adults for obesity and either offer patients who have obesity intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions or refer them to programs that offer these services ( https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/obesity-in-adults-screening-and-management ); similar recommendations exist for children aged \u22656 years ( https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/UpdateSummaryFinal/obesity-in-children-and-adolescents-screening ). \nThe CDC\u2019s National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program supports comprehensive cancer control efforts in all 50 states, DC, eight tribes and tribal organizations, and seven U.S. territories and Pacific Island jurisdictions; these efforts include policy, systems, and environmental changes that promote physical activity and healthy food options in communities. A review of cancer control plans implemented by grantees revealed that 89% include goals or strategies related to nutrition or physical activity to reduce cancer risk, with 82% including both ( 17 ). Other CDC programs, such as the State Public Health Action\u2019s Program, address diet, physical activity, and obesity more broadly ( https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/state-local-programs/state-public-health-action.html ). Maintaining and strengthening these programmatic activities might help reduce the burden of overweight- and obesity-related cancer. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, the weights and BMI histories of cancer patients were not known. Second, because race and ethnicity data are abstracted from medical records, they are subject to misclassification ( https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/npcr/uscs/technical_notes/interpreting/race.htm ). Third, whereas IARC\u2019s most recent report was used to define overweight- and obesity-related cancer, this might underestimate the actual burden, because evidence is still accumulating related to the association of overweight and obesity with other cancers ( 3 ). Fourth, many different risk factors might contribute to development of overweight- and obesity-related cancers, such as genetic mutations; chronic infections; and tobacco, hormone, and alcohol use ( 2 ). Changes in these other risks, as well as in cancer screening rates, might have affected the number of cancer cases and the trends described in this report. Finally, although this report tracks overweight- and obesity-related cancers, it does not estimate what proportion of these cancers are attributable to overweight and obesity. \nThe incidence of overweight- and obesity-related cancers (excluding colorectal cancer) increased significantly among persons aged 20\u201374 years during 2005\u20132014, mirroring increases of obesity observed since 1960 ( 1 ). Multilevel approaches to comprehensive cancer control that address social determinants of health and include evidence-based interventions that address healthy weight and other cancer risk factors might help reduce the burden of cancer and other chronic diseases in the United States.

These cancers account for about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014, according to the latest Vital Signs report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Overall, the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, but increases in overweight- and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress. \nAbout 630,000 people in the U.S. were diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight and obesity in 2014. About 2 in 3 occurred in adults 50- to 74-years-old. The rates of obesity-related cancers, not including colorectal cancer, increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. The rates of non-obesity related cancers declined during that time. \n\u201cA majority of American adults weigh more than recommended \u2013 and being overweight or obese puts people at higher risk for a number of cancers \u2013 so these findings are a cause for concern,\u201d said CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D. \u201cBy getting to and keeping a healthy weight, we all can play a role in cancer prevention.\u201d \nIn 2013-2014, about 2 out of 3 adults in the U.S. were overweight (defined as having a body mass index of 25-29.9 kg/m 2 ) or had obesity (having a body mass index of 30 kg/m 2 and higher). The body mass index (BMI) is a person\u2019s weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of the person\u2019s height (in meters). \nMany people are not aware that being overweight and having obesity are associated with some cancers. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has identified 13 cancers associated with overweight and obesity: meningioma, multiple myeloma, adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, and cancers of the thyroid, postmenopausal breast, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus, colon and rectum (colorectal). Screening for colorectal cancer prevents new cases by finding abnormal growths in the colon and rectum before they turn into cancer. \nThe Vital Signs report, by CDC and National Cancer Institute (NCI) researchers, analyzed 2014 cancer incidence data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and reviewed data from 2005 to 2014 to determine trends for cancers associated with overweight and obesity. \nKey findings regarding cancer types associated with overweight and obesity: 55 percent of all cancers diagnosed in women and 24 percent of those diagnosed in men are associated with overweight and obesity. Non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites had higher incidence rates compared with other racial and ethnic groups. Black males and American Indian/Alaska Native males had higher incidence rates than white males. Cancers associated with overweight and obesity, excluding colorectal cancer, increased 7 percent between 2005-2014. Colorectal cancer decreased 23 percent, due in large part to screening. Cancers not associated with overweight and obesity decreased 13 percent. Cancers associated with overweight and obesity, excluding colorectal cancer, increased among adults younger than age 75. \n\u201cAs an oncologist, when people ask me if there\u2019s a cure for cancer, I say, \u2018Yes, good health is the best prescription for preventing chronic diseases, including cancer,\u2019\u201d said Lisa C. Richardson, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC\u2019s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. \u201cWhat that means to healthcare providers like me is helping people to have the information they need to make healthy choices where they live, work, learn, and play.\u201d \nHow can healthcare providers help? Measure patients\u2019 weight, height, and body mass index, and counsel them on keeping a healthy weight and its role in cancer prevention. Refer patients with obesity to intensive programs that include a variety of activities to help people manage their weight. Connect patients and families with community services to help them have easier access to healthy food and ways to be active. \nCDC\u2019s efforts to prevent overweight and obesity-related cancers \nThe National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program funds all 50 states, the District of Columbia, eight tribes, and seven territories to support cancer coalitions in each jurisdiction and coordinate cancer control activities, including comprehensive strategies to prevent and control overweight and obesity. \nThe State Public Health Action Program addresses nutrition, physical activity, and obesity in workplaces, schools, early childhood education facilities, and in communities. \nCDC\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries and NCI\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program produce the United States Cancer Statistics report, which contains statistics on all new cancer cases, and the data necessary to identify trends in cancers associated with risk factors such as overweight and obesity. \nThe Guide to Community Preventive Services recommends several evidence-based programs that communities can use to prevent and control obesity. \nFor more information about CDC\u2019s efforts to prevent cancer and reduce overweight and obesity visit www.cdc.gov/cancer and www.cdc.gov/obesity . \nTo read the entire Vital Signs report, visit: www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/obesity-cancer \nAbout Vital Signs \nVital Signs is a report that appears as part of the CDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .

Substantial geographic variations in suicide rates exist, with suicides in rural areas occurring at much higher rates than those occurring in more urban areas. Understanding demographic trends and mechanisms of death among and within urbanization levels is important to developing and targeting future prevention efforts. \nReporting Period: 2001\u20132015. \nDescription of System: Mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) include demographic, geographic, and cause of death information derived from death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NVSS was used to identify suicide deaths, defined by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause of death codes X60\u2013X84, Y87.0, and U03. This report examines annual county level trends in suicide rates during 2001\u20132015 among and within urbanization levels by select demographics and mechanisms of death. Counties were collapsed into three urbanization levels using the 2006 National Center for Health Statistics classification scheme. \nResults: Suicide rates increased across the three urbanization levels, with higher rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties than in medium/small or large metropolitan counties. Each urbanization level experienced substantial annual rate changes at different times during the study period. Across urbanization levels, suicide rates were consistently highest for men and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives compared with rates for women and other racial/ethnic groups; however, rates were highest for non-Hispanic whites in more metropolitan counties. Trends indicate that suicide rates for non-Hispanic blacks were lowest in nonmetropolitan/rural counties and highest in more urban counties. Increases in suicide rates occurred for all age groups across urbanization levels, with the highest rates for persons aged 35\u201364 years. For mechanism of death, greater increases in rates of suicide by firearms and hanging/suffocation occurred across all urbanization levels; rates of suicide by firearms in nonmetropolitan/rural counties were almost two times that of rates in larger metropolitan counties. \nInterpretation: Suicide rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties are consistently higher than suicide rates in metropolitan counties. These trends also are observed by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death. \nPublic Health Action: Interventions to prevent suicides should be ongoing, particularly in rural areas. Comprehensive suicide prevention efforts might include leveraging protective factors and providing innovative prevention strategies that increase access to health care and mental health care in rural communities. In addition, distribution of socioeconomic factors varies in different communities and needs to be better understood in the context of suicide prevention. Top Introduction \nSuicides, the fatal component of suicidal behavior, result from an interaction of individual, interpersonal, social, and environmental influences ( 1 ). These deaths take a toll on society. In 2015, suicide ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in the United States and was the cause of 44,193 deaths ( 2 ). One of the Healthy People 2020 objectives is to reduce suicides by 10% (from 11.3 suicides per 100,000 population in 2007 to 10.2 by 2020); however, during 2005\u20132015 the age-adjusted suicide rate increased 21.6% whereas many other causes of mortality have declined ( 3 , 4 ). The increase has been manifested across multiple demographic groups ( 3 ). One study, after adjusting for underreporting, estimated the 2013 U.S. national cost of suicide and suicide attempts at $93.5 billion ( 5 ). \nPatterns of suicide have been associated with various sociodemographic characteristics. For example, in the United States, suicide rates are higher for males than for females and for adults aged \u226545 years than for adolescents and young adults; overall rates are higher for non-Hispanic white and American Indian/Alaska Native populations than for other racial/ethnic groups ( 6 ). Recent trends have demonstrated an increase in suicides, particularly among working age adults aged 45\u201364 years ( 3 ). Previous studies have documented regional and state differences in suicide rates in the United States ( 7 \u2013 10 ). Suicide rates tend to be higher in the West than in the South, Midwest, and Northeast. In at least one study, regional differences in demographic patterns (i.e., age, race/Hispanic ethnicity, and sex) did not account for variations in suicide rates ( 7 ), indicating that some other factor, possibly population density ( 11 ), might be influencing the differences. An analysis of urban-rural differences focused on specific age groups (e.g., youths and older adults) and highlighted the disparities ( 8 , 9 ). In addition, the level of urbanization is associated with suicide rates. One study analyzed death certificate data during 1999\u20132015 and reported that suicide rates in less urban areas are higher than in more urban areas and the gap in rates has been widening ( 10 ). This report analyzes death certificate data during 2001\u20132015 to describe patterns of suicide by level of urbanization, demographic characteristics, and mechanism of death in the United States. Public health professionals and prevention program staff can use the data to identify specific populations in need of targeted interventions to address suicide rates. Top Methods \nThe National Vital Statistics System annual compressed mortality data files during 2001\u20132015 were used to identify suicides using International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) underlying cause of death codes X60\u2013X84, Y87.0, and U03, excluding foreign residents ( 12 ). Three-year moving averages were used to reduce the variability of a small number of observations in a particular period. Working backward from 2015 (the most recent data year), 2001 was identified as the starting point. Going back further would have required the inclusion of 1998 data, which use the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) for coding cause of death, rather than ICD-10 codes. Children aged <10 years (74 deaths) were excluded because intent for self-harm is not usually attributed to young children. Annual suicide counts were summarized using the 2006 National Center for Health Statistics urban-rural classification scheme for counties ( 13 ). The six-level 2006 classification scheme was selected to coincide with the middle of the study period and to align with the results of a recent report on trends by level of urbanization ( 2 , 10 , 12 ). Following are the six classification levels for counties: \nLarge central metropolitan is part of a metropolitan statistical area with \u22651 million population and includes a principal city. \nLarge fringe metropolitan is part of a metropolitan statistical area with \u22651 million population but does not include a principal city. \nMedium metropolitan is part of a metropolitan statistical area with \u2265250,000 but <1 million population. \nSmall metropolitan is part of a metropolitan statistical area with <250,000 population. \nMicropolitan (nonmetropolitan) is part of a micropolitan statistical area (has an urban cluster of \u226510,000 but <50,000 population). \nNoncore (nonmetropolitan) is not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area. \nLevels of urbanization were further collapsed into large metropolitan, medium/small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan/rural for selected analyses. Large metropolitan includes counties from large central metropolitan and large fringe metropolitan areas. Medium/small metropolitan includes counties from medium and small metropolitan areas. Nonmetropolitan/rural includes counties from micropolitan and noncore areas. \nU.S. Census Bureau county level population estimates were used to calculate annual suicide rates (per 100,000 population among persons aged \u226510 years). Rates were age adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population ( 3 , 10 ). Joinpoint regression analyses were used to examine the magnitude and direction of the annual trends in suicide rates for each level of urbanization. During the study period, there were two joinpoints in the large metropolitan counties and one joinpoint in all other levels of urbanization at p value <0.05 statistical significance level. Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and Joinpoint version 4.4.0 (Statistical Methodology and Applications Branch, Surveillance Research Program, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland) software. Top Results \nDuring 2001\u20132015, a total of 256,511 suicides were reported in large metropolitan, 173,045 in medium/small metropolitan, and 114,559 in nonmetropolitan/rural counties ( Table ). Joinpoint regression analyses indicated increases in annual age-adjusted suicide rates across the three urbanization levels during the study period, with counties in more urban areas having the lowest suicide rates and counties in less urban areas having the highest suicide rates ( Figure 1 ). In large metropolitan counties, annual suicide rates decreased during 2001\u20132005, then increased during 2005\u20132010; these changes in rates were significant. During 2010\u20132015, although suicide rates continued to increase in large metropolitan counties, these increases were not significant. In nonmetropolitan/rural and medium/small metropolitan counties, increases in suicide rates occurred during 2001\u20132007 and the increases accelerated in 2007 and 2008. \nAnalysis according to sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death by urbanization level indicated gradual increases in suicide rates occurring across the three urbanization levels for both males and females, with lower rates in large metropolitan counties and higher rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties ( Figure 2 ). The greatest rate increases occurred in medium/small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan/rural counties for both sexes. Across all three urbanization levels, suicide rates for males were four to five times higher than for females during the study period. By race/ethnicity, rates typically increased in all counties across the study period for all racial/ethnic groups, with greater increases in the medium/small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan/rural counties. Non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives had the highest suicide rates across all three urbanization levels, with both groups experiencing greater increases compared with non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Hispanics across the study period. With the exception of non-Hispanic blacks, suicide rates were higher in nonmetropolitan/rural counties. During 2001\u20132015, rates for all age groups typically increased, with greater increases occurring in medium/small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan/rural counties. For all urbanization levels, higher rates were observed among persons aged \u226525 years, with the highest rates among those aged 35\u201364 years. Across all urbanization levels, firearms were the most often used mechanism of death, with rates in nonmetropolitan/rural counties almost double those in large metropolitan and medium/small metropolitan counties. Greater increases in rates of suicide by firearms and hanging/suffocation were observed across all urbanization levels whereas lesser increases in rates of suicide by drug poisoning, nondrug poisoning, and other mechanisms were observed during the study period. Top Discussion \nDuring 2001\u20132015, age-adjusted suicide rates for nonmetropolitan/rural counties were consistently higher than for medium/small and large metropolitan counties. Although other studies have documented these differences ( 10 ), this report examined annual changes in rates by urbanization level along with trends among and within urbanization levels by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death. A closer look at annual rate changes revealed substantial increases after 2005 for large metropolitan counties, after 2008 for medium/small metropolitan counties, and after 2007 for nonmetropolitan/rural counties. Although the Great Recession officially began in 2007 and ended in 2009 ( 14 ), differential effects were observed at different points in different geographic areas ( 14 ). Economic indicators (e.g., housing foreclosures, poverty, and unemployment) vary by urbanization level, with rural areas usually having greater prevalence of these negative factors ( 15 ). Factors such as housing foreclosures and overall business cycles negatively affect suicide rates and other health outcomes ( 16 \u2013 18 ). A combination of these factors likely contributed to the differences in annual suicide rate changes by urbanization level observed in this study. In addition, because U.S. suicide rates were increasing before the Great Recession, other contributors to the changes in rates were likely ( 19 ). \nThe differences observed in suicide rates by sex within urbanization levels are consistent with previous findings that age-adjusted suicide rates tend to be higher for men than for women ( 3 ). This difference is maintained regardless of urbanization level, with differences most notable in nonmetropolitan/rural counties. By race/ethnicity, age-adjusted suicide rates for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives are consistently the highest, followed by rates for non-Hispanic whites across all periods; however, when comparing rates by race/ethnicity across urbanization levels, suicide rates are highest for non-Hispanic whites in metropolitan counties and for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Natives in nonmetropolitan/rural counties. \nCDC released a technical package of policies, programs, and practices to prevent suicide that includes examples of programs that can be tailored to fit the cultural needs of different racial/ethnic groups ( 20 ). The technical package is a compilation of a core set of strategies, developed using the best available evidence, that have the greatest prevention potential. For example, a suicide prevention program called Sources of Strength was developed with rural and tribal communities in North Dakota to promote connectedness between youth and adults. The program strategy is to understand and respond to underlying causes of suicidal behavior and promote protective factors against suicidal behavior to prevent adverse outcomes. Sources of Strength is a universal (i.e., programs administered to all children in classrooms regardless of individual risk status) school-based approach to suicide prevention that is designed to build socioecological protective influences across the student population. Youth opinion leaders are recruited from diverse social backgrounds, including some who are at risk for suicidal behavior. They are trained to change the norms and behaviors of their peers by conducting well-defined messaging activities with adult mentoring ( 21 ). Local implementers might need to tailor this and other programs discussed in CDC\u2019s technical package for suicide prevention to specific cultural practices and traditions of tribes in rural areas. \nAnother notable finding regarding racial/ethnic differences by urbanization level was identified from analysis of the total age-adjusted rates by urbanization level across the study period. For non-Hispanic blacks, suicide rates do not follow the historical trend of being highest in rural areas. Except during 2004\u20132006, rates for non-Hispanic blacks in rural areas were consistently lower than rates for non-Hispanic blacks in urban areas, with fluctuations across the entire period. A previous study using data from the 1993 National Mortality Followback Survey to identify risk and protective factors specific to suicide among blacks identified rural residence as a protective factor ( 22 ). A hypothesis that has been proposed to support this finding is that blacks living in urban areas will be more at risk for suicide due to the stressors and strains of urban life, including unaccustomed social isolation, as well as difficulty acculturating to middle-class suburban living ( 22 ). \nFindings by age group among urbanization levels revealed increases in rates for all age groups, with the highest rates and greatest rate increases in more rural areas. Within all urbanization levels, the highest rates were observed among persons aged 35\u201364 years. This age group has been of particular interest given increases in suicide rates among middle-aged whites ( 23 ). Findings are consistent with those of studies that have identified a pattern of increasing mortality among non-Hispanic white populations, which is in part attributed to increases in drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related mortality, especially among persons aged 45\u201354 years ( 24 ). By mechanism of death within each urbanization level, firearms were the most common, with the highest rates and greatest rate increases in rural areas. Among urbanization levels, rates for firearms as the mechanism of death in nonmetropolitan/rural counties were approximately two times the rates of those in metropolitan counties. This might be attributed, in part, to firearm ownership being more common in rural areas and a large number of rural community residents being familiar with firearm use ( 25 ). \nSuicide rates by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death for the general population are higher in rural communities than in urban areas. In addition to considering differences by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death, this study underscores the need for analyses both among and within urbanization levels with the goal of designing and implementing tailored suicide prevention efforts. To address suicide in rural areas, the Health Resources and Services Administration has developed activities including epidemiologic studies, research, and programs for primary health care providers. Ongoing work by CDC in suicide prevention from a public health perspective, such as programs that focus on middle-aged men, a group experiencing one of the greatest increases in suicide rates ( 3 ), is an important step in decreasing overall suicide rates in the United States. Prevention practitioners could use these findings to prioritize and allocate resources for their rural populations as part of efforts to meet the Healthy People 2020 goal to reduce the suicide rate by 10% ( 4 ). Top Limitations \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, mortality data from the compressed mortality data file missing information on Hispanic origin were excluded when calculating death rates for this group (i.e., no corresponding population denominator data are available). The small fraction (1,970 [0.0036%]) of suicide data excluded might have resulted in a slight underestimation of some rates. Second, use of the 2006 six-level classification scheme does not reflect a number of county reclassifications made in the updated 2013 classification scheme. Although these changes are not reflected in this report, fewer than 10% of counties had different category assignments in the two schemes, with the majority of counties shifted to a more urban category. The effects of using the earlier classification scheme are expected to be minimal. Third, the 2006 National Center for Health Statistics six-level county classifications were further collapsed into three groups (large metropolitan, medium/small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan/rural) for comparative purposes. Collapsing these categories from six into three might further mask the heterogeneity of certain counties. Fourth, on April 3, 2017, CDC released a revised data file for 2014 to include corrections affecting 125 deaths previously coded to accidental discharge of firearms (ICD-10 codes W32\u2013W34). Of the 125 deaths, 53 were reclassified as intentional self-harm (suicide) by discharge of firearms (ICD-10 codes X72\u2013X74). These revisions were not available for inclusion in this report; however, substantial differences in rates and substantial effects on the results and conclusions in this report are not anticipated. Finally, undercounting or underreporting could have an impact on the findings. Suicides are often undercounted on death certificates and studies have indicated they are differentially undercounted for females and racial/ethnic minorities; therefore, the suicide rates in this report are likely to be underestimates ( 26 ). The degree of underreporting might also vary by level of urbanization and mechanism of death, and misclassification of race/ethnicity on death certificates, particularly among the American Indian/Alaska Native population, could also affect the findings. Top Future Directions \nDetailed analysis of suicide rates among and within urbanization levels by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death can provide more comprehensive knowledge of national trends and highlight the greater needs in rural communities. Although CDC\u2019s technical package to prevent suicide might help states and communities focus on strategies supported by the best available evidence, ongoing evaluation of suicide prevention programs is still necessary to advance suicide prevention efforts ( 20 ). This study emphasizes the need for development and evaluation of suicide prevention efforts specific to rural communities. Innovative prevention strategies, such as telebehavioral health (i.e., telephone-, video-, and web-based technologies), are a promising option to increasing access to health care and mental health care in rural communities ( 20 ); however, rural communities often have limited access to the Internet ( 27 ). Future analyses might target identification of rural communities whose populations are at greatest risk for suicide to prioritize Federal Communications Commission broadband access needs, furthering telebehavioral health approaches and helping to reduce suicide rates. \nIn the move toward more comprehensive suicide prevention approaches, prevention specialists might need to consider tailoring specific programs to the needs of various racial/ethnic groups for effective prevention efforts. Although all-cause mortality rates for blacks are higher than those for whites, suicide is the only leading cause of death for which the death rate is lower among blacks compared with whites for all age groups ( 28 ). Among American Indian/Alaska Natives, suicide rates in rural areas are substantially higher than the already high rates for this population. Future studies should attempt to identify risk factors and protective factors for suicide specific to racial/ethnic groups. Top Conclusion \nNonmetropolitan/rural counties have higher suicide rates than medium/small and large metropolitan counties. Over the study period, notable changes were observed in rates by urbanization level. A combination of factors, including economic and health indicators, likely contributed to the differences in annual suicide rate changes by urbanization level ( 14 \u2013 18 ) observed in this study. Trends in suicide rates by sex, race/ethnicity, age group, and mechanism of death that are observed in the general population indicate that rates are consistently higher in rural communities. Findings from this study underscore the need to identify protective factors as part of comprehensive suicide prevention efforts, particularly in rural areas. Additional information on suicide rates in rural areas might be used to evaluate current suicide prevention efforts and determine which rural communities to prioritize when allocating public health and mental health resources.

To have the most positive impact on the health outcomes of young people, government agencies, community organizations, schools, and other community members must work together through a collaborative and comprehensive approach. \nThe Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) model expands on the eight elements of CDC\u2019s coordinated school health ( CSH ) approach and is combined with the whole child framework .

However, only 49 percent of pregnant women who delivered between fall 2015 and spring 2016 received the vaccine. CDC recommends women get Tdap during each pregnancy to provide critical short-term protection to babies when they are most at risk for this life-threatening illness. \nThe study used data from 2011 through 2014 on babies younger than two months from six states. It found that mothers whose babies had whooping cough were less likely to have received Tdap during pregnancy. The study reported that, in addition to being 78 percent effective at preventing whooping cough, Tdap vaccination during the third trimester was 90 percent effective at preventing serious cases of whooping cough that require hospitalization. \n\u201cWomen have such a great opportunity to help protect their babies before they enter the world by getting Tdap vaccine while pregnant,\u201d said Nancy Messonnier, M.D. , director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. \u201cThis study highlights how babies can benefit when their mothers get the vaccine and reinforces CDC\u2019s recommendation for women to get Tdap vaccine in the third trimester of each pregnancy.\u201d \nYoung babies at highest risk \nWhooping cough is a serious disease that can cause uncontrollable, violent coughing that often makes it hard to breathe. In this study, 65 percent of babies younger than two months who got whooping cough needed treatment in the hospital. Babies younger than one year are at the highest risk for severe complications or death. Typically, between five and 15 babies die from whooping cough each year in the United States. Most deaths are in those too young to be protected by getting their own whooping cough vaccines. Babies do not get vaccinated to start building their own protection against whooping cough until they are two months old. \nTdap vaccine history and recommendation \nBefore the introduction of whooping cough vaccines in the 1940s, more than 200,000 cases were reported per year in the United States. After vaccines became available, whooping cough cases declined dramatically to fewer than 10,000 cases reported by 1965. Beginning in the 1980s, whooping cough started making a comeback, though not to the levels seen before vaccines were available. Since 2010, there have been tens of thousands of whooping cough cases reported each year nationwide, with a peak of more than 48,000 cases reported in 2012. More than a third of all whooping cough hospitalizations and two thirds of all whooping cough deaths are in babies younger than two months. To date in 2017, more than 11,000 cases of whooping cough have been reported in the United States. \nIn 2012, CDC began recommending women get a whooping cough vaccine during each pregnancy. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Nurse-Midwives , healthcare professionals who specialize in caring for pregnant women, support this recommendation, as do the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Family Physicians . CDC recommends that doctors and midwives administer Tdap at 27 through 36 weeks of pregnancy, preferably in the earlier part of that period. This timing leads to the most transfer of protective antibodies from mothers to their babies. \nPrevious research \nToday\u2019s study adds to the growing body of research on Tdap vaccination during pregnancy that indicates it prevents whooping cough in babies who are too young to receive their own whooping cough vaccines. Three other studies from the United Kingdom and two from California also show much lower rates of whooping cough in babies whose mothers received Tdap during pregnancy. Another California study also found that babies with whooping cough whose mothers received Tdap during pregnancy were significantly less likely to need care in a hospital. \nTo learn more about CDC\u2019s Tdap vaccine recommendation for pregnant women, visit CDC\u2019s Pregnancy and Whooping Cough website. \nFor more information about whooping cough symptoms, prevention, and outbreaks, visit CDC\u2019s Pertussis (Whooping Cough) website. ###", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T02:38:46.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9bd92f5496b5fbee392aed8fe431fa9016bd150", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvRjd9K43DnCESsOrT0ENotM-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/rss/mmwr.xml", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", "title": "Human Adenovirus Surveillance \u2014 United States, 2003\u20132016", "title_full": "Human Adenovirus Surveillance \u2014 United States, 2003\u20132016", "published": "2017-10-06T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/mm6639a2_Human_Adenovirus_Surveillance.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9bd92f5496b5fbee392aed8fe431fa9016bd150", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvRjd9K43DnCESsOrT0ENotM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Human Adenovirus Surveillance \u2014 United States, 2003\u20132016", "text": "Human Adenovirus Surveillance \u2014 United States, 2003\u20132016 \nWeekly / October 6, 2017 / 66(39);1039\u20131042 Format: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Views: Summary \nWhat is already known about this topic? \nHuman adenoviruses (HAdVs) can cause a wide spectrum of clinical illness, ranging from asymptomatic infections to severe illnesses and death. Approximately 60 HAdV genotypes have been identified to date, and they are associated with different clinical illnesses, including respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis. Surveillance for circulating HAdV types in the United States is passive and voluntary but might be useful to inform diagnostic and surveillance activities by clinicians and public health practitioners. \nWhat is added by this report? \nBased on data from the National Adenovirus Type Reporting System, the most commonly reported types of HAdVs during 2003\u20132016 in the United States were HAdV types 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 14, which accounted for 85.5% (n = 1,283) of all types reported. Year-to-year fluctuations in HAdV types circulating in the United States varied considerably, likely reflecting increases in testing in response to recognized HAdV outbreaks. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nHAdV type-based surveillance data can be used to determine patterns of circulation for individual HAdV types in the United States, assist with the recognition and documentation of outbreaks associated with circulating types, and guide development of new diagnostic tests, therapeutics, and vaccines. \nHuman adenoviruses (HAdVs) are nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses in the family Adenoviridae; seven species (A\u2013G) and >60 genotypes are known to cause human infection ( 1 ). Clinical manifestations associated with HAdV infection include fever, acute respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, and conjunctivitis. HAdV infection can be severe, particularly among immunocompromised patients, and can cause respiratory failure, disseminated infection, hemorrhagic cystitis, neurologic disease, and death ( 1 , 2 ). Illness tends to occur sporadically and without demonstrated seasonality. Outbreaks of HAdV have been reported globally in communities ( 3 ), and in closed or crowded settings, including dormitories, health care settings, and among military recruits, for whom a vaccine against HAdV type 4 (HAdV-4) and HAdV type 7 (HAdV-7) has been developed ( 4 , 5 ). CDC summarized HAdV detections voluntarily reported through the National Adenovirus Type Reporting System (NATRS) after initiation of surveillance in 2014 to describe trends in reported HAdVs circulating in the United States. Reporting laboratories were also encouraged to report available results for specimens collected before surveillance began. Overall, the number of reporting laboratories and HAdV type identifications reported to NATRS has increased substantially from the start of official reporting in 2014 through 2016; this report describes specimens collected during 2003\u20132016. The most commonly reported HAdV types were HAdV type 3 (HAdV-3) and HAdV type 2 (HAdV-2), although HAdV types reported fluctuated considerably from year to year. In the United States, information on recently circulating HAdV types is needed to inform diagnostic and surveillance activities by clinicians and public health practitioners. Routine reporting to NATRS by all U.S. laboratories with the capacity to type HAdVs could help strengthen this surveillance system. \nNATRS is a passive laboratory-based surveillance system initiated in 2014 to coordinate reporting of laboratory identifications of HAdV types in the United States. Traditional typing techniques based on serologic methods have been largely replaced by molecular typing techniques including sequencing and conventional or real-time polymerase chain reaction, which can rapidly determine HAdV types. However, the number of public health and clinical laboratories with the capacity to type HAdVs using molecular techniques remains limited, and traditional methods are labor intensive and time consuming. Commercial molecular assays are more readily available; although some of these assays determine species, they do not identify specific types. Public health and clinical laboratories without the capacity to type HAdVs can send specimens of public health or clinical importance to CDC\u2019s Respiratory Virus Diagnostics Laboratory. All participating laboratories are encouraged to report HAdV typing data quarterly to NATRS accompanied by limited demographic, clinical, and laboratory data. \nEleven laboratories reported data to NATRS during 2014\u20132016, including the CDC Respiratory Virus Diagnostics Laboratory, public health laboratories from seven states, two clinical laboratories, and one U.S. Department of Defense laboratory. Data with specimen-collection years 2003\u20132013 represent retrospective data from reporting laboratories with the capacity to test and type before surveillance formally began in 2014. All typing data for specimens collected during 2003\u20132007 was provided by the CDC Respiratory Virus Diagnostics Laboratory. Five laboratories, including the CDC Respiratory Virus Diagnostics Laboratory, provided data for typed detections among specimens collected during 2008\u20132013 (ranging from two laboratories in 2008 to five in 2013). NATRS received reports for 2,138 HAdV detections among specimens collected during 2003\u20132016. Species and type were reported for 2,107 (98.6%) and 1,497 (70.0%) detections, respectively, representing 22 types ( Table 1 ) from 32 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to patient state of residence. The most commonly reported specimen types were respiratory specimens (N = 1,227; 82.0%), ocular swabs (61; 4.1%), and stool or rectal swabs (35; 1.8%). Species C (N = 683; 41%) and B (657; 40%) were the most commonly reported species during the 13-year period. The number of typed HAdV identifications reported by year of specimen collection ranged from two in 2003 to 269 in 2014 when data collection began and increased to 362 in 2016. HAdV-3 (N = 341; 22.8%), HAdV-2 (293; 19.6%), HAdV type 1 (HAdV-1) (248; 16.6%), HAdV-4 (185; 12.4%), HAdV-7 (127; 8.5%), and HAdV type 14 (HAdV-14) (89; 5.9%) accounted for 1,283 (85.5%) of the 1,497 reports with type identified ( Figure ) (Table 1). A single type was identified in 1,490 (99.5%) specimens, whereas detection of two types was identified in seven (0.5%) specimens. Year-to-year fluctuations in circulating types were evaluated using data reported during 2014\u20132016. HAdV-3, HAdV-2, HAdV-1, and HAdV-4 were among the most common types identified each year during this period; however, the frequency with which individual types were reported varied considerably from year to year ( Table 2 ). The most commonly reported typing methods included serum neutralization (N = 591; 39.5%), full or partial genome sequencing (567; 37.9%), and real-time polymerase chain reaction (285; 19.0%). Top Discussion \nType-based HAdV surveillance in the United States has three objectives: 1) to monitor patterns of circulation for HAdV types over time; 2) to assist with recognition and confirmation of outbreaks associated with circulating types; and 3) to inform development or use of diagnostics tests, therapeutics, and vaccines. After initiation of NATRS in 2014, this is the first report describing national trends in HAdV type circulation in the United States, and fluctuations in frequency of HAdV types during 2014\u20132016. \nDuring 2003\u20132016, the six most commonly reported types were HAdV-3, HAdV-2, HAdV-1, HAdV-4, HAdV-7, and HAdV-14, which have all been detected in association with acute respiratory illness worldwide ( 2 ). HAdV-7 was recognized in the United States as an important cause of severe respiratory illness among adults in a community outbreak in Oregon in 2014 ( 3 ). Nearly half of HAdV-7 detections (n = 62; 48.8%) in NATRS occurred during 2014 (Table 2) as a result of sampling and typing of specimens collected as part of the Oregon outbreak investigation. Before 2014, HAdV-7 was uncommonly reported among civilian populations, although respiratory illness outbreaks had been reported among military recruits ( 6 ). Respiratory illness associated with HAdV-4 also has been well documented among military recruits, but has been less commonly reported among civilian populations ( 7 ). \nA live, oral vaccine against HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 was given to all U.S. military members from 1971 to 1999. After depletion of the vaccine in 1999, HAdV-4 reemerged as the main cause of febrile respiratory illness among military service members, especially among those in initial entry (i.e., basic) training. Subsequent reintroduction of HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 vaccine at all U.S. initial entry training sites in late 2011 led to declines in overall rates of respiratory illness and in incidence of adenovirus infections( 8 , 9 ). The prevalence of respiratory illness associated with HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 in non-military congregate populations that might potentially benefit from HAdV vaccination is not known. \nOther common HAdV types reported to NATRS include HAdV-14, which was first documented in North American military populations in 2006 ( 2 , 10 ). After HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 vaccine re-introduction in 2011, HAdV-14 surpassed HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 as the most prevalent HAdV type reported in these settings, although the actual number of cases of HAdV-14 did not increase ( 8 ). By 2007, outbreaks of respiratory illness because of HAdV-14 in multiple civilian populations were also documented ( 4 ). Among the 89 HAdV-14 detections reported to NATRS during 2003\u20132016, the highest number (25) and percentage (28.1%) were reported during 2007, likely coinciding with specimens collected during documented outbreaks of HAdV-14 among community and military populations and in health care settings in certain states during this period. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, NATRS is a passive system that relies on voluntary participation from laboratories, and data might be biased by outbreak investigations and nonrandom sample selection for typing; therefore, types reported might not be representative of the HAdV types circulating nationally or regionally. Second, NATRS collects limited clinical information, restricting the interpretation of trends in HAdV disease associated with circulating types. Third, although quarterly reporting to NATRS is encouraged and allows for retrospective outbreak documentation, not all participating laboratories submit timely data, limiting the ability to detect outbreaks of HAdVs in real-time. Finally, although the number of laboratories with the capacity to test for specific HAdV types and report to NATRS is increasing, the relatively small number of reporters limits the reliability and generalizability of these results. \nNATRS monitors patterns of HAdV circulation in the United States based on voluntary laboratory reporting of detections by type. Understanding currently circulating HAdV types and improving the reliability and generalizability of surveillance data relies upon voluntary reports to NATRS from public health and clinical laboratories. The long-term sustainability of NATRS depends on building and maintaining the capacity to identify and type HAdVs among public health and clinical laboratories; improving timeliness of reporting by currently participating laboratories; and increasing the number of participating laboratories.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T08:08:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "31b8f603109baa5fd8eb30cfc1b9905235034829", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbva40PCGacZu8YOGDZuvxcHs-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/rss/mmwr.xml", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", "title": "Update: Influenza Activity \u2014 United States and Worldwide, May 21\u2013September 23, 2017", "title_full": "Update: Influenza Activity \u2014 United States and Worldwide, May 21\u2013September 23, 2017", "published": "2017-10-06T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/mm6639a3_Influenza_Activity_United-States_Worldwide.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "31b8f603109baa5fd8eb30cfc1b9905235034829", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbva40PCGacZu8YOGDZuvxcHs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Update: Influenza Activity \u2014 United States and Worldwide, May 21\u2013September 23, 2017", "text": "Metric Details \nLenee Blanton, MPH 1 ; David E.

Timing of influenza activity and predominant circulating influenza viruses vary by season. \nWhat is added by this report? \nWorldwide, influenza activity during May 21\u2013September 23, 2017, followed typical seasonality and in the United States overall, low levels of seasonal influenza activity were detected. The majority of influenza viruses genetically and antigenically characterized at CDC were similar to the reference viruses representing the recommended components for the 2017\u201318 vaccine. A small subset of antigenically distinct influenza B/Victoria viruses was detected. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nIn the United States, an annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged \u22656 months and can reduce the likelihood of becoming ill with influenza and transmitting the virus to others. Annual influenza vaccination offers optimal protection regardless of whether the vaccine composition has changed since the previous season, because immunity wanes over time. Although vaccination is the best method for preventing and reducing the impact of influenza, antiviral medications are an important adjunct. Early treatment with influenza antiviral medications is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza (either seasonal influenza or novel influenza virus infection) who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza-related complications. Testing for seasonal influenza viruses and monitoring for novel influenza A virus infections should continue year-round. \nDuring May 21\u2013September 23, 2017,* the United States experienced low-level seasonal influenza virus activity; however, beginning in early September, CDC received reports of a small number of localized influenza outbreaks caused by influenza A(H3N2) viruses. In addition to influenza A(H3N2) viruses, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses were detected during May\u2013September worldwide and in the United States. Influenza B viruses predominated in the United States from late May through late June, and influenza A viruses predominated beginning in early July. The majority of the influenza viruses collected and received from the United States and other countries during that time have been characterized genetically or antigenically as being similar to the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017\u201318 Northern Hemisphere cell-grown vaccine reference viruses; however, a smaller proportion of the circulating A(H3N2) viruses showed similarity to the egg-grown A(H3N2) vaccine reference virus which represents the A(H3N2) viruses used for the majority of vaccine production in the United States. Also, during May 21\u2013September 23, 2017, CDC confirmed a total of 33 influenza variant virus \u2020 infections; two were influenza A(H1N2) variant (H1N2v) viruses (Ohio) and 31 were influenza A(H3N2) variant (H3N2v) viruses (Delaware [1], Maryland [13], North Dakota [1], Pennsylvania [1], and Ohio [15]). An additional 18 specimens from Maryland have tested presumptive positive for H3v and further analysis is being conducted at CDC. Top United States \nThe U.S. Influenza Surveillance System \u00a7 is a collaboration between CDC and federal, state, local, and territorial partners and uses eight data sources to collect influenza information, \u00b6 six of which operate year-round. U.S. World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System laboratories, which include both public health and clinical laboratories throughout the United States, contribute to virologic surveillance for influenza. During May 21\u2013September 23, 2017, clinical laboratories in the United States tested 153,397 respiratory specimens for influenza viruses, 3,785 (2.5%) of which were positive ( Figure 1 ). Among these, 1,885 (49.8%) were positive for influenza A viruses, and 1,900 (50.2%) were positive for influenza B viruses. Public health laboratories in the United States tested 6,431 respiratory specimens collected during May 21\u2013September 23, 2017. Among these, 1,536 were positive for influenza ( Figure 2 ), including 842 (54.8%) that were positive for influenza A viruses, and 694 (45.2%) that were positive for influenza B viruses. Influenza B viruses were more commonly reported from late May through late June, and influenza A viruses have predominated since early July. Among the 828 (98.3%) influenza A viruses subtyped by public health laboratories, 715 (86.4%) were influenza A(H3N2) and 113 (13.6%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Among the 537 (77.4%) influenza B viruses for which lineage was determined, 398 (74.1%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 139 (25.9%) belonged to the B/Victoria lineage. \nDuring May 21\u2013September 23, the weekly percentage of outpatient visits to health care providers for influenza-like illness** from the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network remained below the national baseline \u2020\u2020 of 2.2%, ranging from 0.7% to 1.2%. Based on data from CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System, the percentage of deaths attributed to pneumonia and influenza did not exceed the epidemic threshold \u00a7\u00a7 and ranged from 5.1% to 6.1%. Four influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during May 21\u2013September 23 were reported; two were associated with an influenza A(H3N2) virus, one was associated with an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, and one was associated with an influenza B virus. Top Novel Influenza A Virus Infections \nFifty-one human infections with novel influenza A viruses were reported in the United States during May 21\u2013September 23, 2017. All of these were variant virus infections (human infections with influenza viruses that normally circulate in swine). Thirty-one have been sequenced and are H3N2v viruses reported from five states (Delaware [1], Maryland [13], North Dakota [1], Pennsylvania [1], and Ohio [15]) and two were H1N2v viruses, both from Ohio. The remaining 18 viruses have tested presumptive positive for H3v at the Maryland public health laboratory and further confirmatory testing is being performed by CDC. All 51 patients reported exposure to swine in a fair setting during the week preceding illness onset. Swine influenza A viruses were identified from respiratory specimens collected from pigs at multiple fairs. Forty-seven of the 51 patients were children aged <18 years and four patients were adults aged \u226550 years. Three of the 51 patients were hospitalized. All other patients are recovering or have fully recovered from their illness. No human-to-human transmission of these viruses has been identified. \nThe viruses detected in Maryland, Ohio, North Dakota, and Pennsylvania all had a hemagglutinin (HA) gene derived from a seasonal human H3N2 virus that was likely introduced into swine by reverse zoonosis (i.e., humans infecting swine) in 2010. These viruses were closely related to H3N2 viruses known to circulate in the U.S. swine population, as well as to variant virus infections detected in Ohio and Michigan during 2016 ( 1 ). Further analysis of the variant viruses detected in the most recent cases from Maryland is being performed at CDC. One of the H1N2v viruses had an HA gene from the alpha sublineage of the classical swine H1 HA lineage ( 2 ). This is the second alpha sublineage H1N2v virus detected since the mid-1990s. The second H1N2v virus had an HA gene representative of the delta 2 sublineage circulating in swine. The HA and neuraminidase (NA) genes are closely related to 2016/2017 swine influenza viruses from the United States. The NA genes of both H3N2v and H1N2v viruses are related to human H3N2 viruses that likely entered the North American swine population around 2002 and have remained the predominant NA found in contemporary swine influenza viruses. Top Worldwide \nCDC serves as a WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza, one of six WHO Collaborating Centers for Influenza in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS). \u00b6\u00b6 CDC, along with other international public health partners, provides surveillance and virus characterization data to WHO.*** The timing of influenza activity around the world varies by region, \u2020\u2020\u2020 and areas with similar influenza transmission patterns are grouped by influenza transmission zones. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 \nReports from GISRS during May 21\u2013September 23 suggested that typical seasonal patterns of influenza activity occurred in temperate climate Southern Hemisphere countries ( 3 ). Influenza activity began to increase in late April in the temperate countries of South America, late May in Southern Africa, early June in New Zealand, and early July in Australia. Influenza activity peaked in mid-June in temperate South America, the beginning of July in Southern Africa and New Zealand, and in mid-August in Australia, although elevated activity continued through September in Southern Africa and Australia. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated across the Southern Hemisphere countries, with some reported influenza B viruses cocirculating in temperate South America, New Zealand, and Australia. In temperate-climate countries of Europe and North America, influenza activity was low, with influenza B viruses predominating. \nIn countries with tropical influenza seasonality, influenza activity levels and the predominant virus varied by country. In Central America and the Caribbean, activity was low and influenza A(H3N2) and influenza B viruses predominated. In tropical South America, influenza activity decreased from May 21 through September 23; influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated with some influenza B viruses reported. Sporadic influenza virus detections were reported in Eastern and Western Africa, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses cocirculating. In Eastern Asia, high levels of influenza activity were reported in Southern China, Hong Kong special administrative region (SAR), and Taiwan beginning in July, peaked in mid-August, and decreased through September 23; influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated. In Southern Asia, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated, with elevated activity reported in India, Nepal, and the Maldives. Influenza activity in Southeast Asia was elevated in August and September. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in the Philippines and Myanmar. Influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B viruses cocirculated in Singapore, and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza B viruses cocirculated in Vietnam. \nDuring May 23\u2013September 13, WHO reported 100 laboratory-confirmed human infections with avian influenza viruses, all from China, including 99 Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) infections, and one influenza A(H9N2) infection. \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 A total of 764 human infections, including 283 (37%) deaths, with Asian lineage avian influenza A(H7N9) virus were reported to WHO from more provinces, regions, and municipalities in China during the fifth epidemic than in the previous four epidemics combined ( 4 ). Top Genetic and Antigenic Characterization of Influenza Viruses \nThe 2017\u201318 influenza vaccine virus components were selected in March 2017, during one of two biannual WHO-sponsored vaccine consultation meetings to review influenza data generated by GISRS laboratories. The recommended Northern Hemisphere 2017\u201318 trivalent influenza vaccine composition consists of an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus. An additional influenza B virus (B/Phuket/3073/2013-like [B/Yamagata lineage]) was recommended for quadrivalent vaccines.**** These recommendations reflect an update to the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus component to a more contemporary influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus (an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus was replaced with an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus), compared with the recommendation for the Northern Hemisphere 2016\u20132017 influenza season and are the same as the vaccine virus recommendations made for the 2017 Southern Hemisphere influenza vaccine. \nMost influenza vaccines licensed in the United States, with the exception of cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccine (ccIIV4) and recombinant influenza vaccines (RIV3 and RIV4) are produced through propagation of candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs) in eggs. Historically, CVVs provided to manufacturers have been egg-derived. Egg propagation of influenza viruses, particularly influenza A(H3N2) viruses, often leads to genetic changes that might have antigenic implications. The vaccine viruses selected for the Northern Hemisphere 2017\u201318 vaccine were representative of most, but not all, circulating influenza viruses at that time, and had the fewest and least substantial egg-adapted changes. In August 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of cell-derived CVVs for inclusion in ccIIV4. \u2020\u2020\u2020\u2020 For the 2017\u201318 season, the influenza A(H3N2) component of this vaccine is manufactured using a cell-derived CVV. The other components of this vaccine are manufactured using egg-derived CVVs. Production of influenza vaccines using cell-grown CVVs and cell-based technology can circumvent antigenic changes that might be associated with egg propagation, particularly for influenza A(H3N2) viruses. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 \nData obtained from antigenic characterization are important in the assessment of the similarity between reference vaccine viruses and circulating viruses. In vitro antigenic characterization data acquired through hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays or virus neutralization assays are used to assess whether genetic changes in circulating viruses affect antigenicity, which could affect vaccine effectiveness. Since the 2014\u201315 season, many influenza A(H3N2) viruses lack sufficient hemagglutination titers for antigenic characterization using hemagglutination inhibition assays. Therefore, representative influenza A(H3N2) viruses are selected for antigenic characterization using the virus neutralization focus reduction assay to assess the ability of various antisera to neutralize infectivity of the test viruses. For nearly all influenza-positive surveillance samples received by CDC, next generation sequencing (NGS), which employs genomic enrichment practices ( 5 \u2013 7 ), adapted by CDC, Nextera library preparation (Illumina, San Diego, California) and NGS using MiSeq (Illumina, San Diego, California), is performed to determine the genetic identity of circulating viruses. The genomic data are analyzed and submitted to public databases (GenBank or GISAID EpiFlu). CDC has antigenically or genetically characterized 877 influenza viruses collected and submitted by U.S. and international laboratories since May 21, 2017, including 117 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 495 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 265 influenza B viruses. \nPhylogenetic analysis of the HA genes from the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected since May 21, 2017, showed that all but one were in subclade 6B.1, and one virus belonged to clade 6B ( Figure 3 ). All A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically similar (analyzed using HI with ferret antisera) to the 6B.1 virus A/Michigan/45/2015, the recommended influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 reference virus for the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017\u201318 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. \nFour hundred ninety-five influenza A(H3N2) viruses collected globally since May 21, 2017, were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes illustrated that multiple clades/subclades were cocirculating (Figure 3). The HA genes showed extensive diversity and belonged to clades 3C.2a or 3C.3a, with 3C.2a predominating (Figure 3). The 3C.2a and the 3C.2a1 subclade circulated in approximately equal proportions. A representative set of 153 influenza A(H3N2) viruses (51 international and 102 United States) were antigenically characterized, and most (97%) A(H3N2) viruses were well-inhibited (reacting at titers of less than or equal to fourfold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera raised against A/Michigan/15/2014 (3C.2a), a cell propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like reference virus representing the A(H3N2) component of the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017\u201318 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. A smaller proportion (33%) of influenza A(H3N2) viruses were well-inhibited by antiserum raised against egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 reference virus representing the A(H3N2) vaccine component, which is likely because of egg-adaptive amino acid changes in the HA of the egg-propagated virus. \nA total of 85 influenza B/Victoria-lineage viruses were phylogenetically analyzed, and all HA genes belonged to genetic clade V1A, the same genetic clade as the vaccine reference virus, B/Brisbane/60/2008. However, two deletion subclades were detected in 2017. One subclade has a 6-nucleotide deletion (encoding amino acids 162 and 163) and the other subclade has a 9-nucleotide deletion (encoding amino acids 162, 163 and 164). The 162\u2013163 double deletion in the HA was detected in viruses circulating in multiple countries, with the majority identified in the United States, although the three viruses with 162\u2013164 triple deletion were only detected in Hong Kong SAR, China. Thirty-nine (72%) B/Victoria lineage viruses were well-inhibited by ferret antisera raised against MDCK-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008 reference virus, representing the B/Victoria lineage component of the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017\u20132018 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. However, 28% of B/Victoria lineage viruses reacted poorly with ferret antisera raised against MDCK-propagated B/Brisbane/60/2008, which correlated with the 162\u2013163 double deletion and the 162\u2013164 triple deletion in the HA. \nPhylogenetic analysis of 180 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses indicate that the HA genes belonged to clade Y3 (Figure 3). A total of 99 representative influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses (59 international and 40 United States) were antigenically characterized, and all were antigenically similar to B/Phuket/3073/2013, the reference vaccine virus representing the influenza B/Yamagata-lineage component of the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017\u201318 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccines. Top Composition of the 2018 Southern Hemisphere Influenza Vaccine \nThe WHO recommendations for influenza vaccine composition for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere season were made at the WHO Vaccine Consultation meeting September 25\u201328, 2017, in Melbourne, Australia. The recommended components for the 2018 Southern Hemisphere influenza trivalent vaccines are an A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus, an A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (H3N2)-like virus, and a B/Phuket/3073/2013-like (B/Yamagata lineage) virus ( 8 ). For quadrivalent vaccines, an additional component, B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria lineage) virus, is recommended ( 8 ). This represents a change in the influenza A(H3N2) component and a change in the influenza B lineage included in the trivalent vaccine compared with the composition of the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017\u201318 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine formulation. The H3N2 component was updated to address the egg-adaptive changes that occurred with the egg-propagated A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 reference virus and to better represent genetic changes seen in recently circulating H3N2 viruses. Top Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Viruses \nThe WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza at CDC tested 486 influenza virus specimens collected during May 21\u2013September 23, 2017, from the United States and worldwide for resistance to the influenza neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral medications currently approved for use against seasonal influenza: oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir. A total of 75 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses (37 international and 38 United States) were tested, and all were sensitive to these drugs. All 231 influenza A(H3N2) viruses (60 international and 171 United States) and all 180 influenza B viruses (98 international and 82 United States) tested were also sensitive to all three recommended antiviral medications. High levels of resistance to the adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) viruses. Adamantane drugs continue not to be recommended for use against influenza at this time. Top Discussion \nDuring May 21\u2013September 23, 2017, influenza A(H3N2), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B viruses co-circulated worldwide. In the United States, influenza B viruses predominated from late May through late June. Influenza A viruses were most commonly reported beginning in early July. The majority of the influenza viruses collected from the United States and other countries during that time were characterized antigenically and genetically as being similar to the cell-grown reference viruses representing the 2017 Southern Hemisphere and 2017\u201318 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. Antigenic and genetic characterization of circulating influenza viruses can give an indication of the influenza vaccine\u2019s ability to produce an immune response against the wide array of influenza viruses cocirculating, but vaccine effectiveness studies are needed to determine how much protection has been provided to the population by vaccination. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were detected at low levels from May 21 to September 23, and virus characterization data indicate no substantial genetic or antigenic changes, even among viruses from regions that experienced higher A(H1N1)pdm09 activity. Influenza A(H3N2) viruses have predominated in many countries in the Southern Hemisphere and in the United States since early July. Virus characterization data suggest extensive genetic diversity among circulating viruses, but limited evidence of substantial antigenic drift. To date, a predominant subclade of A(H3N2) viruses with substantial antigenic drift has yet to emerge, and extensive genetic variation exists in the circulating virus population. Among the influenza B viruses for which lineage was determined, influenza B/Yamagata viruses predominated across the United States from May 21 through September 23, and virus characterization data indicate no substantial genetic or antigenic changes. Two subgroups of antigenically distinct influenza B/Victoria viruses, represented by the double or triple deletion viruses, were detected; the majority of the double deletion viruses were identified in the United States, while all three triple deletion viruses were identified only in Hong Kong SAR, China. Nevertheless, such antigenically distinct viruses represented a minority of B/Victoria viruses circulating globally during this period. Close monitoring of these viruses is required to better assess their potential impact on public health. Although influenza B viruses circulate throughout the influenza season, they frequently circulate later in the season than do influenza A viruses and often result in a second peak of influenza activity, often in the late winter and spring in the United States and other Northern Hemisphere countries ( 3 ). \nAnnual influenza vaccination is the best method for preventing influenza and its potentially severe complications ( 9 ). In the United States, annual influenza vaccination is recommended for all persons aged \u22656 months who do not have contraindications. Annual influenza vaccination is recommended regardless of whether the vaccine composition has changed because immunity from vaccination wanes over time and might decline below protective levels after one season. Optimally, vaccination should occur before the onset of influenza activity in the community. If possible, vaccination should be offered by the end of October and should continue to be offered as long as influenza viruses are circulating and unexpired vaccine is available. Children aged 6 months through 8 years who require 2 doses should receive their first dose as soon as possible after vaccine becomes available, and the second dose \u22654 weeks later. For 2017-18 season, manufacturers have projected they will supply the United States with as many as 151 to 166 million doses of injectable influenza vaccine; approximately 119 million of this will be quadrivalent vaccine. As of September 15, 2017, approximately 73 million doses had already been distributed. \nMultiple influenza vaccines are approved and recommended for use and are being distributed during the 2017\u201318 season, including egg-based trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3 and IIV4), adjuvanted trivalent egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines (aIIV3), high-dose trivalent egg-based inactivated influenza vaccines (HD-IIV3), quadrivalent cell culture\u2013based inactivated influenza vaccines (ccIIV4), and recombinant trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines (RIV3 and RIV4). Two available intramuscular vaccines are approved for administration by jet injector for persons aged 18 through 64 years. One IIV4 formulation is approved for intradermal administration. There is no preferential recommendation for one licensed and recommended influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended product is available ( 9 ). Currently available influenza vaccines, with the exceptions of RIV3, RIV4, and ccIIV4, are prepared by propagation of virus in embryonated eggs ( 9 ). Egg propagation of influenza A(H3N2) viruses often leads to genetic changes that have antigenic implications. For the 2017\u201318 season inactivated vaccines, all influenza A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) and both influenza B components will be egg-derived, with the exception of ccIIV4, for which the influenza A(H3N2) virus component will, for the first time, be a cell-derived vaccine virus component ( 9 ). This represents a first step toward producing a totally egg-independent inactivated virus vaccine. Recombinant technology is used in the production of RIV3 and RIV4; therefore they are manufactured without the use of influenza viruses or eggs. The use of egg-independent vaccine technologies is likely to provide vaccines that more precisely represent the antigenic characteristics of circulating viruses and have the potential to offer improved protection. Because of the low effectiveness of live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine (LAIV4) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in the United States during the 2013\u201314 and 2015\u201316 seasons, for the 2017\u201318 season, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and CDC renewed the recommendation that LAIV4 should not be used ( 9 ). \nAlthough vaccination is the best method for preventing and reducing the impact of influenza, antiviral medications provide a valuable adjunct. Treatment with influenza antiviral medications as early as possible in the course of illness is recommended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza (either seasonal influenza or novel influenza virus infection) who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza-related complications \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 ( 10 ). Treatment is most effective when given early in the illness, especially within 48 hours of illness onset; providers should not delay treatment until test results become available and should not rely on insensitive assays such as found with some rapid antigen detection influenza diagnostic tests to determine treatment decisions ( 10 ). \nFifty-one infections with variant influenza viruses were reported from five states during summer 2017.

Because racial and ethnic groups are not represented equally in all occupations, differences in job characteristics may help explain racial/ethnic health disparities. Two recent studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) explore job complexity as a factor that contributes to racial health disparities. Job complexity as an indicator of SES \nJob complexity is high if a job requires employees to: make decisions while consequences are unknown, gather and evaluate information from various sources, and solve problems in uncertain situations. \nThese jobs are engaging and empowering because they provide opportunities to use our skills and to do our best. For example, doctors and business executives have highly complex jobs, and so do construction managers, barbers, and IT service technicians. Examples of less complex jobs are sorting agricultural products, washing dishes, and cutting meats and vegetables in commercial kitchens. Jobs are generally more complex at the higher end of SES. \nPrevious studies have shown that high job complexity is associated with fewer disabilities in retirement and lower mortality. Decision-making power and skill-use opportunities have been consistently associated with better health. In sum, the literature suggests that job complexity may partly explain health disparities by SES. Job complexity, race, and SES \nRacial composition within an occupation seldom reflects the entire US population. Whites have a higher proportion of high SES jobs, which are generally highly complex. Lower SES jobs, which tend to be less complex, are more common among African Americans and Latinos. Even within the same education level, on average white men hold more complex jobs, a new NIOSH study documented 1 . Reflecting this, the study found that the positive effect of high education and complex jobs was the strongest for white men. For black men and women of both races, even when they had high levels of education, their jobs were not as complex as their white, male counterparts\u2019, and thus the positive effect of a complex job was limited. \nAnother recent study from NIOSH 2 examined job complexity with racial difference in risk of death. Historically, the annual risk of death is higher for African Americans than whites. The NIOSH study found that this difference could be reduced by a third if African Americans had the same levels of complexity in their jobs as whites. This suggests that different experiences of job complexity may be an important factor in creating racial health disparities. \nIf racial difference in job complexity partly explains racial health disparities, then reducing the difference may help remove such disparities. \nWe would like to hear from you. What needs to be done to make jobs more engaging and empowering?

PEER REVIEWED Abstract \nIntroduction \nFew interventions have evaluated the influence of parent health literacy (HL) status on weight-related child outcomes. This study explores how parent HL affects the reach, attendance, and retention of and outcomes in a 3-month multicomponent family-based program to treat childhood obesity (iChoose). \nMethods \nThis pre\u2013post, quasiexperimental trial occurred in the Dan River Region, a federally designated medically underserved area. iChoose research protocol and intervention strategies were designed using an HL universal precautions approach. We used validated measures, standardized data collection techniques, and generalized linear mixed-effect parametric models to determine the moderation effect of parent HL on outcomes. \nResults \nNo significant difference in HL scores were found between parents who enrolled their child in the study and those who did not. Of 94 enrolled parents, 34% were low HL, 49% had an annual household income of less than $25,000, and 39% had a high school education or less. Of 101 enrolled children, 60% were black, and the mean age was 9.8 (standard deviation, 1.3) years. Children of parents with both low and high HL attended and were retained at similar rates. Likewise, parent HL status did not significantly influence improvements in effectiveness outcomes (eg, child body mass index [BMI] z scores, parent BMI, diet and physical activity behaviors, quality of life), with the exception of child video game/computer screen time; low HL decreased and high HL increased screen time (coefficient = 0.52, standard error, 0.11, P < .001). \nConclusion \nBy incorporating design features that attended to the HL needs of parents, children of parents with low HL engaged in and benefited from a family-based childhood obesity treatment program similar to children of parents with high HL. Top Introduction \nDespite the public health priority for both preventing childhood obesity and increasing health literacy (HL), few intervention studies have evaluated the influence of HL on weight-related child outcomes. The prevalence of childhood obesity has increased significantly over the previous 4 decades, stabilizing over the past decade, with approximately one-third of US children being classified as obese (1). Obesity disparities persist between minority and low socioeconomic status children and their more advantaged counterparts (2). When considering children aged 8 to 12 years, parents and caregivers play an important role in providing eating and physical activity opportunities. Caregivers with low HL may be less likely to provide healthful eating and physical activity options for their children, making HL a potential contributing factor in childhood obesity (3). \nHL can be defined as an individual\u2019s capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions. Approximately 1 in 3 parents or caregivers have low HL (4). Furthermore, prevalence of low HL is even higher among low-income and racial/ethnic minority populations (5). Poor HL skills have consistently been linked with poorer health outcomes (6). In theory, intervention strategies that address HL may allow participants with low HL to process information at a similar rate to those with higher HL and thus benefit to the same or greater degree. \nMost scientific literature on HL focuses on adult populations (6), although emerging literature demonstrates that the HL status of parents and caregivers can affect the health outcomes of children (4,6\u20138). Parents and caregivers play a crucial role in making informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment of health conditions, as well as establishing appropriate adherence and follow-up (4,6). Evidence also suggests that children of parents with high HL are more likely to have better health outcomes than children of parents with low HL (8). One systematic review found that adults with low HL are up to 4 times more likely than adults with high HL to exhibit negative health behaviors that affect child health (7). However, of the 23 included studies, most (n = 18; 78%) were cross-sectional, and none focused on child weight outcomes. Since this 2009 review, Sanders and colleagues have conducted intervention work addressing parental HL to prevent obesity among children younger than 24 months (3). However, no other known intervention studies have focused on parent or caregiver HL-sensitive strategies to improve child body mass index (BMI) z scores, including those among children aged 8 to 12 years, where the largest body of evidence-based childhood obesity treatment interventions exist. \nClearly void in the literature are initiatives to address child health inequities, including childhood obesity programs that incorporate design features and treatment strategies that meet the HL needs of parents (9). The use of HL universal precautions is one approach to address the HL needs of parents (10). The HL universal precautions is founded on the concept that, regardless of HL status, all individuals can benefit from simplified health information, reduced literacy demands of program components, reinforcement of key messages, and practice activities that promote skill development and self-management. There is a lack of research related to the use and effects of an HL universal precautions approach applied to childhood obesity treatment programs (6\u20138,10). Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether HL interventions can equitably reach and engage parents with low and high HL (11). \nGuided by a community-based participatory research and systems-based approach, the Partnering for Obesity Planning and Sustainability Community Advisory Board (POPS-CAB) was initiated in 2012 to build community capacity to develop, implement, and sustain an evidence-based childhood obesity reduction initiative in the Dan River Region, a federally designated medically underserved area. In this health disparate region, the prevalence of childhood obesity is approximately 3 times higher than state and national averages. This initiative was funded by a planning grant mechanism from the National Institutes of Health, and the overall evaluation was guided by the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework. Preliminary primary outcomes analysis indicated that our intervention resulted in significant decreases in both child and parent weight status (12); however, the HL data were not examined. Therefore, this secondary data analysis explored whether parental HL influenced reach, attendance, and retention of and outcomes in a 3-month family-based childhood obesity treatment program in the Dan River Region. By applying an HL universal precautions approach in our research protocol and intervention strategies (10), we hypothesized that no significant differences would be found among children of parents with low versus high HL. Top Methods \nThis quasiexperimental trial, with pre\u2013post program data, was tested in 3 waves from January 2013 through September 2015. The POPS-CAB included regional health care, public health, and parks and recreation partners, as well as academic partners. The POPS-CAB was involved in all research phases, including intervention selection and adaptation of the iChoose program, recruitment of families, program implementation, and data collection and evaluation (13). \nEligibility criteria for iChoose participation were English-speaking children aged 8 to 12 years with a BMI at or above the 85th percentile who resided in the Dan River Region. Exclusion criteria were children who had major cognitive impairments and contraindication for physical activity among children and parents. The primary recruitment methods included referral from the POPS-CAB health care partners who identified eligible children through medical record reviews, mailed study invitation letters, and called families to screen for basic demographic characteristics and interest in participating. \nAll study procedures were approved by the Virginia Tech institutional review board. Parents provided written informed consent, and children provided written assent. To compensate time to complete the data assessments, $25 gift cards were provided to children and parents at baseline and at the 3-month assessments. \niChoose was adapted from an evidence-based and family-based childhood obesity treatment program (14) to meet local needs and address feasibility for local community organization delivery. An HL universal precautions approach was applied when developing the research protocol and multicomponent program strategies (10,15\u201317). In this approach, it is assumed that all participants may have difficulty reading, comprehending, and acting on health information. An HL universal precautions approach is hypothesized to reduce the disparities in achieving significant outcomes between participants with low and high HL because of differences that often occur in traditional intervention approaches. The resulting 3-month multicomponent program and the applied a priori HL strategies are described in Table 1 . \nProgram delivery responsibilities were shared among trained research and community staff, including one doctoral-level primary investigator, 4 trained graduate research assistants, one staff member from Parks and Recreation with a bachelor\u2019s degree in exercise, and 4 registered nurses from the health department. Intervention fidelity was assessed and did not differ by research or community staff implementation. Measures \nFollowing standardized techniques, trained research and community staff collected outcome data at baseline and 3 months postprogram. All questionnaires were administered by an interviewer. \nParents reported sex, age, race, annual household income level, and education status during the initial screening. Attendance was tracked for all intervention components. \nTo assess reach, 3 validated HL screening items were used. These HL items asked participants to rate perceptions of their HL skills on a 5-point Likert scale. Items focused on the degree to which people need help in reading health care materials (18), can confidently complete medical forms (19), and perceive their reading ability (20). Responses were summed to produce a continuous score, ranging from 3 to 15, with higher scores indicating higher HL. For parents who enrolled in the study, the validated Newest Vital Sign (NVS) was used to explore the influence of HL on retention, attendance, and outcomes. This 6-item questionnaire, based on the Nutrition Facts Panel, can be on a continuous scale or collapsed to represent low (0\u20133 correct responses) or high (4\u20136 correct responses) HL categories (21). \nA calibrated digital Tanita scale (model no. 310GS; Tanita Corporation of America, Inc) and research-grade SECA 213 portable stadiometer (Seca North America) were used to assess body weight and height, without shoes and in light clothing. BMI measurements and scores were calculated using established Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocol. \nValidated measures assessed self-reported behavioral outcomes among both children and parents. These measures were the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire to assess physical activity behaviors (22); the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 6-item brief screener to assess intake of fruit and vegetable servings; the Beverage Questionnaire to assess sugar-sweetened beverage consumption (23); and the BRFSS screen time questionnaire for children only. Quality of life was measured using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory for children (24) and the BRFSS Healthy Days module for parents. Data analysis \nAll data were entered into SPSS statistical analysis software (version 23.0; IBM Corporation), and validated scoring procedures were applied to compute outcome variable scores. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic characteristics and attendance rates. Chi-square test of association or Fisher exact test and analysis of variance were used to compare reach, attendance, and retention rates between groups. Independent t tests were used to estimate differences in outcomes by parent HL status at baseline and at follow-up. Program outcome effectiveness analyses were conducted using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LP). Generalized linear mixed-effect methods were used to estimate both the main time effect and parental HL moderation effects on children\u2019s and parents\u2019 outcomes, which handled the cohort-nesting feature of our data. Because imputations can introduce severe biases when observation numbers are small, completers-only (ie, children and parents retained at 3 months) analyses are reported. Nonetheless, completers-only results yielded findings similar to those of last-observation-carried-forward simple intention-to-treat analyses. Significance was set at P < .05. Top Results \nReach. Health care partners mailed 586 mailed letters to parents of children, inviting them to participate; 29 children were determined to be ineligible. Of those eligible, 60% of parents were contacted and 40% were unable to be contacted after 6 call attempts over 2 weeks. Of 101 enrolled children, 52% were male, 60% were black, and 71% had Medicaid; mean age was 9.8 (standard deviation [SD], 1.3) years. Characteristics of eligible and enrolled children were not statistically different from the characteristics of the 456 eligible children who did not enroll. Seven families enrolled 2 eligible children. \nOf 94 enrolled parents, most were female (93%) and black (60%); mean age was 39.7 (SD, 8.9) years. Most parents (49%) reported an annual household income of less than $25,000, and 39% had a high school education or less. NVS scores indicated that 32 (34%) parents had low HL and that 62 (66%) had high HL. Among eligible parents with HL screening data (n = 226), there was no significant difference in HL scores ( t 224 = \u22120.32, P = .75) between those who enrolled their child (n = 92; mean, 14.07; SD, 1.52) and those who did not enroll (n = 134; mean, 14.13; SD, 1.37). There were also no significant differences for race, education level, or annual household income among eligible parents who did and did not enroll children. \nAttendance. Among the 101 enrolled children, the average attendance was 2.3 of 6 family classes, 5.6 of 24 physical activity sessions, and parental completion of 3.8 of 6 support calls. There were no significant differences in attendance rates by parental HL status. \nSeventy-one (70%) children and 67 (71%) parents completed the 3-month assessment. There was no significant difference ( t 92 = 1.13, P = .26) in HL scores, as assessed with the NVS, between the baseline HL score of parents of children who were retained at the 3-month follow-up assessment (n = 67; mean, 4.10; SD, 1.80) and those who were lost to follow-up (n = 27; mean, 3.63; SD, 1.92). \nEffectiveness outcomes. At baseline, screen time for video and computer games among children of parents with low HL was higher than for children of parents with high HL ( P = .03) ( Table 2 ). A trend for low reported minutes per week of moderate to vigorous physical activity was found among low HL parents ( P = .08), but no significant differences were found in child or parent variables by parental HL status. At postprogram, there were no significant differences by parent HL status, and the differences between the significant and trending variables at baseline shrunk in magnitude (children screen time for video and computer games 1.1 to 0.6). \nSignificant main effects improvements were observed for child BMI z score, ounces of sugar-sweetened beverages, and quality of life ( Table 3 ). Among main effect models for parents, significant improvements were observed for BMI, minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, servings per day of fruits and vegetables, and ounces of sugar-sweetened beverages per day. Parental HL status did not influence these outcomes, with the exception of child screen time for video game/computer (coefficient = 0.52; standard error [SE], 0.11; P < .001). Children of parents with low HL decreased their video game/computer screen time by 0.39 (2.35) units, whereas children of parents with high HL increased by 0.13 (1.61) units (1 unit equates to approximately 1 hour). Top Discussion \nIn our universal HL precautions approach, we developed research protocol and intervention materials for the multicomponent iChoose program to reduce the literacy demands and address the HL needs of the targeted families. Therefore, it was important to discover that HL status had no influence on reach, attendance, and retention and little influence on postprogram outcomes (with the exception of child video game/computer screen time). Although few significant gaps existed between parents with low and high HL at baseline, our approach provides preliminary evidence that inequalities were not generated as a result of iChoose. These exploratory findings address notable gaps in the literature (4,6\u20138) and in a health disparate region with high childhood obesity prevalence. \nOur intervention significantly decreased child weight status within the range of effects documented in previous efficacy trials (9). However, prior trials did not examine differences by parent HL status, leaving little opportunity for direct comparisons. Most information related to relationships between parental HL status and child outcomes is limited to cross-sectional studies (6\u20138,25,26), with few in the context of childhood obesity (27,28). For example, odds of obesity among children decrease with higher parent HL status (27), and parent nutrition literacy is associated with higher child Healthy Eating Index scores (28). Beyond these 2 studies, no other known studies have examined the relationship between parent HL status and child weight or obesity-related behaviors such as sugar-sweetened beverage consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, screen time, and physical inactivity. When available, results from the ongoing intervention research by Sanders and colleagues to address parental HL to prevent obesity among children younger than 24 months will advance understanding of the role of parental HL on child obesity\u2013related outcomes (3). \nThe fact that there was no main intervention effect on child video game/computer screen time but that screen time was influenced by parent HL status exemplifies the importance of our analysis. Screen time was addressed in week 6 group family sessions and week 7 and 8 support calls, and families were encouraged to develop a calendar to limit screen time to less than 2 hours per day. At baseline, video game/computer screen time among children of parents with low HL was approximately 1 hour per day higher than among children of parents with high HL. Children of parents with low HL decreased their time by approximately 24 minutes per day while children of parents with high HL increased by approximately 6 to 9 minutes per day, resulting in a nonsignificant difference of about one-half an hour at the 3-month follow-up. This finding shows that the differential gap in video game/computer screen time between children of parents with low versus high HL at baseline was narrowed at the follow-up. Although we interpret these results cautiously because this is a pilot study, our findings provide the foundation for potentially fruitful research studies to identify and address child health disparities related to parent HL status. \nBeyond parent or caregiver HL interventions, the broader literature indicates notable advancements in experimental HL approaches (5). However, many research gaps persist in experimental HL research that targets disease self-management and health promotion (11). First, few experimental or quasiexperimental studies report on how participant HL status influences reach, adherence, or retention (11). Second, few experimental or quasiexperimental studies have explored how HL status influences weight outcomes in behavioral interventions, and, among those, findings have been mixed. Our study attempts to address these documented areas of opportunities for research and practice. Ideally, future family-based childhood obesity treatment programs should seek to improve outcomes for all families and narrow any existing gaps in outcomes between families of low and high HL (6). \nInterpretations of this exploratory and secondary data analysis are limited by the quasiexperimental design, small sample size, and short follow-up period. Also, although validated measures of HL were used, these measures may not capture the full complexity of HL skills. Despite these limitations, this research, conducted as part of a planning grant initiative, provides preliminary data to advance the next phases of childhood obesity treatment research in the targeted underserved region and can inform the work of other practitioners and researchers. Evidenced by a seminal review of HL studies, pilot testing intervention strategies before implementing them on a full scale leads to effective interventions (5). As one example, although parent HL status did not influence participation, overall participation was lower than desired. Lessons learned from this planning grant, including summative exit interviews of parents, will be used to further develop culturally relevant engagement and retention strategies. \nFuture studies should include a more robust randomized controlled study design, longer follow-up, and an adequate sample powered to detect HL moderation effects and to control for other potentially relevant demographic factors. There is also opportunity to test which HL strategy features, either alone or in combination, are most successful in mitigating the effects of low HL on targeted outcomes (5). Finally, exploring the influence of child HL and child obesity outcomes should be a priority. Literature is beginning to emerge in this area (29). However, there are issues and opportunities related to use of validated HL measures in children, especially younger children, such as the 8- to 12-year-olds included in this study (30). \nThis study provides preliminary evidence on the utility of applying an HL universal precautions approach in a family-based childhood obesity treatment program. By incorporating design features and obesity treatment strategies that address the HL needs of all parents in our study, children of parents with low HL participated and benefited from the intervention similarly to children of parents with high HL. Although future studies are needed to further explore the generalizability of our findings, public health specialists are encouraged to use a universal HL precautions approach to meet the needs of parents and caregivers, especially in underserved areas where resources, health information, and behavioral skills training opportunities are limited (4,6\u20138).

Classes included an interactive, didactic nutrition component and a physical activity component that engaged families in movement for about 20 minutes. For the behavioral component of each class, parents and children received separate training, with complementary, role- and age-specific objectives and activities. 1) Use visual and experiential learning techniques; 2) empower participants to ask questions by creating a shame-free environment; and 3) make an action plan. Verbal presentations were accompanied by pictorial information presented in PowerPoint (Microsoft Inc) slides and handouts. Engaging hands-on activities and demonstrations were used to reinforce key messages. Group questions were encouraged and facilitated. At the conclusion of each family class, families set an exercise and nutrition goal for the next 2 weeks. Workbooks The parent workbook and child workbook were developed in 6 chapters to be used in conjunction with the small group classes. Each chapter was divided into components of nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral strategies and included the module objectives, educational content, a class activity, and homework. 1) Train community advisory board members to evaluate the quality of written materials; 2) assess readability and create written materials that are at a 5th-grade reading level or below; 3) assess understandability and acceptability of written materials; and 4) have participants provide feedback on written materials. Community partners and researchers were trained on CDC\u2019s Clear Communication Index (CCI) and the Suitability Assessment of Materials (SAM) to assess both understandability and cultural appropriateness of the materials (15,16). These assessments, along with focus group feedback from iChoose participants, resulted in workbook modifications, including simplified language and culturally appropriate language, images, and examples. The modified workbooks have a final readability rating of 90 out of 100 on the CCI, scored at a 5th-grade reading level on the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, and achieved cultural relevance with 9.2 or 10 on the SAM. Child newsletters The 6 child newsletters were mailed the week following each small group family class. 1) Improve self-management by reminding participants of what they learned from each class; 2) encourage participants to stick to their action plans; and 3) provide support by linking participants to resources to avoid relapses (including each other as role models). Child newsletters were designed to be action-oriented for behavioral recommendations, feature and highlight iChoose success stories, and provide fun educational activities to reinforce key behavioral messages from the previous class. Newsletters were personalized for each cohort with pictures from class of participants role-modeling healthy behaviors during classes. Newsletters also included special features for a current holiday and/or seasonal health tips to avoid relapses. Physical activity sessions Twenty-four physical activity classes (2 per week) were scheduled for 1 hour with the purpose of engaging the children in moderate to vigorous physical activity. 1) Demonstrate new activities and behaviors; and 2) empower participants to follow through on action plans. Physical activity sessions focused on exposure to new activities and the opportunity to practice these activities. The objective was to build confidence and skill in meeting physical activity recommendations. Exercise during these sessions counted toward family action plans. Telephone support calls One week following each small group class, the parents received a telephone support call, delivered by a research or community staff member. Use teach-back method to improve understanding of and adherence to behavioral recommendations discussed in the family classes and provided in workbooks. The support calls incorporated teach-back and teach-to-goal strategies. To promote comprehension of learning objectives, parents were asked to explain, or teach back, key concepts from the prior small group class. When concepts were recalled incorrectly, the answers were provided and discussed with participants. Using a teach-to-goal approach, participants were given 2 additional opportunities to teach back the key concepts within the same call. This health literacy strategy was used to assess parent comprehension as well as to clarify and reinforce key messages. Goal setting and self-monitoring Goal setting occurred during the small group classes and was reinforced during the telephone support calls. Self-monitoring activities were incorporated in the small group and workbook activities. 1) Make action plans; and 2) follow up with participants to monitor progress on action plans and encourage self-monitoring.

PEER REVIEWED Abstract \nIntroduction \nWe examined US adults\u2019 understanding of a Nutrition Facts panel (NFP), which requires health literacy (ie, prose, document, and quantitative literacy skills), and the association between label understanding and dietary behavior. \nMethods \nData were from the Health Information National Trends Survey, a nationally representative survey of health information seeking among US adults (N = 3,185) conducted from September 6, 2013, through December 30, 2013. Participants viewed an ice cream nutrition label and answered 4 questions that tested their ability to apply basic arithmetic and understanding of percentages to interpret the label. Participants reported their intake of sugar-sweetened soda, fruits, and vegetables. Regression analyses tested associations among label understanding, demographic characteristics, and self-reported dietary behaviors. \nResults \nApproximately 24% of people could not determine the calorie content of the full ice-cream container, 21% could not estimate the number of servings equal to 60 g of carbohydrates, 42% could not estimate the effect on daily calorie intake of foregoing 1 serving, and 41% could not calculate the percentage daily value of calories in a single serving. Higher scores for label understanding were associated with consuming more vegetables and less sugar-sweetened soda, although only the association with soda consumption remained significant after adjusting for demographic factors. \nConclusion \nMany consumers have difficulty interpreting nutrition labels, and label understanding correlates with self-reported dietary behaviors. The 2016 revised NFP labels may address some deficits in consumer understanding by eliminating the need to perform certain calculations (eg, total calories per package). However, some tasks still require the ability to perform calculations (eg, percentage daily value of calories). Schools have a role in teaching skills, such as mathematics, needed for nutrition label understanding. Top Introduction \nThe Nutrition Facts panel (NFP) \u2014 sometimes referred to as the \u201ccornerstone of nutrition labeling\u201d (1) \u2014 was developed to provide US consumers with the information they need to follow dietary recommendations. The Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 (2), which required nearly all packaged foods to carry the NFP label, was intended to allow consumers to make healthy food choices and ultimately reduce their risk of illness and death from diet-related chronic diseases (3). Many consumers check food labels when buying food, either to choose healthy foods or to lose weight (4). Label users also tend to report more healthful dietary practices than nonusers (5). However, mandated nutrition labels have been criticized for being too complex for many consumers to understand and use (4,6). Comprehension may be particularly difficult for certain subsets of the population, such as consumers with low levels of literacy and numeracy. This is particularly important given the rising rate of obesity and associated medical conditions in the United States. \nUnderstanding the NFP label requires health literacy, that is, \u201cthe capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions\u201d (7). However, a sizable proportion of the US population is deficient in health literacy. The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (8) found that more than one-third of the US population had only basic or below-basic health literacy, meaning they would have difficulty viewing the nutrition labels of 2 different potato chip packages and determining the difference in the number of calories. Some studies have found that even high school graduates and college students lack the basic health literacy skills to effectively apply nutrition label information (9,10). Beyond education level, little empirical evidence is available about other demographic and behavioral characteristics that may be associated with the ability to interpret information on a nutrition label. Moreover, much of what we know about US consumers\u2019 understanding and use of nutrition labels has come from studies that have relied on convenience samples of participants from shopping malls, grocery stores, and patient populations, rather than nationally representative surveys (6,10\u201312). \nInadequate health literacy has been associated with many adverse health outcomes, including poor health status, poor health management, more frequent emergency department visits, and unhealthy diets (13,14). Recognizing the importance of health literacy, the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) instrument (15) was developed as a rapid health literacy screening tool that could be readily implemented in clinical practice. To complete the NVS, a person reads an ice cream nutrition label and answers 6 questions that require prose literacy (the ability to search and understand information on a label), document literacy (the ability to find and use information in charts and tables), and quantitative literacy (the ability to perform computations and use numbers embedded in printed materials) (8). The NVS has been validated and used successfully in various clinical settings and patient populations (16\u201319). \nThis study examined how a nationally representative sample of the US population performed on a shortened version of the NVS. We examined whether people could use the NFP label on an ice cream container to understand food content (eg, number of calories and grams of carbohydrate per serving) and the effects of a change in consumption on calorie or nutrient intake. The study also examined associations between NFP label understanding and dietary behaviors, including consumption of sugar-sweetened soda, fruits, and vegetables. We reasoned that if the NFP label promotes healthy eating, then people who are better at understanding nutrition labels may be more likely to eat healthier diets, including consuming less sugar-sweetened soda. Moreover, given that the NVS is used to screen for health literacy, we also expected performance to correlate with healthier dietary behaviors, including higher consumption of fruits and vegetables. Methods Study design \nData were obtained from the National Cancer Institute\u2019s Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) Round 4 Cycle 3, a national survey of the US adult, civilian noninstitutionalized population that monitors health information use and cancer-related behaviors. The survey is available in English and Spanish. Details of survey development and methods have been published (20) and are available online (http://hints.cancer.gov). Data were collected by mailed questionnaire from September 6, 2013, through December 30, 2013. Households were randomly selected using a stratified sample from a listing of all nonvacant residential addresses in the United States. One adult per household was asked to complete the questionnaire (ie, the individual with the next birthday). A total of 3,185 surveys were completed, yielding a response rate of 35.2%. HINTS Round 4 Cycle 3 was approved by the Westat Institutional Review Board and was deemed exempt from institutional review board review by the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Office of Human Subjects Research. Measures \nNFP label questions. Participants read an NFP label from an ice cream container (Figure) and answered 4 questions from the NVS instrument, a screening test for health literacy that assesses the ability to understand information contained on a nutrition label (15). Participants responded to the following open-ended questions: \u201cIf you eat the entire container, how many calories will you eat?\u201d (item 1, Total Calories); \u201cIf you are allowed to eat 60 g of carbohydrates as a snack, how much ice cream could you have?\u201d (item 2, Nutrient Specific); \u201cYour doctor advises you to reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet. You usually have 42 g of saturated fat each day, which includes 1 serving of ice cream. If you stop eating ice cream, how many grams of saturated fat would you be consuming each day?\u201d (item 3, Health Recommendation); and \u201cIf you usually eat 2,500 calories in a day, what percentage of your daily value of calories will you be eating if you eat 1 serving?\u201d (item 4, Daily Value). The study excluded 2 questions from the NVS because of space limitations on the study instrument. Those questions ask if it would be safe to eat the ice cream if you are allergic to penicillin, peanuts, latex gloves, and bee stings, and if not, why not. Figure.

Participants reported the number of days they drank sugar-sweetened soda or pop each week: \u201cNot counting any diet soda or pop, about how often do you drink regular soda or pop in a typical week?\u201d Response options were \u201cevery day,\u201d \u201c5 or 6 days a week,\u201d \u201c3 or 4 days a week,\u201d \u201c1 or 2 days a week,\u201d \u201cless often than 1 day a week,\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t drink any regular soda or pop.\u201d Participants estimated their daily vegetable consumption: \u201cAbout how many cups of vegetables (including 100% pure vegetable juice) do you eat or drink each day?\u201d Response options were \u201cnone,\u201d \u201c \u00bd cup or less,\u201d \u201c\u00bd cup to 1 cup,\u201d \u201c1 to 2 cups,\u201d \u201c2 to 3 cups,\u201d \u201c3 to 4 cups,\u201d and \u201c4 or more cups.\u201d Finally, participants estimated their daily fruit consumption using the same response options. To help estimate their daily intake of vegetables and fruit, participants were provided with lists of items equivalent to 1 cup of vegetables (eg, 3 broccoli spears, 12 baby carrots, 1 large ear of corn) and 1 cup of fruit (eg, 1 small apple, 1 medium pear, 1-inch\u2013thick wedge of watermelon). \nDemographic factors. Participants reported their sex (female; male), age (18\u201334 y; 35\u201349 y; 50\u201364 y; 65\u201374 y; \u226575 y), highest level of educational attainment (less than a high school diploma; high school diploma; some college; 4-year college degree), household income (<$20,000; $20,000 to <$35,000; $35,000 to <$50,000; $50,000 to <$75,000; \u2265$75,000), and race/ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, other). Data analysis \nThe 4 NFP label questions were scored as either correct or incorrect/missing (dichotomous outcome) and summed to create a total performance score (continuous outcome). Twenty participants were excluded from the analysis, because they were administered a short form of the survey that did not include the NFP label items, leaving a total sample of 3,165. \nDescriptive analyses and simple linear regressions evaluated differences in NFP label item scores across demographic groups (sex, education, income, age, race/ethnicity). Ordinal logistic regressions evaluated the association between NFP label scores and consumption of fruits, vegetables, and sugar-sweetened soda. The latter regressions were conducted with and without adjusting for demographic characteristics. List-wise deletion was used for each analysis (ie, participants were excluded from any analysis in which there were missing data on one or more of the variables). Alpha was set at .05. Analyses were weighted to account for the survey\u2019s complex sampling design and to generate nationally representative estimates using SAS-Callable SUDAAN version 11.0.0 (RTI International). Results NFP label understanding \nWe summarized the demographic characteristics of the sample and the bivariate associations between demographics and NFP label understanding ( Tables 1 and 2 ). We found a strong bivariate association between income and NFP label understanding: participants in the lowest income group correctly answered, on average, 1.31 fewer questions than those in the highest income group. Race/ethnicity was also associated with NFP label understanding: average scores tended to be lower among blacks and Hispanics than among non-Hispanic whites. Age was negatively associated with NFP label understanding: participants in the oldest age group scored lower than those in all other age groups. NFP label understanding was strongly associated with education: on average, participants with less than a high school diploma correctly answered 1.37 of the 4 NFP label questions, participants with a high school diploma correctly answered an average of 2.49 questions, and participants with at least some college correctly answered an average of 3.15 questions. More than one-third (35.4%) of participants with less than a high school diploma were unable to correctly answer any of the NFP label questions, and fewer than 9% could answer all 4 questions correctly. Only 54% of participants with a 4-year college degree correctly answered all 4 nutrition label questions (Table 2). \nThe first 2 NFP label questions (Total Calories and Nutrient Specific) were correctly answered by only 39.4% and 53.9% of people without a high school diploma, respectively. Questions 3 and 4 (Health Recommendation and Daily Value) were correctly answered by an even lower proportion of those without a high school diploma (25.3% and 18.8%, respectively). Across all educational levels, participants had the greatest difficulty with these last 2 questions (Table 2). NFP label understanding and self-reported dietary behaviors \nIn unadjusted models, NFP label understanding was negatively associated with sugar-sweetened soda consumption: participants with a better understanding of the NFP reported consuming sugar-sweetened soda fewer days per week (odds ratio [OR] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81\u20130.94; P = .001). NFP label understanding was positively associated with vegetable consumption (OR = 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03\u20131.21; P = .009) and positively associated with fruit consumption, although the latter was not significant (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00\u20131.17; P = .055) ( Table 3 ). \nAfter adjusting for demographic characteristics, the association between NFP label understanding and sugar-sweetened soda consumption remained significant ( Table 4 ). Other significant predictors of sugar-sweetened soda consumption included sex, education level, age, and race/ethnicity, with higher soda consumption reported by people who were male, less educated, younger, and non-Hispanic black (Table 4). \nThe associations between NFP label understanding and fruit and vegetable consumption were not significant in models adjusted for demographic factors (Table 4). Female participants reported eating more vegetables than did male participants, those with a 4-year college degree reported eating more fruits and vegetables than those with a high school diploma or less, those in the highest income bracket reported eating more fruit than those in the 2 lowest income brackets, and those in the oldest age group reported eating more fruit than those in the youngest age group and the 50 to 64-year age group (Table 4). Top Discussion \nWe assessed understanding of an NFP label among a representative sample of US adults and examined associations among label understanding, self-reported dietary behaviors, and sociodemographic characteristics. Although other studies \u2014 which have included convenience samples of patients, consumers, parents, and children \u2014 have examined how well people interpret information on a nutrition label (6,10,12), ours is one of the few studies to examine understanding of nutrition labels by using nationally representative data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which assesses the health and nutrition of US children and adults, has surveyed whether people use the NFP label but not whether they can actually apply the information contained on the label (21). We examined critical aspects of nutrition label understanding: whether people could calculate the total number of calories in an entire container of ice cream, the number of servings of ice cream equal to 60 g of carbohydrates, the effect that foregoing a serving of ice cream would have on saturated fat intake, and the percentage daily value of calories represented by one serving of ice cream. Given our large sample, we were able to examine the association between nutrition label understanding and 3 dietary behaviors. \nIn general, participants\u2019 ability to interpret nutrition label information was poor. Understanding was lower among older than younger adults, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black people than non-Hispanic white people, lower income than higher income people, and less educated than more educated people. People who had not graduated from high school had the poorest performance on the 4 nutrition label questions: more than a third of this group could not correctly answer any nutrition label questions, and fewer than 9% could correctly answer all 4 questions. These findings are consistent with those of other studies that have found low educational attainment to be associated with poor understanding of nutrition labels (10,22). \nEven a college education did not ensure nutrition label understanding. Only slightly more than half (53.9%) of people who had earned a 4-year college degree could correctly answer all 4 nutrition label questions. Other studies of college students have reported similar difficulties interpreting nutrition labels. In one study of over 500 undergraduate and graduate students, nearly 90% of students could not define serving size, and one-third could not perform simple tasks involving comparison of nutrition labels (9). Another college student survey found that only 60% of the approximately 200 students surveyed could use the information on a nutrition label to determine the number of servings of a particular food that would meet 100% of the daily value of carbohydrates for a 2,000-calorie diet (23). \nNutrition label understanding was also associated with dietary behaviors: compared with people with lower levels of nutrition label understanding, those with better label understanding tended to eat more vegetables and drink less sugar-sweetened soda. These findings are consistent with those of another study that found that healthier dietary practices were positively associated with greater nutrition label understanding (24). \nThe finding that only slightly more than half of people with a college degree could correctly answer all 4 nutrition label questions \u2014 each of which involved a single-step arithmetic operation \u2014 underscores the importance of health literacy. Using NFP labels requires not only being able to read and perform arithmetic but also \u2014 just as importantly \u2014 the ability to reason with words and numbers. According to our results, a substantial proportion of consumers clearly struggle to effectively use the information contained in a nutrition label. Across all education levels, participants performed best on Item 1 (Total Calories) and Item 2 (Nutrient Specific). We can only speculate as to why Items 3 (Health Recommendation) and Item 4 (Daily Value) proved more difficult. It is possible that these items required more complex reasoning than the other items. Item 3 was particularly long, comprising 3 sentences, and Item 4 required participants to understand percentages, which may have presented a challenge. \nNutrition labels can be a useful source of information for managing one\u2019s diet and diet-related health conditions (25), and simple, clear nutrition labels are critical to ensuring that everyone can benefit from dietary information. The revised NFP label, which the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated in 2016 to reflect current nutrition science and public health research, attempts to make the nutrition label more user-friendly. Major changes to the label included making certain label elements more salient (eg, calories, servings per container, and serving size are highlighted by a larger font size and bold type), updating serving sizes to more accurately reflect the amount of food and drink that people usually consume, and updating nutrient daily values to be consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (26). Sugar content now includes added sugars in grams and as a percentage of daily value. To help consumers better understand serving size, dual column labels will be used for foods that can be eaten in one or multiple sittings (eg, a bag of potato chips), so people will be able to easily determine how many calories and nutrients they consume if they eat the package contents in one sitting (26). \nOn the basis of responses to NVS questions, the revised nutrition label may make it easier for consumers to understand the total calories per food item (Item 1, Total Calories ) and to make better use of specific nutrient information (Item 2, Nutrient Specific). However, the label revisions would not necessarily improve people\u2019s ability to understand the effect that foregoing a serving of a food item would have on their nutrient intake (Item 3, Health Recommendation) or to calculate the percentage of their daily value of calories represented by one serving of a food item (Item 4, Daily Value). The latter tasks still require consumers to perform calculations and interpret those calculations. \nAs nutrition labels are improved to make them easier for all consumers to use, schools also have a role to play in teaching students the skills they need to understand the labels and make informed dietary decisions. This education could be achieved by integrating nutrition education and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) across all school levels (elementary through high school). Additionally, states could adopt school nutrition education policies requiring a standards-based health education curriculum integrating nutrition education content with specific standards across grade levels. As of December 31, 2014, few states had such strong state nutrition education policies; 7 states had strong policies for elementary schools and 6 states had strong polices at the middle and high school levels (https://class.cancer.gov/map_nutrition.aspx). \nOur study has limitations. Because study data were collected by mail survey, participants who had difficulty answering the NFP label questions may have obtained help from a family member or other source. If this were the case, we may have overestimated NFP label understanding. The mail survey may also have excluded people with low literacy, which would have further inflated our estimates of NFP label understanding. Space limitations on the HINTS survey instrument precluded including all 6 nutrition label questions originally developed as part of the NVS. Including these 2 additional questions may have enhanced the reliability of our estimate of NFP label understanding. Moreover, because dietary behaviors were self-reported, the data may have been subject to reporting bias, social desirability bias, or random error (27,28). The validity of memory-based dietary recall is an ongoing debate in nutrition research (28,29). It may have been challenging for participants to estimate the number of cups of fruits and vegetables they typically eat, even though the survey instrument provided examples of portion size. \nAdditional research on health literacy in the context of nutrition should also consider the emerging literature on nutrition and food literacy (30), concepts developed to broaden the scope of research and practice in this area. Like other studies (30), our study focused solely on functional nutrition literacy and did not include other aspects of nutrition literacy, such as interactive or critical nutrition literacy (30). For example, understanding NFP labels is not the same as using the nutritional information on the label for selecting food. That is, participants who answered all 4 nutrition label questions correctly may not necessarily use these labels when purchasing food (an example of interactive nutrition literacy) (30). \nA substantial proportion of consumers in this country, including those with a college education, have difficulty understanding NFP labels, which is likely a function of limited health literacy. This deficit would be expected to limit consumers\u2019 ability to apply the information contained in a nutrition label effectively and compromise their ability to make informed dietary choices. Future research should examine whether the revised NFP label promotes greater understanding, healthier dietary choices, and ultimately, better health outcomes.

PEER REVIEWED Abstract \nIntroduction \nInfection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is common and can progress to various types of cancer. HPV infection can be prevented through vaccination; however, vaccination rates among adolescents are low. The objective of this study was to assess efforts among Wisconsin stakeholders in HPV vaccination and organizational capacity for future collaborative work. \nMethods \nWe conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 277 stakeholders in HPV vaccination activities, from April 30, 2015, through June 30, 2015. Stakeholders were public health professionals, health care providers, educators, quality improvement professionals, researchers, and advocates identified as engaged in HPV vaccination work. \nResults \nOf the 277 invited stakeholders, 117 (42%) responded to the survey. Findings showed that most current HPV vaccination activities targeted 3 groups: adolescents and parents, clinical and health professionals, and communities and health systems. The main activities directed at these groups were providing printed educational materials, professional education, and media campaigns to raise awareness. Common barriers reported were lack of understanding about the link between HPV and cancer, requests to delay vaccination, difficulty completing the 3-dose vaccine series, and reluctance to discuss sexuality. \nConclusion \nHPV vaccination rates are far below those of other vaccinations administered to adolescents in Wisconsin. Our study showed that various local efforts were being made to increase HPV vaccination uptake; however, many barriers exist to initiation and completion of the vaccine series. Future interventions should address barriers and employ evidence-based strategies for increasing HPV vaccination rates. Top Introduction \nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection is common, especially among young adults (1\u20133). Almost all cervical and anal cancers and most oropharyngeal cancers are caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV, types 16 and 18 (4\u20136). HPV vaccines offer the best protection to women and men who receive all 3 doses in the series and have time to develop an immune response before becoming sexually active. Initiation of HPV vaccination is recommended for girls and boys beginning when they are aged 11 to 12 years (6). It is also recommended for girls aged 13 to 26 and for boys aged 13 to 21 who have not been vaccinated (7\u20139). However, since licensure of the first HPV vaccine in 2006, vaccination rates have remained low in the United States compared with rates for other adolescent vaccinations. In Wisconsin, data from the Wisconsin Immunization Registry indicate that HPV vaccination coverage is far lower than for other vaccines administered to adolescents. In 2013, an estimated 55% of girls and 29% of boys aged 13 to 17 had initiated the HPV vaccine series, and only 34% of girls and 11% of boys aged 13 to 17 had completed the series. By comparison, 92% of adolescents in this age group have received the tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, and 75% had received the meningococcal conjugate vaccine (10). \nThe Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, housed at the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, was among 18 sites funded by the National Cancer Institute to conduct an environmental scan of HPV vaccination activities to enhance collaborations for developing research and interventions to increase HPV vaccination rates in Wisconsin (11). The scan involved 4 components: 1) examination of vaccination data from the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, 2) a survey of stakeholders\u2019 HPV-related projects, 3) assessment of current University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison research on HPV, and 4) evaluation of a quality improvement education series for health care providers. The objective of this study was to assess local interventions to increase HPV vaccination and organizational capacity for future collaborative work in Wisconsin. Methods Study population \nWe conducted a cross-sectional online survey of 277 Wisconsin stakeholders in HPV vaccination activities from April 30, 2015, through June 30, 2015 ( Appendix ). Stakeholders were public health professionals, health care providers, educators, quality improvement professionals, researchers, and advocates from the state who attended or were invited to the Wisconsin HPV Vaccine Summit in June of 2014. The summit was a conference designed to mobilize vaccine advocates by providing data on state-specific HPV disease epidemiology and immunization rates, updates on the diseases caused by HPV, vaccine safety information, and discussions on how to address vaccination hesitancy and strengthen vaccination recommendations. We also surveyed members of the 15 local or regional immunization coalitions in Wisconsin. Stakeholders received an email inviting them to participate in the online survey. Four follow-up email reminders were sent to incomplete survey respondents and nonrespondents at intervals of every 2 weeks to encourage participation. Measures \nStudy participants reported on their role in their organization and answered other organization-related questions, including type of organization, whether the organization belonged to a local or regional immunization coalition, whether the organization accessed the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, and whether the organization used the Registry for Effectively Communicating Immunization Needs and an electronic health record to track immunizations. Respondents were also asked about their organization\u2019s interest in conducting new activities and their capacity to take on new activities to promote HPV vaccination. \nRespondents were asked whether their organizations conducted any activities in Wisconsin in 2013, 2014, or 2015 related to HPV vaccination. The activities were classified into 4 categories:1) adolescents and their parents, 2) clinical and health care professionals, 3) communities and health systems, and 4) advocacy and public policy. If respondents reported activities in any year in any of these categories, they were asked to provide information about how often they encountered certain barriers (never, rarely, sometimes, often, or always). The selections of sometimes, often, and always were defined as barriers. In addition, respondents provided information on their funding sources and collaborating organizations for each category of activities. Statistical analysis \nWe calculated simple descriptive statistics to examine the prevalence of HPV vaccination-related activities that stakeholders conducted from 2013 through 2015 and the barriers they encountered. We then tested for trends in different activities over time. All analyses were performed with Stata/MP version 13.1 (StataCorp LP). Significance was set at P less than .05. Top Results \nOf the 277 stakeholders we invited to participate, 117 replied, a response rate of 42.2%. Of the 117 stakeholders who participated in the survey, 37 (31.6%) classified themselves as public health professionals, 21 (17.9%) as health care providers, and 9 (7.7%) as educators ( Table ). Thirty (25.6%) of the respondents worked for local public health departments, 8 (6.8%) worked for state health departments, and 22 (18.8%) for health care providers/health systems (categories were not mutually exclusive). Fifty-six (47.9%) indicated that they or their organization belonged to a local or regional immunization coalition, 71 (60.7%) reported that their organizations currently accessed the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, 6 (5.1%) used the Regional Early Childhood Immunization Network, and 32 (27.4%) used an electronic health record to track immunizations. Over half of respondents 67 (57.3%) expressed a medium to high level of interest in conducting new activities to promote HPV vaccination. However, only 46 (39.3%) rated their capacity to take on new activities as adequate (medium or high capacity). \nStakeholders reported on activities that their organizations conducted in recent years to increase HPV vaccination. Ninety-four (80.3%) reported that their organizations were involved in activities focusing on adolescents (girls or boys aged 11\u201318 y) and their parents. In 2015, the most common activities involving adolescents and their parents were providing printed educational materials (69.2%), one-on-one consultations to adolescents and parents on HPV vaccination (54.7%), reminders to adolescents and parents of when adolescents were due for HPV vaccination (47.9%), and referrals to HPV vaccination services (46.2%). The pattern was similar for 2013 and 2014, and the prevalence of these 4 types of activities increased significantly over time ( P < .05) (Figure 1a). Figures 1a\u2013d.

Figure 1a shows stakeholder organizations with activitiesfocused on adolescents and parents, 1b shows stakeholder organizations with activities focused on clinical and health professionals, 1c shows stakeholder organizations with activities focused on communities and health systems, and 1d shows stakeholder organizations with activities focused on advocacy and public policy. The rates of advocating for public policy change and advocating for increased public funding increased over time ( P < .05). [A tabular version of these figures is also available.] \nOverall, 75 respondents reported barriers to activities focusing on adolescents and parents. The most common barriers were lack of education or understanding about HPV infection, including its link to cancer (86.6%); logistical or other barriers to returning for the full series of 3 shots (74.7%); requests that HPV vaccination be deferred (71.7%); belief that the adolescent is not at risk for HPV infection (71.6%); and the parent\u2019s belief that child is too young for the HPV vaccine (68.5%, Figure 2).

Abbreviation: STI, sexually transmitted infection. [A tabular version of these figures is also available.] \nSeventy-six of the 117 respondents (65.0%) indicated that their organizations were conducting activities focusing on clinical and health professionals to increase HPV vaccination. The most commonly reported activities in 2015 were providing printed educational materials (53.0% of stakeholders), professional education on HPV vaccination (47.0%), protocols to track and report on HPV vaccination rates (35.0%), and websites focused on health professionals (11.1%) (Figure 1b). The increase in all activity rates from 2013 to 2015 was significant ( P < .05). Barriers most often encountered by these organizations (N = 54) were difficulty ensuring that patients completed the 3-dose HPV vaccination series (63.0%), concern that parents would decline HPV vaccination despite appropriate counseling (57.7%), reluctance to discuss sexuality or sexually transmitted infections (45.3%), concern about the time it takes to discuss HPV vaccination with patients or parents (41.5%), and HPV vaccination not being required by schools (37.1%) (Figure 2b). \nSixty-one stakeholders (52.1%) identified their organization\u2019s activities as projects focusing on communities and health systems. The most commonly reported activity in this category in 2015 was media campaigns to raise awareness about the need for HPV vaccination of adolescents (39.3%,), followed by community committee or work groups that focus on HPV vaccination (24.8%), support for community groups that fund and promote the vaccine (23.1%), and community events or health fairs to promote HPV vaccination (21.4%) (Figure 1c). The increase from 2013 through 2015 in these activities was significant ( P < .05). Barriers experienced in implementing community- and health-system\u2013focused activities (N = 43) were lack of education or understanding about HPV infection, including its link to cancer (44.1%); difficulty ensuring that patients will complete the 3-dose HPV vaccination series (41.9%); belief that younger adolescents are too young for the HPV vaccinations (41.8%); and reluctance to discuss sexuality or sexually transmitted infections (38.7%) (Figure 2c). \nLastly, 18 respondents (15.4%) indicated that they were involved in activities focused on advocacy and public policy with the most commonly reported activity in 2015 being efforts to increase HPV vaccination rates through advocating public policy change (17 respondents), followed by advocating for increasing public funding for HPV vaccination (13 respondents) and advocating for increased public funding for HPV research (5 respondents) (categories were not mutually exclusive). The rates of the former 2 activities increased over time ( P < .05) (Figure 1d). Barriers to these activities that respondents (N = 10) reported were described as lack of provider recommendations for HPV vaccination (7 respondents), concerns about vaccine safety (6 respondents), and reluctance to discuss sexuality or sexually transmitted infections (6 respondents) (Figure 2d) \nMost organizations reported working with partners on activities promoting HPV vaccination: activities that focused on adolescents and parents (50 of 94 respondents), activities that focused on clinical and health professionals (47 of 76 respondents), activities that focused on communities and health systems (37 of 61 respondents), and activities that focused on advocacy and public policy (14 of 18 respondents). Commonly reported collaborators were the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Wisconsin Immunization Program, local health departments, local clinics and hospitals, schools, local immunization coalitions, the Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, and the Wisconsin chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Primary sources of funding for HPV vaccination activities were CDC, the Wisconsin chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, the University of Wisconsin Partnership Program, the Wisconsin Immunization Program, immunization coalitions, the Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, and tax levy funds. Top Discussion \nPersistent HPV infection can lead to cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, and oropharynx (12). The HPV vaccine is safe and effective and has been recommended since 2006 (13). However, HPV vaccination coverage has remained far below that of other vaccinations administered to adolescents, in Wisconsin and throughout the United States. To assess efforts to increase HPV vaccination in Wisconsin and barriers encountered, we conducted a survey of stakeholders involved in the effort. Findings from the survey illustrate the HPV vaccination-related projects being conducted in Wisconsin and provide a roadmap for future collaboration and activities to increase HPV vaccination. \nOur survey of stakeholder activities found that ongoing work is focused on 4 main groups: adolescents and parents, clinical and health professionals, communities and health systems, and stakeholders involved with advocacy and public policy. HPV vaccination promotion activities increased across all these groups from 2013 through 2015. Many survey respondents reported conducting activities that were focused on adolescents and parents, the most common of which were the provision of educational materials, one-on-one consultations and referrals, and reminders for vaccination. The main activities used to influence clinical and health professionals were provision of educational materials, professional education, and protocols to track and report vaccination rates. These activities are in line with research, which indicates that educational campaigns directed at health care professionals and parents are key facilitators for promoting HPV vaccination (14). Examples of educational efforts to raise awareness about HPV and HPV vaccination are media campaigns, printed materials, online information, webinars, conferences, and in-person training sessions. Of the activities designed to affect communities and health systems, media campaigns to raise awareness were used most often, followed by health fairs and community group collaborations. We identified fewer activities in the area of advocacy and public policy, but among the activities reported were advocating for public policy change and advocating for increased public funding for vaccination. HPV vaccination promotion activities in Wisconsin are similar to efforts conducted at the health care practice or community level in other parts of the United States. The effectiveness of interventions to increase HPV vaccination has varied, and further research is needed (15\u201317). \nAs in other research, Wisconsin stakeholders reported several main barriers to vaccination across groups: lack of understanding about HPV and its link to cancer, reluctance to discuss sexuality, parental resistance to the vaccination, belief that the adolescent is too young or is not at risk, difficulty with completion of the 3-dose vaccine series, safety concerns, and concern about promoting risky sexual behavior (3,18,19). Health care providers have been identified as uniquely positioned to address barriers perceived by parents. They can initiate conversations to address concerns and misunderstandings and recommend the vaccine (19). Studies have shown that parents and patients want additional information about HPV and the HPV vaccine and that they trust the information provided by health care providers (20). Providers need additional training on how to give a strong, clear recommendation and communicate the urgency and importance of HPV vaccination (14). Other potential strategies for providers and health care systems to increase HPV vaccination rates are reducing missed clinical opportunities and administering the HPV vaccine at the same time as other adolescent vaccines (18). To reduce the number of HPV-related cancer deaths in Wisconsin and reach the Healthy People 2020 goal of 80% HPV vaccination coverage, continued efforts are needed to cultivate provider champions for the vaccine, educate the public about its safety and efficacy, increase access to vaccination, and reduce missed clinical opportunities to vaccinate (21). The consistency of barriers cited across target groups related to the lack of understanding about HPV, the HPV vaccine, and HPV related cancers indicates that future efforts should focus on enhanced education and communication strategies for providers, parents, adolescents, and communities. \nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that young adolescents (aged 9\u201314 y) move from a 3-dose to a 2-dose HPV vaccine schedule (22,23). This change presents new opportunities for increasing adherence. The change, also recommended by CDC, was based on a review of clinical trials showing that 2 doses of the vaccine among young adolescents produced an immune response similar to, or higher than, the response in young adults (aged 16\u201326 y) who received 3 doses (22). Because survey respondents cited logistical challenges to returning for the series of 3 shots as a barrier, the move to a 2-dose schedule \u2014 which still provides safe, long lasting, effective protection \u2014 may increase acceptance and improve vaccination rates among young adolescents (23). More than half of survey respondents expressed interest in conducting new activities to promote HPV vaccination. However, because less than 40% said they had the organizational capacity to do so, policy efforts should focus on increasing funding for HPV vaccination education and promotion. HPV vaccination rates in Wisconsin have increased in recent years. In 2015, the overall vaccination rate for adolescents aged 13 to 18 years was 44%, and in 2016 the rate was 49% (https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/immunization/data.htm). \nA strength of our study is that it is the first statewide, comprehensive review of HPV vaccination activities in Wisconsin. A limitation is that our list of Wisconsin HPV vaccination stakeholders may be incomplete, and we do not have information about HPV vaccination-related activities conducted by stakeholders who were not identified. However, the participant list was reviewed by representatives of the Wisconsin Immunization Program, the Wisconsin chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the University of Wisconsin Immunization Taskforce to identify missing stakeholders engaged in current or recent HPV vaccination work who were then added to the group. Another limitation is that the survey response rate was moderate (42.2%), but it was within the range (40%\u201360%) recommended for surveys to inform key policies and resource allocation (24). A comparison between survey respondents and nonrespondents indicated that the geographic distribution was similar between the 2 groups, suggesting that the survey findings were representative of the state. \nThe Wisconsin HPV stakeholder survey found that activities promoting HPV vaccination are wide-ranging and have increased over time across the state. Future interventions should address identified barriers and employ evidence-based strategies for increasing HPV vaccination rates.

There were more than half a million suicides during the 2001\u20132015 study period. \n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve seen many causes of death come down in recent years, suicide rates have increased more than 20 percent from 2001 to 2015. And this is especially concerning in rural areas,\u201d said CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D. \u201cWe need proven prevention efforts to help stop these deaths and the terrible pain and loss they cause.\u201d \nMortality data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) include demographic, geographic, and mechanism of death information derived from death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The new report examined annual county level trends in suicide rates during 2001-2015 for rural counties, medium/small metropolitan counties, large metropolitan counties, as well as demographics and mechanism of death. Overall, suicide death rates for rural counties (17.32 per 100,000 people) were higher than medium/small metropolitan counties (14.86) and large metropolitan counties (11.92). \nAdditional findings from the CDC study: Across metropolitan and rural areas, suicide rates for males were four to five times higher than for females during the study period. Suicide rates for Black Non-Hispanics in rural areas were consistently lower than suicide rates for Black Non-Hispanics in urban areas. White Non-Hispanics have the highest suicide rates in metropolitan counties while American Indian/Alaska Native Non-Hispanics have the highest rates in rural counties. Findings by age group revealed increases in suicide rates for all ages with the highest rates and greatest rate increases in rural counties. \n\u201cThe trends in suicide rates by sex, race, ethnicity, age, and mechanism that we see in the general population are magnified in rural areas,\u201d said James A. Mercy, Ph.D., director of CDC\u2019s Division of Violence Prevention. \u201cThis report underscores the need for suicide prevention strategies that are tailored specifically for these communities.\u201d \nCDC recently released a technical package (a compilation of a core set of strategies based on the best available evidence that have the greatest prevention potential) to prevent suicide that includes examples of programs that can be customized to fit the cultural needs of different groups. The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) has developed activities to address suicide in rural areas including epidemiologic studies, research, telemedicine and programs addressing primary health care providers. \nTo read the article, visit the MMWR Homepage . \nVisit CDC\u2019s Website to learn more about suicide prevention . \nFor more information on rural health, visit www.cdc.gov/ruralhealth . \nFor best practices on suicide reporting, please refer to the Recommendations for Reporting on Suicide. \n\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide or needs support, help is always available.

Of the 762 possible cases of plague pneumonia (the most serious form of the disease), 23% have been confirmed. Approximately 8% of those with possible plague have died. Health authorities have a low threshold for considering a respiratory illness to be plague because they do not want to miss any possible cases. \nWHO and the Madagascar Ministry of Health are leading a public health response to the outbreak, assisted by personnel from partner organizations around the world, including CDC. What is plague? \nPlague is a bacterial infection that is usually spread through bites by infected fleas. When acquired by flea bite, plague causes symptoms of high fever and swollen and tender lymph nodes (bubonic plague) that usually occur 2\u20136 days after the bite. If it is not treated, the infection can spread to the lungs and cause pneumonia. \nPlague pneumonia (or \u201cpneumonic plague\u201d) is the only form that can be directly transmitted from one person to another. In rare but serious cases, a person with severe plague pneumonia can spread the infection directly to others by coughing up droplets that contain the plague bacteria. These bacteria-containing droplets can cause pneumonic plague in another person if breathed in ( more information ). Symptoms of plague pneumonia typically appear 2\u20134 days after inhaling plague bacteria and usually include sudden onset of high fever and cough and other general symptoms such as headache, chills, and weakness. \nPlague can be treated with antibiotics. However, without prompt treatment, plague can cause serious illness or death. How can travelers protect themselves? \nNo vaccine is available to prevent plague. But travelers can take steps to prevent plague, and plague can be prevented with antibiotics. Travelers to Madagascar should Use EPA-registered insect repellent that lists protection against fleas on the label and contains at least 25% DEET. Avoid close contact with sick or dead animals. Avoid close contact with seriously ill people, especially people who are coughing up blood. \nTravelers who have had close contact with people with plague pneumonia should immediately notify a health care provider. They may need to take antibiotics to prevent plague. \nDuring or after travel to Madagascar, travelers should be alert for symptoms of plague. If symptoms do appear, they should seek medical care and inform the provider about their travel to Madagascar. \nLearn more about plague, how to prevent it, and what to do if you think you are infected at CDC\u2019s plague page for travelers .

It would just come out of nowhere,\u201d says Tywan Willis. \u201cI would have pain in my lower back, my shoulders, and sometimes in my legs. I can\u2019t describe it. I just know it\u2019s a really bad pain that I get.\u201d \nTywan has sickle cell disease (SCD), an inherited blood disease that can run in families and causes abnormal, sickle-shaped red blood cells. Pain is the most common complication of SCD, and the top reason people with SCD go to the emergency room or hospital . \nTywan is a regular patient at a new sickle cell clinic within the Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK) Outpatient Center in Los Angeles (LA). The Sickle Cell Data Collection (SCDC) program in California, which is funded through the CDC Foundation,* and has been collecting information to monitor the long-term trends in diagnosis, treatment, and access to health care for people with SCD since 2010, provided data that highlighted the strong need for comprehensive care for adults with SCD in LA County. These data, together with the determination and hard work of many partners, lead to the establishment of the clinic in order to address those needs. Identifying a Community Need \nThe SCDC program found that 1 in every 2 adults with SCD in California (about 1500 people) live in LA County. In October 2015, a team of SCD experts used these data to inform LA County\u2019s Department of Health Services about the urgent needs of the SCD community. The data showed no places in the county where adults with SCD could receive quality, comprehensive, and coordinated care. The emergency department was the only option for the many patients who did not have access to doctors who understood the complexities of SCD. \nData on patients with SCD in LA County were mapped by ZIP code. The map showed that most patients with SCD in the county lived within five miles of the MLK Outpatient Center. This new information presented an opportunity to create a clinic that focused on the needs of people with SCD within a medically underserved area. Providing Comprehensive Care \u201cThe color coded map by ZIP code was the most powerful data. You could easily see at a glance that there was an intensity of adults with SCD living in the MLK geographic region,\u201d said Ellen Rothman, Chief Medical Officer of the MLK Outpatient Center. \nThe SCD clinic at the MLK Outpatient Center opened in August 2016, only 10 months after sharing the data from the SCDC program with LA County health officials. The clinic provides comprehensive care to patients with SCD, whom often have other health problems in addition to those related to SCD. \nDuring each visit, clinic patients see both a hematologist (a doctor who specializes in blood disorders) and a primary care provider. The hematologist focuses on SCD-specific needs, helping to reduce health issues and prevent early death. The primary care provider manages health problems unrelated to SCD, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. \u201cWe complement each other,\u201d says Susan Claster, the clinic\u2019s hematologist. \u201cHaving the primary care provider sitting with me, we cover 90% of what the patient needs and it\u2019s very efficient.\u201d \nThis combination of expertise effectively addresses the complex health needs of patients with SCD. \nThe clinic provides access to complementary health services, such as acupuncture, yoga, and exercise classes. Behavioral therapists are available to help with mental health issues related to SCD, such as anxiety and depression. In addition, Patient Navigators guide patients through the clinic process and make their experience as stress-free as possible. \n\u201cSince I\u2019ve been going to this clinic, I\u2019ve learned a lot of new things that I didn\u2019t know about sickle cell. They have taught me what to do when I\u2019m in pain and how to treat it. It really works.

PEER REVIEWED Abstract \nIntroduction \nObesity rates in Appalachia are among the highest in the United States, and knowledge of upstream approaches to decrease prevalence among this vulnerable population is limited. The primary aim of this study was to examine the association between healthy, diet-based, social marketing interventions in grocery stores and frequency of fruit and vegetable intake. \nMethods \nA social marketing campaign was conducted among 17 grocery stores (N = 240 participant surveys) over 4 months in 5 rural Kentucky counties. Interventions included providing food samples, recipe cards, and promotional discounts on fruits and vegetables and moving high-calorie foods to side aisles. \nResults \nMost survey participants reported that recipe cards influenced their desire to purchase ingredients as well as fruits and vegetables in general. Results indicated a significant association between the influence of recipe cards and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption. \nConclusion \nSmall-scale interventions in grocery stores influenced purchasing choices among Appalachian residents. Working with various store managers and food venues in rural high-obesity communities is a promising way to encourage purchasing of fruits and vegetables. Top Introduction \nRural residents of the United States have higher levels of adult obesity than do other US residents (1), and Appalachia residents are at a 33% higher risk of diabetes (2). In part because of concern about these health disparities in the region, community-based studies have started focusing on different facets to combat the problems, with diet and shopping behavior being a major area of focus (3). \nGiven the high percentage of people who report shopping at supermarkets or grocery stores as their primary food stores (60%\u201385%) (4), grocery stores can provide an avenue for improving shopping choices, such as purchasing more fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and other healthy items. However, grocery stores, supermarkets, and supercenters also provide avenues for purchasing non\u2013nutrient dense items, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, chips, baked goods, and other processed foods (5). However, provided that shoppers are encouraged to purchase healthy items in a store, stores have potential for improving the nutritional quality of what shoppers purchase and consume (6), thereby improving dietary intake. \nPolicies have been established to reduce prices on fruits and vegetables and relocating food in stores, and they are correlated with more fruit and vegetable purchases (7). Studies have been conducted on the efficacy of grocery store marketing features on food purchases, with varying degrees of apparent success. One study showed that of the many grocery store features, recipe samples and discount promotions resulted in frequent shoppers being more motivated to purchase healthier foods (8). Another study showed that increasing the perceived access of fruits and vegetables, specifically by focusing on display space, price, variety, and freshness, was associated with an increase in shoppers\u2019 consumption of fresh produce (9). It remains unclear what strategy may be most cost-effective and effective at promoting behavior change; perhaps a combination of all these strategies would be most effective. \nThe aims of this study were to test the effectiveness of marketing strategies (price reductions, recipe cards and samples, and product placements) on awareness of strategies and in increasing purchasing of fruits and vegetables. This study used a cross-sectional survey of neighborhood grocery stores in 5 counties in rural Appalachian Kentucky with high prevalence of obesity. Top Methods \nGrocery stores from the 5 counties participating in this project agreed to take part in the social marketing campaign strategies in stores as a way to improve food-purchasing choices among residents. The 5 counties met eligibility criteria for funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Obesity Prevention program: having a 40% or higher obesity rates among adults, being a rural geographic area, and being demographically composed primarily of white or Caucasian residents (97%). The reason behind these criteria was to study the rural high-prevalence obese population of Appalachian Kentucky. \nCooperative Extension agents in all 5 counties contacted all grocery store managers in each of their counties and managers of large supercenters in adjacent counties. Grocery store managers were given a letter explaining the social marketing campaign and were offered $100 per store event to offset any costs they might incur by moving food and displays to other locations in the store. Of the 30 stores contacted, 17 agreed to participate in the program. The grocery stores agreed to promote the campaign to their patrons, move merchandise around to promote the foods being sampled, display fruits and vegetables at the front of the store, display Plate It Up Kentucky Proud (PIUKP) materials, and offer a discount on the fruit or vegetable being tasted during the recipe sample. \nThe PIUKP program was conducted in 17 grocery stores (midsize grocery store with 5\u20137 checkout counters) or supercenters (large grocery store selling multiple produces and 15 or more checkout counters) during April and May of 2016 and then again in September and October of 2016. PIUKP is a partnership project between the University of Kentucky Cooperative Extension Service, the Kentucky Department of Agriculture, and the University of Kentucky School of Human Environmental Sciences. This project uses undergraduate students to develop and test new recipes using local and seasonal fruits and vegetables. After recipes have been tested, Cooperative Extension agents provide recipe cards, samples, and food demonstrations in their communities as a way to promote consumption. The events were held on various days of the week and various hours to capture a variety of store shoppers. The campaign consisted of displays with the PIUKP banner and recipe samples with recipe cards. Additionally, storeowners moved food that is typically higher in calories away from the front of the store and showcased the fruit or vegetable that was in the recipe. They also moved sugar-sweetened beverages or other \u201cgrab and go\u201d items such as chips to a side aisle. Lastly, the storeowner agreed to offer a discount on the fruit or vegetable being sampled with the discount varying from 10% to 15% less than the original price. Each shopper was given a tote bag or gel-pack with the logo if they sampled a recipe. During these 2 months, the program was promoted through advertisements in local newspapers, flyers distributed in schools, and radio announcements. \nA customer intercept survey was developed to capture the effectiveness of the in-store marketing events. The survey questions were previously tested for test\u2013re-test among farmers market patrons in rural towns (10). During the marketing campaign, the Cooperative Extension agent or an assistant gave the survey to store patrons who took a recipe card or a recipe sample. A total of 240 surveys were collected from all 5 counties. The survey was conducted at the beginning of the social marketing campaign in April and again in September and October. \nSTATA version 12 (StataCorp LP) was used to perform statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the influence of recipe cards and samples with the consumption of fruits and vegetables. All models were adjusted for age, education, and participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Top Results \nMean age of participants was 51 years, and most participants (N = 240) were white (97%) and female (88%) ( Table 1 ). Fifty-eight percent of participants reported a yearly income of less than $40,000, and 19% of participants reported receiving SNAP benefits. \nOnly 44% of participants had previously heard of the PIUKP Program. Forty-nine percent reported that the recipe cards influenced the purchasing of ingredients from the recipe, and 39% indicated that recipe cards influenced purchasing fruits and vegetables in general. \nWhen assessing the intervention effectiveness on dietary intake ( Table 2 ), results indicated a significant association between the influence of recipe cards and frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption. Participants who reported that a recipe card influenced the purchase of ingredients related to the fruit and vegetable sample were 2.86 times ( P = .04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03\u20137.94) as likely to consume fruit 2 to 3 times per week than were those who reported that the cards had no influence. Participants who reported that the recipe card influenced fruit and vegetable purchases in general were 11.06 times as likely (95% CI; 3.35\u201336.51; P < .001) to consume fruit 2 to 3 times per week and 3.89 times as likely ( P = .006; 95% CI, 1.46\u201310.33) to consume fruit at least once per day or more than were those that reported a recipe card not influencing fruit and vegetable purchases. Top Discussion \nResults of PIUKP grocery store marketing efforts suggest that there is a notable association between consumers\u2019 use of recipe cards and their dietary habits in geographically isolated rural areas of Appalachian Kentucky. Other research indicates that many grocery store features, such as recipe samples and discount promotions, resulted in frequent shoppers being more motivated to purchase healthier foods (8). Our results support these findings, particularly with regard to recipe cards. Our results also indicate how community-based efforts with cooperation from grocery store managers can influence patrons\u2019 purchasing habits. A strength of this study was that these efforts were conducted across various store types. Working with managers from different types of food stores operating in rural communities is a promising strategy for improving purchasing of fruits and vegetables (11). \nFruit and vegetable consumption can reduce a person\u2019s risk of becoming obese (12), and findings from this study can promote healthy shopping behaviors and improve personal diet. Providing opportunities for shoppers to sample different recipes as well as improving the consumer food environment may be a sustainable program approach year-round (13). Store managers who are willing to improve their stores in rural communities can make changes in their stores and thus help to improve fruit and vegetable intake among their customers (14). \nLimitations of our study were the cross-sectional survey design, the small sample size, and the lack of causality. More research and different types of interventions, including those that are multipronged or not diet-focused (15), may be needed for more conclusive results on the effects of a social marketing campaign and on an overall look at dietary and shopping behavior among rural residents. Nonetheless, our study results suggest that the implementation of social marketing strategies in rural grocery stores may increase healthy food consumption habits among community residents and should be continued.

PEER REVIEWED Abstract \nIntroduction \nObesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) indicators have increased globally among the pediatric population. MetS indicators in the young elevate their risk of cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders later in life. This study examined early onset obesity as a risk factor for MetS risk in adolescence. \nMethods \nA cohort of Chilean participants (N = 673) followed from infancy was assessed at age 5 years and in adolescence (mean age, 16.8 y). Adiposity was measured at both time points; blood pressure and fasting blood samples were assessed in adolescence only. Early onset obesity was defined as a World Health Organization z score of 2 standard deviations (SDs) or more for body mass index (BMI) at age 5 years. We used linear regression to examine the association between early onset obesity and adolescent MetS risk z score, adjusting for covariates. \nResults \nEighteen percent of participants had early onset obesity, and 50% of these remained obese in adolescence. Mean MetS risk z score in adolescence was significantly higher among those with early onset obesity than among those without (1.0; SD, 0.8 vs 0.2; SD, 0.8 [ P < .001]). In the multivariable model, early onset obesity independently contributed to a higher MetS risk score in adolescence (\u03b2 = 0.27, P < .001), controlling for obesity status at adolescence and sex, and explained 39% of the variance in MetS risk. \nConclusion Top Introduction \nObesity among children is a global public health problem (1,2), and signs of metabolic syndrome (MetS) have increased among both children and adolescents over the past 25 years (3,4). MetS is defined as having at least 3 of 5 risk factors: a large waist circumference, high blood pressure, fasting hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (5). Although few children meet all 5 MetS criteria, up to 30% of obese children have at least one element of MetS (6). A recent systematic review showed a median prevalence of MetS of 3% (range 0%\u201319.2%) among all children and 29% (range 10%\u201366%) among obese children (3). In a sample of US adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, the overall MetS prevalence was 7%, with a range from 19% to 35% among obese adolescents (7). Additionally, Hispanic adolescents had a higher MetS prevalence (11%) than non-Hispanic white adolescents (9%) (8). \nMetS increases a person\u2019s risk for developing chronic disease (9,10). Pediatric MetS is independently associated with type 2 diabetes and adult MetS and with subclinical atherosclerosis leading to cardiovascular disease (CVD) (11,12). Additionally, research shows that obesity tracks from childhood into adulthood (13) and contributes to adverse consequences, including premature mortality and cardiometabolic disorders (14,15). However, the impact of the age of obesity onset in early childhood on adolescent MetS risk has not been documented, because research has largely focused on infant weight gain and catch-up growth as predictors of health outcomes later in life (16\u201318). This study examined early onset obesity as a risk factor for MetS risk in adolescence. We hypothesized that obesity onset early in life is associated with a higher MetS risk score in adolescence. Methods Study design and population \nParticipants were 677 Chilean infants who were part of an observational longitudinal study of biopsychosocial determinants of obesity and CVD risk. From 1991 through 1996, 1,933 infants were enrolled in either a preventive trial of iron supplementation to prevent iron-deficiency anemia or a neuromaturation study, a study that assessed neurodevelopment by using neurophysiological and electrophysiological techniques. The studies were conducted in Santiago, Chile, where infancy iron deficiency was widespread at the time and no national program existed for iron supplementation. Infants were from low-to-middle income, working-class communities. Inclusion criteria for the infancy studies were an uncomplicated, singleton, term, vaginal birth with birthweights of 3 kg or more, no major congenital abnormalities, and no prior iron therapy. Because of a successful national breastfeeding campaign, all but 8 infants in the cohort were initially breastfed. \nInfants were recruited at age 4 to 6 months. Infants without iron-deficiency anemia were randomly assigned to high-iron supplementation, low-iron supplementation, or usual nutrition (no added iron). Further details about enrollment and trial specifications are described elsewhere (19). A total of 1,657 infants completed the preventive trial (high iron, n = 718; low iron, n = 405; usual nutrition, n = 534). Infants found to have iron-deficiency anemia, and the next nonanemic infant (the control), were treated with medicinal iron and participated the neuromaturation study (20). A total of 135 infants completed the neuromaturation study. At age 5 years, because of a cut in funding, only 2 of the 3 randomly selected preventive trial groups and neuromaturation trial participants could be evaluated. Thus, only 888 of 1,501 infants who were in the high-iron and no-added-iron groups or completed the neuromaturation study were assessed. At age 16 years, participants from the 5-year follow up were invited to participate in a study of obesity and CVD risk. A total of 677 of 888 (76%) participants agreed and were assessed from 2009 through 2012. Our analytic sample for the obesity and MetS study consisted of 673 participants from the obesity and CVD risk study who had complete data at 5 years and 16 years (Figure). Figure. Flow of participants in study on relationship between early onset obesity and metabolic syndrome risk in adolescence, Santiago, Chile, 2009\u20132012. Participants were drawn from a larger study of infancy iron-deficiency anemia. [A text version of this figure is also available,] \nThe sample was representative of the original cohort, with no differences in infant and family characteristics, including birthweight (3.5 kg in the original cohort vs 3.6 kg in the final analytic sample), breastfeeding for at least 6 months (63% in the original cohort vs 61% in the final analytic sample), socioeconomic status (SES) (27.3 on the Graffar index [21] for the original cohort vs 27.0 for the final analytic sample), and household environment (30.1 on the Home Observation for Measurement of the Environment [HOME] [22] scale for the original cohort vs 30.0 for the final analytic sample). The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the University of California, San Diego, the University of Michigan, and the University of Chile Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology (INTA). Data collection and analysis \nParticipants were considered to have early onset obesity if obesity was present at age 5 years (defined as \u22652 standard deviations [SDs] for body mass index [BMI] z score) by using WHO growth standard indicators. BMI is a measure of weight relative to height (kg/m 2 ), with age-specific and sex-specific norms (23). \nAdolescents were assessed at age 16 to 17 years. Height (cm), weight (kg), waist and hip circumference (cm), and blood pressure (mmHg) were measured by a physician-investigator at INTA. Standardized procedures were used to measure weight to the closest 0.1 kg by using a SECA scale (SECA), and height to the closest 0.1 cm by using a Holtain stadiometer (Holtain Ltd) (24). Each measurement was taken twice, and a third measurement was taken if the difference between the first 2 exceeded 0.3 kg for weight, 0.5 cm for height, or 1.0 cm for waist. The WHO BMI z score indicator was used to dichotomize (yes/no) obesity status at adolescence, with obesity defined as an SD of 2 or more in the BMI z score. Fasting serum triglyceride, cholesterol, and glucose levels were assessed. Serum glucose concentration (mg/dL) was determined by using an enzymatic\u2013colorimetric test (Qu\u00edmica Cl\u00ednica Aplicada S.A.). Triglyceride (mg/dL), and cholesterol (mg/dL) levels were determined with the Vitros dry analytical methodology (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics Johnson & Johnson Inc). \nA continuous MetS risk z score was calculated by applying the equations developed by Gurka et al (25). The equations provide a sex-specific and race-specific z score measure for MetS risk based on standardized and log-transformed values for each component of the MetS. \nCharacteristics that may be associated with both the variable of interest and the outcome were considered covariates. For infancy, the following were considered: birthweight, SES, breastfeeding, emotional and material support provided in the home environment, iron status during infancy, and iron supplementation as part of the preventive trial. For adolescents, the following were potential covariates: age at menarche, age at the adolescent assessment, physical activity, and obesity status. Birthweight, measured in kilograms, was analyzed as a continuous measure. Iron status during infancy, coded as iron sufficient, iron deficient, or iron-deficient anemic, was dichotomized to iron sufficient (0) and iron deficient or iron-deficient anemic (1) for modeling purposes. Iron supplementation in infancy was dichotomized to iron supplementation (high or low) (1) and no iron supplementation (0). The SES variable, the Graffar index, is a pseudocontinuous variable based on a 13-item questionnaire that produces a composite score that comprises questions on mothers\u2019 and fathers\u2019 years of education, occupation, and income (21) the higher the Graffar index, the lower the SES. Questions were coded as absent (1) to plentiful (6), for a possible score range of 13 to 78. The quality of the home environment that supported the children\u2019s development was assessed with HOME, a 45-item, observer-rated checklist (22). A higher HOME score reflects a more supportive home environment for children\u2019s development. Scores range from 0 to 45. Physical activity at adolescence was measured by using a 5-item questionnaire, validated for use in young populations (26). The questionnaire addresses planned and unplanned physical and sedentary activities as a continuous score between 0 and 10. Age at menarche and age at adolescent measurement were analyzed as continuous variables. Statistical analyses \nSAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute) was used for all statistical analyses, with the exception of computed MetS risk score, for which SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp) was used. \nFor describing sample characteristics, continuous variables were expressed as mean and SD, and categorical variables were expressed as frequencies. All variables were assessed for normality. Unadjusted comparisons between early onset obesity groups were calculated by using t tests for continuous outcomes and \u03c7 2 tests for categorical outcomes. Regression diagnostics, using tests and graphical methods, examined linear regression assumptions including linearity (residual vs predictor plot) normality (Shapiro\u2013Wilk test), homogeneity of variance (Breusch\u2013Pagan test) and independence (Durbin\u2013Watson statistic). All of these assumptions were met, indicating linearity, uncorrelated and normally distributed estimated residuals with constant variance. Influence and collinearity were also examined, with no extreme deviations observed for studentized and jackknife residuals, and small leverage and Cook\u2019s distance values. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between early onset obesity and MetS risk score, adjusting for possible confounders. The full model was tested by using backward elimination. Variables that were not statistically associated with the dependent variable were manually removed. Because the study sample participated in a preventive trial, iron status during infancy and iron supplementation were initially included as covariates. Neither variable was significantly associated with the outcome, and thus both were removed from the final model. Age at menarche, which was tested in the multivariable model, was not significantly associated with outcome and therefore was dropped from the final model. Significance was set at a P value of less than .05. Multicollinearity between variables was assessed with tolerance level with a cut point of less than 0.10. There was no evidence of multicollinearity in the model. \nMarginal structural models (MSMs) refine the adjustment made by traditional analytic approaches and predict an estimate that accounts for the bias that exists when time-dependent covariates might act as both confounders and intermediates in a linear association. We used an MSM as a sensitivity analysis to account for potential bias resulting from the inclusion of adolescent weight status in the final model; bias may arise because adolescent weight status both mediates and confounds the relationship between early-life obesity and adolescent MetS risk score. To carry out these analyses, we estimated stabilized inverse probability weights (27) and reweighted our sample to create a pseudopopulation in which the exposure, early onset obesity, is statistically independent of potential time-dependent confounders. Results from the pseudopopulation models supported initial findings, indicating limited bias resulting from the inclusion of adolescent weight status as a covariate in the multivariable linear regression model. Top Results \nMean age of participants at adolescence was 16.8 years, and 52.9% were male ( Table 1 ). The mean birthweight in the study population was 3.6 kg (SD, 0.4 kg). Early onset obesity was found in 18.1% of the participants, of which 41.0% were girls. We found no significant differences in birthweight, sex, SES, HOME scores, and physical activity in adolescence between participants with early onset obesity and participants without early onset obesity. Obesity status at adolescence was related to early onset obesity. Of those with early onset obesity, 50% were obese at adolescence, in contrast to 6% of the comparison group ( P < .001). \nThe MetS risk score and all variables related to CVD risk were significantly higher in the early onset obesity group, compared with the group without early onset obesity, with the exception of HDL cholesterol, which was inversely related to CVD risk, and fasting blood glucose, which did not differ between groups ( Table 2 ). Participants in the early onset obesity group had significantly higher mean total cholesterol levels (156.4 mg/dL; SD, 27.9 vs 151.1 mg/dL; SD 27.5, P = .04) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (98.9 mg/dL, SD 24.8 vs 93.3 mg/dL, SD 24.2, P = .03) compared with the group without early onset obesity. Additional analyses for MetS components by sex showed that adolescent boys had significantly lower mean total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels and significantly higher fasting blood glucose levels and blood pressure than adolescent girls. \nThe final model, controlling for sex and obesity status in adolescence, indicated that early onset obesity was associated with a higher MetS risk score in adolescence (\u03b2 = 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13\u2013 0.41, P < .001) ( Table 3 ) and explained 39% of the variance in the MetS risk score. The adjusted mean and standard error (SE) MetS risk score was 1.0 (SE, 0.06) and 0.7 (SE, 0.04) for participants with and without early onset obesity, respectively. Additionally, female sex was associated with a lower MetS risk score in the model (\u03b2 = \u22120.26; 95% CI, \u22120.35 to \u22120.17; P < .001), adjusting for other covariates. \nFindings from the MSM, a sensitivity analysis, did not differ from findings of the multivariable regression analysis. This corroborated the effect size of early onset obesity and its relationship with MetS risk score in adolescence. Top Discussion \nThis study showed that early onset obesity was associated with greater MetS risk in adolescence. Independent of adolescent obesity status and sex, a child who had obesity at age 5 years had a higher MetS risk score (\u03b2 = 0.27) at age 16. These results support our initial hypothesis. \nOur findings are consistent with those in a mid-childhood cohort (28). Using a similar analytic approach and focusing on metabolic profiles that included dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, Garnett et al. (28) concluded that children who were overweight or obese at age 8 years were almost 7 times as likely to have CVD risk-clustering at age 15 years as those who were not overweight or obese (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.5\u2013 19.0; P < .001) (28). \nBoys in our cohort had higher mean MetS risk scores than girls, independent of early onset obesity and obesity status at adolescence. These results are similar to our prior findings (29) and those of US national data, in which adolescent boys were more likely to have MetS risk factors than adolescent girls (9). A recent systematic review of the prevalence of MetS in children and adolescents from 12 countries in North America and South America also found a higher prevalence of MetS among boys (29). Adolescent boys also manifested higher fasting blood glucose, higher blood pressure, and lower HDL cholesterol levels than adolescent girls. These CVD risks were primarily observed in Mexico, Canada, Colombia, and the United States (30). \nThis research emphasizes the value of studying longitudinal cohorts and the relevance this study\u2019s cohort to obesity in early childhood and adolescent health outcomes among Chileans. In addition to the longitudinal study design, this study has several strengths, such as the uniqueness of a Chilean cohort of infants followed successfully to adolescence, inclusion of a relatively large group of healthy infants, and good participant retention. Another strength is that the evaluation was conducted at a nutrition research center by highly trained study personnel. Furthermore, the use of a sex-specific and race-specific continuous MetS risk score is a study strength. Although continuous scores were previously developed, the methodology followed by Gurka et al and applied in this study, acknowledges correlations between the MetS components, accounting for MetS component correlation differences by sex and race/ethnicity (25). \nA limitation of this study is that it may not be generalizable to other populations. The participant sample was restricted to infants who weighed 3 kg or more at birth. Thus, we cannot infer whether these relationships translate to preterm or low-birthweight infants. Also, probably because data on birthweight were restricted, we probably did not observe a relationship between birthweight and obesity. Generalization to higher-income or poverty groups is also restricted. Another limitation is lack of anthropometric data between measurement waves, thus placing participants in a BMI category at time of measurement, which might have been different a year before or after measurement. Additionally, data were unavailable on maternal or paternal obesity status, diet intake, and direct physical activity measures. Although we attempted to minimize unmeasured confounding in our study by including measures on recognized potential confounders, such unmeasured risk factors could confound the relationship between early onset obesity and MetS risk. \nNotwithstanding these limitations, our findings add to the literature on early life determinants, in particular determinants related to the long-term effects of early onset obesity on MetS or other CVD-related risk factors. Future research should be conducted in populations with various races and ethnicities to substantiate these findings and address a key public health problem. \nOur results underscore the public health implications of early childhood obesity for health outcomes later in life. The findings provide evidence for a clinically meaningful and significant association between early onset obesity and MetS risk score in this Chilean cohort. The results of this study emphasize the importance and need for early detection of childhood obesity and effective public health interventions.

PEER REVIEWED Abstract \nIntroduction \nA national diabetic retinopathy screening program does not exist in Mexico as of 2017. Our objective was to develop a screening tool based on a predictive model for early detection of diabetic retinopathy in a low-income population. \nMethods \nWe analyzed biochemical, clinical, anthropometric, and sociodemographic information from 1,000 adults with diabetes in low-income communities in Mexico (from 11,468 adults recruited in 2014\u20132016). A comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation was performed. We developed the screening tool through the following stages: 1) development of a theoretical predictive model, 2) performance assessment and validation of the model using cross-validation and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC), and 3) optimization of cut points for the classification of diabetic retinopathy. We identified points along the AUC ROC that minimized the misclassification cost function and considered various scenarios of misclassification costs and diabetic retinopathy prevalence. \nResults \nTime since diabetes diagnosis, high blood glucose levels, systolic hypertension, and physical inactivity were considered risk factors in our screening tool. The mean AUC ROC of our model was 0.780 (validation data set). The optimized cut point that best represented our study population ( z = \u22120.640) had a sensitivity of 82.9% and a specificity of 61.9%. \nConclusion \nWe developed a low-cost and easy-to-apply screening tool to detect people at high risk of diabetic retinopathy in Mexico. Although classification performance of our tool was acceptable (AUC ROC > 0.75), error rates (precision) depend on false-negative and false-positive rates. Therefore, confirmatory assessment of all cases is mandatory. Top Introduction \nIn 2016, diabetes was declared a national epidemiologic emergency in Mexico (1). In 2006, the estimated prevalence of diabetes in Mexican adults was 14.4% (2). Mortality rates attributable to this disease in Mexico are among the highest in the world (3). By 2012, 74.7% of Mexican adults with diagnosed diabetes had inadequate glycemic control (4). Diabetes is associated with the development and progression of diabetic retinopathy (5\u20138), a major cause of sight loss and blindness in Latin American countries (9). A population-based survey from 2010 in the state of Chiapas found that 38.9% of adults aged 50 or older with diabetes had diabetic retinopathy and 21.0% had proliferative diabetic retinopathy (10). \nLong-term diabetes and hypertension are consistently associated with diabetic retinopathy (5\u20138,11\u201313). The Mexican National Nutrition Survey 2006 found that the mean time since diabetes diagnosis among adults was more than 8 years (2). In 2012, an estimated 65.6% of adults with diabetes had hypertension (14). In this context, an epidemic of diabetes complications, including diabetic retinopathy, could worsen in Mexico, and the study of screening systems for diabetic retinopathy is important. \nDiabetic retinopathy ranks third in direct costs generated by diabetes complications in Mexico (15); these costs result from specialized procedures for diagnosis and treatment. A cost-benefit analysis to identify optimal cut points for identifying people who are at risk for diabetic retinopathy and who need a comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation is an approach to developing an adequate-performance screening tool (16); however, such an approach would be complex because of the detailed cost information required. \nOur objective was to develop a practical screening tool based on a predictive model and a simplification of a cost-benefit analysis to optimize cut points for early detection of diabetic retinopathy in low-income communities in Mexico. Top Methods \nWe conducted a screening protocol for eye-related complications of diabetes from May 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016, in 3 low-income municipalities in the state of Morelos. We recruited 11,468 adults (aged \u226520 y) for a screening of chronic diseases in our mobile unit and community health centers. From these participants, we invited those with a type 2 diabetes diagnosis (n = 1,768 [15.4%]) to a comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation. Exclusion criteria for this evaluation were signs of ocular infection or pregnancy. \nOf the 1,768 participants, 538 declined to participate in the ophthalmologic evaluation, 1 person was excluded because the quality of photographs was not adequate for grading, and 229 participants did not have a photographic assessment at the time of analysis. One thousand participants (56.6%) completed the procedure. We obtained informed consent from all participants, and the protocol was approved by the ethics, research, and biosecurity committees of the Mexican National Institute of Public Health. Data collection and definition of variables \nAll participants had at least 1 glycemic assessment (fasting [\u22658 h] capillary or random capillary glycemia [glucometer method] or fasting venous glycemia [glucose oxidase method]). Fasting serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were assessed by enzymatic method (n = 418) and serum insulin with radioimmunoassay method (n = 112) for a portion of the sample; because of logistical and budgetary constraints, the entire sample could not be assessed for these variables. \nHigh blood glucose was defined as a fasting glucose of 126 mg/dL or more or, if fasting glucose was unavailable, as random glucose of 200 mg/dL or more (17). Insulin resistance was classified by using a homeostasis model assessment value of 3.8 or more (18). \nHypertriglyceridemia was defined as triglycerides of 150 mg/dL or more, hypercholesterolemia as total cholesterol of 200 mg/dL or more, and hypoalphalipoproteinemia as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of less than 50 mg/dL for women and less than 40 mg/dL for men (19,20). \nBlood pressure was measured twice (interval of 30 seconds). We diagnosed high systolic/diastolic blood pressure when the average of the assessments was \u2265140/\u226590 mm Hg. Likewise, we recorded whether participants reported a diagnosis of hypertension (21). \nWeight, height, and waist circumference were measured by trained personnel using standard protocols. Body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms divided by height in m 2 [kg/m 2 ]) was calculated: overweight was defined as a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 and obesity as a BMI of 30.0 or more (22). Abdominal obesity was defined as a waist circumference of 80 cm or more for women and 90 cm or more for men (19). \nData on sociodemographic characteristics and clinical history were collected by trained interviewers through an adapted version of the questionnaires applied in the National Health and Nutrition Survey of Mexico (23). We used the time since diabetes diagnosis as a proxy of duration of type 2 diabetes and categorized it into 4 intervals (<5 y, 5 y to <10 y, 10 y to <15 y and \u226515 y). Participants reported whether they followed diet and physical activity recommendations to control their diabetes. \nWe conducted a principal component analysis of 15 characteristics related to household appliances and services (eg, ownership of car, telephone, computer, vacuum cleaner, washing machine, refrigerator, pay television, internet) as a proxy for socioeconomic status (SES). Similar methods have been used (14). These characteristics had a factorial loading of 0.30 or more. The first principal component was divided into tertiles and used as a proxy for low SES, medium SES, and high SES. Ophthalmologic evaluation \nAll participants were interviewed by using a validated questionnaire for ocular assessment. The following data were collected by trained technicians: best-corrected visual acuity, refractometry (by using an automated refractor [Huvitz HRK-7000]), and intraocular pressure (by using a rebound tonometer [Icare TA01i]). Afterwards, all participants received a photographic evaluation of their posterior pole (45\u00b0 nonmydriatic fundus camera [DRS-Centervue]). Participants were dilated with tropicamide only if the quality of the photographs was not adequate for grading. We took 3 fields of the posterior pole using a standardized protocol. The first field centered on the optic nerve, the second field centered on the fovea, and third field was temporal to the macula but included the fovea. This protocol has an adequate level of sensitivity and specificity for grading referable stages of diabetic retinopathy (24). \nAll photographs were sent to Eye Knowledge Network (www.eyeknowledge.net). All cases were masked and reviewed by trained graders from the Hospital Luis S\u00e1nchez Bulnes of the Association for the Prevention of Blindness in Mexico. The cases were graded by using the Revised English Diabetic Eye Screening Program Grading System (25), which allows prompt referral of proliferative stages of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema. Diabetic retinopathy was recorded when a participant had background diabetic retinopathy, preproliferative diabetic retinopathy, or proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Statistical analysis \nWe tabulated categorical variables as frequency and proportion distributions and quantitative variables as measures of central tendency (mean or median) and dispersion (standard deviation [SD] or interquartile range). We set statistical significance at an \u03b1 of .05. We compared measures of central tendency according to diabetic retinopathy status of participants (has diabetic retinopathy or does not have diabetic retinopathy) by using the Student t test or Mann\u2013Whitney U test, depending on the distribution of the quantitative variables. We used a \u03c7 2 test or Fisher exact test to compare the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy across categories of nonquantitative variables. We conducted a descriptive analysis to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and diabetic retinopathy risk factors between participants and nonparticipants. \nWe developed the screening tool in 3 stages: 1) we developed the theoretical predictive model, 2) we assessed the performance of the model and conducted a validation analysis, and 3) we optimized risk-score cut points for diabetic retinopathy classification. Development of the theoretical predictive model \nFor multivariate analysis, we included only participants who had complete information on diabetic retinopathy status (the dependent variable), and we determined whether at least 95% of the participants provided information for each of the independent variables. If 5% or more of the participants did not provide information for an independent variable (theoretical risk factors of diabetic retinopathy), we used multiple imputation through a logistic regression model, where diabetic retinopathy, sex, age, and self-reported diabetes screening were the independent variables, to complete the information. \nWe generated a predictive probit model based on theoretical risk factors of diabetic retinopathy (5\u20138,11\u201313). We decided to use this model to develop our tool because of its easy interpretability as a z score from its linear equation and because it provides a predicted probability for the linear predictor (applying the standard normal cumulative function). Familiarity with this distribution provides a better understanding of coefficients and predicted z scores. The dependent variable was diabetic retinopathy, and the 4 predictors were time since diabetes diagnosis, high blood glucose, high systolic blood pressure, and physical inactivity. We estimated probabilities adjusted by covariables of having diabetic retinopathy given each risk factor category though predictive margins. Performance assessment and validation \nWe used the k -fold cross-validation method ( k = 10 partitions) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC). To assess the performance of the model in training and validation data sets, we randomly divided the sample into 10 partitions. In each partition, one segment was reserved for model validation (validation data set, n ~ 10%), while the rest of the sample in this partition was used as a training subsample (training data set, n ~ 90%). We calculated the AUC ROC for each iteration and its mean for the 10 iterations. Optimization of risk-score cut points for diabetic retinopathy classification \nWe developed a risk score for diabetic retinopathy based on the z predictor of our statistical model. In this way, the attributable score of each risk factor was equivalent to its probit coefficient. \nThe use of a cost-benefit analysis to select cut points implies knowledge of true and false classification costs; however, it is difficult to have such complete information. To select the optimal cut points of the z predictor to classify diabetic retinopathy, we decided to focus on misclassification costs only through the misclassification cost term (16). We identified points along the ROC curve that minimized the misclassification cost function for various scenarios of misclassification costs and diabetic retinopathy prevalence. The costs of true classification were assumed as null, and the examples of the variations of misclassification ratios were set according to consequences in health costs of screening for diabetic retinopathy. \nWe estimated sensitivity and specificity across AUC ROC and isocost curves, which minimized the costs of misclassification. Likewise, we estimated positive predictive values and negative predictive values. \nWe considered the following scenarios for the optimization of the cut points: diabetic retinopathy prevalence of 35.0%, 40.0%, and 45.0%, and the observed prevalence in our sample. We examined various ratios of cost misclassification (classification costs of false negatives divided by classification costs of false positives). We examined ratios of 1, 4, and 10, assuming that classification of a false negative would generate higher health care costs than would classification of a false positive. \nThe statistical analysis was conducted by using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp LLC) and RStudio version 1.0.136 with the OptimalCutpoints package. Top Results \nThe mean age of our sample was 57.2 y (SD, 11.0 y), and 73.0% were women. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 31.7% ( Table 1 ); 18.9% had background diabetic retinopathy, 5.7% had preproliferative diabetic retinopathy, and 7.1% of participants had active proliferative diabetic retinopathy. \nThe prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was significantly higher among participants with insulin resistance, high blood glucose, and hypertension than among participants without those conditions. Participants with diabetic retinopathy had significantly longer times since diabetes diagnosis, higher blood glucose levels, and higher systolic blood pressure than those without diabetic retinopathy. In contrast, the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was lower among participants who were overweight or obese, had abdominal obesity, or used physical activity to control their diabetes than among participants without these characteristics. The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was highest, by SES, in the lowest tertile of SES and highest, by marital status, among divorced adults (Table 1). \nWe found no significant differences in the distribution of sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics, or diabetic retinopathy risk factors between participants and nonparticipants. Development and cross-validation of predictive model \nFrom all independent variables included in our model, except physical activity (data were missing for 17.0% of participants), had at least 95.0% of information. After multiple imputation analysis for physical activity, we obtained a probit model with 939 observations. \nAccording to our multivariate analysis ( Table 2 ), time since diabetes diagnosis was positively associated with the estimated probability of diabetic retinopathy. For example, the probability of diabetic retinopathy was 11.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.9%\u201314.9%) when time since diabetes diagnosis was less than 5 years, whereas the probability was 56.0% (95% CI, 49.5%\u201362.6%) when time since diabetes diagnosis was 15 years or more. Similarly, the probability of diabetic retinopathy was higher among those with high blood glucose (35.6%) and high systolic blood pressure (37.4%) than among those without those conditions (23.9% and 29.3%, respectively). On the other hand, participants who reported using physical activity to control diabetes had a lower predicted probability of diabetic retinopathy (25.4%) than those who reported not using physical activity (34.8%). \nAccording to the cross-validation analysis ( Table 3 ), the diagnostic performance of our model was similar between training data sets (mean AUC ROC = 0.780) and validation data sets (mean AUC ROC = 0.778). Risk-score cut points for diabetic retinopathy classification \nAccording to the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy observed with misclassification ratios of 1, 4, and 10, the optimal cut points were \u22120.046, \u22120.640, and \u22121.209, respectively ( Table 4 ). \nFour points minimized the misclassification costs given the ROC curve of our model (Figure). The optimized cut point according to a misclassification ratio of 4 and the diabetic retinopathy prevalence observed in our sample (31.7%) was z = \u22120.640, with a sensitivity of 82.9%, a specificity of 61.9%, a positive predictive value of 50.3%, and a negative predictive value of 88.6% (Table 4). Figure. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and points along the ROC curve corresponding to optimized cut points given a cost ratio (classification costs of false negatives divided by classification costs of false positives) equal to 4 and various scenarios of diabetic retinopathy prevalence: a) 31.7%, the observed prevalence in the study population; b) and c) prevalence of 35.0% and 40.0%; and d) prevalence of 45.0%. [A tabular description of this figure is also available.] \nOn the basis of our data, we propose a risk-score screening tool (Box): A health care provider (can be a nonspecialized provider) asks the patient 2 questions (on time since diabetes diagnosis and use of physical activity to control diabetes) and obtains 2 measurements (blood glucose and systolic blood pressure). Each response is scored, the scores are summed, and a final score is calculated. The health care provider consults a simple chart that shows 4 levels of diabetic retinopathy prevalence, chooses the prevalence that most closely matches the prevalence of the community in which the patient resides, and then identifies the cut point that corresponds with the prevalence. If the patient has a score equal to or greater than the cut point, the patient should be directed to receive a comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation. Box. Proposed Screening Tool for Diabetic Retinopathy in Mexican Adults Aged \u226520 With Type 2 Diabetes, Given a Cost Ratio (Classification Costs of False Negatives Divided by Classification Costs of False Positives) of 4 Application Instructions: Check one box per question. Sum the corresponding scores of each checked box and then subtract 1.48. Use the cut point closest to the diabetic retinopathy prevalence of the population in which you are applying this tool. If the patient obtained a higher or equal score to the cut point used, the patient must be referred to specialized health services for a comprehensive ophthalmologic evaluation. Risk Factors for Diabetic Retinopathy Score The information of the following 2 questions must be obtained by direct interview: 1.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd14.170425 . On This Page Author Information \nIt was a remarkable year for Preventing Chronic Disease ( PCD ) as we embarked on a journey to advance the journal\u2019s mission and vision and achieve priorities. I was appointed editor in chief of PCD in October 2016, and this column marks my one-year anniversary. My first column, in February, established that I would publish 3 columns this year to announce actions and appointments, discuss timely public health topics, and update readers on the journal\u2019s priorities. I also identified 10 priorities for the journal in 2017: Adopting a multilayered approach to peer review Securing additional associate editors Promoting global public health perspectives Ensuring scientific integrity Accelerating the dissemination of critical research Introducing a new article type to focus on implementation evaluation Maintaining the   Developing tools and resources for novice authors Enhancing our brand as an innovator in scholarly publishing \nIn this final Editor in Chief\u2019s Column for 2017, it is important to me to provide PCD readers with updates on each of these priorities, toward which considerable progress has been made. Top Adopting a Multilayered Approach to Peer Review \nPCD carefully examined its peer-review process, and thanks to an expanded team of associate editors, we added an additional quality control stage to the process. Each manuscript is first screened to ensure it aligns with the journal\u2019s mission and publication standards. A manuscript that meets these initial submission requirements is assigned by me to one of our associate editors, who determines whether the manuscript should undergo peer review. The associate editor then makes a recommendation on the manuscript on the basis of his or her assessment of the peer reviews, and as editor in chief I make the final decision. In addition to adding a new layer to our peer-review process, we began using a rating system to evaluate the quality of reviews, so associate editors can select the best reviewers and ensure that manuscripts are assessed by highly qualified, independent, and experienced peer reviewers. \nThis multilayered peer-review process established important quality control checkpoints, positioned authors to receive valuable feedback on the scientific and programmatic content of their manuscripts, and improved the quality of manuscripts accepted for publication. In addition, these enhancements influenced the journal\u2019s acceptance rate, which decreased from 32.5% from January through August 2016 to 26.9% for the same period in 2017. Top Securing Additional Associate Editors \nPCD assembled an impressive group of researchers and practitioners capable of recommending manuscripts for publication on the basis of merit, appropriateness, and the highest ethical standards in scholarly publishing. In October 2016, PCD had 3 associate editors. Since then, PCD has appointed 16 new associate editors with experience in population health, health systems, implementation evaluation, geographic information systems, health economics, behavioral health, and applied epidemiology. To ensure the stability of the journal\u2019s institutional knowledge while still allowing room to recruit new expertise to meet future research and programmatic priorities, we established appointment terms of 2 years, 3 years, and 4 years. All associate editors undergo training on the journal\u2019s mission, direction, and publication standards for all article types; on the logistics of the journal\u2019s manuscript system; and on how to provide meaningful feedback to authors. The increase in the number of associate editors in critical research areas has assisted the journal in providing relevant and useful feedback to authors, reducing manuscript review time, and improving the quality of manuscripts submitted and accepted for publication. To learn more about the background and experience of our associate editors, please see www.cdc.gov/pcd/about_the_journal/associate_editors.htm . Top Promoting Global Public Health Perspectives \nPCD recognizes that understanding the conditions that shape health in various settings and geographical locations is critical to advancing public health and medicine. PCD established a priority to serve as a resource to researchers and practitioners internationally, recognizing that factors influencing health in the United States are similar to those in other countries. We have worked closely with our editorial board to identify strategies to increase submissions from experts who are conducting population health interventions that address diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular health, and other public health topics in other countries. From January through August 2017, the journal received 89 submissions from countries outside of the United States \u2014 including Australia, Canada, Germany, Guatemala, Israel, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, and Taiwan \u2014 an increase of 20 manuscripts from this same period in 2016. Ten of these manuscripts, mostly original research articles, were accepted for publication. Readers can anticipate articles describing international efforts to prevent and control diabetes, education of children about stroke prevention, use of geographic information systems technology to monitor multiple chronic conditions, and how public health surveillance systems are being used to monitor and track health conditions. Top Ensuring Scientific Integrity \nPCD recognizes that several factors can contribute to situations of scientific misconduct \u2014 lack of confidence, pressure to publish in established journals, competition within disciplines and professions, desire for prestige and recognition, lack of consequences established by the journal, and poor research and writing skills. PCD takes the matter of ensuring scientific integrity seriously, and we took steps to provide our editorial board, associate editors, peer reviewers, and authors with guidance on the journal\u2019s expectations for preparing and disseminating findings to the public health community. We have sought to educate them about the need to ensure scientific integrity at all levels: analyzing and reporting results, determining authorship, acknowledging and obtaining approval to use copyrighted material, recognizing how previous research helped to advance reported findings, and disclosing conflicts of interests. Information on PCD \u2019s policy on scientific integrity was refined and can be reviewed on our Editorial Policy page: www.cdc.gov/pcd/about_the_journal/editorial_policy.htm . Top Publishing Collections of Articles \nPCD is often approached by authors and organizations interested in publishing multiple articles that address a common theme. In November 2016, we released new guidance on submitting proposals for collections. Articles published in PCD collections undergo the same rigorous peer-review process as regular submissions to ensure that their scientific and programmatic content meets the highest standards of scholarly research. During the past year, we worked closely with authors of articles in 2 collections. \nThe first collection, \u201cState and Local Public Health Actions to Prevent and Control Chronic Disease,\u201d recognizes that chronic diseases often occur simultaneously and result from interrelated risk factors. This collection showcases how 4 programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2014 diabetes; heart disease and stroke prevention; nutrition, physical activity, and obesity; and school health \u2014 can work together to address state and local efforts to improve health outcomes. Articles in this collection describe the use of 3 primary strategies: 1) improving environments and settings to promote positive health behaviors; 2) improving the delivery and use of quality clinical services and other health services to prevent and manage high blood pressure and diabetes; and 3) increasing links between communities and clinical organizations to support prevention of diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity. \nChildhood obesity is a global public health problem. Obese children are at high risk for becoming obese adolescents, placing them at risk for developing chronic diseases later in life. In addition, obese children are more prone to have emotional and psychological challenges than are children who are not obese. The second collection, \u201cThe Childhood Obesity Research Demonstration (CORD) Project: Real-World Implementation of Multisetting Interventions to Address Childhood Obesity,\u201d focuses on real-world implementation of evidence-based interventions in multiple settings \u2014 schools, early child care and education centers, health care facilities, and the community \u2014 with the goal of improving healthy eating and physical activity among low-income children. \nArticles in these 2 collections describe original research not previously published in indexed scientific literature. PCD encourages authors and organizations interested in reviewing previously published collections and finding guidance on submitting a proposal to visit the Collections section of our website: https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/collections/index.htm . Top Accelerating the Dissemination of Critical Research \nThroughout this year, we identified several ways to accelerate the dissemination of critical research: streamlining author submission requirements; identifying and securing reviewers with a track record of high-quality and timely peer reviews; and emphasizing promotion of the Research Brief. A Research Brief is essentially a shortened version of an Original Research article. It offers authors an opportunity to have their work reviewed more quickly and published in a shorter turnaround time. From January through August 2017, the journal received 65 Research Brief submissions, and 19 of these manuscripts were accepted for publication. The accepted Research Briefs cover diverse topics, such as the role of age and acculturation in diabetes management, aspirin use for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, prevalence and correlates of sleep apnea among US veterans, and concordance of blood-pressure\u2013control estimates using thresholds derived from treatment guidelines. We will continue to identify ways to publish rigorous research and evaluation findings \u2014 by using quality controls, modifying the formats of article types, enlarging the pool of experienced and reliable reviewers, and maintaining a robust management system \u2014 to quickly move manuscripts through all stages of review, production, and publication. Top Introducing a New Article Type to Focus on Implementation Evaluation \nIn March 2017, PCD developed a new article type, Implementation Evaluation, which provides readers with information on how public health programs and interventions are developed and evaluated on the basis of diverse factors (ie, program focus, population characteristics, staffing capacity, geographic location, patient\u2013community\u2013health system partnerships, and fiscal resources) in real-world settings. Implementation Evaluation articles offer an opportunity for authors to present results from tailored, setting-specific evaluation methods and approaches. As such, Implementation Evaluation articles are positioned to discuss how evidence-based programs and interventions can be adapted in other settings. Since its launch in March 2017, PCD has received 10 submissions that examine effective ways to integrate population-based interventions, practices, and evaluation methods into routine clinical, public health, health care, school, worksite, and community settings. Top Maintaining the   \nPCD is committed to providing opportunities for young researchers to contribute to public health and develop critical writing and reviewing skills. We are pleased to showcase in this week\u2019s release the winners of the 2017  . This year, instead of having one winner, we introduced 4 categories of winners: high school, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral. We have 5 winners this year, rather than 4, because the caliber of submissions in the doctoral student category was so high that our panel decided on 2 winners. Special thanks go to our editorial board for their assistance in serving on the reviewing panels to identify this year\u2019s winners. \nIt is important to note that student researchers, regardless of category, had to meet our standard to serve as first authors \u2014 that is, the person who conducted or led the research described in the manuscript and prepared the first draft. PCD received a record 72 contest entries this year, compared with 37 in 2015 and 59 in 2014. We were thrilled to see this number of high-quality entries. We recognize that these entries would not have been possible without the support of faculty mentors working closely with students to develop their research competencies and scientific writing skills. Although we could not name every entry as a winner, we thought several nonwinning submissions were of sufficient merit to warrant peer review. PCD has accepted and will publish a total 19 manuscripts, all of which will be available soon on PCD \u2019s Collections page. For more information on this year\u2019s contest and access to the 5 winning student research articles, please see this week\u2019s Table of Contents: www.cdc.gov/pcd/index.htm . For information on our 2018   rules and expectations, please visit our Announcements page: www.cdc.gov/ PCD /announcements.htm . Student entries must be received electronically no later than 5:00 PM EST on Friday, February 23, 2018. Top Developing Tools and Resources for Novice Authors \nPCD is committed to assisting authors with tools and resources for strengthening skills and building confidence in scientific writing. This year our editorial staff reviewed and revised the journal\u2019s instructions for authors, and the updated content is provided in our new \u201cAuthor\u2019s Corner\u201d: www.cdc.gov/ PCD /for_authors/index.htm . In addition, editorial staff members updated information on PCD \u2019s Types of Articles page and provided detailed information for authors on the requirements for each: www.cdc.gov/ PCD /for_authors/types_of_articles.htm . \nPCD finalized a new section on the following topics: 1) Top 5 Reasons Manuscripts Are Rejected; 2) Top 5 Mistakes in Tables; 3) Top 5 Mistakes in Reporting Statistics; and 4) Top 5 Mistakes in Figures. This new section was developed on the basis of PCD \u2019s years of experience in working with authors to improve manuscripts as well as guidelines published in the AMA Manual of Style: A Guide for Authors and Editors \u2014 10th Edition and other resources describing how to present statistical information to medical and public health audiences. The section was designed to help authors to position their manuscripts for acceptance. Authors can access this guidance by visiting the Author\u2019s Corner: www.cdc.gov/pcd/for_authors/index.htm . Top Enhancing Our Brand as an Innovator in Scholarly Publishing \nPCD is committed to enhancing the journal\u2019s brand as an innovator in scholarly publishing. During the past 4 months, PCD implemented a Simplified Submission pilot program to reduce the amount of time authors spend in the process of submitting manuscripts. The pilot program has been a tremendous success; instances of manuscripts being returned to authors for formatting corrections have dropped from 45 to 4 since the program began, and manuscript check-in time has decreased from 1.12 days to 0.68 days. \nPCD has introduced another pilot program to offer opportunities for PCD \u2019s top peer reviewers to receive continuing education (CE) credits. The pilot is only one of the avenues PCD is exploring to recognize excellence among our peer reviewers in providing thoughtful, comprehensive, and timely reviews. PCD is now looking into recognizing reviewers for their excellence through their ORCID ID or Publons profile \u2014 interactive mechanisms that link people with their professional activities. As editor in chief I have made my own commitment this year to recognize these important contributions, and I have emailed many of our top reviewers to express my appreciation for the quality of their reviews and emphasize how critical these reviews are to the journal\u2019s success. \nPCD has increased efforts to promote articles to the news media by distributing media summaries through the CDC Newsroom ( www.cdc.gov/media/PCD/index.html ), increasing social media outreach, and releasing podcasts. PCD rebranded its podcasts as \u201c PCD Sound Bites\u201d and developed and introduced a new logo. To track the success of these outreach efforts, PCD is working to identify additional metrics to monitor the uptake, citation, impact, and visibility of PCD articles. Top Conducting External Review to Assess Journal \nAnd finally, perhaps PCD \u2019s biggest achievement in working to improve its brand is conducting the journal\u2019s first-ever external review. PCD invited a distinguished panel of health and medical professionals to assess the journal\u2019s progress and to identify ways to strengthen PCD \u2019s ability to disseminate cutting-edge programmatic, research, and evaluation findings. Although PCD has always been considered a valuable resource to a broad audience of readers, we are ready to take the journal to the next level. In June 2016, we invited 7 experts in public health, scientific writing, and scholarly publishing to examine the journal\u2019s strengths and areas of growth and answer a series of fundamental questions about the journal\u2019s focus and direction. The panel provided their expert opinions on PCD \u2019s mission, scientific quality, scope, audience, editorial standards and protocols, metrics and analytics, distribution platforms to communicate with readers, and future priorities. PCD is reviewing feedback from the external review panel\u2019s report, and during the next 3 months we will engage in discussions with our editorial board and associate editors, CDC\u2019s senior leadership, and PCD staff members to refine the journal\u2019s mission statement and vision statement. We will redefine the primary topics of interest and decide which topic areas the journal will no longer consider. We will share more details about the journal\u2019s new direction with our readership early next year. Please stay tuned for exciting enhancements geared to uphold PCD \u2019s commitment to be an influential journal promoting the best science and practice in public health. Top Final Thoughts and Acknowledgments \nThis year has been one of tremendous progress and success for the journal. We are committed to securing the necessary expertise among the journal\u2019s editorial board and associate editors to recognize the best scientific and programmatic contributions in public health. PCD will continue to identify and implement ways to improve our authors\u2019 interaction with every aspect of the journal, from submission to publication, and provide timely guidance so that authors have the best chance of receiving favorable peer reviews. For the growing number of student authors, the journal created a more level playing field in the   by establishing categories for different levels of education. PCD continued its brand as an innovator, from improvements in the journal\u2019s website and submissions process, to creative ways to recognize our top peer reviewers, to developing the best processes to ensure timely, courteous, and responsive service from PCD staff members. \nPCD could not have achieved these 10 priorities without a carefully considered plan of action. Furthermore, PCD could not have achieved them without the shared support of readers, authors, peer reviewers, editorial board members, associate editors, staff members, and senior leadership in CDC\u2019s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Thanks to these many people for their unwavering support of the journal.

PEER REVIEWED Abstract \nIntroduction \nPromotoras , Hispanic community health workers, are frequently employed to promote health behavioral change with culturally bound Hispanic lifestyle behaviors. Peer health mentors have been used in schools to promote healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors among students. This study investigates the efficacy of combining these 2 approaches by training high school health mentors, called compa\u00f1eros , to engage Hispanic middle school students in a school-based obesity intervention as a strategy to promote and sustain reductions in standardized body mass index (zBMI). \nMethods \nHigh school compa\u00f1eros were trained to participate in a 6-month obesity program alongside middle school students in Houston, Texas. Middle school students were randomized to participate in the program either with compa\u00f1eros (n = 94) or without compa\u00f1eros (n = 95). The intervention was conducted from 2013 through 2016 in 3 cohorts of students, 1 each school year. Students were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was zBMI, which was analyzed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. \nResults \nSignificant differences were found between conditions across time ( F = 4.58, P = .01). After the 6-month intervention, students in the condition with compa\u00f1eros had a larger decrease in zBMI ( F = 6.94, P = .01) than students in the condition without compa\u00f1eros . Furthermore, students who received the intervention with compa\u00f1eros showed greater sustained results at 12 months ( F = 7.65, P = .01). \nConclusion \nUsing high school compa\u00f1eros in an obesity intervention for Hispanic middle school students could be effective in promoting and maintaining reductions in zBMI. Top Introduction \nAlthough one of the strengths of school-based interventions for obesity is the ability to reach racial/ethnic minority groups who are at elevated risk, the success of school-based weight management interventions is not equivalent across races/ethnicities, and few obesity intervention programs exist that are tailored for racial/ethnic minority groups (1,2). A cost-effective public health strategy frequently used in Hispanic communities is to train community health workers, called promotoras, to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors (3,4). Promotoras are familiar with the population they serve and are typically well-respected members of the target community. These factors enable them to communicate health messages in a relatable way (5). Adapting the promotoras model to the middle school setting by training high school students as health mentors, called compa\u00f1eros , may be one strategy to more effectively tailor weight management interventions for Hispanic adolescents. \nPeer perception of lifestyle behaviors is important to adolescents (6), and evidence is beginning to establish teenagers as effective health mentors (7). However, few studies have assessed anthropometric measurements as an outcome (8\u201310). Of those that have, none were conducted with low-income, Hispanic adolescents, and none included a follow-up after the intervention to determine whether results were sustained. Our study aimed to examine whether the assistance of compa\u00f1eros in the implementation of nutrition and physical activity lessons could be an effective strategy for delivering an obesity prevention program to middle school students in a predominantly Hispanic school system. Top Methods \nSixth-grade and seventh-grade students (n = 506) were recruited from a charter school in Houston, Texas, that serves students in grades 6 through 12. Although all students who provided verbal assent and had parental consent were given the opportunity to participate in the intervention, only those who were overweight or obese (n = 189), defined as having a body mass index (BMI, kg/m 2 ) at or above the 85th percentile for age and sex according to the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (11) were included in this analysis. This sample size satisfied the 200 participants (100 in each condition) that were calculated to be needed to have an 80% likelihood of detecting a 0.09-unit difference in zBMI (standardized BMI) between conditions. The power analysis assumed nominal values for type I and type II error rates (5% and 20% respectively; 2-tailed) and an attrition rate of 20%. Students were randomized to receive either an obesity intervention with compa\u00f1eros (n = 94) or without compa\u00f1eros (n = 95). All students self-identified as Hispanic. Study design \nParticipants in both conditions received an obesity intervention for 50 minutes, 5 days a week, for 6 months during students\u2019 physical education (PE) class period. The intervention was conducted from 2013 through 2016 in 3 cohorts, 1 each school year, and participants were followed for 12 months. Because of the school calendar, the intervention was interrupted by various school breaks. To prevent contamination, students\u2019 schedules were developed before the beginning of the school year so that all students randomized to a particular condition were in classes only with students who were also randomized to the same condition. Interventions were led by PE teachers who were trained by research staff members as described elsewhere (12). Each week, the students participated in 1 day of healthy eating activities and 4 days of physical activity. This program was based on a school-based obesity intervention with demonstrated efficacy among this population (13,14). Details about the intervention and curriculum are available elsewhere (12,14,15). In addition to the physical activity and nutrition components, the intervention included behavioral modification through a token economy system in which the students received points for participation that they could accumulate and redeem for prizes. The only difference between the 2 conditions was the presence or absence of compa\u00f1eros . \nHigh school students were selected to be compa\u00f1eros if they met the following criteria: were recommended by a teacher, had an opening in their schedule during intervention periods, and expressed a desire to be involved. Weight was not a criterion for either compa\u00f1eros or middle school students to participate in the study. Compa\u00f1eros and middle school students were not matched by weight or racial/ethnic characteristics. However, because the school has a predominantly Hispanic student body, all compa\u00f1eros and middle school students were Hispanic. In this school district, high school and middle school students were taught in the same building. \nCompa\u00f1eros meeting criteria were trained daily for 2 weeks on how to lead all of the intervention activities. This training approach was similar to that used to train the PE teachers (12). The training curriculum mirrored the intervention curriculum, included basic nutrition and physical activity education, and was designed to help compa\u00f1eros identify strengths and weaknesses in their own diets and physical activity habits. Training provided compa\u00f1eros with ideas to use when talking with middle school students about how to make improvements in their diets and activity behaviors. Compa\u00f1eros were trained on each intervention activity until they were able to perform each themselves and explain to others how to do it. Compa\u00f1eros were provided with conversation starters and practiced initiating conversations about the curriculum with peers. Lastly, compa\u00f1eros were trained in how to provide praise and the importance of modeling. Compa\u00f1eros were considered to be proficient in this activity when they were able to demonstrate the use of praise correctly in 3 different student scenarios. \nOnce trained, compa\u00f1eros were instructed to engage in intervention activities with the middle school students. Before each class, the PE teacher informed compa\u00f1eros of the topic of focus for the day (eg, strategies to eat more vegetables, ways to be more active throughout the day). During class, compa\u00f1eros were to initiate a discussion of the selected topic with their group of middle school studentss. For example, between exercise stations compa\u00f1eros might talk about what they were going to eat for lunch that day or discuss their favorite vegetables. PE teachers regularly met with compa\u00f1eros to provide feedback on how they were doing and give guidance as needed. \nIn the without compa\u00f1eros condition, all variables were held constant between conditions with the exception of the compa\u00f1eros component. A trained PE teacher provided the same lessons as with the compa\u00f1eros condition. The only difference was that they conducted class without compa\u00f1eros assistance. \nResearchers monitored the implementation fidelity of each condition. For both conditions, researchers recorded the number of nutrition and physical activity sessions conducted. They also randomly assessed 10% of classes to record how frequently the PE teacher provided positive reinforcement and constructive feedback to students. Weekly meetings were conducted with the PE teacher to discuss issues related to intervention adherence. The fidelity check process was the same for both conditions except that in the compa\u00f1eros condition, the implementation of fidelity of the compa\u00f1ero role was also monitored. Specifically, researchers randomly observed 10% of classes to record how frequently compa\u00f1eros modeled healthy behavior and provided praise to the middle school students. Measures \nMiddle school students\u2019 height and weight were regularly measured throughout the study. Baseline, 6-month, and 12-month assessments were included in this analysis. At each assessment point, height was measured without footwear using a SECA 213 stadiometer (SECA). Weight was assessed in light clothing and without footwear using a Tanita BWB-800 digital scale (Tanita Corp). BMI was calculated from students\u2019 weight and height. BMI percentiles were determined by using the students\u2019 age and sex and were classified according to CDC guidelines (11). BMI percentiles were standardized to sex and age norms to determine zBMI. \nThe interpretation of height and weight for adolescents is complicated because adolescents are growing and developing. To enable a more comprehensive interpretation of anthropometric changes in adolescents, zBMI, BMI percentile, and BMI were included as outcomes. The primary outcome was zBMI, because the use of this metric is standard practice in research (16). Both zBMI and BMI percentiles account for age, sex, and the expected growth and development of adolescents. Possibly because pediatricians often speak to parents about their child\u2019s growth in terms of percentiles, the meaning of BMI percentile is more interpretable for a larger audience than the meaning of zBMI. Although zBMI is more sensitive than BMI percentile, neither of these metrics is sensitive to change at extreme ranges, such as that indicative of extreme obesity. BMI was included as an outcome to overcome this shortcoming because, although BMI does not account for age, sex, or the expected growth of adolescents, its sensitivity does not diminish at ranges suggestive of extreme obesity. Data analysis \nStatistical analyses were performed using SPSS, version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc); \u03c7 2 and independent samples t tests were conducted to compare differences between conditions at baseline and between those with and without measures at 6 and 12 months. A 2 \u00d7 3 repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine differences in weight outcomes between conditions across all periods. Post-hoc analyses (2 \u00d7 2 repeated measures ANCOVA) were conducted at both 6 and 12 months. To be consistent with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 Statement (17), in addition to the model developed for the main analysis, the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was used to create an intention-to-treat model to include those without 6-month or 12-month measurements. This method replaces missing data with the data most recently collected. Mean change scores for height, weight, BMI, BMI percentile, and zBMI were computed for each condition, from baseline to 6 months and from baseline to 12 months for both the main analysis and the intention-to-treat analysis. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects at the Baylor College of Medicine. Top Results \nOf the 189 students initially included in the study (94 in the compa\u00f1eros condition and 95 in the without compa\u00f1eros condition), 140 were available for assessment at 6 and 12 months, 71 students in the with compa\u00f1eros condition and 69 in the without compa\u00f1eros condition (Figure 1). The 49 students who were unavailable for assessment were excluded from our main assessment. No significant differences in age, sex, height, weight, or BMI were observed at baseline between conditions ( Table 1 ). There was a 74.1% retention rate at 12 months (n = 140 students remained). Attrition did not differ significantly among the 71 students remaining in the compa\u00f1eros condition (24.5% attrition) and the 69 students remaining in the condition without compa\u00f1eros (27.4% attrition). Students excluded from analysis (those unavailable for measurements at both 6 and 12 months) had a higher initial weight, BMI, and zBMI than did those whom we were able to assess at each time point (Table 1). Because of this, baseline weight was used as a covariate during all analyses. Figure 1.

[A text version of this figure is also available.] \nImplementation fidelity was high overall for both conditions. In both conditions, all 24 nutrition sessions and 96 physical activity sessions were conducted, and PE teachers provided constructive feedback in 100% of the observed classes. PE teachers provided positive reinforcement in 90% of the observed classes in the compa\u00f1eros condition and in 95% of the observed classes in the condition without compa\u00f1eros condition. In the compa\u00f1eros condition, compa\u00f1eros modeled healthy behaviors in 98% of the observed classes and provided praise in 94% of the observed classes. \nResults from the ANCOVA analysis indicated that, compared with students in the condition without compa\u00f1eros , students in the compa\u00f1eros condition decreased their zBMI ( F = 4.58, P = .01) (Figure 2). Figure 2. Comparison by study group of mean zBMI of participants at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months for participants in the with compa\u00f1eros condition and participants in the without compa\u00f1eros condition, an obesity prevention intervention using compa\u00f1eros , Houston, Texas, 2013\u20132016. [A tabular version of this figure is also available.] \nPost hoc analyses from baseline to 6 months and baseline to 12 months indicated differences in zBMI between conditions ( F = 6.94, P = .01 and F = 7.65, P = .01, respectively). Eighty percent of students in the compa\u00f1eros condition and 64% of students in the condition without compa\u00f1eros decreased or maintained zBMI from baseline to 6 months. At 12 months, 68% of students in the compa\u00f1eros condition and 55% of students in the condition without compa\u00f1eros had decreased or maintained zBMI from baseline. \nBMI scores did not decrease for all outcome variables between conditions from baseline to 6 months and 12 months for either condition ( Table 2 ). The mean change in BMI from baseline to 12 months was significantly different between conditions; zBMI and BMI percentile decreased from baseline to 6 months and from baseline to 12 months for both conditions. The compa\u00f1eros condition had a significantly greater decrease in zBMI at both 6 months and 12 months than the condition without compa\u00f1eros . \nAs with the main analysis, the intention-to-treat ANCOVA showed that compared with students in the condition without compa\u00f1eros , students in the compa\u00f1eros condition had a significantly decreased zBMI ( F = 3.27, P = .04). The change in zBMI between conditions for both 6- and 12-month post hoc analyses also showed significant differences between conditions ( F = 5.08, P = .04; F = 5.62, P = .02, respectively). Top Discussion \nThe purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to see if the addition of compa\u00f1eros to an established teacher-led, school-based obesity intervention (12) for middle school Hispanic students would be a more effective strategy for delivering the intervention than teachers delivering the intervention without compa\u00f1eros. At both 6 months and 12 months, students in the compa\u00f1eros condition had a significantly lower zBMI than those in the condition without compa\u00f1eros . The paucity of school-based interventions for Hispanic adolescents makes it difficult to directly compare the findings of this study to other studies (18). However, the results of this study are consistent with obesity interventions for adolescents in general, in which zBMI has been estimated to decrease by less than 0.1 units from baseline to intervention end (19). \nMean weight, height, and BMI increased from baseline to 12 months in both conditions. This change is expected because adolescents are still growing. The goal of adolescent obesity interventions is not necessarily weight loss, but a slowed weight gain relative to height. The statistically smaller increase in BMI observed in the condition with compa\u00f1eros compared with the condition without compa\u00f1eros indicates that the presence of compa\u00f1eros was more effective at changing the trajectory of weight gain relative to height. \nAlthough school-based interventions have generally been able to create short-term reductions in zBMI, few have been able to accomplish maintenance of zBMI (19). Maintenance of results is particularly discouraging when intervention implementation is translated from research professionals to teachers and staff at a school (12). The results of this study are compelling because students who received the intervention with compa\u00f1eros demonstrated greater maintenance in zBMI reduction at a year than those who received the intervention without compa\u00f1eros . The addition of compa\u00f1eros appears to be a possible solution to bridge the maintenance gap in the translation of intervention implementation from research professionals to a school\u2019s teachers and staff. \nOne potential explanation for why the compa\u00f1eros condition was more successful than the condition without compa\u00f1eros is the possibility that compa\u00f1eros were able to individually tailor the program for the middle school students in a way PE teachers were unable to. This suggestion is consistent with hypothesized reasons for the success of promotoras in community-based programs. As members of the community that they serve, promotoras are able to relate to program participants in a way medical professionals are often unable to (5). Because compa\u00f1eros attended the same school and had similar socioeconomic and racial/ethnic backgrounds as the middle students, they likely had a fuller understanding of the middle students\u2019 school, familial, and social environments. Although no data were collected to determine how middle school students perceived compa\u00f1eros , the endorsement of healthy behaviors by high students, who are thought to be respected and admired by middle students, likely contributed to intervention engagement and sustained behavior change (20). Another plausible explanation for the differences seen between the 2 conditions is that students who received the intervention with compa\u00f1eros received more attention, and this additional attention could have contributed to improved outcomes. \nBecause of the population of our study (ie, low income, Hispanic adolescents attending a charter school), additional research is needed to determine the generalizability of this type of intervention in other settings. However, the strategy of using peers to promote and sustain weight outcomes is likely generalizable to a variety of populations. For example, findings from this study are consistent with those of peer health mentoring interventions with Appalachian youths (21). Collectively, these studies support the notion that for interventions to be successful in the short and long term, they need to be relevant to the population being observed. \nStrengths of this study include its being a randomized controlled trial with a pre, post, and one-year follow up design that targeted Hispanic adolescents, a group at increased risk for obesity. Limitations include the lack of a no-treatment control condition, though practical considerations and school requirements made this unfeasible. Although being able to randomize students at the individual level is a strength of the study, the randomization does not control for the possibility of contamination. Steps were taken to prevent contamination. All students assigned to a particular condition had identical class schedules so that they had class only with students also randomized to the same intervention condition. Although students ate lunch by grade level, students had assigned tables for lunch so that they ate lunch only with students randomized to the same intervention condition. It was not feasible to keep students separated according to condition during free times or extracurricular activities, and it is probable that those in the condition without compa\u00f1eros knew that there was another condition and vice versa. Lastly, the health outcomes of compa\u00f1eros were not assessed. Results from other studies that have measured the effects of peer health mentorship on the mentor suggest that health mentorship programs have health benefits for both parties involved (8). \nMore research is needed in the area of maintenance and translation of effective interventions for the school setting. School health initiatives are often deprioritized because of the pressures schools are under for students to perform well on standardized tests and because of resource constraints (22). Low-cost strategies that require little additional effort from the school\u2019s staff are needed for school-based health programs to be sustainable. The findings of this study indicate that the addition of compa\u00f1eros to an obesity program was an effective strategy among Hispanic adolescents to facilitate sustained reductions in zBMI for a year. Considering the effectiveness compa\u00f1eros demonstrated in this study and the minimal extra resources needed to support them, the compa\u00f1eros model warrants further investigation as a possible strategy for addressing practical concerns schools face when implementing health initiatives.

Since its introduction in 2011, PCD \u2019s   has been a success; each year the journal receives manuscripts prepared by students from around the world, and the number of entries continues to increase. This year, PCD set a record of 72 student submissions. With so many entries, we decided that the only fair way to judge the submissions would be to establish 4 winning categories by level of education: high school, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral. This year\u2019s submissions addressed a range of topics related to the screening, surveillance, and use of population-based approaches to prevent and control chronic diseases and focused on such health conditions as arthritis, asthma, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular health, obesity, depression, and others. Goals of the PCD   \nThere are 5 primary goals of PCD \u2019s  : Provide students with an opportunity to become familiar with a journal\u2019s manuscript submission requirements and peer-review process Assist students to connect their knowledge and training on conducting quality research with a journal\u2019s publication expectations Develop students\u2019 research and scientific writing skills to become producers of knowledge rather than just consumers of knowledge Provide students with an opportunity to become a first author on a peer-reviewed article Promote supportive, respectful, and mutually beneficial student\u2013mentor relationships that strengthen students\u2019 ability to generate and submit scholarly manuscripts throughout their professional career Top Developing Critical Skills in Research and Scholarly Publishing \nConducting sound research and summarizing findings for a scholarly publication requires patience, resilience, sound ethical judgement, and scientific writing skills that meet a journal\u2019s high standards. PCD recognizes that this process can be both an exciting and an anxiety-producing experience for student authors. PCD provides guidance and support through every stage of the publication process to help student authors gain experience and confidence. PCD \u2019s website offers comprehensive guidance to authors in preparing manuscripts for submission, including helpful submission checklists, detailed descriptions of various article types and requirements, and guidelines on structuring abstracts and creating tables and figures from the AMA Manual of Style: A Guide for Authors and Editors, 10th Edition (1). \nThe contest also helps students during the early stages of their academic career in working with colleagues and responding to critique. In preparing their manuscripts, students have an opportunity to work with mentors to explore the public health landscape and identify original ideas that contribute to public health. The peer-review process student manuscripts undergo at PCD allows students to talk about appropriate ways to respond professionally to feedback. Novice authors can be discouraged by negative feedback, but through the peer review and revision process students learn the value of feedback in strengthening their arguments, clarifying their narrative story, and gaining knowledge and insight from peer reviewers who are subject matter experts in their field. \nAnother key aspect of the contest is helping students gain a greater understanding of the ethical parameters of peer-reviewed research, so that they develop good judgement in presenting and interpreting data. Students work with their mentors to better understand what it means to execute sound ethical judgement. PCD encourages and facilitates these conversations by providing guidance from the American Medical Association, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, and the Committee on Publication Ethics on topics such as duplicate publication, definitions of authorship, conflicts of interest, copyright and permissions, institutional review board approval, differences between honest scientific errors and research misconduct, and a detailed understanding of a peer-reviewed journal\u2019s process for responding to allegations of possible misconduct. \nAnd finally, every stage of PCD \u2019s   requires students to take responsibility in responding to deadlines. Students must submit their manuscript to PCD on or before the due date, respond to feedback from peer reviewers and the editor in chief, and work with PCD \u2019s experienced staff of technical editors through all stages of editing and production. Manuscripts may undergo multiple rewrites as students respond to comments and suggestions related to the strengths and weaknesses of their study, statistical tests used, presentation of data in tables and figures, accuracy of data analyses, and implication of the study\u2019s findings on public health research and practice. In advancing through these stages and meeting these deadlines, students develop two of the most critical skills of successful public health professionals: patience and persistence. Top Contest Categories and Stages of Review \nThis year\u2019s winners in the high school, undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral categories should be commended for demonstrating maturity and professionalism throughout this comprehensive and intense manuscript submission and review process. PCD \u2019s student papers progress through 6 stages. First, the editorial office screens entries to determine whether they meet contest requirements. In the second stage, the editor in chief reviews the entries to determine whether they align with the journal\u2019s mission and vision and are of high enough quality to advance to the third stage. In the third stage, members of the PCD editorial board identify which submissions should be considered as potential winners for the various categories. Submissions not advancing as potential winners are assigned to PCD \u2019s standard peer-review process, so that those students still have an opportunity for publication. In the fourth stage, the editorial board conducts a comprehensive review of a few selected manuscripts and provides feedback to the student contestants, who then must address the feedback and submit a revised manuscript. In the fifth stage, the editorial board assesses the revised manuscripts to identify which should be selected as the winner in each category. Editorial board members must provide strong justifications to support their selections to the editor in chief, who makes the final decision. The sixth and final stage is notifying authors of winners. In addition to having an article published, winning authors are featured through a PCD podcast, \u201c PCD Sound Bites,\u201d to discuss key aspects of their research. PCD also mentors winners by providing an opportunity for them to become a reviewer and serve on a selection panel for the next year\u2019s contest. Top 2017 PCD   Winners \nPCD identified 5 winners in the 2017  . Two entries were selected as winners in the doctoral category. In one, Pacheco and colleagues conducted a study that followed a cohort of 673 participants in Chile from infancy to adolescence to understand the association between early obesity and risk of metabolic syndrome in adolescence (2). Researchers found that the age of onset of obesity is a strong risk factor for metabolic syndrome. In the other winning entry, Arlinghaus and colleagues conducted a 6-month obesity program for Hispanic middle school students in Houston, Texas, to determine the feasibility of using high school students as trained peer health mentors called compa\u00f1eros to promote and sustain reductions in body mass index (3). Researchers found that the use of compa\u00f1eros was a promising approach in helping Hispanic children achieve healthier body weight. \nThe winning entry in the graduate category, by Mendoza-Herrera and colleagues, described the development of a diabetic retinopathy screening tool based on a predictive model for use among low-income adults in Mexico (4). Researchers collected biomedical, clinical, anthropometric, and sociodemographic data from 1,000 low-income adults with diabetes. Four risk factors predicted diabetic retinopathy: time since diabetes diagnosis, hyperglycemia, systolic hypertension, and physical inactivity. \nThe winning entry in the undergraduate category, by Smurthwaite and Nasser, explored the geographic convergence of chronic conditions at the neighborhood level (5). The study used a cross-sectional design to estimate the prevalence of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes in western Adelaide, Australia. The authors used Moran\u2019s I method to identify significant clusters of these 3 chronic conditions and observed diverse spatial variation in their prevalence. \nPCD is delighted to have its first winner in the high school category. Liu and colleagues conducted a social marketing campaign that used environmental prompts to influence purchases of fruits and vegetables (6). The social marketing campaign was implemented and evaluated in 17 grocery stores during 4 months in 5 rural counties in Kentucky. By using surveys collected from 240 participants, the authors found that recipe cards influenced participants\u2019 desire to purchase fruits and vegetables. Top Parting Thoughts \nStudents and mentors submitting manuscripts in this year\u2019s   \u2014 regardless of whether their entry was selected as a winner \u2014 should be proud of their efforts. Student authors of manuscripts not accepted for publication in PCD were encouraged to seek consideration elsewhere. PCD has just announced the call for student research papers for its 2018 contest. Please see our Announcements page ( www.cdc.gov/pcd/announcements.htm ) for more information. PCD \u2019s   has proven to be a well-received scientific writing experience. We ask PCD readers to encourage students to consider submitting a manuscript for consideration in next year\u2019s contest.

Examination of local geographic variation in chronic disease patterns can enable policy makers to identify inequalities in health outcomes and tailor effective interventions to communities at higher risk. Our study aimed to determine the geographic variation of obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and type 2 diabetes, using general practice clinical data. Further objectives included identifying regions of significantly high and low clusters of these conditions and assessing their association with sociodemographic characteristics. \nMethods \nA cross-sectional approach was used to determine the prevalence of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes in western Adelaide, Australia. The Getis-Ord Gi* method was used to identify significant hot spots of the conditions. Additionally, we used the Pearson correlation test to determine the association between disease clusters and risk factors, including socioeconomic status (SES), smoking history, and alcohol consumption. \nResults \nThe spatial distribution of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes varied across communities. Hot spots of these conditions converged in 3 locations across western Adelaide. An inverse relationship was observed between area-level prevalence of CVD, obesity, and type 2 diabetes with SES. \nConclusion \nIdentification of significant disease clusters can help policy makers to target prevention strategies at the right people, in the right location. The approach taken in our study can be applied to identify clusters of other chronic diseases across the world, wherever researchers have access to clinical data. Top Introduction \nThe global prevalence of obesity is a major threat to public health because of its steep increase in recent years (1,2). This trend is of international concern, with over 13% of men and 21% of women in the world classified as obese according to their body mass index (BMI) (1). Although the financial burden of high BMI raises concerns about the effectiveness of intervention strategies (3\u20135), increasingly more attention is placed on the role of obesity in the development of other chronic diseases (1). The relationship between obesity, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus is well documented, with high BMI associated with the development of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and insulin resistance (6\u20139). Because obesity is a clear risk factor of chronic disease, questions are raised about whether obese populations have higher rates of CVD and type 2 diabetes. \nThe reported interplay of sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle factors in the development of adulthood obesity supports the notion that high BMI is not randomly distributed within a population (3,10). Therefore, the implementation of intervention programs that target all individuals within a population are limited in their capacity to create change. Intervention strategies need to be tailored to communities where clusters of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes exist. Examination of local geographic variation and the identification of the hot spots is a novel approach to inform policy and practice about inequalities in health outcomes. \nThe primary objective of our study was to determine the geographic variation of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes in an Australian community, using general practice clinical data. Secondary objectives included the identification of regions of significantly high and low clusters of these conditions and the determination of their relationship with sociodemographic characteristics. Top Methods \nA clinical data set of de-identified patient records (n = 84,387) from 2010 through 2014 was acquired from 16 general practices across western Adelaide, South Australia. Obesity was defined as a BMI of 30.0 or higher, as calculated by clinical measurements of an individual\u2019s weight and height (kg/m 2 ). CVD was defined as having at least 1 of the following 5 CVD events: carotid stenosis, chronic heart disease, heart failure (chronic and acute), myocardial infarction, or peripheral vascular disease. Active type 2 diabetes was defined by prior diagnosis from a medical practitioner. The study obtained ethics approval from the Australian National University Human Ethics Committee (protocol 2014/174). \nData analysis was restricted to individuals aged 35 to 74 years. Active patients (individuals who had visited their general practitioner at least 3 times between 2012 and 2014) with complete data on sociodemographic characteristics and geographic information were included in the individual-level analysis (n = 20,594). After exclusion of individuals residing outside of western Adelaide, patients\u2019 medical records were geo-linked to Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Statistical Area Level 1 (SA1) regions (mean, 400 individuals per SA1) (11). Active patients across 490 SA1 regions (n = 17,716; mean, 36 patients per SA1) were included in the population-level analysis. Only SA1 regions with 5 or more patients were included to preserve patient privacy. Descriptive analysis \nMean BMI and frequency of CVD and type 2 diabetes diagnosis were determined for sex, age category, and SES through use of the Stata software (version 14; StataCorp LP). SES was classified into tertiles based on ABS Socioeconomic Indexes for Areas (SEIFA) data, including low socioeconomic, moderate socioeconomic, and high socioeconomic regions (12). Mean BMI and disease frequency was further calculated for each discrete BMI category, including the underweight class (<18.5), normal class (18.5\u201324.9), overweight class (25.0\u201329.9) and obese class (\u226530.0). Additionally, mean BMI and disease frequency was determined for tobacco smoking status, frequency of alcohol consumption, and total cholesterol level. Using definitions from the Metadata Online Registry (13), individuals were classified as having smoked tobacco throughout their life or as not having smoked. Individuals who consumed alcohol at least once in the past year were identified as alcohol consumers and those who had not consumed alcohol in the past year were identified as not alcohol consumers (13). Cholesterol levels were classified as either normal or high: normal cholesterol was defined as less than 5.5 mol/L and high cholesterol was defined 5.5 mol/L or higher (14). For all risk factors, individuals with incomplete records were excluded from the descriptive analysis. The percentage of individuals with CVD and type 2 diabetes in each subpopulation was calculated by direct standardization to allow for within-group and between-group comparisons. The statistical significance of the difference in BMI and disease prevalence between each subpopulation was further calculated using the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. Spatial analysis \nMean BMI and percentage of individuals diagnosed with CVD and type 2 diabetes were aggregated at the SA1 level for western Adelaide. The regional variation was mapped across western Adelaide communities for continuous values of BMI, CVD, and type 2 diabetes diagnosis. Values were categorized into 4 groups using the Jenks natural breaks classification method (separation of data based on naturally occurring groups, determined to be the best arrangement of data) (15). A similar technique was used to map the geospatial variation of SES in western Adelaide, although SA1 regions were instead categorized into 3 groups based on the ABS SEIFA tertiles. \nLocal spatial clusters at the SA1 level with obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes were examined using the Getis-Ord Gi* technique (16,17). This tool compares the local sum of, for example, obesity values (the sum of obesity values of the targeted SA1 area and its neighboring SA1s) to the sum of obesity values of all SA1s within the study area. A significant, positive z score indicates a local high-rate cluster (hot spot). Hot spots are detected when an SA1 with high rates of disease is surrounded by SA1s that also have high rates of disease; the observed local sum of disease is higher than the expected local sum, and the difference is too large to be the result of chance alone. Similarly, a significant, negative z score indicates a local low-rate cluster (cold spot), where an SA1 with low rates is surrounded by SA1s with low rates (16,17). Significant hot spot and cold spot clusters were visualized in the western Adelaide area to highlight communities with high rates and low rates of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes. \nResulting visual representations of the spatial distribution of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes promoted comparison of disease hot spots and cold spots, allowing conclusions to be made about the convergence of the 3 conditions. Pearson correlation statistics were used to determine the global relationship between SES and the 3 conditions, with further comparisons made between the prevalence of CVD and type 2 diabetes. For the spatial analysis, we used ArcGIS software (version 10.4, Esri). Results Descriptive statistics \nThe prevalence of obesity in the sample population was 43.2% ( Table 1 ). Mean BMI across sex, age category, and SES was constant, with total variation at most 1.4 kg/m 2 between high SES and low SES. Men had a significantly higher BMI than women ( P < .001) and increasing age had a significant, positive relationship with increasing BMI ( P < .001). This trend was further seen for CVD and type 2 diabetes diagnosis, with men reporting a significantly higher diagnosis rate than women ( P < .001 for each). CVD prevalence was 3 times higher in men than in women, where 9.1% of men reported at least 1 cardiovascular event throughout their life. Type 2 diabetes diagnosis rates were 3 percentage points higher in men than in women. \nThe prevalence of CVD events and type 2 diabetes also had a significant, positive association with increasing age ( P < .001 for each), with adults aged 65 to 74 years reporting the highest rate of diagnosis. In comparisons between the age groups of 35 to 44 and 65 to 74 years, the prevalence of CVD events among older adults was 40 times higher than that in younger adults, and the occurrence of type 2 diabetes diagnosis was 5 times higher in adults aged 65 to 74 years (Table 1). \nDifferences in disease prevalence related to SES were smaller than those associated with sex and age (Table 1). Individuals with high SES had lower diagnosis rates of CVD or type 2 diabetes than did individuals with a low or moderate SES. This inverse relationship indicates that even individuals with a moderate SES have a lower prevalence of all conditions than those in the lowest tertile. However, differences were only at most 1.4% lower across the sample population for CVD events. \nThe percentage of individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and CVD had a significant, positive association with increasing BMI ( P < .001 for each). Obese individuals had a higher rate of type 2 diabetes (4.4 times higher) and CVD events (2.1 times higher) than those in the normal BMI range ( Table 2 ). \nIndividuals with high total cholesterol levels did not have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes or CVD events than individuals with normal cholesterol levels (Table 2). We found an inverse relationship between cholesterol level and obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes. The highest percentage-point difference was for type 2 diabetes diagnosis, where individuals with normal cholesterol levels had a 10 percentage-point higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than those with high cholesterol levels. However, data on cholesterol level were missing for 1,193 individuals, which may have changed the associations between cholesterol level and disease prevalence. \nIndividuals who reported a history of smoking had a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes or CVD ( P < .001 for each). In contrast to the results on smoking, we found an overall inverse relationship between alcohol consumption and disease occurrence. However, this relationship was not significant for CVD ( P = .50) or type 2 diabetes diagnosis ( P = .62). Although the association was not significant, 67.5% of the total sample population did not have complete reports of their alcohol consumption. This could have changed the relationship between alcohol use and type 2 diabetes and CVD prevalence. Spatial analysis \nThe regional distribution of BMI, CVD diagnosis (%), and type 2 diabetes (%) across western Adelaide indicated that the prevalence of the conditions varied across SA1 regions (Figure 1). Thematic maps (choropleth maps) show that the mean BMI of SA1 regions in western Adelaide was largely skewed toward the obese BMI class. Across the 490 SA1 regions, the lowest and highest reported mean BMIs were 24.0 and 36.0, respectively. The population-level rate of CVD was higher than that of type 2 diabetes. Figure 1. Regional variation of mean body mass index (BMI) (as calculated by clinical measurements of an individual\u2019s weight and height [kg/m 2 ]), cardiovascular disease event (CVD) diagnosis (%), type 2 diabetes diagnosis (%), and socioeconomic status, by Australian Bureau of Statistics Statistical Area Level 1 region, in western Adelaide, South Australia. [A text version of this figure is also available.] \nThe western coastline of western Adelaide has the lowest levels of obesity. This area is similar to the high-SES SA1 regions. We found a significant, inverse correlation between SES and mean BMI (\u22120.278) through Pearson correlation statistics. A similar relationship was shown for SES and CVD (\u22120.126), and SES and type 2 diabetes (\u22120.187). Disease patterns of CVD and type 2 diabetes had a significant, positive relationship (0.224). \nGetis-Ord Gi* calculations determined regions across western Adelaide where the prevalence of mean BMI, CVD, and type 2 diabetes was significantly higher than other regions (Figure 2). We found 48 hot spots for BMI; they were primarily in the northern and eastern regions of western Adelaide. High-BMI cold spots were on the western coastline (Figure 2) and were associated with higher SES SA1 regions (Figure 1). Figure 2. Hot spots and cold spots of mean body mass index (BMI) (as calculated by clinical measurements of an individual\u2019s weight and height [kg/m 2 ]), cardiovascular disease (CVD) event diagnosis (%), and type 2 diabetes diagnosis (%), by Australian Bureau of Statistics Statistical Area Level 1 regions, western Adelaide, South Australia. [A text version of this figure is also available.] \nThe spatial distribution of CVD events and type 2 diabetes also related to northern and central-eastern SA1 regions in western Adelaide. For CVD, 2 hot spots were found in the northern region and 26 hot spots toward the eastern region (Figure 2). For type 2 diabetes, we found a clustering of 32 hot spots in the central-eastern part of the study area. Furthermore, we observed geographical convergence for cold spots of high BMI, CVD, and type 2 diabetes in the southwestern region of western Adelaide (Figure 2), where SES is high (Figure 1). Top Discussion \nThrough combining geospatial analysis and general practice clinical data, our study aimed to determine the spatial variation of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes in western Adelaide communities. Descriptive analysis of the study population revealed a positive association between high BMI and diagnosed CVD and type 2 diabetes. Identification of disease hot spots further showed geographic convergence of the 3 chronic diseases. \nAs supported by data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (18,19), increasing age was positively associated with the increasing proportion of CVD and type 2 diabetes diagnoses. Mapping of mean BMI across demographic characteristics also aligned with trends found in literature (14,20), indicating that the sample used for the analysis was representative of other Australian communities. This is further established in the relationship between physiologic and lifestyle risk factors determined throughout the individual-level study, where increased BMI was associated with higher disease prevalence. \nTo date, population health researchers in Australia have not investigated the geographic variation of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes at the neighborhood level. However, a study by Paquet et al (21) determined the clustering of biological risk factors related to the development of cardiometabolic diseases. The research emphasized the importance of using medical data collected by trained clinicians in determining the geographic spread of cardiometabolic outcomes and further outlined how clustering differs in relation to the geographic level analyzed (21). The level of spatial analysis completed by Paquet et al (21) was limited relative to our study. The intra-class correlation analysis was insufficient to determine the geographic hot spots and cold spots of cardiometabolic outcomes, investigating only the difference in the level of clustering of the risk factors (21). Thus, our study responds to a gap in the research of the spatial distribution of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes across communities in Australia. \nThe overall aims of our study related to the population level and centered on using methods that would result in information that could be used to guide health policy and program implementation in the community. We found obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes hot spots in the northern and central-eastern SA1 regions. These hot spots could be a priority for policy interventions. Because these hot spots were further associated with populations of a low SES, there are further implications for the equality of health care access in the western Adelaide community. The problem of health care disparities may need to be more effectively monitored through longitudinal surveillance and related health care policies. \nOur study has limitations. Use of clinical data is favored by Australian guidelines in assessing the prevalence of diseases in communities (20). Despite this, selection of study participants from local general practice records creates questions of bias. Although Australian data indicate that 85% of individuals visit their local general practitioner annually (22), the generalizability of our study is limited because individuals who visit their doctor are those who are sick and require medical attention. This selection bias may account for the larger prevalence of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes shown in our study, in comparison to findings reported by the ABS (14). A further limitation in the generalizability of our study is its cross-sectional design. Because the analysis did not longitudinally follow participants, if individuals move to a different location, the identified disease hot spots and cold spots may not continue to represent the frequency of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes in the SA1 regions. \nIn line with emerging recommendations from the World Health Organization, waist circumference, in addition to BMI, should be used to diagnose obesity in individuals (23). Therefore, we could improve our study approach by changing how we measure obesity. Because waist circumference measurements were not accurately reported in the general practice data used for our study, we could not use these data. Areas of future research could also include a qualitative study to determine the sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle risk factors related to obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes. Through use of the South Australian Monitoring and Surveillance System (24), our approach could be extended to analyze the differences between identified hot spots and cold spots within the community, providing further evidence for changes to government policies and programs. In addition, a quantitative investigation into the access and use of primary care in western Adelaide could be developed to determine the effect of health care disparities on the spatial distribution of obesity, CVD, and type 2 diabetes. Further analysis of community disease profiles at the small-area level would allow more conclusions to be made about the most effective aspects of prevention and intervention programs and could be seen as an improvement to the new approach presented here. \nCombining geospatial analysis and general practice data allows researchers and policy makers to identify chronic disease profiles at both the individual and community levels. This method of analysis further applies to the general practice level, where health care professionals in disease hot spots can increase the use of screening measures and related health education. Recognition of individuals and communities that require this increased surveillance would encourage the implementation of primary and secondary prevention techniques in general practices and related health services.

National goals include 85% linkage to care, 90% retention in care, and 80% viral load suppression by 2020. \nWhat is added by this report? \nIn 2015, 58.1% of HIV infections among Hispanics or Latinos aged \u226513 years with diagnosed HIV infection in 38 jurisdictions with complete laboratory reporting were diagnosed at an earlier stage (stage 1 or 2) and another 18.8% at an unknown stage; 75.4% were linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis. Among Hispanics or Latinos living with diagnosed HIV infection at year-end 2014, 70.2% received care, 58.3% were retained in care, and 58.2% were virally suppressed. The lowest levels of care and viral suppression were among males with infection attributed to injection drug use, and the highest levels of care and viral suppression were among heterosexual females. Hispanics or Latinos in the four age groups \u226525 years had similar percentages of retention and viral suppression. Those aged 13\u201324 years had the highest retention in care among all age groups (60.5%), but had the lowest overall viral suppression (54.6%). \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nIncreasing the proportion of Hispanics or Latinos living with HIV infection who are receiving care and treatment will help to achieve the national goals to reduce new infections, improve health outcomes, and decrease health disparities. Among Hispanics or Latinos, targeted strategies for different groups, such as persons who inject drugs, might be needed to achieve improvements in linkage, care, and viral suppression. \nData from CDC\u2019s National HIV Surveillance System (NHSS)* are used to monitor progress toward achieving national goals set forth in the Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention\u2019s Strategic Plan ( 1 ) and other federal directives \u2020 for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing, care, and treatment outcomes and HIV-related disparities in the United States. Recent data indicate that Hispanics or Latinos \u00a7 are disproportionately affected by HIV infection. Hispanics or Latinos living with diagnosed HIV infection have lower levels of care and viral suppression than do non-Hispanic whites but higher levels than those reported among blacks or African Americans ( 2 ). The annual rate of diagnosis of HIV infection among Hispanics or Latinos is three times that of non-Hispanic whites ( 3 ), and a recent study found increases in incidence of HIV infection among Hispanic or Latino men who have sex with men ( 4 ). Among persons with HIV infection diagnosed through 2013 who were alive at year-end 2014, 70.2% of Hispanics or Latinos received any HIV medical care compared with 76.1% of non-Hispanic whites ( 2 ). CDC used NHSS data to describe HIV care outcomes among Hispanics or Latinos. Among male Hispanics or Latinos with HIV infection diagnosed in 2015, fewer males with infection attributed to heterosexual contact (34.6%) had their infection diagnosed at an early stage (stage 1 = 12.0%, stage 2 = 22.6%) than males with infection attributed to male-to-male sexual contact (60.9%: stage 1 = 25.2%, stage 2 = 35.7%). The percentage of Hispanics or Latinos linked to care after diagnosis of HIV infection increased with increasing age; females aged 45\u201354 years with infection attributed to injection drug use (IDU) accounted for the lowest percentage (61.4%) of persons linked to care. Among Hispanics or Latinos living with HIV infection, care and viral suppression were lower among selected age groups of Hispanic or Latino males with HIV infection attributed to IDU than among males with infection attributed to male-to-male sexual contact and male-to-male sexual contact and IDU. Intensified efforts to develop and implement effective interventions and public health strategies that increase engagement in care and viral suppression among Hispanics or Latinos ( 3 , 5 ), particularly those who inject drugs, are needed to achieve national HIV prevention goals. \nAll states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories report cases of HIV infection and associated demographic and clinical information to NHSS. CDC analyzed data for persons aged \u226513 years reported through December 2016 from 38 jurisdictions \u00b6 with complete laboratory reporting.** These jurisdictions accounted for 75.2% of Hispanics or Latinos aged \u226513 years living with diagnosed HIV infection at year-end 2014 in the United States. Stage of disease at diagnosis and linkage to care were assessed among Hispanics or Latinos living in any of the 38 jurisdictions at the time of diagnosis of HIV infection in 2015. For persons who received a diagnosis of HIV infection during 2015, linkage to HIV care within 1 month of diagnosis was measured by documentation of one or more CD4 (cell count or percentage) or viral load tests performed \u22641 month after diagnosis of HIV infection, including tests performed on the date of diagnosis. Receipt of any HIV care, defined as having one or more CD4 or viral load tests during 2014, retention in care, defined as having two or more CD4 or viral load tests \u22653 months apart, and viral suppression, defined as a viral load of <200 HIV RNA copies/mL at most recent test ( 6 ) were assessed among Hispanics or Latinos with HIV infection diagnosed by December 31, 2013, and who were alive and resided (based on the most recent known address) in any of the 38 jurisdictions as of December 31, 2014 (i.e., persons living with diagnosed HIV infection). Data were statistically adjusted by using multiple imputation techniques to account for missing HIV transmission categories ( 3 ). \nIn the 38 jurisdictions, 6,707 Hispanics or Latinos received a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2015 ( Table 1 ). Among these persons, 24.5% had infection classified as stage 1 at diagnosis, 33.6% as stage 2, and 23.1% as stage 3 (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]); for 18.8% the stage was unknown ( 6 ). Among both males and females, the highest percentage of infections were diagnosed at an earlier stage (stage 1 [24.5%] or stage 2 [33.6%]). By age group, the highest percentage of Hispanics or Latinos whose infection was diagnosed at stage 1 or stage 2 was reported in persons aged 13\u201324 years (stage 1, 30.8%; stage 2, 41.1%), followed by persons aged 25\u201334 years (stage 1, 24.3%; stage 2, 36.8%). In general, the percentages of early diagnosis decreased as age increased; among persons aged \u226555 years, 40.1% of infections were diagnosed at stage 3 (Table 1). By transmission category, the highest percentages of Hispanics or Latinos with infection diagnosed at an earlier stage of HIV disease were among females with infection attributed to heterosexual contact (stage 1, 27.2%; stage 2, 29.2%). Males with infection attributed to heterosexual contact accounted for the lowest percentages of early diagnoses (stage 1, 12.0%; stage 2, 22.6%). \nOverall, 5,059 (75.4%) of the 6,707 Hispanics or Latinos with HIV infection diagnosed during 2015 were linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis; the percentage of persons linked to care increased with increasing age ( Table 2 ). By transmission category and age group, males aged \u226555 years with infection attributed to heterosexual contact accounted for the highest percentage of persons linked to care (88.0%), whereas females aged 45\u201354 years with infection attributed to IDU accounted for the lowest percentage (61.4%). \nAmong 141,929 Hispanics or Latinos aged \u226513 years living with diagnosed HIV infection in 38 jurisdictions in 2015, 70.2% received care, and 58.3% were retained in care ( Table 3 ), with males having lower receipt of care (69.0%) and retention in care (57.1%) than females (74.6% and 63.0%, respectively). By transmission category and age group, males aged 25\u201334 years with infection attributed to IDU accounted for the lowest percentages of persons who received (55.7%) and were retained (44.8%) in care. At the most recent test, 58.2% of Hispanics or Latinos had suppressed viral load (Table 3); a higher percentage of females had suppressed viral load (59.7%) than did males (57.8%). Among all age groups, the lowest level of viral load suppression was among persons aged 13\u201324 years (54.6%); viral load suppression increased with increasing age. Males aged 25\u201334 years and 35\u201344 years with infection attributed to IDU had the lowest levels of viral suppression (38.9% and 43.1%, respectively). Top Discussion \nIn 2015, among Hispanics or Latinos aged \u226513 years with diagnosed HIV infection in 38 jurisdictions with complete laboratory reporting, 58.1% of infections were diagnosed at an earlier stage (stage 1 or 2) and another 18.8% at an unknown stage; overall, 75.4% were linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis. Among all Hispanics or Latinos aged \u226513 years living with diagnosed HIV infection at year-end 2014 in these jurisdictions, 58.3% were retained in care, and 58.2% had suppressed viral load. By comparison, the national goals are 85% linkage to care, 90% retention in care, and 80% viral load suppression ( 1 ), and the percentages among non-Hispanic whites were 79.9%, 58.5%, and 65.0%, respectively ( 3 ). Improving health outcomes for Hispanics or Latinos living with HIV infection is necessary to reduce HIV transmission in the United States. Prompt linkage to care after diagnosis allows early initiation of HIV treatment, which is associated with reduced morbidity, mortality, and transmission of HIV infection ( 7 ). \nConsistent with findings from a previous report on the continuum of HIV care among Hispanics or Latinos with diagnosed HIV infection based on data from 19 jurisdictions, linkage to care was similar for both males and females, retention in care followed a similar pattern across age groups, and males had lower levels of viral suppression than did females ( 8 ). The lowest levels of care and viral suppression among Hispanics or Latinos with HIV infection in these 38 jurisdictions were among males with infection attributed to IDU, and the highest levels of care and viral suppression were among heterosexual females. Hispanics or Latinos in the four age groups \u226525 years had similar percentages of retention in care and viral suppression. Those aged 13\u201324 years had the highest retention in care among all age groups (60.5%) and the lowest viral suppression (54.6%); the reasons for this are not known. Hispanics or Latinos with HIV infection might not seek, receive, or adhere to HIV care or treatment regimens for various reasons, including lack of health insurance, language barriers, and migration patterns ( 9 ). HIV programs that focus on care and treatment for Hispanics or Latinos might consider strengthening efforts to link to and retain in care persons with HIV infection and to promote adherence to medication to achieve optimal health outcomes. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, analyses were limited to 38 jurisdictions with complete laboratory reporting of all levels of CD4 and viral load test results; these 38 jurisdictions might not be representative of all Hispanics or Latinos living with diagnosed HIV infection in the United States. Second, comparisons of numbers and percentages by sex, transmission category, and age group should be interpreted with caution because groups vary in size and some have small, unstable numbers. Reported numbers smaller than 12 and their accompanying percentages also should be interpreted with caution. \nIncreasing the proportion of Hispanics or Latinos living with HIV infection who receive optimal HIV care will help achieve the national goal of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in HIV care outcomes. Through partnerships with federal, state, and local health agencies, CDC is pursuing a high-impact prevention approach to maximize the effectiveness of current HIV prevention and care methods ( 10 ). CDC supports projects focused on Hispanics or Latinos to optimize outcomes along the HIV care continuum, such as HIV testing (the first essential step for entry into the continuum of care) and projects that support linkage to, retention in, and return to care for all persons with HIV infection. \u2020\u2020 Among Hispanics or Latinos, targeting strategies to groups that bear a disproportionate burden of HIV disease (e.g., persons who inject drugs) could lead to reductions in HIV infections and health inequities and help achieve the national goal of 80% of all persons living with HIV infection having a suppressed viral load.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T10:17:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e057ec05db718b55e4c75df9ac5880a16c6bc43f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5fuYWao3k44KR3ZENkCtRNiYh25WmV.E6cerEP74imsPSJCCMUXgnpXk3BOjjy7bt28vo3a74hbGm1fD538vVsavNAL_I2AY5u96jqacJe70fwHkUy9DxUxyGOieFxdzrw--", "site_full": "blogs.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=479", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Your Environment and Your Health", "title": "Protecting Kids from Environmental Exposure", "title_full": "Protecting Kids from Environmental Exposure", "published": "2017-10-12T19:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e057ec05db718b55e4c75df9ac5880a16c6bc43f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5fuYWao3k44KR3ZENkCtRNiYh25WmV.E6cerEP74imsPSJCCMUXgnpXk3BOjjy7bt28vo3a74hbGm1fD538vVsavNAL_I2AY5u96jqacJe70fwHkUy9DxUxyGOieFxdzrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T19:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Protecting Kids from Environmental Exposure", "text": "Protecting Kids from Environmental Exposure Posted on Share Compartir \nChildren\u2019s rapid development from before they are born through early childhood makes them more vulnerable to environmental exposures.

They crawl and play on the floor or in the yard where they can come into contact with harmful substances\u2014and they put everything in their mouths. \nJust their physical size puts children at greater risk of exposure. From birth, children breathe more air, drink more water, and eat more food per pound of body weight than adults. An infant\u2019s breathing rate is more than twice of an adult\u2019s. \nChildren continue to be vulnerable as they go through the developmental changes of puberty. \nIn 2008, the U.S. economic cost for children\u2019s environmental exposures was estimated at $76.6 billion.1 But has your child\u2019s pediatrician ever talked to you about environmental exposures? Has your obstetrician ever taken an environmental history? Doctors Uncomfortable Discussing Environmental Health \nTaking an environmental history is essential for healthcare providers to understand patients\u2019 exposure risks and help reduce them, but most physicians and other healthcare providers are not taught the importance of an exposure history during their medical education. For example, responses to a survey of members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2014 reported that:2 Only 1 in 15 physicians have received training on environmental exposures. Half of the respondents rarely take an environmental health history. Less than 20% counsel patients about environmental exposures common in pregnant women in the United States. \nHowever, 78% of respondents did agree that counseling patients about environmental health hazards could prevent exposures. \nProtecting a pregnant woman from environmental exposures also protects the unborn child. \nDoctors who don\u2019t counsel their patients reported that they did not know enough about environmental exposures and were uncertain about evidence. They were also concerned that patients would be unable to reduce their exposure or that counseling would alarm them. \nAnother survey in 2015 was sent to pediatric blood and cancer specialists. Most of them indicated that families of children with cancer asked about environmental connections to their children\u2019s illnesses, but the doctors were uncomfortable discussing the topic. Over 77% suspected that their cases did have an environmental origin, but their methods of taking environmental histories varied widely.3 \nThe results of both these surveys indicate the need for increased physician education on the relationship between environmental exposures and health effects\u2014in medical school, during residencies, and after beginning practice.

This year\u2019s theme, It takes a team of superheroes to defeat HIV , encourages partners across the nation to work together with determination and strength to prevent HIV among Hispanics/Latinos and to help those living with HIV stay healthy. \nHIV continues to be a serious health threat to the Hispanic/Latino community. Though HIV diagnoses among Hispanic/Latina women declined 16% from 2010 to 2014, diagnoses increased 2% among all Hispanics/Latinos, driven by a 13% increase among Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual men. By the end of 2014, an estimated 235,600 Hispanics/Latinos were living with HIV in the United States. Among Hispanics/Latinos who had received an HIV diagnosis, 70% had received care and 58% were virally suppressed. \nA recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ), \u201c HIV Care Outcomes Among Hispanics/Latinos with Diagnosed HIV\u2014United States, 2015 ,\u201d suggests that targeted strategies might be needed for different subgroups to achieve improvements in linkage to care, retention in care, and viral suppression among Hispanics/Latinos. CDC encourages public and private stakeholders to strengthen interventions that can improve care outcomes for Hispanics/Latinos living with HIV. In addition, partners such as health departments, community-based organizations (CBOs), and others can extend the reach of their HIV prevention and testing services that focus on Hispanic/Latino gay and bisexual men. More of these services can help address the increase in HIV infections among this population. Learn more about how CDC can support your prevention programs . \nCDC is committed to reducing new HIV infections among the Hispanic/Latinos and improving the health and well-being of those who are living with HIV. For example: Under the current cooperative agreement (PS12-1201), CDC awarded health departments at least $330 million each year for directing resources to populations, including Hispanics/Latinos, and geographic areas of greatest need. In 2017, CDC awarded nearly $11 million per year for 5 years to 30 CBOs to provide HIV testing and other prevention strategies to young gay and bisexual men of color and transgender youth of color. Under the Capacity Building Assistance for High-Impact HIV Prevention program, a national program that addresses gaps in the HIV continuum of care, CDC is providing training and technical assistance for health departments and other organizations. CDC is working to increase the availability, access, and uptake of biomedical approaches to HIV prevention such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Under Act Against AIDS , an initiative that raises awareness about HIV prevention through campaigns and partnerships, CDC is disseminating campaigns and engaging in partnership activities that include Hispanics/Latinos. For example, Let\u2019s Stop HIV Together is a campaign that raises awareness about HIV and its impact on the lives of all Americans, and fights stigma by showing that persons living with HIV are real people. Doing It , a national bilingual testing and prevention campaign, encourages all adults to know their HIV status and make HIV testing a part of their regular health routine. HIV Treatment Works shows how people living with HIV have overcome barriers to stay in care and provides resources on how to live well with HIV. Start Talking. Stop HIV. helps gay and bisexual men communicate about safer sex, testing, and other HIV prevention issues. Partnering and Communicating Together (PACT) to Act Against AIDS is a partnership with organizations such as the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Hispanic Medical Association to raise HIV awareness among populations disproportionately affected by HIV, including Hispanic/Latino communities. \nThank you for working with us to implement powerful prevention strategies that give Hispanics/Latinos the tools to defeat HIV. We look forward to continuing this collaboration and making greater progress in reducing HIV infections, improving health outcomes, and reducing health disparities in HIV care among all Hispanics/Latinos.

Many of these hazards originate from interactions with the environment. For example, children may be exposed to harmful chemicals in the air they breathe, the water they drink, or soil they touch or swallow. Because children are still growing and developing, they are uniquely susceptible to health threats from environmental exposures. These early exposures can trigger diseases and disrupt development, learning, and behavior. \nAs our scientific understanding of children\u2019s environmental health issues continues to evolve, so do the policies and practices in place to protect children\u2019s health. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) are working to prevent and control harmful environmental exposures that affect children. We are dedicated to protecting America\u2019s health. \nProtecting communities from hazardous waste exposures is one of ATSDR\u2019s key functions. National and state programs exist to ensure safe siting for school age children. Young children are even more susceptible to harmful environmental exposures, but less attention has been paid to the placement of early care and education (ECE) programs. Through our work in communities across the United States, we have seen how the location of an ECE program can affect the health of the children it serves. In the past decade, ATSDR\u2019s public health assessment and health consultation activities have evaluated and provided recommendations at dozens of sites where concerns existed about potential environmental hazard exposures for children attending an ECE program. We have applied lessons learned from this site work to develop Choose Safe Places for Early Care and Education (CSPECE) Guidance Manual. This manual is a resource to help you keep children in your community safe and healthy in the environments where they grow, learn, and play. \nThis manual is the result of many people\u2019s efforts.

MPHIA has provided detailed information on the current status of the HIV epidemic and the uptake of HIV prevention, care, and treatment services in Malawi. CDC-Malawi team \nIn his remarks during the MPHIA National Launch, Dr. Peter Kumpalume, the former Malawi Minister of Health, highlighted the importance of quality population-based data in supporting the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets as reflected in the Malawi National Strategic Plan. The findings from MPHIA, were released on World AIDS Day, December 1, 2016, by the First Lady of Malawi Gertrude Mutharika. \nMPHIA results show commendable progress towards achieving the 90-90-90 goals, with estimates at 73-90-91. However, the 1 st 90 of ensuring individuals know their HIV status remains a challenge. MPHIA data revealed that Malawi has done well in providing HIV services to women more than 30 years of age but was lagging behind in young women and in men. The data also showed that most areas of highest HIV prevalence were on track to reach 90-90-90 except for a few urban areas and areas with low HIV prevalence. Through MPHIA, it was also demonstrated that once people know their HIV status, 90% of them initiate antiretroviral therapy and are able to suppress the virus. \nMPHIA data have been used to identify program gaps in specific geographic areas and subpopulations and has also served to triangulate existing data and estimates. The MPHIA data were used to update estimates of HIV prevalence and people living with HIV at regional and district levels using small-area estimation and Spectrum models. In addition, MPHIA was the first national survey to directly measure HIV prevalence among children; previously, modeled estimates of children living with HIV were used for program planning. \nMPHIA results have also been used in high-level strategic planning such as the national Global Fund application. The data were foundational to PEPFAR Malawi Country Operational Plan (COP17) planning, as they were used to inform where to scale up HIV testing and ART programs, who to reach by age and sex, and how to reach them efficiently. \nThese data have therefore guided PEPFAR and the national program in putting more emphasis on reaching the first 90 with intensified case finding in men and adolescents and in specific geographic locations. PEPFAR partners have also been asked to report age and gender disaggregated data to ensure that the right subpopulations and geographic locations are being targeted in PEPFAR programs. As Malawi moves toward HIV epidemic control, MPHIA and subsequent analyses have allowed Malawi to practice precision public health to reach those individuals most in need of HIV testing and clinical care.

The median exemption level remained low (2.0%) but exemption rates varied by state. The median proportion of kindergartners under a grace period or provisional enrollment was 2.0%, the same as in 2015\u201316. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nVaccination coverage might vary at the local level. School assessment allows immunization programs to focus on schools with lower vaccination coverage and higher exemption levels, allowing schools to follow up with undervaccinated students to help ensure kindergartners are protected from vaccine preventable diseases. \nState and local school vaccination requirements help protect students and communities against vaccine-preventable diseases ( 1 ). CDC reports vaccination coverage and exemption data for children attending kindergarten (kindergartners) collected by federally funded immunization programs in the United States.* The typical age range for kindergartners is 4\u20136 years. Although vaccination requirements vary by state (the District of Columbia [DC] is counted as a state in this report.), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that children in this age range have received, among other vaccinations, 5 doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP), 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR), and 2 doses of varicella vaccine ( 2 ). This report summarizes 2016\u201317 school year MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccination coverage reported by immunization programs in 49 states, exemptions in 50 states, and kindergartners provisionally enrolled or within a grace period in 27 states. Median vaccination coverage \u2020 was 94.5% for the state-required number of doses of DTaP; 94.0% for 2 doses of MMR; and 93.8% for 2 doses of varicella vaccine. The median percentage of kindergartners with an exemption from at least one vaccine \u00a7 was 2.0%, similar to 2015\u201316 (1.9%). Median grace period and provisional enrollment was 2.0%. Vaccination coverage remains consistently high and exemptions low at state and national levels. Local-level vaccination coverage data provide opportunities for immunization programs to identify schools, districts, counties, or regions susceptible to vaccine-preventable diseases and for schools to address undervaccination through implementation of existing state and local vaccination policies ( 1 ) to protect communities through increased coverage. \nFederally funded immunization programs partner with departments of education and school nurses and other school personnel to assess vaccination coverage and exemption status of children enrolled in public and private kindergartens. \u00b6 In accordance with state and local school entry requirements, parents and guardians submit their children\u2019s vaccination records or exemption forms to schools, or schools obtain kindergartners\u2019 records from their states\u2019 immunization information systems. During the 2016\u201317 school year, 49 states reported data on coverage for all state-required vaccines among public and private school kindergartners, 50 states reported exemption data on public school kindergartners, and 49 states reported exemption data on private school kindergartners. Seven states reported coverage and exemption data for at least some homeschooled kindergartners.** Twenty-seven states reported data on kindergartners who, at the time of the assessment, were attending school under a grace period (a set number of days during which a student can be enrolled and attend school without proof of complete vaccination or exemption) or provisional enrollment (a provision that allows a student without complete vaccination or exemption to attend school while completing a catch-up vaccination schedule). \nDuring the 2016\u201317 school year, vaccination assessments varied by immunization program because of differences in state requirements regarding required vaccinations and number of doses required, vaccines assessed, school assessment, data reported, and available resources. Among the 50 states reporting data, 35 used a census to collect kindergarten vaccination data; nine used a sample; four used a voluntary school response; and two used a mix of sampling methods. \u2020\u2020 States used the same methods to collect both vaccination coverage and exemption data, except in Alaska, Kansas, Virginia, and Wisconsin, where a sample was used to collect vaccination coverage data and a census to collect exemption data. Five states (Delaware, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, and South Carolina) used a sample for both vaccination coverage and exemption data. Kindergartners were considered up-to-date and included in the coverage estimate for a given vaccine if they received all doses required for school entry, \u00a7\u00a7 except in seven states \u00b6\u00b6 that considered kindergartners up-to-date only if they had received all doses of all vaccines required for school entry in those states. Kindergartners with a history of varicella disease were reported as either vaccinated against varicella or medically exempt, varying by immunization program. Medical exemptions were issued by a health care provider; all other exemptions (i.e., religious and philosophical) were nonmedical. \nThis report presents vaccination coverage for MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccines. Coverage for these vaccines and hepatitis B and poliovirus vaccines that are required in most states is presented on SchoolVaxView ( 3 ). Vaccination coverage and exemption estimates were adjusted based on survey type and response rates.*** Medians and ranges of state MMR vaccination coverage and of exemption rates collected from the 2011\u201312 school year through the 2016\u201317 school year were examined over time. During the 2016\u201317 school year, vaccination coverage data were reported for approximately 3,973,172 kindergartners, exemption data for approximately 3,666,870, and grace period and provisional enrollment data for approximately 2,463,131. \u2020\u2020\u2020 \nSince the 2011\u201312 school year, median kindergarten MMR vaccination coverage has remained near 95% and median exemption rates have remained \u22642% ( Figure ). Among the 49 states included in this analysis, median MMR coverage was 94.0% (range = 85.6% [DC] to 99.4% [Mississippi]); 20 states reported coverage \u226595%; and six states (Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, and DC) reported coverage <90% ( Table 1 ). Among the 48 states that required and reported DTaP vaccination, median coverage was 94.5% (range = 82.2% [DC] to 99.6% [Maryland]); 23 states reported coverage \u226595% and six states (Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, and DC) reported coverage <90%. Among the 42 states that required and reported 2 doses of varicella vaccine, median coverage was 93.8% (range = 84.6% [DC] to 99.4% [Mississippi]); 15 states reported coverage \u226595%, and seven states (Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Washington, and DC) reported coverage <90%. Thirty states \u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 published 2015\u201316 or 2016\u201317 local-level data (county, parish, school district, school, or other level) online for vaccination coverage, exemptions, or both (Table 1). \nThe median percentage of kindergartners with an exemption from one or more required vaccines (not limited to MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccines) among the 46 states reporting this information was 2.0% (range = 0.1% [Mississippi] to 6.8% [Alaska]), similar to the median of 1.9% reported for this group during the 2015\u201316 school year ( Table 2 ). The percentage of kindergartners with any exemption was <1% in four states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and West Virginia), and \u22654% in nine states (Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Maine, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin). From the 2015\u201316 to the 2016\u201317 school year, the exemption rate decreased by >1.0 percentage points in two states (California and Vermont) and increased by >0.5 percentage points in seven states (Alaska, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, and Wisconsin). Among states that reported exemptions by type, the median percentage of medical exemptions was 0.2% (range = <0.1% in two states [Delaware and New Mexico] to 1.5% [Alaska]), and the median percentage of nonmedical exemptions was 1.8% (range = 0.5% [DC] to 6.5% [Oregon]). \nTwenty-seven states \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 reported data on grace period or provisional enrollment for the 2016\u201317 school year. The median reported percentage of kindergartners attending school during a grace period or provisional enrollment was 2.0% (range = 0.2% [Georgia] to 8.1% [Pennsylvania]) (Table 2). In 12 of 27 states reporting for the 2016\u201317 school year, the percentage of children provisionally enrolled or within a grace period at the time of the assessment exceeded the percentage of children with exemptions from one or more vaccines. Top Discussion \nDuring the 2016\u201317 school year, kindergarten vaccination coverage for MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccine each approached 95%, and the median exemption rate among children attending kindergarten was 2%; these rates have been relatively consistent since the 2011\u201312 school year. The median percentage of kindergartners attending school under a grace period or provisional enrollment was 2.0%. Although vaccination rates have remained high and stable, four states have reported coverage <90% for at least one vaccine for at least 6 consecutive years ( 3 ). In addition, coverage can vary within states, and clusters of undervaccinated kindergartners can exist in states with high overall rates. \nFour states (California, New York, North Dakota, and Tennessee) reported increases in coverage of \u22651.5 percentage points for all reported vaccines ( 3 ); these increases might have resulted from programmatic measures to address undervaccination and incomplete documentation of vaccination during the 2016\u201317 school year. California eliminated new nonmedical exemptions for kindergartners attending public or private school ( 4 , 5 ) and continued to educate school staff members on criteria for provisional enrollment, thus reducing provisional enrollment from 4.4% to 1.9% ( 6 ). New York conducted webinars to train school staff members on vaccination requirements, exemptions, and exclusion policies; coverage increased by >1.5 percentage points for all reported vaccines in 2016\u201317 (Assessment Branch, Immunization Services Division, CDC, unpublished data, 2017). In North Dakota, school superintendents were educated about the importance of immunizations and their mandated role in enforcement of requirements ( 7 ), which prompted most school districts in the state to begin strict enforcement of school vaccination requirements, leading to increases in coverage of >3 percentage points for MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccine in 2016\u201317. In Tennessee, the immunization program worked to increase the proportion of public school kindergartners who were completely up to date in the state\u2019s immunization information systems and to improve schools\u2019 capacity to correctly assess student vaccination status; MMR, DTaP, and varicella vaccination coverage increased >3 percentage points in Tennessee in 2016\u201317 (Assessment Branch, Immunization Services Division, CDC, unpublished data, 2017). \nIn 12 of 27 states reporting for the 2016\u201317 school year, the percentage of children provisionally enrolled or within a grace period at the time of the assessment exceeded the percentage of children with exemptions for one or more vaccines, indicating that children who do not have exemptions are not receiving their childhood immunizations in a timely fashion. The median percentage of children provisionally enrolled or within a grace period for the 2016\u201317 school year was 2.0%, which is the same as for the 2015\u201316 school year. Pennsylvania\u2019s estimated grace period and provisional enrollment prevalence increased from 5.1% to 8.1%, probably because the assessment date changed from March 31 in the 2015\u201316 school year to December 31 in the 2016\u201317 school year, giving students enrolled under the grace period less time to complete required vaccination and documentation (Assessment Branch, Immunization Services Division, CDC, unpublished data, 2017). CDC encourages programs to collect and use these data to identify areas with high rates of provisional or grace period enrollment, where increasing coverage through a targeted intervention might be possible. \nThe number of states sharing local-level school vaccination coverage increased from 25 to 30 ( 8 ) . The online sharing of local-level data with the public contributes to transparency in public health by placing information about the risk for vaccine preventable diseases in the hands of parents and communities. The type of data published (exemptions, vaccine-specific coverage, complete vaccination, compliance with documentation requirements, and other information) varies across states, as does the geographic level of detail (school, school district, county, region of the state, or other geographic or administrative area), and the method of displaying the data (table, chart, map, or other format). \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations, which have been reported previously ( 8 ). First, comparability is limited because of variations in states\u2019 requirements, data collection methods, and definitions of grace period and provisional enrollment. Second, representativeness might be negatively affected because of data collection methodologies that miss some schools or students or assess vaccination status at different times. Collecting vaccination and exemption data from a validated census of schools and students can improve comparability and representativeness of the data, and therefore, census data are the most programmatically useful. The majority of immunization programs do use a census to collect vaccination and exemption data. Third, actual vaccination coverage, exemption estimates, or both might be under- or overestimated because of improper or absent documentation. Finally, median coverage estimates include only 48 of 50 states and DC, median exemptions estimates include only 45 of 50 states and DC, and the median grace period or provisional enrollment estimate includes only 27 states for the 2016\u201317 school year. \nKindergarten vaccination requirements provide an opportunity for children to be fully vaccinated with recommended age-appropriate vaccines and to catch up on any missed early childhood vaccinations. CDC works with immunization programs to monitor kindergarten vaccination coverage, improve data quality, and promote data use for effective program planning. Based on state-level kindergarten vaccination data reported to CDC, median vaccination coverage was consistently high and median exemption rates were consistently low. However, clusters of low vaccination coverage continue to serve as opportunities for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases ( 9 ). Because vaccination coverage and exemption levels are clustered locally, availability of local-level vaccination data can help immunization programs identify schools that might be vulnerable in an outbreak. CDC is working with programs to improve collection and use of grace period and provisional enrollment data to understand contributing factors for reported undervaccination and identify programmatic actions that might increase vaccination coverage among kindergartners.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mmr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assessment branch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advisory committee on immunization practices", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immunization services division", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north dakota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "district of columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new hampshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idaho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dc", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-15T03:31:50.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57a0d438f7f2411bc10bae68b7451d182e0d96e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvRDnlUAWNMwFiyPdYYLuLD0-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=5", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)", "title": "Notes from the Field: Multiple Cases of Seoul Virus Infection in a Household with Infected Pet Rats \u2014 Tennessee, December 2016\u2013April 2017", "title_full": "Notes from the Field: Multiple Cases of Seoul Virus Infection in a Household with Infected Pet Rats \u2014 Tennessee, December 2016\u2013April 2017", "published": "2017-10-12T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/mm6640a4_Multiple_Seoul_Virus_Infection_Pet_Rats.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57a0d438f7f2411bc10bae68b7451d182e0d96e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvRDnlUAWNMwFiyPdYYLuLD0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Notes from the Field: Multiple Cases of Seoul Virus Infection in a Household with Infected Pet Rats \u2014 Tennessee, December 2016\u2013April 2017", "text": "Metric Details \nMary-Margaret A.

Approximately 1 week later, she was evaluated by her local physician and received a diagnosis of an unspecified viral illness. Laboratory testing at that time was notable only for an elevated creatinine level (1.27 mg/dL; normal = 0.60\u20131.10 mg/dL). She recovered from her illness without treatment or complications. \nIn January 2017, an outbreak of Seoul virus infection was identified among rat breeders and owners in Wisconsin and Illinois. CDC assisted Illinois and Wisconsin health officials in performing tracing of potentially infected or exposed rats, and in late January 2017, the Tennessee Department of Health was notified that pet rats owned by patient A were linked to confirmed Seoul virus\u2013infected rats. On February 14, 2017, a follow-up specimen of patient A\u2019s blood tested positive for Seoul virus immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; she declined testing of her rats, although they were presumed to be positive in light of the patient\u2019s confirmed infection. Consistent with CDC guidance, the Tennessee Department of Health recommended euthanizing the rats; however, patient A refused. In collaboration with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, an order of quarantine was issued to patient A, prohibiting movement of the rodents from her home. In addition, she and her family received extensive education about risk reduction techniques, including avoiding contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials. \nIn late April 2017, patient B, aged 38 years and the mother of patient A, was evaluated at a local hospital emergency department for multiple days of high fever, anorexia, fatigue, and shortness of breath. At the time of evaluation, her fever was 104.5\u00b0F (40.3\u00b0C). Laboratory testing was notable for a slightly elevated creatinine level (1.13 mg/dL) and slight thrombocytopenia (platelet count = 143,000/ \u03bc L; normal = 150,000\u2013450,000/ \u03bc L). A blood specimen tested positive for Seoul virus immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Seoul virus RNA was detected by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction testing. Although patient B lived in the same house as patient A, she only recalled one noteworthy exposure to rodent droppings, having cleaned some from a bathtub approximately 3 weeks before her illness onset. \nSeoul virus is a rodent-borne hantavirus, which has been associated with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome,* and has a mortality rate of approximately 1\u20132% ( 1 ). It is transmitted by the brown Norway rat ( Rattus norvegicus ), which is found worldwide ( 2 , 3 ). As of January 2017, 17 laboratory-confirmed acute human cases of Seoul virus infection associated with pet rat contact have been identified in the United States as part of this outbreak investigation ( 4 ). To prevent human cases of Seoul virus infection, CDC recommends testing pet rats for Seoul virus infection and taking measures to avoid unprotected contact with infected rats or their urine, droppings, saliva, and nesting materials, and after safe cleaning techniques ( 1 ). Euthanasia is recommended for rats with Seoul virus infection; however, this guidance might not be heeded. For certain persons, such as rat breeders, these animals are a financial investment; for others, they are personal pets with which owners might have a substantial emotional attachment. Owners who choose to keep a potentially infected rodent place themselves, other household members, and visitors at risk for infection. Additionally, Seoul virus is easily transmitted within breeding colonies of rats, further propagating the virus and risk for human illness. This report demonstrates ongoing risk for Seoul virus infection for persons living in or visiting households with Seoul virus\u2013infected rodents. Adherence to recommendations for euthanasia will help to mitigate ongoing risk for Seoul virus morbidity and mortality in humans. Top Acknowledgments \nDeborah Cannon, MS, James Graziano, MS, M.

First observed in 1996, World Arthritis Day serves as a focus for organizations and individuals to work toward increasing awareness of arthritis and other rheumatic conditions worldwide. In the United States, 54 million adults ( 1 ) have some form of arthritis or other rheumatic condition. By 2040, the number of adults with arthritis is projected to increase 49% to 78.4 million, and the number of adults with arthritis-attributable activity limitation will increase 52%, from 23 million to 34.6 million ( 2 ). \nThe theme of this year\u2019s World Arthritis Day is \u201cDon\u2019t delay. Connect today.\u201d Early diagnosis and professionally guided management is important for maintaining a good quality of life, particularly for persons with inflammatory arthritis. There are four other things that persons with arthritis can do to help manage their arthritis: 1) learn arthritis management strategies, 2) be physically active, 3) maintain a healthy weight, and 4) protect their joints. Self-management education programs help persons with arthritis learn the strategies and gain the confidence to manage their condition, and improve pain control and function. Physical activity decreases pain, improves function, and delays disability; low impact, moderate intensity activities such as walking, cycling, water exercise, and fitness classes are safe and effective for persons with arthritis. Maintaining a healthy weight can limit disease progression and activity limitation, and avoiding joint injuries from sports or occupation can reduce the likelihood of developing osteoarthritis.

This observance helps to increase awareness and understanding of handwashing with soap as an effective and affordable way to prevent disease around the world. \nHandwashing with soap has an important role in child survival and health. Approximately 1.4 million children aged <5 years die each year from diarrheal diseases and pneumonia, the top two causes of death among young children globally ( 1 ). Handwashing with soap can reduce the incidence of diarrhea and respiratory infections among children in this age group by approximately 30% and 20%, respectively ( 2 , 3 ). \nAlthough persons around the world clean their hands with water, few use soap to wash their hands, because soap and water might be less accessible in developing countries. Even when soap is available, it might be reserved primarily for laundry and bathing instead of for handwashing. Washing hands with soap removes germs more effectively than water alone ( 4 ), and can help in preventing diseases and saving lives.

As of July 2015, the population of Hispanics or Latinos was estimated at 56.6 million, or approximately 18% of the U.S. population ( 1 ). However, in 2015, Hispanics or Latinos accounted for 24% of all new HIV diagnoses ( 2 ). \nAt the end of 2014, an estimated 235,600 Hispanics or Latinos were living with HIV infection in the United States. In 38 jurisdictions with complete reporting of CD4 and viral load data, 75.4% were linked to care within 1 month of diagnosis, 70.2% received HIV medical care, and 58.2% were virally suppressed ( 3 ). \nNational Latino AIDS Awareness Day is an opportunity to encourage increased HIV prevention activities, such as HIV testing, for Hispanics or Latinos. CDC supports testing, linkage to, and engagement in care and treatment, and a range of other efforts to reduce the risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection among Hispanics or Latinos.

Have a plan. Be informed.\u201d in your sleep. You are probably familiar with the important items you should keep in your emergency kit \u2013 water, food, a flashlight, and a battery-powered radio. What you may not think about is personalizing your kit for your unique medical needs or the needs of your family. Particularly, including prescription medications and other medical supplies in your emergency kit and plans. \nAs a pharmacist whose job is focused on emergency preparedness and response, I want to give you 10 pointers about how to prepare your medications for an emergency so you can decrease the risk of a life-threatening situation. Make a list . Keep a list of all your medications and the dosages in your emergency kit. Make sure you have the phone numbers for your doctors and pharmacies. Have your card. Keep your health insurance or prescription drug card with you at all times so your pharmacy benefits provider or health insurance plan can help you replace any medication that was lost or damaged in a disaster. Keep a record . Make copies of your current prescriptions and keep them in your emergency kit and/or go bag. You can also scan and email yourself copies, or save them in the cloud. If you can\u2019t reach your regular doctor or your usual pharmacy is not open, this written proof of your prescriptions make it much easier for another doctor to write you a refill. Start a stockpile . During and after a disaster you may not be able to get your prescriptions refilled. Make sure you have at least 7 \u2013 10 days of your medications and other medical supplies. Refill your prescription as soon as you are able so you can set aside a few extra days\u2019 worth in your emergency kit to get you through a disaster. Storage matters . Keep your medications in labeled, child-proof containers in a secure place that does not experience extreme temperature changes or humidity. Don\u2019t forget to also include nonprescription medications you might need, including pain relievers, cold or allergy medications, and antacids. Rotate the date . Don\u2019t let the medications in your emergency supply kit expire. Check the dates at least twice every year. Prioritize critical medicines . Certain medications are more important to your health and safety than others. Prioritize your medications, and make sure you plan to have the critical medications available during an emergency. Communicate a plan . Talk to your doctor about what you should do in case you run out of a medication during an emergency. If you have a child who takes a prescription medication, talk to their daycare provider or school about a plan in case of an emergency. Plan ahead . Make sure you know the shelf life and optimal storage temperature for your prescriptions, because some medications and supplies cannot be safely stored for long periods of time at room temperature. If you take a medication that needs to be refrigerated or requires electronic equipment plan ahead for temporary storage and administration in an emergency situation. Check before using . Before using the medication in your emergency kit, check to make sure the look or smell hasn\u2019t changed. If you are unsure about its safety, contact a pharmacist or healthcare provider before using.

HIV medicine is called anti-retroviral therapy, or ART. If taken as directed, HIV medicine reduces the amount of HIV (viral load) in the body to a very low level, which keeps the immune system working and prevents illness. This is called viral suppression \u2014defined as having less than 200 copies/ml of blood. HIV medicine can even make the viral load so low that a test can\u2019t detect it. This is called an undetectable viral load .* \nGetting and keeping an undetectable viral load is the best thing people living with HIV can do to stay healthy. Another benefit of reducing the amount of virus in the body is that it helps prevent transmission to others through sex or needle sharing, and from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, and breastfeeding. This is sometimes referred to as \u201ctreatment as prevention.\u201d There is strong evidence about treatment as prevention for some of the ways HIV can be transmitted, and more research is needed for other ways. \nSexual Transmission \nPeople living with HIV who take HIV medicine as directed and get and keep an undetectable viral load have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative sexual partners. \nTransmission from pregnancy, labor, and delivery \nIf a woman living with HIV can take HIV medicine as directed throughout pregnancy, labor, and delivery and give HIV medicine to her baby for 4-6 weeks after delivery, the risk of transmitting HIV can be 1% or less. \nTransmission from sharing needles or other injection drug use equipment \nWe don\u2019t know whether getting and keeping an undetectable viral load prevents HIV transmission through sharing needles or other injection drug equipment. While we do not yet know if or how much being undetectable prevents some ways that HIV is transmitted, it is reasonable to assume that being on treatment and getting undetectable provides some risk reduction. \nTransmission from breastfeeding \nWe don\u2019t know if a woman living with HIV who has an undetectable viral load can transmit HIV to her baby through breastfeeding. While we do not yet know if or how much being undetectable prevents some ways that HIV is transmitted, it is reasonable to assume that being on treatment and getting undetectable provides some risk reduction. \n* From this point forward, undetectable will refer to either viral suppression or an undetectable viral load.

Hypertension prevalence was higher among non-Hispanic black (40.3%) than non-Hispanic white (27.8%), non-Hispanic Asian (25.0%), or Hispanic (27.8%) adults. Prevalence of controlled hypertension was 48.3% and increased with age for men but not women. Hypertension control was higher among non-Hispanic white (50.8%) than non-Hispanic black (44.6%) or non-Hispanic Asian (37.4%) adults. From 1999 to 2016, hypertension prevalence was unchanged. For controlled hypertension, prevalence increased from 1999 to 2010 but then did not change through 2016. \nHypertension remains an important public health challenge in the United States because it increases the risk for cardiovascular disease. Effective blood pressure management has been shown to decrease the incidence of stroke, heart attack, and heart failure ( 1\u20133 ). This report presents updated estimates ( 4 ) for the prevalence and control of hypertension in the United States for 2015\u20132016. Trends in hypertension prevalence and control from 1999\u20132000 through 2015\u20132016 are also presented. \n\nKeywords : high blood pressure, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey \nWhat was the prevalence of hypertension among adults during 2015\u20132016? \nOverall, the prevalence of hypertension among adults was 29.0%, and was similar among men (30.2%) and women (27.7%) ( Figure 1 ). \nThe prevalence of hypertension increased with age, from 7.5% among adults aged 18\u201339 to 33.2% among those aged 40\u201359, and 63.1% among those aged 60 and over. A similar pattern was found among both men and women. \nMen had a higher prevalence of hypertension than women among adults aged 18\u201339 (9.2% compared with 5.6%, respectively) and 40\u201359 (37.2% compared with 29.4%, respectively), but men had a lower prevalence of hypertension than women among adults 60 and over (58.5% compared with 66.8%, respectively). \nFigure 1.

SOURCE: NCHS, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999\u20132016. \nSummary \nOverall, the U.S. prevalence of hypertension among adults was 29.0% during 2015\u20132016, with no significant change in prevalence since 1999\u20132000. However, among adults with hypertension, hypertension control increased from 1999\u20132000 to 2009\u20132010 and then did not significantly change through 2015\u20132016. No significant differences were seen between 2013\u20132014 and 2015\u20132016. \nHypertension prevalence increased with age and was 33.2% among those aged 40\u201359 and 63.1% among those aged 60 and over. About one-half of all adults aged 40 and over with hypertension had controlled hypertension. However, among those aged 18\u201339 with hypertension, 15.5% of men had controlled hypertension compared with 62.6% of women. \nHypertension prevalence was highest among non-Hispanic black men and women. Hispanic women also had a higher prevalence of hypertension than non-Hispanic Asian women. Controlled hypertension, however, was generally higher among non-Hispanic white adults than among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic Asian adults. Controlled hypertension was also higher for non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black women than for their male counterparts. \nDespite progress in hypertension control that has been noted in the United States over the years, the goal of Healthy People 2020 (61.2% by 2020) has not been met ( 5 ). Currently, just less than one-half of adults with hypertension have their hypertension under control (48.3%). \nDefinitions \nHypertension : Systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg, or currently taking medication to lower high blood pressure ( 6 ). \nControlled hypertension : Systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg among those with hypertension ( 6 ). Estimates are age adjusted to the subpopulation of persons with hypertension in the 2007\u20132008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ( 7 ). \nData source and methods \nData from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999\u20132016 were used for these analyses. Data from the most recent 2-year survey cycle, NHANES 2015\u20132016, were used to test differences between demographic subgroups. The precision and ability to detect differences in hypertension prevalence and control when a true difference does exist are lower with 2 years of data than when these estimates are based on 4 years of data, due to the smaller sample sizes. In testing for trends in hypertension prevalence and control, nine 2-year cycles (1999\u20132000 through 2015\u20132016) were used. \nNHANES is a cross-sectional survey designed to monitor the health and nutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population using highly stratified, multistage probability designs ( 8 ). The survey consists of interviews conducted in participants\u2019 homes and standardized health examinations conducted in mobile examination centers (MECs). Blood pressure was measured in the MEC by trained physicians using standard protocol on a total sample of 5,504 nonpregnant persons aged 18 and over. \nDuring 2015\u20132016, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic persons, among other groups, were oversampled to obtain reliable estimates for these population subgroups. Specific race and Hispanic-origin estimates reflect persons reporting only one race; those reporting more than one race are included in the total but not reported separately. \nAll blood pressure readings were obtained during a single examination visit. After a 5-minute rest in a seated position, participants had up to three brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements taken 30 seconds apart. An average of up to three systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings was used for systolic and diastolic blood pressure values ( 8 ). More than 99% of study participants had at least two complete blood pressure measurements. For participants with only one blood pressure reading (0.005%), a single measurement was used. \nExamination sample weights, which account for the differential probabilities of selection, nonresponse, and noncoverage, were incorporated into the estimation process. All variance estimates accounted for the complex survey design by using Taylor series linearization. \nHypertension prevalence estimates for the total adult population were age adjusted to the 2000 projected U.S. Census population using the direct method and age groups 18\u201339, 40\u201359, and 60 and over ( 9 ). Age-adjusted estimates of controlled hypertension were calculated using the subpopulation of persons who have hypertension, as recommended by the National Surveillance Definitions for Hypertension ( 7 ), using age groups 18\u201339, 40\u201359, and 60 and over. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS System for Windows Release 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, N.C.) and SUDAAN Release 11.1 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, N.C.). Differences between groups were tested using a univariate t statistic. Linear regression modeling was used to determine the significance of linear and quadratic trends and the significance of any change in trend. If a quadratic trend was found, Joinpoint software and piecewise regression were used to determine if changes in trend occurred over time ( 10 ). All differences reported are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level unless otherwise indicated. Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons. \nAbout the authors \nCheryl D.

All infants born to mothers with possible Zika virus exposure* during pregnancy should receive a standard evaluation at birth and at each subsequent well-child visit including a comprehensive physical examination, age-appropriate vision screening and developmental monitoring and screening using validated tools ( 3 \u2013 5 ), and newborn hearing screen at birth, preferably using auditory brainstem response (ABR) methodology ( 6 ). Specific guidance for laboratory testing and clinical evaluation are provided for three clinical scenarios in the setting of possible maternal Zika virus exposure: 1) infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome regardless of maternal testing results, 2) infants without clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome who were born to mothers with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection, \u2020 and 3) infants without clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome who were born to mothers without laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection. Infants in the first two scenarios should receive further testing and evaluation for Zika virus, whereas for the third group, further testing and clinical evaluation for Zika virus are not recommended. Health care providers should remain alert for abnormal findings (e.g., postnatal-onset microcephaly and eye abnormalities without microcephaly) in infants with possible congenital Zika virus exposure without apparent abnormalities at birth. Top Congenital Zika Virus Infection \nZika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious fetal brain anomalies and microcephaly ( 7 ). Among infants with substantial loss of brain volume, severe microcephaly and partial collapse of the bones of the upper skull or cranium produce a distinctive physical appearance. Characteristic findings in the brain and spinal cord include thin cerebral cortices with enlarged ventricles and increased extra-axial fluid collections, intracranial calcifications particularly between the cortex and subcortex, abnormal gyral patterns, absent or hypoplastic corpus callosum, hypoplasia of the cerebellum or cerebellar vermis, and hypoplasia of the ventral cord ( 8 \u2013 10 ). Reported anomalies of the anterior and posterior eye include microphthalmia, coloboma, intraocular calcifications, optic nerve hypoplasia and atrophy, and macular scarring with focal pigmentary retinal mottling ( 11 \u2013 13 ). Some infants with suspected congenital Zika virus infection without structural eye lesions have cortical visual impairment, attributable to abnormalities in the visual system of the brain ( 13 ). Other reported neurologic sequelae include congenital limb contractures, dysphagia, sensorineural hearing loss, epilepsy, and abnormalities of tone or movement, including marked hypertonia and signs of extrapyramidal involvement ( 14 , 15 ). Currently, there is no evidence suggesting that delayed-onset hearing loss occurs following congenital Zika virus infection. Since publication of the previous interim guidance in August 2016 ( 1 ), additional clinical findings have been reported in the setting of laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection in the mother or infant, including eye findings in infants without microcephaly or other brain anomalies ( 16 ), postnatal-onset microcephaly in infants born with normal head circumferences ( 17 ), postnatal-onset hydrocephalus in infants born with microcephaly ( 18 ), abnormalities on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) in some infants with microcephaly who did not have recognized seizures ( 19 ), and diaphragmatic paralysis in infants born with microcephaly and arthrogryposis ( 20 \u2013 22 ). Top Zika Virus Laboratory Testing \nLaboratory testing for Zika virus has a number of limitations. Zika virus RNA is only transiently present in body fluids; thus, negative nucleic acid testing (NAT) does not rule out infection. Serologic testing is affected by timing of sample collection: a negative immunoglobulin M (IgM) serologic test result does not rule out infection because the serum specimen might have been collected before the development of IgM antibodies, or after these antibodies have waned. Conversely, IgM antibodies might be detectable for months after the initial infection; for pregnant women, this can make it difficult to determine if infection occurred before or during a current pregnancy. In addition, cross-reactivity of the Zika virus IgM antibody tests with other flaviviruses can result in a false-positive test result, especially in persons previously infected with or vaccinated against a related flavivirus, further complicating interpretation ( 23 , 24 ). Limitations of Zika virus IgM antibody assays that were approved under an Emergency Use Authorization have been recognized; both false-positive and false-negative test results have occurred. CDC is updating the Emergency Use Authorization to improve assay performance and develop more standardized methods to improve precision ( 25 ). Recent epidemiologic data indicate a declining prevalence of Zika virus infection in the Americas; lower prevalence results in a lower pretest probability of infection and a higher probability of false-positive test results. Top Updated Guidance for Testing of Pregnant Women with Possible Zika Virus Exposure \nGiven the decreasing prevalence of Zika virus infection cases in the Americas and emerging data regarding Zika virus laboratory testing, on July 24, 2017, CDC published updated guidance for testing of pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure ( 2 ). Zika virus NAT testing should be offered as part of routine obstetric care to asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure (residing in or frequently traveling to an area with risk for Zika virus transmission); serologic testing is no longer routinely recommended because of the limitations of IgM tests, specifically the potential persistence of IgM antibodies from an infection before conception and the potential for false-positive results. Zika virus testing is not routinely recommended for asymptomatic pregnant women who have possible recent, but not ongoing, Zika virus exposure; however, guidance might vary among jurisdictions ( 2 ). The updated guidance for maternal testing ( 2 ) is intended to reduce the possibility of false-positive results in the setting of the lower pretest probability; however, there is a possibility that the lack of routine testing might delay identification of some infants without clinical findings apparent at birth, but who may have complications from congenital Zika virus infection. Communication regarding possible maternal exposures between pediatric health care providers and obstetric care providers is critical, and strategies to enhance coordination of care and communication of health information are being developed. For families of infants with possible congenital Zika virus infection, health care providers should ensure that psychosocial support is in place and that families have access to care. The long-term prognosis for infants with congenital Zika virus infection is not yet known; health care providers should strive to address families\u2019 concerns, facilitate early identification of abnormal findings, and refer infants for neurodevelopmental follow-up and therapy when indicated. Top Forum on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Management of Zika Virus Infection Among Infants \nOn August 30\u201331, 2017, CDC, in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, convened the Forum on the Diagnosis, Evaluation, and Management of Zika Virus Infection among Infants, with the goal of obtaining individual expert opinion to inform development of updated guidance for diagnosing, evaluating, and managing infants with possible congenital Zika virus infection and to identify strategies to enhance communication and coordination of care of mothers and infants affected by Zika virus. Experts from various medical specialties, professional organizations, public health agencies, and federal agencies participated in the Forum ( Box 1 ). Discussion focused on the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of three groups of infants born to mothers with possible Zika virus exposure during pregnancy: 1) infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome, regardless of maternal testing results, 2) infants without clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome who were born to mothers with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection, and 3) infants without clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome who were born to mothers without laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection ( Figure ). \nThis updated interim guidance is based on current, limited data about Zika virus infection, the interpretation of individual expert opinion collected during the Forum, and knowledge about other congenital infections, and reflects the information available as of September 2017. As more information becomes available, this guidance will be updated. Top Diagnosis of Congenital Zika Virus Infection \nThe optimal assays, specimens, and timing of testing for congenital Zika virus infection are unknown. A few reports have described infants with clinical findings consistent with possible congenital Zika syndrome but with negative laboratory results ( 20 , 26 ). Recommended laboratory testing for congenital Zika virus infection includes evaluation for Zika virus RNA in infant serum and urine and Zika virus IgM antibodies in serum. In addition, if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obtained for other purposes, NAT and IgM antibody testing should be performed on CSF because CSF was the only sample that tested positive in some infants with congenital Zika virus syndrome ( 26 ). Testing of cord blood is not recommended because it can yield false-positive and false-negative test results ( 27 , 28 ). \nBecause levels of Zika virus RNA and IgM antibodies decline over time, laboratory testing of infants should be performed as early as possible, preferably within the first few days after birth, although testing specimens within the first few weeks to months after birth might still be useful ( 17 , 29 , 30 ). Diagnosis of congenital Zika virus infection is confirmed by a positive Zika virus NAT result ( Table ). If Zika virus IgM antibodies are detected in the infant with a negative NAT, the infant is considered to have probable congenital Zika virus infection. If neither Zika virus RNA nor Zika IgM antibodies is detected on the appropriate specimens (e.g., serum or urine) obtained within the first few days after birth, congenital Zika virus infection is unlikely. Distinguishing between congenital and postnatal infection is difficult in infants who live in areas where there is ongoing transmission of Zika virus and who are not tested soon after birth. If the timing of infection cannot be determined, infants should be evaluated as if they had congenital Zika virus infection. \nThe plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which measures virus-specific neutralizing antibodies, can be used to help identify false-positive results ( 24 ). In the United States and U.S. territories, if the infant\u2019s initial sample is IgM nonnegative (nonnegative serology terminology varies by assay and might include \u201cpositive,\u201d \u201cequivocal,\u201d \u201cpresumptive positive,\u201d or \u201cpossible positive\u201d) and NAT negative, but PRNT was not performed on the mother\u2019s sample, PRNT for Zika and dengue viruses should be performed on the infant\u2019s initial sample if the test is appropriate given the setting. A negative Zika virus PRNT suggests that the infant\u2019s Zika virus IgM test was a false positive ( 23 ). \nPRNT cannot distinguish between maternal and infant antibodies in specimens collected from infants at or near birth; however, based on what is known about other congenital infections, maternal antibodies are expected to become undetectable by age 18 months and might become undetectable earlier ( 31 ). For infants whose initial sample is IgM nonnegative and Zika virus neutralizing antibodies are detected on either the infant\u2019s specimen at birth or the mother\u2019s specimen, PRNT at age \u226518 months might help confirm or rule out congenital Zika virus infection. However, PRNT cannot be used to determine timing of infection. If PRNT is positive in an infant at age \u226518 months, congenital Zika virus infection is presumed; however, for infants living in or traveling to areas with risk of Zika virus transmission, postnatal infection cannot be excluded. If PRNT is negative at age \u226518 months, congenital Zika virus infection is unlikely. For infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome who have maternal laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy, PRNT at age \u226518 months could be considered if the infant testing results are negative (i.e., negative Zika virus NAT and IgM on infant serum and urine) or if the infant was not tested at birth. Top Updated Recommendations for Diagnosis, Clinical Evaluation, and Management of Infants with Clinical Findings Consistent with Congenital Zika Syndrome Born to Mothers with Possible Zika Virus Exposure in Pregnancy \nLaboratory testing. Zika virus testing is recommended for infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome and possible maternal Zika virus exposure during pregnancy, regardless of maternal testing results (Figure). Testing CSF for Zika virus RNA and Zika virus IgM antibodies should be considered, especially if serum and urine testing are negative and another etiology has not been identified. \nClinical Evaluation and Management . In addition to a standard evaluation ( Box 2 ), infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome should have a head ultrasound and a comprehensive ophthalmologic exam \u00a7 performed by age 1 month by an ophthalmologist experienced in assessment of and intervention in infants. Infants should be referred for automated ABR by age 1 month if the newborn hearing screen was passed using only otoacoustic emissions methodology ( 6 ). Because infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome are at risk for developmental delay and disabilities, referrals to a developmental specialist and early intervention service programs are recommended, and family support services should be provided. In addition, the following consultations should be considered: 1) infectious disease for evaluation of other congenital infections and assistance with Zika virus diagnosis, testing, and counseling; 2) clinical genetics for confirmation of the clinical phenotype and evaluation for other causes of microcephaly or congenital anomalies; and 3) neurology by age 1 month for comprehensive neurologic examination and consideration for other evaluations, such as advanced neuroimaging and EEG. Consultations with other clinical specialists should be based on the infant\u2019s clinical findings ( Box 3 ). Health care providers and families might consider fewer consultations for the evaluation of severely affected infants who are receiving palliative care. \nThe initial clinical evaluation, including subspecialty consultations, can be performed before hospital discharge or as an outpatient, taking into account hospital capabilities and needs of the family. Transfer to a facility with access to pediatric subspecialty care typically is not necessary unless there is an urgent clinical need. Health care providers should maintain vigilance for the appearance of other clinical findings associated with congenital Zika syndrome. Diaphragmatic paralysis should be considered in an infant who develops respiratory distress or failure or who fails to wean from a ventilator. Infant feedings should be monitored closely, and if there are signs of swallowing dysfunction, such as difficulty breathing with feeding, coughing or choking during feeding, or extended feeding times, an assessment for dysphagia should be performed ( 32 , 33 ). Signs of increasing intracranial pressure (e.g., increasing head circumference, irritability, or vomiting) should prompt neuroimaging to assess for postnatal hydrocephalus. \nThe follow-up care of infants with findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome requires a multidisciplinary team and an established medical home to facilitate the coordination of care and ensure that abnormal findings are addressed ( 34 ). At each subsequent well-child visit, all infants should have a standard evaluation (Box 2) along with routine preventive pediatric care and immunizations ( 35 ), with decisions about further evaluation guided by clinical findings and made in consultation with the family. Follow-up visits with an ophthalmologist after the initial eye examination should be based on ophthalmology recommendations. As a change from the previous guidance ( 1 ), a diagnostic ABR is no longer recommended at age 4\u20136 months for infants who passed the initial hearing screen with automated ABR because of the absence of data suggesting delayed-onset hearing loss in infants with congenital Zika virus infection. Additional follow-up will depend on clinical findings in the infant. Top Updated Recommendations for Diagnosis, Clinical Evaluation, and Management of Infants without Clinical Findings Consistent with Congenital Zika Syndrome Born to Mothers with Laboratory Evidence of Possible Zika Virus Infection During Pregnancy \nLaboratory testing. Zika virus testing is recommended for infants without clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome born to mothers with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy (Figure). \nClinical evaluation and management. In addition to a standard evaluation (Box 2), infants who do not have clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome born to mothers with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy should have a head ultrasound and a comprehensive ophthalmologic exam performed by age 1 month to detect subclinical brain and eye findings. Further follow-up visits with an ophthalmologist after the initial examination should be based on ophthalmology recommendations. Infants should also be referred for automated ABR by age 1 month if newborn hearing screen was passed using only otoacoustic emissions methodology. \nHealth care providers should perform a standard evaluation along with routine preventive pediatric care and immunizations ( 35 ) at each subsequent well-child visit, and they should be vigilant for signs that might be associated with congenital Zika virus infection. If findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome (e.g., impaired visual acuity/function, hearing problems, developmental delay, or delay in head growth) are identified at any time, referrals to the appropriate specialists should be made and further evaluation should follow recommendations for infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome (Figure). \nInfants with laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection. Laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection includes a positive Zika virus NAT or a nonnegative Zika virus IgM with confirmatory neutralizing antibody testing, if PRNT confirmation is performed. Further clinical evaluation for infants with laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection should follow recommendations for infants with clinical findings even in the absence of clinically apparent abnormalities (Figure). As a change from the previous guidance ( 1 ), a diagnostic ABR at 4\u20136 months or behavioral audiology at age 9 months is no longer recommended if the initial hearing screen is passed by automated ABR, because of absence of data suggesting delayed-onset hearing loss in congenital Zika virus infection. \nInfants without laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection . If adequate laboratory testing is performed (e.g., concurrent testing on infant serum and urine within the first few days after birth), there is no laboratory evidence of congenital Zika virus infection (i.e., negative NAT and IgM on infant samples), and the clinical evaluation is normal, then congenital Zika virus infection is unlikely. Infants should continue to receive routine pediatric care, and health care providers should remain alert for any new findings of congenital Zika virus infection. Top Updated Recommendations for Diagnosis, Clinical Evaluation, and Management of Infants without Clinical Findings Consistent with Congenital Zika Syndrome Born to Mothers with Possible Zika Virus Exposure in Pregnancy but without Laboratory Evidence of Possible Zika Virus Infection During Pregnancy \nThis heterogeneous group includes mothers who were never tested during pregnancy as well as those whose test result could have been negative because of issues related to timing or sensitivity and specificity of the test. Because the latter issues are not easily discerned, all mothers with possible exposure to Zika virus during pregnancy who do not have laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection, including those who tested negative with currently available technology, should be considered in this group. \nLaboratory testing. Laboratory testing for congenital Zika virus infection is not routinely recommended for infants born to mothers in this category based on the unknown risk for infection; the lower likelihood of congenital Zika virus infection as a result of the declining prevalence of Zika virus infection; and limitations of infant laboratory testing. If abnormal findings are identified, these infants should receive further evaluation, including evaluation and testing for congenital Zika virus infection. \nClinical evaluation and management . Infants without clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome born to mothers without laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection during pregnancy should have a standard evaluation (Box 2) performed at birth and at each subsequent well-child visit along with routine preventive pediatric care and immunizations ( 35 ). Health care providers should be alert to the possibility of congenital infection, especially in infants born to mothers with ongoing possible Zika virus exposure during pregnancy. \nFurther clinical evaluation for congenital Zika virus infection beyond a standard evaluation and routine pediatric care is not routinely indicated. Health care providers can consider additional evaluation in consultation with families, taking into account the infant\u2019s complete physical examination with emphasis on neurologic findings; risks of screening (e.g., identification of incidental findings); and maternal factors, including the presence and timing of symptoms, and type, location, and length of possible Zika virus exposure. Older infants in whom maternal Zika virus exposure was not assessed at birth and who are evaluated later might also have more clinical data available (e.g., neurologic status, development, visual/hearing impairments, or head circumference trajectory) to guide the evaluation. If findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome are identified at any time, referrals to the appropriate specialists should be made, and subsequent evaluation should follow recommendations for infants with clinical findings consistent with congenital Zika syndrome (Figure). Top Special Considerations for the Prenatal Diagnosis of Congenital Zika Virus Infection \nWhile much has been learned about congenital Zika syndrome, limitations of laboratory testing exist and the full spectrum of congenital Zika virus infection is not yet known. Similar to other congenital infections, prenatal diagnostic evaluation can inform the clinical evaluation of infants with possible Zika virus exposure. Current CDC guidance regarding prenatal diagnosis is reviewed below ( 2 ); as more data become available, understanding of the diagnostic role of prenatal ultrasound and amniocentesis in the clinical evaluation of congenital Zika syndrome will improve and guidance will be updated. \nUltrasound. Routine screening for fetal abnormalities is a component of prenatal care in the United States. Comprehensive ultrasound examination to evaluate fetal anatomy is recommended for all women at 18\u201322 weeks\u2019 gestation ( 36 ). However, for the detection of abnormalities associated with congenital Zika virus infection, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of ultrasound are unknown. Prenatal ultrasound findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection include intracranial calcifications at the gray-white matter junction, ventriculomegaly, abnormalities of the corpus callosum, microcephaly, and limb anomalies ( 10 , 37 ). The reliability of ultrasound detection for each of these abnormalities as isolated findings is unknown ( 37 , 38 ). Limited data suggest that a constellation of ultrasound abnormalities (e.g., microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, or abnormalities of the corpus callosum) identified prenatally in the context of maternal Zika virus exposure correlates with reported structural abnormalities in infants at birth ( 20 , 21 , 39 \u2013 43 ). \nQuestions remain about optimal timing of ultrasound among pregnant women with possible maternal Zika virus exposure. Abnormalities have been detected anywhere from 2 to 29 weeks after symptom onset ( 39 , 41 , 43 , 44 ); therefore, insufficient data are available to define the optimal timing between exposure and initial sonographic screening. Brain abnormalities associated with congenital Zika syndrome have been identified by ultrasound in the second and third trimesters in published case reports ( 20 , 39 , 41 , 43 , 44 ). Currently, the negative predictive value of serial normal prenatal ultrasounds is unknown. Serial ultrasound monitoring can detect changes in fetal anatomy, particularly neuroanatomy, and growth patterns ( 39 , 41 , 44 ). CDC previously recommended serial ultrasounds every 3\u20134 weeks for women exposed during pregnancy with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection, based upon existing fetal growth monitoring for other maternal conditions (e.g., hypertension or diabetes) ( 2 ). However, there are no data specific to congenital Zika virus infection to guide these timing recommendations; clinicians may consider extending the time interval between ultrasounds in accordance with patient preferences and clinical judgment. Women with possible exposure but without laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy should receive ultrasound screening as recommended for routine prenatal care. Future data will be used to inform the optimal timing and frequency of ultrasound in pregnant women with possible Zika virus infection. \nAmniocentesis. The role of amniocentesis for the detection of congenital Zika virus infection is unknown. Data regarding the positive and negative predictive values and optimal timing for amniocentesis are not available. Reports of the correlation between positive Zika test results in amniotic fluid and clinical phenotype or confirmatory infant laboratory testing are inconsistent ( 20 , 42 , 45 , 46 ). Zika virus RNA has been detected in amniotic fluid specimens; however, serial amniocenteses have demonstrated that Zika virus RNA might only be present transiently ( 45 ). Therefore, a negative test result on amniotic fluid cannot rule out congenital Zika virus infection. However, if amniocentesis is indicated as part of the evaluation for abnormal prenatal findings, NAT testing for Zika virus should be considered to assist with the diagnosis of fetal infection. \nSummary of prenatal diagnosis of congenital Zika virus infection. Given the limitations in the available screening modalities and the absence of effective interventions to prevent and treat congenital Zika virus infection, a shared decision-making model is essential to ensure that pregnant women and their families understand the risks and benefits of screening in the context of the patient\u2019s preferences and values. For example, serial ultrasound examinations might be inconvenient, unpleasant, and expensive, and might prompt unnecessary interventions; amniocentesis carries additional known risks such as fetal loss. These potential harms of prenatal screening for congenital Zika syndrome might outweigh the clinical benefits for some patients; therefore, these decisions should be individualized ( 47 ).

Summary \nWhat is already known about this topic? \nIn 2015, a total of 7,498 women received a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States, 60% of whom were black, although black women accounted for only 12% of the female population. HIV testing, identification of HIV infections, and early linkage to HIV medical care are critical for ensuring that HIV-positive women receive the care they need to achieve viral suppression and improved health outcomes, and to reduce transmission to others. Providing partner services can further support these prevention goals. \nWhat is added by this report? \nAnalysis of 2015 data on CDC-funded HIV tests and HIV prevention services from 61 health departments and 123 community-based organizations indicated that among women identified as having HIV infection, 62% had received a diagnosis of HIV infection before the current test, and 87% of those women were not in HIV medical care at the time of the test. Rates for linkage to medical care within 90 days of the current test date were 61% and 58% for women with newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed HIV infection, respectively. Among women with previously diagnosed HIV infection, 57% of black women and 65% of white women were linked to HIV medical care. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nEnhanced efforts to test and identify women with HIV infection and promptly link them to HIV medical care, as well as to identify women with previously diagnosed HIV infection who are not in care, especially black women, and link them to care will improve health outcomes, increase rates of viral suppression, and reduce transmission of HIV to others. \nDiagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among women declined 17% during 2011\u20132015, and a total of 7,498 women received a diagnosis of HIV infection in 2015 ( 1 ). Although black or African American (black) women accounted for only 12% of the U.S. female population, 60% of women with newly diagnosed HIV infection were black ( 1 , 2 ). By the end of 2014, an estimated 255,900 women were living with HIV infection ( 3 ), including approximately 12% who did not know they were infected; in addition, approximately 45% of women who had received a diagnosis had not achieved viral suppression ( 3 ). HIV testing is an important public health strategy for identifying women with HIV infection and linking them to HIV medical care. Analysis of CDC-funded program data submitted by 61 health departments in 2015 indicated that among 4,749 women tested who received a diagnosis of HIV infection, 2,951 (62%) had received a diagnosis in the past (previous diagnosis), and 1,798 (38%) were receiving a diagnosis for the first time (new diagnosis). Of those who had received a previous diagnosis, 87% were not in HIV medical care at the time of the current test. Testing and identifying women who are living with HIV infection but who are not in care (regardless of when they received their first diagnosis) and rapidly linking them to care so they can receive antiretroviral therapy and become virally suppressed are essential for reducing HIV infection among all women. \nIn 2015, CDC funded 61 state and local health departments and 123 community-based organizations (CBOs)* to provide HIV testing and related services in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Health departments submitted deidentified program data about services provided by both health departments and CBOs through a secure, online, CDC-supported system. Data analyzed for this report include 2015 CDC-funded HIV tests, \u2020 new and previous HIV diagnoses, linkage to medical care within 90 days \u00a7 of the current test, and interviews for partner services. \u00b6 Analyses were restricted to persons who reported their sex at birth and current gender identity as female, and were aged \u226513 years. Data were stratified by the following demographic characteristics: age group, race/ethnicity, census region, health department jurisdiction\u2019s prevalence of HIV infection, and test setting.** Multivariate robust Poisson regression ( 4 ) was used to assess the association between demographic characteristics and newly diagnosed HIV infections, linkage to HIV medical care, and interviews for partner services. \nAmong 3,020,068 CDC-funded HIV tests provided in 2015, a total of 1,454,499 (48%) were provided to women. The highest percentages of tests were provided to women who were aged 20\u201329 years (41%), black (49%), living in the South (62%), living in medium and high prevalence jurisdictions (97%), and who received testing in health care facilities (83%) ( Table 1 ). \nOverall, 4,749 women had positive tests for HIV infection in 2015; among these, 2,951 (62%) had previously received a diagnosis of HIV infection, and 1,798 (38%) received a new diagnosis. Compared with women aged 20\u201329 years, those aged 13\u201319 years were less likely to receive a new diagnosis (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0.41), whereas prevalence was higher among women aged 30\u201339 years (aPR = 1.69), 40\u201349 years (2.58), and \u226550 years (2.53). Black women accounted for 58% of the new diagnoses of HIV infection and were more likely to receive a new diagnosis than were white women (aPR = 1.31). Compared with tests performed in the South, tests performed in in the Northeast, Midwest, West, and Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands were more likely to yield new diagnoses (aPR = 1.65, 1.24, 1.59, and 2.26, respectively). Compared with tests performed in high prevalence jurisdictions, tests performed in medium and medium-low/low prevalence jurisdictions were less likely to yield new diagnoses (aPR = 0.86 and 0.38, respectively). Tests performed in health care facilities were less likely to yield new diagnoses than tests performed in non\u2013health care facilities (aPR = 0.51) (Table 1). \nAmong the 1,798 women with newly diagnosed HIV infection, 1,104 (61%) were linked to HIV medical care within 90 days of diagnosis, and 1,096 (61%) were interviewed for partner services. The percentages of women with newly diagnosed HIV infection who were linked to care were higher in the Northeast (72%; aPR = 1.21) and Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (79%; aPR = 1.57) than in the South (59%) ( Table 2 ). \nAmong the 2,951 women with a previously diagnosed infection, 2,554 (87%) were not in HIV medical care at the time of testing ( Table 3 ); among these women, 1,474 (58%) were linked to care within 90 days. The prevalence of being linked to HIV medical care within 90 days was lower for black women (57%) than for white women (65%; aPR = 0.91). The prevalence of being linked to care was 53% in the South, and was higher in the Northeast (78%; aPR = 1.46) and the West (86%; aPR = 1.57). Compared with women tested in non\u2013health care facilities (68%), linkage was lower among women tested in health care facilities (55%; aPR = 0.80) (Table 3). Top Discussion \nHIV testing and partner services are essential strategies for diagnosing and rapidly linking women living with HIV infection and their infected partners to medical care so they can achieve viral suppression. Findings from this report underscore the importance of HIV testing not only to identify new infections, but also to identify women who have previously received a diagnosis but are not receiving medical care, because either they were never linked to care or they stopped receiving care. A high percentage of women tested had already received an HIV diagnosis (62%) before the current test; however, 87% of those women were not receiving HIV medical care. Willingness of women with previously diagnosed HIV infection to take another HIV test might signal a desire or willingness to receive the additional support they need to be linked to care, representing an opportunity for an important public health intervention; however, in this analysis, only 58% of women with previously diagnosed HIV infection were linked to care within 90 days of the current test. \nBlack women accounted for 72% of women with a previous HIV diagnosis, although they were significantly less likely than were white women to be linked to HIV medical care within 90 days of the current test. Disparities in socioecological factors such as poverty, health literacy, and health care coverage might contribute to lower linkage for black women ( 5 ). Mistrust of medical providers and conspiracy beliefs about the origin of HIV and the role of the government in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome epidemic might also explain why black women are less likely to be engaged in HIV medical care ( 6 ). Black women might be more likely to remain in HIV medical care if they trust and engage in high quality communication with their provider ( 7 ). \nOverall, 61% of women with newly diagnosed HIV infection were interviewed for partner services. CDC recommends that all persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection be interviewed for partner services so that partners can be confidentially notified of their potential risk ( 8 ). There are potential prevention benefits of interviewing women with previously diagnosed infection for partner services as well so that their partners may also be confidentially notified of their potential risk, receive an HIV test, and be linked to care if they receive a diagnosis of HIV. It is important to prioritize provision of partner services to women whose characteristics suggest possible recent risk for transmission (e.g., new bacterial sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, report of sex without condoms, or sharing drug injection equipment) or those who did not receive partner services when they initially received their diagnosis ( 8 ). Partner services is a process through which HIV infected persons are interviewed to elicit information about their partners, who can then be confidentially notified of their possible exposure or potential risk and offered services that can protect the health of partners and prevent HIV transmission to others. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, findings describe CDC-funded HIV tests only and are not generalizable to all tests provided to women in the United States. Second, linkage data include records with missing or invalid data in the denominator and therefore probably underestimate the percentage of persons linked to care. Finally, when surveillance data are unavailable to verify previous HIV status, the number of new positive results might be overestimated if clients inaccurately report a previous negative HIV status. \nTo reduce and eventually eliminate HIV infection among women in the United States, HIV testing programs need to improve early linkage to HIV medical care among HIV-positive women who are not in care, regardless of their known HIV status at the time of testing. It is also important for the HIV prevention public health community to increase their focus on identifying women with previously diagnosed HIV infection who are not in care, especially black women, and promptly link them to care, as well as monitor and evaluate these efforts.

Beginning in 2012, tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine has been recommended for pregnant women during the third trimester of each pregnancy to provide protection to the newborn. A recent report indicated Tdap vaccination coverage during pregnancy was approximately 42% in women giving birth during 2013. \nWhat is added by this report? \nAmong mothers of control infants participating in the Birth Defects Study of the Slone Epidemiology Center, which included pregnant women in New York and Massachusetts and the areas surrounding Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and San Diego, California, Tdap vaccination coverage increased from <1% before 2010 to 28% in 2013, and reached 53% in 2015. Overall, 96% of Tdap vaccinations received by pregnant women in this study were administered in physicians\u2019 offices or clinics. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nAlthough Tdap vaccination coverage has increased in recent years and approximately half of pregnant women in this study who had a live birth in 2015 received Tdap, coverage for pregnant women remains far below the recommendation that every woman be vaccinated during each pregnancy. Increasing vaccination coverage during pregnancy could help reduce the impact of pertussis on infant morbidity and mortality. \nTetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine is recommended during the third trimester of each pregnancy to provide protection to newborns, who are at risk for pertussis-related morbidity and mortality ( 1 ). As part of its case-control surveillance study of medications and birth defects, the Birth Defects Study of the Slone Epidemiology Center at Boston University (the Birth Defects Study) has recorded data on vaccinations received during pregnancy since 2006. Among 5,606 mothers of infants without structural birth defects in this population (control group), <1% had received Tdap vaccine before 2009. By 2012, the percentage of mothers of infants in the control group (control infants) who had received Tdap increased to approximately 9%, and then in 2013 and continuing through 2015, increased markedly, to 28% and 54%, respectively. As the prevalence of maternal Tdap vaccination increased, so did the proportion of pregnant women who received Tdap in the third trimester, as recommended (94%\u2013100% from 2010 to 2015). The vast majority of Tdap vaccinations (96%) were received in a traditional health care setting (e.g., the office of the woman\u2019s obstetrician or primary care physician or her prenatal clinic). Increasing vaccination coverage during pregnancy could help reduce the impact of pertussis on infant morbidity and mortality. \nPertussis is a highly contagious disease, but mortality is highest among newborns: almost all pertussis-associated deaths occur within the first 2 months of life ( 2 ), when these infants are too young to receive primary pertussis vaccinations. To provide infants with indirect protection from pertussis, in 2006, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended postpartum Tdap administration to mothers, but noted that the vaccine could be administered during pregnancy.* In June 2011, ACIP changed the preferred timing of Tdap administration to mothers, recommending that previously unvaccinated pregnant women should receive Tdap after 20 weeks\u2019 gestation ( 3 ). In October 2012, this recommendation was expanded to include all pregnant women during every pregnancy, with the optimal time for vaccination in the third trimester ( 1 ). A recent analysis reported 42% coverage with Tdap among pregnant women in 2013 ( 4 ). To assess the impact of the ACIP recommendations, trends in Tdap coverage in pregnancy were examined, along with the settings in which women received their vaccinations, from 2006 through 2015, using data from the Birth Defects Study. \nDuring 1976\u20132015, the Birth Defects Study conducted surveillance using a case-control methodology described previously ( 5 ). Infants with major structural birth defects (case infants) were identified at study centers that, for the present analysis, included participating hospitals in the areas surrounding Boston, Massachusetts, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and San Diego, California, as well as statewide birth defects registries in New York and Massachusetts. Control infants were randomly selected each month from study hospitals\u2019 discharge lists or statewide vital statistics records. Within 6 months of delivery, mothers of case and control infants were invited to participate in a computer-assisted telephone interview conducted by trained study nurses. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, reproductive history, illnesses, and medications used from 2 months before the last menstrual period through the end of pregnancy. Medication data included prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and for pregnancies that began in 2005 or later, any vaccines received during pregnancy. Women were asked to provide an exact date of vaccination, or if the vaccination date was not available, a range of possible dates, along with the setting or facility where the vaccine was administered (e.g., doctor\u2019s office/prenatal clinic, workplace, school, pharmacy/supermarket, or government site). All women who reported receiving a vaccine were asked to provide a release allowing study personnel to contact the vaccine provider to validate the vaccine report. If vaccine records were not available, the maternal report was accepted ( 6 ). All vaccine doses received from the provider were recorded, and during the process of validating vaccination reports, study personnel sometimes discovered unreported Tdap vaccinations. For instance, a maternal report of influenza vaccination might lead to the recording of an unreported Tdap vaccination during pregnancy from the same provider. \nThis analysis of Tdap vaccination coverage was limited to pregnancies in women who gave birth to control infants during 2006\u20132015. Among women who reported receiving Tdap vaccine during pregnancy, the exact date of vaccination obtained from the vaccination record was used if the record was available; otherwise, the vaccination date the woman provided or the midpoint of the reported date range was used. Unvaccinated women were defined as those without provider-documented exposure who did not report receiving the Tdap vaccine, or whose reported Tdap vaccination took place before pregnancy or after delivery. \nAmong the 5,606 pregnant women who participated in the study during the 10 years included in the analysis, 849 (15%) received doses of Tdap during pregnancy. Among these doses, 83% were validated by provider records; the remaining 17% were ascertained only by maternal self-report. Fifty-nine (7%) Tdap doses were not reported by the mother and were identified during validation of other reported vaccinations (primarily influenza vaccine). \nTdap vaccination during pregnancy increased over the years of the study ( Figure ). Tdap vaccination during pregnancy occurred in <1% of women who delivered before 2010, but began to increase from 2010 (5%) to 2012 (9%); during 2010\u20132011, 83% of Tdap vaccinations documented in the study were received among mothers of control infants reported to the San Diego study center. Overall Tdap vaccination coverage approximately tripled in 2013 to 28%, with highest rates reported for mothers of control infants in Boston (34%) and Philadelphia (32%); reported vaccination rates continued to increase in 2014 (48%) and 2015 (54%) (2015 rates were 64% in Philadelphia, 56% in Boston, 52% in San Diego, and 44% in New York). Among all mothers giving birth, Tdap vaccination during the first trimester remained at approximately 1%, and vaccination in the second trimester ranged from 1% to 5%. Tdap vaccination in the third trimester increased from 4% in 2010 to 49% in 2015. \nOverall, 96% of Tdap vaccine doses received by pregnant women were administered in a traditional health care setting (e.g., the office of their obstetrician or primary care physician or their prenatal clinic). Among 4% of vaccine doses reported to have been administered in non-traditional health care settings, half were received at work or school settings, and one quarter each at pharmacy/supermarket or government settings. During the 10 years included in this analysis, the proportion of vaccine doses received by pregnant women in these settings remained stable; during 2010\u20132015, Tdap vaccinations administered in traditional health care settings accounted for 94%\u2013100% of Tdap vaccine doses administered to pregnant women. Top Discussion \nFrom 2006 to 2015, Tdap vaccination coverage among pregnant women in the Birth Defects Study who gave birth to control infants increased from <1% of births in 2009 to 9% in 2012, before increasing to 28% in 2013 and to >50% of births in 2015. These increases reflect the implementation of evolving ACIP recommendations, which currently recommend that all pregnant women be vaccinated during each pregnancy, ideally in the third trimester. Of note, before 2012, the San Diego study center accounted for the large majority of pregnant women in the Birth Defects Study who received Tdap; this was likely a result of California\u2019s 2010 recommendation that all women of childbearing age be vaccinated with Tdap \u201cpreferably before pregnancy, but otherwise during or after pregnancy\u201d in response to a statewide pertussis epidemic. \u2020 The higher Tdap coverage beginning in 2010 has also been reported in two studies using the Vaccine Safety Datalink ( 4 , 7 ), and was likewise attributed to the 2010 recommendation in California ( 7 ). Tdap coverage in non-California sites remained low until 2012 ( 7 ). In both the Vaccine Safety Datalink and Birth Defects Study, marked increases were observed for all sites beginning in 2013; the Birth Defects Study data in this report indicate that this increase continued in 2014 and 2015. By 2015, all four Birth Defects Study centers (Boston, Philadelphia, San Diego, and New York) reported Tdap administration prevalences ranging from 44% to 64% among mothers of control infants. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, Tdap vaccination histories were ascertained by self-report and could be subject to misclassification; however, maternal reports of influenza vaccination in the Birth Defects Study were previously found to be accurate within a given trimester for 83% of women in this group ( 8 ), and 83% of Tdap vaccine doses reported in the current study were confirmed by vaccine providers\u2019 records. Second, because the data was limited to reporting centers in only four U.S. locations, the study population might not be representative of the entire U.S. population. Finally, the small number of mothers vaccinated each year might have affected year-to-year variability. \nTdap vaccination during pregnancy increased substantially among mothers of control infants in the Birth Defects Study over the 10 years included in this report. Although approximately half of mothers who gave birth to control infants in the most recent year of the study received Tdap during pregnancy, this proportion remains far below the ACIP recommendation that all pregnant women be vaccinated during each pregnancy. Newborns at highest risk for pertussis-associated complications are too young to be vaccinated, but Tdap vaccination during pregnancy can reduce the potential for morbidity ( 9 ) and mortality in this vulnerable population. A recent U.S. study found that Tdap vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy was 85% more effective than postpartum vaccination at preventing pertussis in infants aged <2 months ( 10 ). To help increase coverage of Tdap vaccination among pregnant women, resources are available for prenatal care providers and pregnant women at https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/pregnant .

In Guinea, health officials suspected that traditional burial preparations and funeral rites involving corpse contact promoted transmission, but they lacked national-level data about these practices. \nWhat is added by this report? \nAs the Ebola epidemic waned in Guinea, a KAP survey found that most participants understood Ebola causes, transmission, and prevention, but nearly half believed that Ebola could be transmitted by mosquitoes or ambient air. The majority of participants reported more frequent handwashing and avoiding physical contact with persons suspected of having Ebola. Nearly all participants reported they would seek specialized treatment for family members with suspected Ebola and would engage special burial teams if someone died from Ebola in their homes. More than half would observe Ebola-affected corpses from a safe distance that would avoid corpse contact, but there was considerable regional variation in that finding. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nKAP information collected during an epidemic can yield data to guide response and recovery efforts, health education, and social mobilization. Future activities should aim to reverse misconceptions about Ebola transmission and prevention, clarify duration and modes of transmission from survivors, prevent stigmatization of Ebola survivors, and foster safer case management and burial practices. \nHealth communication and social mobilization efforts to improve the public\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding Ebola virus disease (Ebola) were important in controlling the 2014\u20132016 Ebola epidemic in Guinea ( 1 ), which resulted in 3,814 reported Ebola cases and 2,544 deaths.* Most Ebola cases in Guinea resulted from the washing and touching of persons and corpses infected with Ebola without adequate infection control precautions at home, at funerals, and in health facilities ( 2 , 3 ). As the 18-month epidemic waned in August 2015, Ebola KAP were assessed in a survey among residents of Guinea recruited through multistage cluster sampling procedures in the nation\u2019s eight administrative regions (Bok\u00e9, Conakry, Faranah, Kankan, Kindia, Lab\u00e9, Mamou, and Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9). Nearly all participants (92%) were aware of Ebola prevention measures, but 27% believed that Ebola could be transmitted by ambient air, and 49% believed they could protect themselves from Ebola by avoiding mosquito bites. Of the participants, 95% reported taking actions to avoid getting Ebola, especially more frequent handwashing (93%). Nearly all participants (91%) indicated they would send relatives with suspected Ebola to Ebola treatment centers, and 89% said they would engage special Ebola burial teams to remove corpses with suspected Ebola from homes. Of the participants, 66% said they would prefer to observe an Ebola-affected corpse from a safe distance at burials rather than practice traditional funeral rites involving corpse contact. The findings were used to guide the ongoing epidemic response and recovery efforts, including health communication, social mobilization, and planning, to prevent and respond to future outbreaks or sporadic cases of Ebola. \nEbola-related KAP assessments were conducted in Sierra Leone ( 4 ), Liberia ( 5 ), Nigeria ( 6 ), and in one region in Guinea ( 7 ) during Ebola epidemics in 2014\u20132015. To learn more about Ebola-related KAP in Guinea as the nation\u2019s epidemic waned following more than a year of Ebola education and prevention activities, several organizations conducted an Ebola KAP assessment across all administrative regions in August 2015. At that time, cumulative case counts varied substantially across the four natural regions of Guinea (Forest Guinea, Maritime Guinea, Middle Guinea, and Upper Guinea) ( Figure ); previously intense transmission had been controlled in the Forest Guinea region, but transmission persisted in the Maritime Guinea region ( 8 ). Various control measures were implemented, including case investigation and contact tracing, health communication about prevention practices, and specialized treatment units and burial teams to manage persons and corpses affected by Ebola. \nThe assessment employed a cross-sectional design using a multistage cluster sampling procedure. The 2014 Guinea Census List of Enumeration Areas served as the sampling frame for the random selection of 150 clusters across all eight administrative regions, which were grouped by the four natural regions of Guinea. Within each administrative region, prefectures were randomly sampled from among two strata defined by high (\u226595) or low (<95) cumulative counts of confirmed cases that had been reported to the national Ebola surveillance system by May 2015. The sample was further stratified to include both urban and rural subprefectures. Districts within each subprefecture were randomly selected, and 20 households were selected from each cluster using a form of systematic random sampling known as the random walk method. \u2020 In each selected household, two interviews were conducted; the first was with the head of household, and the second was with a randomly selected woman aged \u226525 years or a person of either sex aged 15\u201324 years. Interviews were conducted by locally trained data collectors using a free open-source set of tools to manage mobile data collection ( https://opendatakit.org ), installed on mobile devices. Data were analyzed using statistical software. For each record, weighted estimates adjusted for the probability of participant selection were calculated by applying a factor based on population size of the participant\u2019s administrative region; 95% confidence intervals were generated for overall and regional data. \nData collection teams approached 6,699 persons, 6,273 (94%) of whom (from 3,137 households) consented to initiate the assessment. Among these, 5,733 (91%) persons who reported that they had heard of Ebola before the survey were asked questions for up to 60 minutes about Ebola through individual interviews that included closed- and open-ended questions in local languages, and rarely, in French. These respondents were considered to have completed the survey and were included in the analysis ( Table 1 ). Overall, sociodemographic characteristics did not vary substantially by region, except that participants from Forest Guinea were more likely than other participants to report some formal education and Christian religious affiliations. \nParticipants from the most heavily Ebola-affected regions (Forest Guinea and Martime Guinea) were more likely to have encountered Ebola response teams (61% and 72%, respectively), than were respondents from Middle Guinea (37%) and Upper Guinea (47%) ( Table 2 ). Overall, 15% of participants perceived a high risk for acquiring Ebola; in Maritime Guinea, 25% of participants perceived a high risk. Most participants knew that Ebola is transmitted by contact with body fluids of infected persons (92%) or corpses (87%). However, the misconception that Ebola is transmitted by mosquito bites was reported by 49%, and this belief was reported by 66% of participants in Upper Guinea. Nearly all participants reported taking actions to avoid Ebola (95%), including more frequent handwashing (93%), avoiding contact with persons with suspected Ebola (44%), or avoiding crowds (22%). \nThe majority of participants across all regions (91%) indicated they would send relatives with suspected Ebola to Ebola treatment centers. Most (72%) participants knew that one could survive and recover from Ebola, but such knowledge varied by region, and was lowest in Upper Guinea (58%) and highest in Maritime Guinea (81%). A minority of participants (17%) reported that survivors could infect others through casual contact such as hugging and shaking hands, that they would not buy fresh vegetables from shopkeepers who survived Ebola (28%), and that they would not welcome survivors into their communities (19%). Overall, 44% of participants expressed at least one of those three attitudes toward survivors, and these attitudes were more common in the less-affected regions (Middle Guinea [58%] and Upper Guinea [55%]) than in heavily affected regions (Maritime Guinea [35%] and Forest Guinea [30%]). In contrast, 91% of all participants expressed the opinion that Ebola survivors could contribute to Ebola control, such as through educating community members about Ebola prevention (62%) or caring for Ebola patients (37%) (Table 2). \nWhen asked about intended burial preparations for family members suspected to have died from Ebola at home, only 3% of participants reported that they would wash or touch the body, and most stated that they would accept special Ebola burial teams (89%). Overall, 66% said they would prefer to observe corpses of family members who had died from Ebola from a safe distance at burials, but this attitude varied widely by region (Forest Guinea [90%]; Upper Guinea [83%]; Maritime Guinea [65%]; and Middle Guinea [38%]). Attitudes about other alternatives to touching Ebola-affected corpses also varied by region. When asked about intended burial preparations for family members who died of any cause at home, the majority of participants (72%) indicated they would accept alternatives that did not involve corpse contact, but this attitude was least common among respondents in Forest Guinea (57%). Among 1,082 (20%) participants who had recently attended burials of persons who had died from any cause, a minority reported washing (6%), touching (4%), or crying over the corpse without touching it (27%), but 26% reported touching other burial attendees. Participants from Forest Guinea were more likely to report recently washing (16%) or touching (19%) corpses than were participants from other regions (Table 2). Top Discussion \nEighteen months after the start of a devastating Ebola epidemic, most participants in this geographically diverse sample understood principal aspects of Ebola transmission and prevention, reported taking actions to reduce their risk for acquiring Ebola, and indicated they would use safer case management and burial practices for relatives with suspected Ebola. However, a substantial percentage of participants harbored misconceptions about Ebola transmission or expressed reticence about close proximity to Ebola survivors, including persons certified by the government to be cured of the disease. Although the World Health Organization declared Guinea to be Ebola-free by late 2015, clusters of Ebola cases occurred in 2016, partly through sexual transmission from survivors with persistence of Ebola virus in semen ( 9 ). These data underscore the value of ongoing health promotion efforts to prevent sporadic transmission or future outbreaks, including messaging that aims to reverse misconceptions about Ebola transmission and prevention, to clarify duration and modes of transmission from survivors, and to address stigma that survivors might face as they recover, rebuild their lives, and reintegrate into communities. Regional variations in the epidemic and related response activities might have resulted in the regional differences in attitudes and suggest that targeting health communication by region might be more effective than a uniform, national approach. Underlying differences in customs and traditions across different ethnic populations might have contributed to regional variation in attitudes and behaviors, especially regarding burials. \nThe assessment was the first national-level quantitative evaluation of Ebola-related burial practices among persons who attended a burial in West Africa during a period of ongoing Ebola transmission. It revealed that most participants would forsake traditional burial preparations involving washing or touching Ebola-affected corpses and would adopt safer practices without corpse contact. Compared with residents of other regions, residents of Forest Guinea were far more likely to indicate a preference for keeping a safe distance from Ebola-affected corpses. However, among the subset of persons who had recently attended burials for deaths from any cause, Forest Guinea residents were substantially more likely to have washed or touched corpses than were residents of other regions. The Forest Guinea region was the first region in the country to report Ebola cases and, unlike other regions, had contained its outbreak several months before the survey. This might explain why Forest participants reported a lower perceived risk for Ebola and might have reverted to traditional, high-contact burial practices for persons dying from causes other than Ebola. These findings underscore the observation that changes in cultural practices to combat highly infectious diseases such as Ebola might be transient, and that in-depth community engagement or new resources, such as cadres of professional body washers, might help prevent future transmission of infectious diseases related to corpse contact ( 10 ). \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because of the need to conduct the survey during the ongoing epidemic, interviewers did not validate the comprehension of some survey questions in French or other languages. Second, some participants might have provided socially desirable responses aligned to government recommendations rather than their actual opinions. For instance, government messages to encourage social distancing from Ebola-affected persons during the epidemic might have explained the reticence about close contact with Ebola survivors that some interviewers observed. Third, this analysis did not examine the relation between attitudes and exposure to health promotion interventions or messages. Finally, the sample was not nationally representative because of the partial randomization needed to intentionally oversample heavily affected areas, and the need to seek consent from heads of households, who were usually older men. \nDespite their limitations, the mobile data collection tools permitted generation of preliminary findings that were shared with several organizations in Guinea within a few days of the interviews; this information was used to guide the ongoing response and health communication efforts, which contributed to eventual control of the epidemic. Such rapid KAP surveys, conducted during an outbreak, can provide important information for health communications efforts that can contribute to controlling an outbreak at its source, and thereby enhance global health security.

To estimate child mortality in the absence of reliable vital records, additional data sources are needed. \nWhat is added by this report? \nAssessing multiple death reporting streams, including the 117 phone alert system established during the Ebola virus disease outbreak, improved ascertainment of deaths among children aged <5 years and stillbirths. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nCommunity-based reporting strategies (e.g. phone alerts) can be implemented in countries with incomplete death registration to supplement vital events records and strengthen child mortality surveillance. \nMortality surveillance and vital registration are limited in Sierra Leone, a country with one of the highest mortality rates among children aged <5 years worldwide, approximately 120 deaths per 1,000 live births ( 1 , 2 ). To inform efforts to strengthen surveillance, stillbirths and deaths in children aged <5 years from multiple surveillance streams in Bombali Sebora chiefdom were retrospectively reviewed. In total, during January 2015\u2013November 2016, 930 deaths in children aged <5 years were identified, representing 73.3% of the 1,269 deaths that were expected based on modeled estimates. The \u201c117\u201d telephone alert system established during the Ebola virus disease (Ebola) epidemic captured 683 (73.4%) of all reported deaths in children aged <5 years, and was the predominant reporting source for stillbirths (n = 172). In the absence of complete vital events registration, 117 call alerts markedly improved the completeness of reporting of stillbirths and deaths in children aged <5 years. \nThe 2016 National Civil Registration Act established a new authority in Sierra Leone responsible for recording vital events.* The act is an essential step toward improving national death reporting and registration, which are currently largely paper-based and limited in coverage. Improving death reporting is needed to enhance disease reporting, facilitate more rapid disease control, and enhance global health security. In March 2017, Sierra Leone implemented an electronic reporting system, Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response, which includes facility-based maternal mortality reporting ( 3 ). Discussions are ongoing regarding adding deaths among children aged <5 years to the reporting. Until further improvements in reporting systems are introduced, decision-makers must rely on modeled national mortality rate estimates for children aged <5 years. \nPreparations are underway to implement a Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance (CHAMPS) \u2020 site in Bombali Sebora chiefdom, Bombali District, northern Sierra Leone (population approximately 161,000). CHAMPS seeks to generate high-quality cause-of-death data for children aged <5 years through multifaceted postmortem investigations. A baseline assessment of surveillance for stillbirths and deaths among children aged <5 years was conducted during 2015\u20132016 to guide surveillance strengthening and CHAMPS cause-of-death investigations. \nThe main objectives of the assessment were to assess the relative contributions of different reporting mechanisms to death ascertainment and to evaluate reporting completeness by comparing the number of documented deaths with national mortality estimates calculated from modeling. Eligible cases were defined as stillbirths and deaths among resident Bombali Sebora children aged <5 years that occurred from January 1, 2015 through November 25, 2016. \nData from three existing reporting streams were used in this analysis. The first was the 117 telephone alert system; the second included records from eight Bombali Sebora health facilities, and the third contained vital records from the Makeni Office of Births and Deaths. The toll-free 117 phone alert system was established in August 2014 to allow rapid notification and investigation of suspected Ebola cases and all deaths from the community ( 4 ). After the epidemic, the phone alert system remained in place under a policy of mandatory death reporting and Ebola testing, and changed to report all deaths in July 2016. Telephone alert calls peaked in October 2014 at >11,000 per week; by December 2016, calls had decreased to <500 per week. \nData on stillbirths and deaths in children aged <5 years from handwritten health facility and Office of Births and Deaths records were abstracted into prepared excel spreadsheets. Deaths were linked across data sources using the child\u2019s name (or the mother\u2019s name for stillbirths), date of death or stillbirth, age, sex, residence address, and location of death as identifiers. Because denominators for calculating rates and expected numbers of stillbirths and deaths among children aged <5 years in Bombali Sebora were unavailable, expected numbers of stillbirths and deaths were calculated \u00a7 using national mortality rates for all children aged <5 years (approximately 120 of 1,000 live births)( 1 , 2 ), infants (death during the first year of life; 87 per 1,000), and neonates (deaths during the first 28 days of life; 35 per 1,000 live births), national stillbirth rate (27 per 1,000 births)( 4 ), and crude estimates of the birth rate (34.2 births per 1,000 population) ( 5 , 6 ). \nAfter consolidation and deduplication of records identified in the three data sources, 172 unique stillbirths and 930 unique deaths among children aged <5 years were identified, including 249 neonatal deaths (27%), 247 (27%) deaths in infants aged 1\u201311 months, and 434 (47%) deaths in children aged 1\u20134 years ( Figure ) ( Table ). Death reports from health facilities and vital records were lowest in early 2015, when multiple facilities remained closed because of the Ebola epidemic. There was minimal overlap among the different reporting streams: only 11% of deaths were reported through more than one source (Figure). The majority of deaths (600; 65%) were documented through 117 phone alert only, followed by 20% (187) through health facilities only, and 5% (45) through vital records only. The proportion of deaths reported by phone alert decreased from 81% in 2015 to 65% in 2016. The percentage of expected deaths that were reported declined from 92% in 2015 to 53% in 2016. The number of infant deaths reported varied most from the number expected: reported infant deaths were 70% of expected in 2015 and 37% of expected in 2016. \nAmong an expected 277 stillbirths, 172 (62%) were reported. A majority of stillbirths were reported through phone alert (107; 62%) or health facility records only (53; 31%), with one stillbirth identified through a death record, and 11 (6%) by more than one source. Stillbirth reporting patterns were inconsistent over time and information on gestational age at delivery was rarely available. Top Discussion \nOn the basis of the national estimates used for these analyses, stillbirths and deaths in children aged <5 years are underreported in Bombali Sebora chiefdom; use of all available sources is needed to improve death reporting in this chiefdom. The 117 phone alert system captured community-based deaths and stillbirths not recorded through health facility and vital records. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, expected stillbirths and deaths were calculated based on point estimates; therefore, comparisons with reported cases should be interpreted with caution. Second, case misclassification might have occurred because of age estimation errors and inconsistent application of a standard case definition for stillbirths. Stillbirth classification was largely self-defined by reporters, and there is a high likelihood that certain spontaneous miscarriages and early neonatal deaths were included. Finally, when interpreting trends in stillbirth and child mortality over time, it is important to note that separating the effects of the Ebola epidemic on child mortality from changes in reporting and documentation was not possible. For example, the July 2016 change to nonmandatory 117 death reporting would be expected to lead to a decline in death reporting through this source; however, the contribution of this change to the proportion of expected deaths that were reported could not be determined. Despite these limitations, the findings in this report indicate that surveillance in this setting can be strengthened by using multiple data sources, which together capture both community and facility deaths. These findings also demonstrate that community-based reporting strategies, such as phone alerts, can be implemented in countries with incomplete death registration to supplement vital events records. \nSierra Leone continues to use the 117 phone alert system to improve national disease surveillance and plans are in place to include the system for death reporting as part of enhanced child mortality surveillance through CHAMPS in Sierra Leone. Additional strategies are needed to improve overall child morality surveillance and to promote post-Ebola community participation in death reporting using the 117 phone alert system.

All patients had severe respiratory depression, loss of consciousness, or both, and some required high naloxone doses and mechanical ventilation. Two patients reported taking one or two pills that they believed to be Percocet, purchased without a prescription, on the street. \nThe Georgia Poison Center notified area hospitals and a Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) epidemiologist, who informed partners, including 1) health district epidemiologists, who worked with hospitals; 2) the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which performed drug testing; 3) the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area office, which notified law enforcement; 4) local coroners, who reported related deaths to GDPH; and 5) the GDPH Office of Emergency Medical Services (EMS), which notified EMS providers and the medical community. A coordinated communication effort led to two multiagency press conferences on June 6 to notify the public about the presence of the dangerous counterfeit pills. \nA counterfeit Percocet cluster case was defined as 1) an opioid toxidrome (i.e., with central nervous system depression, respiratory depression, and pupillary miosis) requiring resuscitation, ventilation, naloxone, or all three; 2) a history of purchasing street pills; and 3) ingestion of as few as one or two pills, resulting in disproportionately severe central nervous system, respiratory, or cardiovascular depression occurring in a person evaluated by EMS or at an ED since June 1, 2017 ( 1 ). During June 6\u201313, EMS providers and EDs reported possible cases daily, and district epidemiologists reviewed medical records to determine whether patients met the case definition. Concomitant syndromic surveillance was conducted by reviewing Georgia statewide ED admission data received daily, using a text-search for drug overdose syndrome. This surveillance was used to determine whether the cluster extended beyond the initially identified area. Local law enforcement personnel delivered pills obtained from one patient to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation crime laboratory for chemical analysis. \nSyndromic surveillance demonstrated a sharp increase in overdoses reported by EDs on June 5 ( Figure ). Chemical analysis of obtained pills identified cyclopropyl fentanyl and U-47700, two rare and potent illicit synthetic opioids. The source of the pill was not identified. \nAmong the 37 possible cases reported initially (including five deaths), 27 cases (including one death) that occurred during June 4\u201313 met the counterfeit Percocet cluster case definition. Of the 27 patients, 16 (59%) were male, and 19 (70%) were black; median age was 34 years (range = 19\u201369 years). Symptoms included loss of consciousness (25 patients [93%]) and respiratory distress (22 [81%]). Twenty-five (93%) patients received naloxone, and 11 (41%) required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Routine urine drug screens were positive for multiple drugs in 16 (59%) patients; synthetic opioids are not detected by these screens. \nE-mail descriptions of the pills and related overdoses were sent from the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area office to law enforcement personnel and from GDPH to EMS and the medical community to alert all to the danger of these pills and how to prevent occupational exposure ( 2 ), to note that Georgia law specifies a naloxone standing order allowing anyone to purchase it ( 3 ), and to share the CDC opioid prescribing guideline with prescribers ( 4 ). Rapid identification, notification, public messaging, and a coordinated response among members of the health care community, public health agencies, and law enforcement personnel contributed to curtailing this outbreak.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "georgia north-central health district", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "georgia bureau of investigation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gdph office of emergency medical services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia poison center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia department of public health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T21:48:24.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "09b7c305fd1e26ec5859f96017066e9d545e8419", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvRKTr.2kT6LXTQJRh.aItGA-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=5", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)", "title": "Announcement: Community Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Comprehensive Telehealth Methods to Deliver Dietary Interventions for Chronic Disease Management", "title_full": "Announcement: Community Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Comprehensive Telehealth Methods to Deliver Dietary Interventions for Chronic Disease Management", "published": "2017-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/socialmedia_logo_600x300_72dp_fw.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "09b7c305fd1e26ec5859f96017066e9d545e8419", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvRKTr.2kT6LXTQJRh.aItGA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Announcement: Community Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation for Comprehensive Telehealth Methods to Deliver Dietary Interventions for Chronic Disease Management", "text": "View suggested citation \nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) recently posted new information on its recommendation regarding telehealth interventions to supplement the care of adults with chronic diseases affected by diet. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHealth Information Technology: Comprehensive Telehealth to Deliver Dietary Interventions to Patients with Chronic Diseases\u00e2\u0080\u009d is available at https://www.thecommunityguide.org/findings/health-information-technology-comprehensive-telehealth-deliver-dietary-interventions . \nEstablished in 1996 by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the CPSTF is an independent, nonfederal panel of public health and prevention experts whose members are appointed by the director of CDC.

Understanding differences in illicit drug use, illicit drug use disorders, and overall drug overdose deaths in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas is important for informing public health programs, interventions, and policies. \nReporting Period: Illicit drug use and drug use disorders during 2003\u20132014, and drug overdose deaths during 1999\u20132015. \nDescription of Data: The National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) collects information through face-to-face household interviews about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population aged \u226512 years. Respondents include residents of households and noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories, migratory workers\u2019 camps, and halfway houses) and civilians living on military bases. NSDUH variables include sex, age, race/ethnicity, residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan), annual household income, self-reported drug use, and drug use disorders. \nNational Vital Statistics System Mortality (NVSS-M) data for U.S. residents include information from death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Cases were selected with an underlying cause of death based on the ICD-10 codes for drug overdoses (X40\u2013X44, X60\u2013X64, X85, and Y10\u2013Y14). NVSS-M variables include decedent characteristics (sex, age, and race/ethnicity) and information on intent (unintentional, suicide, homicide, or undetermined), location of death (medical facility, in a home, or other [including nursing homes, hospices, unknown, and other locations]) and county of residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan). \nMetropolitan/nonmetropolitan status is assigned independently in each data system. NSDUH uses a three-category system: Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) of \u22651 million persons; CBSA of <1 million persons; and not a CBSA, which for simplicity were labeled large metropolitan, small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan. Deaths from NVSS-M are categorized by the county of residence of the decedent using CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics 2013 Urban-Rural Classification Scheme, collapsed into two categories (metropolitan and nonmetropolitan). \nResults: Although both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas experienced significant increases from 2003\u20132005 to 2012\u20132014 in self-reported past-month use of illicit drugs, the prevalence was highest for the large metropolitan areas compared with small metropolitan or nonmetropolitan areas throughout the study period. Notably, past-month use of illicit drugs declined over the study period for the youngest respondents (aged 12\u201317 years). The prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders among persons using illicit drugs in the past year varied by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status and changed over time. Across both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, the prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders declined during 2003\u20132014. \nIn 2015, approximately six times as many drug overdose deaths occurred in metropolitan areas than occurred in nonmetropolitan areas (metropolitan: 45,059; nonmetropolitan: 7,345). Drug overdose death rates (per 100,000 population) for metropolitan areas were higher than in nonmetropolitan areas in 1999 (6.4 versus 4.0), however, the rates converged in 2004, and by 2015, the nonmetropolitan rate (17.0) was slightly higher than the metropolitan rate (16.2). \nInterpretation: Drug use and subsequent overdoses continue to be a critical and complicated public health challenge across metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas. The decline in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders in rural areas during 2012\u20132014 are encouraging signs. However, the increasing rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas, which surpassed rates in urban areas, is cause for concern. \nPublic Health Actions: Understanding the differences between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in drug use, drug use disorders, and drug overdose deaths can help public health professionals to identify, monitor, and prioritize responses. Consideration of where persons live and where they die from overdose could enhance specific overdose prevention interventions, such as training on naloxone administration or rescue breathing. Educating prescribers on CDC\u2019s guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain (Dowell D, Haegerich TM, Chou R. CDC guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain\u2014United States, 2016. MMWR Recomm Rep 2016;66[No. RR-1]) and facilitating better access to medication-assisted treatment with methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone could benefit communities with high opioid use disorder rates. Top Introduction \nDuring 1999\u20132014, annual age-adjusted death rates for the five leading causes of death in the United States (heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, chronic lower respiratory disease, and stroke) were higher in rural (nonmetropolitan) areas than in urban (metropolitan) areas ( 1 ). Many factors influence the rural-urban mortality gap, including socioeconomic differences, health-related behaviors, and access to health care services. Residents of rural areas in the United States tend to be poorer and sicker than their urban counterparts, with rural residents in the South and West experiencing some of the most adverse health outcome ( 2 ). \nIn each year during 1999\u20132015, all-cause injury death rates were higher in nonmetropolitan areas of the United States than they were in metropolitan areas ( 3 ), and previous studies indicate that rates of drug overdose death and drug use varied markedly by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status ( 4 \u2013 6 ). Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of injury death in the United States, and although prescription drugs were primarily responsible for the rapid expansion of this large and growing public health crisis, illicit drugs (heroin, illicit fentanyl, cocaine, and methamphetamines) now are contributing substantially to the problem ( 7 ). Age-adjusted death rates for drug overdoses varied by the drug involved and the level of urbanization. For example, natural and semisynthetic opioid-related drug overdose death rates were highest and heroin-related drug overdose death rates were lowest in nonmetropolitan areas in 2015 compared with other levels of urbanicity ( 7 ). \nA growing body of literature describes various aspects of the drug overdose epidemic and population density ( 4 , 6 , 8 , 9 ). Risk factors within metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status are a complicated mix of type of drug used (licit versus illicit), recreational versus pharmaceutical use, the combinations of drugs used, routes of administration (e.g., injection versus oral administration), the amount of drugs prescribed, the place used (home versus community), knowledge of potential adverse outcomes, access to overdose reversal drugs, and access to emergency services and substance abuse treatment services. \nThis report examines trends in drug use, drug use disorders, and overdose deaths in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas of the United States through analyses of 2003\u20132014 National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) data and 1999\u20132015 National Vital Statistics System Mortality (NVSS-M) data. Public health professionals and clinicians can use these findings to identify specific subgroups and rural/urban groups in need of targeted interventions. Methods Data Sources \nDrug use and drug use disorder data were from the 2003\u20132014 NSDUH, which is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality ( https://www.samhsa.gov/data/population-data-nsduh ). NSDUH collects information through face-to-face household interviews about the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among the U.S. noninstitutionalized civilian population aged \u226512 years. Respondents include residents of households and noninstitutional group quarters (e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories, migratory workers\u2019 camps, and halfway houses) and civilians living on military bases. An independent, multistage area probability sample design for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia allows for the production of state-level and urban status (county of residence) estimates. \nMortality data for U.S. residents were from the 1999\u20132015 NVSS-M, which is based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Deaths of nonresidents (e.g., nonresident aliens; nationals living abroad; and residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories) were excluded. Mortality data are provided to CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program and coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) by NCHS. Analyses were restricted to deaths with an underlying cause of death based on the ICD-10 codes for drug overdoses (X40\u2013X44, X60\u2013X64, X85, and Y10\u2013Y14) ( 10 ). Variables \nNSDUH variables included sex, age, race/ethnicity, residence (metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area), annual household income, self-reported drug use, and drug use disorders. Metropolitan/nonmetropolitan status was coded using NSDUH\u2019s Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) measure, which was available across the study period. This measure uses three segments of population density: CBSA with population of \u22651 million persons (large metropolitan); CBSA with population of <1 million persons (small metropolitan); and not a CBSA (nonmetropolitan) ( 11 , 12 ). For this report, CBSAs with populations \u22651 million persons and <1 million persons were considered metropolitan and those classed as \u201cnot a CBSA\u201d were considered nonmetropolitan. \nSelf-reported drug use in NSDUH included past-month use of illicit drugs (marijuana/hashish, cocaine [including crack], inhalants, hallucinogens, or heroin) or nonmedical use of prescription-type drugs (opioids, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants). The presence of a past-year illicit drug use disorder was defined using criteria specified within the 4th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which include symptoms such as withdrawal, tolerance, use in dangerous situations, trouble with the law, and interference with major obligations at work, school, or home ( 13 ). Respondents were asked questions about substance use disorders if they had reported use of illicit drugs in the past 12 months. The full survey instrument is available at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NAHDAP/studies/36361 . \nNVSS-M variables included decedent characteristics (sex, age, and race/ethnicity) and information on the intent (unintentional, suicide, homicide, or undetermined) and location of death (medical facility, in a home, or other [including nursing homes, hospices, unknown, and other locations], and county of residence [metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area]). Location of death might be different from location of drug use. NVSS-M suppression rules include not reporting cell counts with <10 persons and rates are considered unreliable for <20 deaths. Deaths were categorized as metropolitan or nonmetropolitan based on the county of residence. Nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas were identified using the NCHS 2013 county-based classification scheme ( 14 ). The six NCHS classification levels for counties are: 1) large central metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with \u22651 million population and covers a principal city; 2) large fringe metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with \u22651 million population but does not cover a principal city; 3) medium metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with \u2265250,000 but <1 million population; 4) small metropolitan: part of a metropolitan statistical area with <250,000 population; 5) micropolitan (nonmetropolitan): part of a micropolitan statistical area (has an urban cluster of \u226510,000 but <50,000 population); and 6) noncore (nonmetropolitan): not part of a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical area. For a dichotomous measure, metropolitan (urban) combines categories 1\u20134 and nonmetropolitan (rural) combines 5 and 6. Data Analysis \nOn the basis of NSDUH data, overall prevalence of past-month illicit drug use was estimated for four 3-year periods (2003\u20132005, 2006\u20132008, 2009\u20132011, and 2012\u20132014), by CBSA designation, sex, age group, race, and annual household income. Prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorder among persons reporting past-year illicit drug use was calculated by large metropolitan, small metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas for the four periods, overall, and by sex. Estimates were weighted based on the complex sample design and sampling weights of the NSDUH. Years were pooled to improve the precision of estimates and enable comparisons across subgroups. Logistic regression models (presence of drug use or drug use disorder) tested p-values of beta coefficients of the year variable to assess statistically significant (p <0.05) changes in trends. Percentage change was calculated by comparing the early period (2003\u20132005) with the last period (2012\u20132014). The analysis of trends in age-adjusted death rates during 1999\u20132015 included all ages; death rates per 100,000 persons were adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population by the direct method ( 10 ). Results National Survey of Drug Use and Health \nFrom 2003\u20132005 to 2012\u20132014, the prevalence of past-month use of illicit drugs was highest in large metropolitan areas ( Table 1 ). All three urban status groups (large metropolitan, small metropolitan, and nonmetropolitan) experienced significant increases in the prevalence of past-month drug use overall. Prevalence was higher for males than females during all time intervals in all urban status groups. However, in the large metropolitan group, the percentage increase in prevalence from 2003\u20132005 to 2012\u20132014 was greater for females (23.4%) than for males (21.6%). The prevalence of illicit drug use among nonmetropolitan females remained stable during the study period. \nDuring 2012\u20132014, respondents aged 18\u201325 years had the highest prevalence of past-month use of illicit drugs for all urban levels (Table 1). For respondents in this age group, the prevalence increased slightly from 2003\u20132005 to 2012\u20132014 in large metropolitan areas (13.8%) while the prevalence remained stable among small metropolitan area respondents and nonmetropolitan respondents. Past-month use of illicit drugs declined over the study period for the youngest respondents (aged 12\u201317 years), with the largest decline among small metropolitan area youth. Past-month use of illicit drugs increased significantly among all three urban areas among persons aged 26\u201334 years and those aged \u226535 years. \nPrevalence of past-month illicit drug use increased among both non-Hispanic whites and other races for both large and small metropolitan areas (Table 1). Prevalence did not change among non-Hispanic white nonmetropolitan respondents nor among nonmetropolitan respondents of other races. When past-month illicit drug use was examined by annual household income, respondents with an annual household income <$20,000 had the highest prevalence across all three geographic groups. Persons living in large metropolitan areas with a household income of <$20,000 experienced the largest increase in past-month illicit drug use during the study period (37.6%), followed by nonmetropolitan residents with a household income of $20,000\u2013$49,999 (29.8%). \nThe prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders among persons reporting illicit drug use in the past year varied by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area and sex, and changed over time ( Figure 1 ). All three geographic groups experienced statistically significant declines in overall prevalence of drug use disorders during the study period. For residents in large metropolitan areas, prevalence declined 12.6%. For residents in small metropolitan areas, prevalence declined 20.7% from 20.8% during 2003\u20132005 to 16.5% during 2012\u20132014. Among nonmetropolitan residents, the prevalence of past-year illicit drug use disorders decreased 12.8%, from 18.8% during 2003\u20132005 to 16.4% during 2012\u20132014. During 2012\u20132014, prevalence rates were similar across the three geographic groups. \nMales who reported illicit drug use in the past year consistently had higher prevalence of illicit drug use disorders compared with females. In general, females experienced consistently larger declines during the study period. The prevalence of illicit drug use disorders among females declined 14.9% among those living in large metropolitan areas, 19.3% among those living in small metropolitan areas, and 23.0% among nonmetropolitan residents. The prevalence of illicit drug use disorders declined significantly in metropolitan areas for males and females. The decline in prevalence of illicit drug use disorders among nonmetropolitan residents was significant overall and for males during the study period. National Vital Statistics System \nIn 2015, nearly six times as many drug overdose deaths were reported in metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan areas (metropolitan: 45,059; nonmetropolitan: 7,345) in the United States ( Table 2 ). The overall percentage change in the number of deaths for nonmetropolitan areas over the time period was 325% (the percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 was 330%; data not reported). Although age-adjusted drug overdose death rates for metropolitan areas were higher than in nonmetropolitan areas in 1999 (6.4 versus 4.0, respectively), the rates converged in 2004 (9.4 in both areas), and in 2015 the nonmetropolitan rate (17.0) was slightly higher than the metropolitan rate (16.2). \nThe age-adjusted drug overdose death rate for females was higher in metropolitan areas during 1999\u20132003 and higher in nonmetropolitan areas thereafter (Table 1). The difference in rates (per 100,000 population) between areas was greatest in 2015 (metropolitan: 11.5; nonmetropolitan: 14.3). The percentage change in the number of drug overdose deaths for females increased nearly 350% in nonmetropolitan areas during 1999\u20132015 (the percentage change in the age-adjusted death rate per 100,000 persons was 360%). The drug overdose death rate for males was higher in metropolitan areas in all years except 2010 and 2011 with the largest difference between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan rates occurring in 1999 (metropolitan: 8.8; nonmetropolitan: 4.8). \nDuring 1999\u20132015, age-adjusted drug overdose death rates varied by race/ethnicity and metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area. American Indians/Alaska Natives had the highest drug overdose death rates in 2015 (metropolitan: 22.1; nonmetropolitan: 19.8) and the largest percentage change increase in the number of deaths over time (nonmetropolitan: 519%) (Table 2). During 1999\u20132001, black decedents in metropolitan areas had the highest death rates compared to other race/ethnicity categories; the rate for white decedents in metropolitan areas was highest in 2002 and 2007, and the rate was highest in remaining years for American Indians/Alaska Natives residing in metropolitan areas. Rates for white decedents (metropolitan: 21.4) were similar to American Indians/Alaska Natives in 2015. Drug overdose death rates were lowest among Asians/Pacific Islanders in all years. \nNonmetropolitan unintentional age-adjusted overdose death rates changed from 2.5 in 1999 to 14.2 in 2015 (Table 2). Metropolitan unintentional overdose death rates changed from 4.3 in 1999 to 13.8 in 2015. Rates of suicide overdose deaths were similar in metropolitan (1.5) and nonmetropolitan (1.6) areas in 2015. \nAll age group categories showed increases in drug overdose deaths from 1999 to 2015 (Table 2). The percentage change increase in age-specific drug overdose deaths from 1999 to 2015 was higher for nonmetropolitan areas than metropolitan areas for persons aged \u226512 years, with the largest increase in drug overdose deaths (411%) among those aged 18\u201325 years. Nonmetropolitan drug overdose death rates in 2015 were higher than metropolitan rates for those aged 26\u201334 years. \nMore age-adjusted drug overdose deaths occurred in a home versus in a medical facility or other location in each year for both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas ( Table 3 ). The distribution changed over time, however, and the percentage of deaths that occurred in a home increased from 1999 to 2015 in both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas (1999 metropolitan: 45.2% versus 2015 metropolitan: 51.7%; 1999 nonmetropolitan: 43.3% versus 2015 nonmetropolitan: 53.5%). \nThe increasing trends for males and females in age-adjusted drug overdose death rates varied by the six urban levels ( Figure 2 ). Drug overdose death rates had a greater range by level of urban status for males in 1999 (noncore = 4.5 to large central metropolitan = 11.8) than in 2015 (noncore = 18.4 to medium metropolitan = 23.0). Converse patterns were observed for females (1999 range: noncore = 2.9 large central metropolitan = 4.9; 2015 range: large central metropolitan = 9.9 to micropolitan nonmetropolitan = 14.6). At the beginning of the study period, death rates were higher in metropolitan areas than in nonmetropolitan areas, but the rates converged over time. Top Discussion \nThis report presents an overview of illicit drug use, illicit drug use disorders, and drug overdose deaths for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas in the United States. The findings of this study indicate that trends varied. On the one hand, the decline in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders are encouraging signs. On the other hand, the increasing rate of drug overdose deaths in rural areas, which surpassed rates in urban areas, is cause for concern. Regardless of metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area, illicit drug use among youth generally declined over a 10-year period, but increased substantially in other age groups (aged 26\u201334 and \u226535 years). Declines in prescription opioid use disorders have also been demonstrated among persons aged 12\u201317 years ( 15 ). The percentage change increase between 1999 and 2015 in overdose deaths among nonmetropolitan residents is concerning and carries across sex, race, and intent. The type of drug involved in overdose deaths varies by metropolitan/nonmetropolitan area with rates of heroin and cocaine related overdose deaths being higher in more urban areas ( 7 ); however, monitoring trends in use and drugs involved in overdoses is critical as they have changed rapidly in recent years ( 16 ). Although past-month use of illicit drugs was lower in nonmetropolitan areas compared to metropolitan areas, the prevalence of drug use disorders among people reporting past-year illicit drug use in nonmetropolitan areas was similar to that in metropolitan areas. Studies have found that persons with substance use disorders are at higher risk for drug use-related morbidity and mortality ( 17 ). Further, given research indicating that nonmetropolitan areas have less access to substance abuse treatment services ( 18 ) and other risk reduction strategies ( 19 ), the similar prevalence of drug use disorders in this study underscores the importance of scaling up these critical interventions in nonmetropolitan areas. \nBecause of the involvement of prescription opioids in the current epidemic ( 20 ), monitoring prescribing levels along with understanding the local illicit drug trade is important for prevention efforts. Recent studies suggest that a leveling off and decline has occurred in opioid prescribing rates since 2012 and in high-dose prescribing rates since 2009 ( 7 ). However, overall opioid prescribing remained high in 2015 and the amounts prescribed varied by level of urbanization ( 21 ). Reducing the number of persons initially exposed to prescription opioids might reduce the illicit use of opioids, the subsequent risk of addiction, and the use of illicit drugs ( 22 ). \nInterventions for drug overdoses, such as naloxone administration, rescue breathing, or calling 911, are most useful when someone is present to administer them. In both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, the majority of overdose deaths occurred in a home, and rescue care could fall to friends or relatives who might lack knowledge about naloxone administration and follow-up care. In private locations, such as homes, bystanders might not know to call for emergency services after giving naloxone ( 23 ). Further, naloxone is less often administered by emergency medical technicians-basics (persons trained to provide basic-level life support), who are more common in rural areas ( 24 ) than paramedics (who can provide advanced life support care). Legislation designed to improve access to naloxone by laypersons is now present in all 50 states and the District of Columbia ( 25 ). \nAlthough prevalence rates of drug use in rural areas are lower in this report, the consequences of use appear to be higher. For example, an investigation of HIV infections linked to the injection of prescription opioids found that the majority of the counties at high risk for rapid dissemination of hepatitis C virus or HIV were in rural areas ( 26 ). Access to substance abuse treatment services is more limited in rural areas ( 27 ) and strengthening the health care delivery system while improving the integration of primary, specialty, and substance abuse services can provide the nexus of care needed to reduce drug misuse ( 28 \u2013 31 ). Specific interventions to address overdose deaths in rural areas have been discussed previously ( 25 ) and might include actions such as expanding the types of emergency medical service providers that can administer naloxone to reverse a drug overdose. In addition, the following resources can assist providers and communities in efforts to reduce misuse and overdose: \nCDC\u2019s rural health website ( https://www.cdc.gov/ruralhealth/ ) and the Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain resource page ( https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/prescribing/resources.html ; \nthe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration\u2019s Opioid Overdose Toolkit ( https://store.samhsa.gov/shin/content//SMA14-4742/Overdose_Toolkit.pdf ) or the Bureau of Justice Assistance Law Enforcement Naloxone Toolkit website ( https://www.bjatraining.org/tools/naloxone/Naloxone-Background ); \nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services resource of tools and information for families, health care providers, law enforcement, and other stakeholders about prescription drug abuse and heroin use prevention, treatment, and response ( https://www.hhs.gov/opioids ); and \nthe Rural Health Information Hub\u2019s toolkit, which provides evidence-based examples, promising models, program best practices, and resources that can be used to implement substance abuse prevention and treatment programs ( https://www.ruralhealthinfo.org/community-health/substance-abuse ). Top Limitations \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least six limitations. First, NSDUH is a self-reported survey and is subject to recall bias and social desirability; however, good validity and reliability have been found for substance use measured by NSDUH ( 32 ). Second, NSDUH excluded persons who were homeless and not living in shelters or persons residing in institutions, which could lead to underestimates in drug use and drug use disorders. Some areas might change in their urbanization categorization over time; however, few would have changed from the larger grouping of metropolitan to nonmetropolitan ( 14 ). In addition, the 2013 NCHS county-based classification scheme was used for the entire time period for parsimony. Although metropolitan/nonmetropolitan areas were not directly comparable between the two data systems, results demonstrate that it is important to consider the rural to urban continuum of population density for drug use and overdose. Third, overdose deaths are likely underestimated because lengthy investigations are often required including toxicology assessments and this sometimes results in a death being categorized as \u201cpending manner and cause of death\u201d at the time mortality files are closed and shared with NCHS. It was not possible to analyze this underestimation by urban level directly. Fourth, because of the misclassification of race/ethnicity of decedents on death certificates, the actual numbers of deaths for certain racial/ethnic populations (e.g., American Indians/Alaska Natives and Hispanics) might be underestimated by up to 35% ( 33 ). Fifth, because information on intent might be coded in the mortality file even though the case could still be under investigation, it might be difficult to determine whether a death should be certified as suicide or unintentional ( 34 ). Finally, the time periods were different between the two data systems (NVSS-M: 1999\u20132015; NSDUH: 2003\u20132014), so the duration of change over time varied. Top Conclusion \nDrug use and subsequent overdoses continue to be a critical and complicated public health challenge. Variations and trends in drug overdose death rates by urban status differed by sex and race/ethnicity and trends among these subgroups indicate that certain groups are more profoundly affected by the epidemic than others. The decline in illicit drug use by youth and the lower prevalence of illicit drug use disorders in rural areas during 2012\u20132014 are encouraging signs. However, the rising death rate of drug overdoses in rural areas, which surpassed rates in urban areas, along with persistent limited access to substance abuse treatment services in rural areas is cause for concern. Educating opioid prescribers on the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain ( 35 ) and better access to evidence-based substance abuse treatment, including medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction, are critical steps that can be taken in communities heavily impacted by substance abuse.

Prevalence of Single and Multiple Leading Causes of Death by Race/Ethnicity Among People Aged 60 to 70 Years. Prev Chronic Dis 2017;14:160241. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd14.160241 . PEER REVIEWED   \nDiabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) (coronary artery disease, heart attack, and angina pectoris), and chronic lung disease (emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are major causes of death in the United States. The objective of this study was to assess racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of these conditions as cause of death among people aged 60 to 79 years with one or more of these conditions. \nMethods \nWe used data on the prevalence of major chronic conditions from the National Health Interview Survey on 56,280 adults aged 60 to 79 years who reported having any of the chronic conditions assessed in the National Health Interview Survey for 2006 through 2014. We compared trends with age for 11 single and multiple conditions. Analyses employed multinomial logistic regression models. \nResults \nHispanics and non-Hispanic blacks had the greatest prevalence of diabetes, and non-Hispanic whites had the greatest prevalence of cancer and chronic lung disease. The prevalence of multiple chronic diseases in an individual varied less by race/ethnicity. An exception was the prevalence of having both diabetes and CVD, which was higher among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks than non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic blacks aged 65 years and 75 years had higher odds of having diabetes and cancer than non-Hispanic whites at the same ages. Hispanics had lower odds of having CVD with cancer or chronic lung disease than non-Hispanic whites. Women had a lower age-specific prevalence than men for most of the 11 single and multiple conditions. Most chronic diseases showed an inverse relationship with education and a higher prevalence in the South than in other regions. \nConclusion \nStrong racial/ethnic differences exist in the prevalence of single chronic conditions, but differences are lower for prevalence of multiple conditions. Comparing race/ethnicities, the same disease dyads and triads may occur more often in different orders. Top Introduction \nThe segment of the US population aged 65 years or older has been growing, especially among ethnically diverse groups. Hispanic populations make up a rapidly growing proportion of the US older (>65 y) population (1,2). With this aging of the population, the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions in an individual has increased to approximately 75% of Americans aged 65 or older (3), and this proportion has been increasing among non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics (4). \nMultimorbidity \u2014 the presence of more than one disease in a person \u2014 affects death rates, health-related quality of life, and use of health care. A study of Medicare beneficiaries found that the mean annual health care costs for a person with chronic conditions were $7,172 for 1 condition, $14,931 for 2, and $32,498 for 3 or more (5). Moreover, approximately 66% of total US health care spending is associated with care for people with multiple chronic conditions (3). The most prevalent disease dyads are hypertension in combination with arthritis, diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease, heart attack, and angina pectoris) and arthritis in combination with diabetes or cancer (6). The most common triads are arthritis and hypertension in combination with diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease. In addition, a recent study from Denmark documented a high co-occurrence of mental and somatic disorders, emphasizing the complexity of multimorbidity (7). \nThe prevalence of multiple chronic conditions varies by race/ethnicity. After adjustment for age, sex, and other factors, non-Hispanic blacks have a higher prevalence of multimorbidity than non-Hispanic whites (6,8\u201311), and Hispanic populations have a lower prevalence of multimorbidity than non-Hispanic whites (6,10). These findings are consistent with what is known as the Hispanic paradox, which refers to the relatively good health of Hispanic people despite their relatively low socioeconomic status (12,13). \nWe conducted a comprehensive assessment of how the prevalence and nature of the combinations of the leading causes of death in the United States differ among non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic whites, and Hispanics according to age, sex, geographic region, and education level. The goal of this study was to examine racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of single and multiple chronic conditions in a national sample of older (60\u201379 y) Americans. Top Methods \nWe evaluated prevalence data on 56,280 adults aged 60 to 79 years who responded to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 2006 through 2014. We compared racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of single and multiple chronic conditions in an individual by age, sex, geographic region, and education. The study population was participants in NHIS for 2006 through 2014. NHIS is a voluntary, cross-sectional household interview survey conducted annually. Sampling and interviewing are continuous throughout each year. NHIS uses a complex, multistage sample design to survey the health of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population (14). The survey excludes residents of nursing homes and residential care facilities, populations with a high prevalence of chronic conditions (15). We studied NHIS participants aged 60 to 79 years who self-identified as non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, or Hispanic. This age range encompasses the population with the highest prevalence of many major chronic conditions (16). NHIS collects information on health disorders from one randomly sampled adult per family, although additional information is collected on all adults in the family. Participants in our study were those who reported to NHIS that they had been told by a health care provider that they had the following diseases: diabetes, coronary heart disease, a heart attack, angina pectoris, diabetes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer). These diseases are leading causes of death in the United States (16). \nAll variables except age were classified into categories for analysis. Races/ethnicities were non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Hispanic. Geographic regions were the East, Midwest, West, and South. Education was coded as less than a high school diploma, high school diploma or general equivalency degree, some college (with or without an associate degree), and a college degree or professional school degree (eg, MD, DDS, DVM, JD). Chronic conditions were classified into 4 categories: 1) diabetes; 2) cardiovascular disease (CVD) (coronary artery disease, heart attack, and angina pectoris); 3) chronic lung disease (emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); and 4) cancer, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer. Participants were asked if a doctor or other health care provider had ever told them that they had one or more of these chronic conditions. The presence of chronic bronchitis was based on whether participants had ever been told by a doctor or other health care provider in the past 12 months that they had chronic bronchitis. The presence of the other chronic conditions was based on whether participants had ever been told by a doctor or other health care provider that they had that condition. Participants were classified by the presence of combinations of the 4 chronic conditions. Race/ethnicity was first categorized as Hispanic/Spanish origin or not (ie, Hispanic), and secondarily by white or black/African American (ie, non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black). \nAll statistical analyses consisted of the strata, cluster, and weight variables provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to give valid estimates from the complex NHIS design. Preliminary analyses summarized the frequencies of study variables by race/ethnicity. Subsequent analyses used regression models treating the various categories of single and multiple chronic conditions as outcomes. Associations of predictor variables with these outcomes were modeled by using multinomial logistic regression. The models included age, a series of indicators for participating in the survey years (yes or no), indicators for the race/ethnicity categories, and interaction terms between age and the race/ethnicity indicators. Results are presented for the 11 disease categories with the largest samples sizes. Because of the high prevalence of diabetes, and because diabetes is an underlying cause of several chronic conditions, results are stratified by the presence or absence of diabetes. The presence of both cancer and chronic lung disease was the rarest combination, and those results are not included because of small numbers. The probabilities of having the various disease outcomes were calculated from the regression results as described by Agresti (17). Other analyses compared differences in prevalence by race/ethnicity at ages 65 and 75 years. Age was centered by subtracting 65 or 75 from the participants\u2019 ages for these analyses. The results are presented as odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The multinomial models were extended by adjusting for sex and indicators for the geographic regions, education, and survey year. All analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc), and P values at or below .05 were deemed significant. Top Results \nRacial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of single and multiple chronic conditions in a person varied by age, sex, region, and education. Most (73.4%) of the 56,280 adults studied were non-Hispanic white. Racial/ethnic differences by age group and sex were within a few percentage points, but differences in prevalence by education levels differed substantially ( Table 1 ). Almost half (48.1%) of the Hispanic population had less than a high school education, and only 11.7% had a college degree or professional school degree. By contrast, 87.2% of non-Hispanic whites and 71.2% of non-Hispanic blacks had a high school diploma. Non-Hispanic whites were twice as likely as non-Hispanic blacks to have a college degree or professional license (29.4% vs 15.6%) and nearly half as likely to have less than a high school diploma (12.8% vs 28.7%). Racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of chronic diseases were greatest for diabetes and cancer. Thirty percent of non-Hispanic blacks and 29% of Hispanics reported having diabetes compared with 17% of non-Hispanic whites. Cancer prevalence was 8.8% for Hispanics, 12.2% for non-Hispanic blacks, and 16.9% non-Hispanic whites. \nAmong adults with diabetes aged 60 to 79 years, the prevalence of diabetes alone or diabetes with CVD was twice as high among Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks as among non-Hispanic whites (Figure 1). The co-occurrence of diabetes and cancer was similar among non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics at age 60 but was more than twice as high among non-Hispanic blacks by age 79. Co-occurrence of diabetes and lung disease was relatively uncommon. Co-occurrence of diabetes, CVD, and cancer increased with age among the 3 racial/ethnic groups. \nFigure 1. Prevalence of single and multiple chronic conditions that include diabetes. Abbreviations: CVD, cardiovascular disease; lung, chronic lung disease. [A text version of this figure is also available.] \nNon-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics had more than twice the prevalence of diabetes alone and diabetes and CVD as non-Hispanic whites. Non-Hispanic blacks had roughly the same prevalence of diabetes and cancer as the other 2 races at age 60, but prevalence of this multimorbidity more than doubled by age 79. Non-Hispanic blacks had double the prevalence of the combination of diabetes and lung disease at age 60, but that prevalence fell below that of non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics by age 79. Among Hispanics, prevalence of the combination of diabetes, CVD, and lung disease declined by more than half from age 60 to age 79, but more than doubled over the same age span for non-Hispanic blacks while remaining approximately the same for non-Hispanic whites. \nAmong non-Hispanic whites the prevalence of multimorbidities that include diabetes was low; however, non-Hispanic whites had a high prevalence of multimorbidities that exclude diabetes (Figure 2). Non-Hispanic whites had the highest prevalence of cancer only or lung disease only. Among Non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics, prevalence of these 2 conditions singly was lower than among non-Hispanic whites as was prevalence of co-occurrence of CVD and lung disease. At most ages, non-Hispanic whites had the highest age-specific prevalence of CVD only or CVD in combination with either lung disease or cancer. Hispanics had a very low prevalence of CVD in conjunction with cancer. Except for having CVD as a single condition, non-Hispanic whites who did not have diabetes had the greatest increases in prevalence with age. Figure 2. Prevalence of single and multiple chronic conditions that exclude diabetes. Abbreviations: CVD, cardiovascular disease; lung, chronic lung disease. [A text version of this figure is also available.] \nThe prevalence of the 4 chronic diseases we studied varied across the survey years. Prevalence of diabetes increased from 18.0% in 2006 to 19.5% in 2014; lung disease prevalence increased from 9.8% to 12.2%, cancer prevalence increased from 14.7% to 15.7%, and CVD prevalence decreased from 17.5% to 14.2%. \nOdds ratios comparing the prevalence of chronic diseases among adults aged 65 and 75 years highlight racial/ethnic differences ( Table 2 ). Most notable were the high odds ratios of non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics compared with non-Hispanic whites for having only diabetes or diabetes in conjunction with CVD. Non-Hispanic blacks had significantly higher odds than non-Hispanic whites at one or both ages for chronic conditions that include diabetes. The odds ratios for chronic conditions that exclude diabetes present a different pattern: odds ratios for non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics were consistently lower than for non-Hispanic whites. Among Hispanics, 9 of 10 comparisons at ages 65 and 75 years were significantly lower. The odds ratios of non-Hispanic blacks for any of the diseases or disease combinations studied decreased from age 65 to 75 years except for the combination of diabetes, CVD, and chronic lung disease, which increased from odds ratio (OR) 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.8%\u20131.5% to OR 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1%\u20132.6%. \nIn adjusted statistical models, sex, region, and education had strong associations with chronic disorders ( Table 3 ). For most disorders, women had lower odds of disease than men. Compared with the South, other geographic regions had lower odds for many of the chronic diseases. The West was significantly lower than the South in 9 of 11 comparisons of diseases or disease combinations. The West was lower than the Northwest on 6 comparisons and lower than the Midwest on 2. Participants with less than a high school diploma had significantly higher odds for 8 of the 11 conditions than participants with a high school diploma but significantly lower odds for having cancer as a single disorder. Participants with a college degree or professional school degree, by contrast, had significantly lower odds than those with a high school diploma in comparisons of 9 of the diseases or disease combinations and significantly higher odds for having only cancer. Top Discussion \nThe study adds a distinct perspective by restricting analyses to diseases that cause the highest number of deaths. The greatest differences occurred among people with single chronic diseases. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, for example, Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks had double the prevalence of diabetes. Racial/ethnic differences were less distinct for some conditions including multiple diseases. Non-Hispanic whites trended toward a high prevalence for dyads of CVD with cancer or lung disease. Non-Hispanic blacks had a high prevalence of diabetes with CVD or cancer. The prevalence of multiple chronic conditions is complex; it derives from the prevalence of single conditions, incidence rates of other conditions, and mortality. The same multimorbidity can occur through differing pathways. Racial/ethnic differences in single diseases may lead to more diverse patterns or increased differences in multimorbidities. Differences in the prevalence of dyad pairs and of triad triplets of diseases could become more dissimilar. \nOther studies of multimorbidity using NHIS may offer the best comparison with our results. Ford et al (18) conducted an NHIS study of arthritis and the same 4 conditions as our study. That study was designed to analyze co-occurring major, lifestyle-related chronic conditions among adults aged 25 years or older. The number of chronic conditions increased with age, was higher in women than in men, and lowest among Hispanics. We excluded arthritis for 2 reasons (1): to give results specific to conditions with high mortality and (2) to increase the sample sizes for combinations of high-risk conditions. The results illustrate the variability in the prevalence of specific multimorbidities that underlie differences in the number of chronic conditions. \nWard et al (6) analyzed 10 conditions among participants in NHIS 2010 aged 18 years or older. Their study reported that 26% of adults had multiple chronic conditions. Multimorbidity increased with age, exhibited a higher prevalence among women than among men, and was higher among non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks than among Hispanics (both black and white). The most common disease dyad in Ward et al\u2019s population was arthritis and hypertension; the most frequent disease triad was arthritis, hypertension, and diabetes. These combinations remained the most prevalent among adults aged 65 years or over. In a recent update, Ward et al. (19) reported that 85.8% of adults aged 65 years or over had multiple chronic conditions. \nIn contrast to Ward et al, our results are restricted to a subset of the NHIS population: an older population with chronic conditions that cause the highest number of deaths. We find in agreement with that study that women tended to have the higher prevalence. The prevalence of single and multiple disorders most often increased with age, although in some instances the prevalence remained stable or decreased with age. Our results illustrate that among racial/ethnic subpopulations trends in prevalence exhibit substantial variability in combinations of diseases. \nWe also observed complexity in the possible health advantage of Hispanic populations. Of the single diseases studied, Hispanics had the lowest overall prevalence of lung disease and cancer, but they had a high prevalence of diabetes. Among people with multiple disorders, Hispanics experienced a higher prevalence of CVD in conjunction with diabetes than non-Hispanic whites. Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites presented similar trends with age for the dyad of diabetes and cancer. The Hispanic health advantage reported for some chronic diseases did not persist throughout the range of subpopulations with similar combinations of chronic diseases. \nOur results underscore differences in the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions by geographical region and education. The South had the highest prevalence for most single and multiple chronic conditions. The southern United States exceeds other regions in levels of poverty and other risk factors (20). Variations in disorders by education were extensive: people with a college degree or professional school degree had a lower prevalence of the 11 chronic conditions we studied than people with less education. Participants reporting less than a high school degree had the highest prevalence of the 4 chronic conditions. Smoking and obesity \u2013 major drivers of chronic disease \u2013 varied geographically and were inversely related to education and other socioeconomic factors (21\u201324). \nIn models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, survey year, and geographic region, women had a significantly higher prevalence than men did of 10 of 11 chronic disorders. Based on Medicare data, Lochner et al (25) observed that women had a higher prevalence of chronic morbidities across all age groups. They noted a high prevalence of chronic disease among non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanic women. Compared with non-Hispanic white women, we found a significantly higher prevalence among Hispanic women in 8 comparisons. \nStudies of other populations add insights into the epidemiology of multimorbidity (25\u201327). Common approaches have been to analyze the number of chronic conditions or to examine specific disease dyads and triads. Studies vary in the selection of chronic conditions. This variation makes comparisons difficult; however, results do offer insights into the health of the populations studied. Recent studies by the Mayo Clinic of adults from Olmstead County, Minnesota, offer guidelines on how to define diseases in ways that others can apply to their local populations (8,9,26). \nOur study had limitations. Although analyses of NHIS data have the strength of a nationally representative sample, the self-report of race/ethnicity and other information is a limitation. Errors in reporting single conditions can lead to compounded errors in classifying adults with multiple chronic conditions. The patterns observed should be interpreted recognizing the changing prevalences of the study diseases across the study years. Undiagnosed disease can also lead to errors in patterns of single and multiple chronic diseases. Misclassification may vary by race and ethnicity. One study, for example, reported that Hispanic populations, especially new immigrants, might not know that they have or fail to report diabetes (27). The study analyses are intricate and are not adjusted for multiple comparisons; the repeated analyses of the same subjects will inflate the error rates for type I diabetes. To increase the number of people with multiple conditions, we aggregated cancers together and combined diverse subgroups into the Hispanic population. A limitation of NHIS is the restriction to noninstitutionalized adults, which means that older institutionalized adults with chronic diseases are less likely to be eligible for participation. \nOur results support the strategic framework of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to improve the health and quality of life for people with multiple chronic conditions (28). A specific goal of the framework was to extend the epidemiology of common disease dyads and triads. Our results add to the understanding from 4 leading causes of death but are limited to diseases self-reported by the noninstitutionalized US population. The 4 diseases are a subset of the conditions in the HHS multiple chronic condition framework, and information on all of the framework\u2019s conditions is not available in the NHIS. \nStudy findings highlight racial/ethnic differences among the leading causes of death but present a more complicated pattern than one of straightforward group disparities. We found greater racial/ethnic differences in prevalence of single chronic disorders than in multiple disorders emphasizing the importance of public health strategies to prevent the first disease. To prevent the complexity of multimorbidity, additional efforts might target people with a single disease. Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults had a high prevalence of diabetes, both alone and combined with CVD. Non-Hispanic whites had nearly twice the age-specific prevalence of cancer without other chronic conditions, and non-Hispanic whites had the highest prevalence of chronic lung disease, both as a single condition and combined with CVD. Across the racial/ethnic groups, disease dyads and triads may evolve through different pathways. The existence of distinct racial/ethnic patterns should be considered in the HHS framework to prevent and address multimorbidity.

PEER REVIEWED   \nUnderstanding the patterns of mammography use and monitoring changes in use are essential to improving national health policy for breast cancer control. We aimed to describe the use of mammography in Portugal and to identify the determinants of its nonuse and underuse by examining data from the National Health Survey 2014. \nMethods \nWe analyzed data on 8,758 women aged 30 years or older. We defined women at an eligible age for mammography as women aged 45 to 69. Women who reported a previous mammography test were classified as ever-users and grouped according to time since the most recent test. We computed the prevalence of mammography use, and we used Poisson regression models to obtain age-adjusted and education-adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals. \nResults \nThe overall prevalence of mammography use was 80.0%, whereas nonuse was 20.0% and underuse 27.3% among users. The prevalence of nonuse and underuse were lower and associations with sociodemographic characteristics, use of health care services, and behavioral factors were stronger among women aged 45 to 69 than among women aged 30 to 44 and women aged 70 or older. The prevalence of mammography use was generally higher in the northern areas of Portugal than in southern areas and varied by marital status, educational level, and household size. A more frequent use of health care services and healthier behaviors were associated with lower prevalences of both nonuse and underuse. \nConclusion \nThis study illustrates inequalities in mammography use and provides useful information for better allocation of resources in breast cancer screening. Top Introduction \nBreast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women in the world (1). It ranks first as cause of cancer death among women in less developed regions and second as cause of cancer death in more developed regions (2). Nevertheless, 5-year survival has increased worldwide, surpassing 80% in several high-income countries (3). Besides the availability of more effective treatments, the widespread use of mammography screening is also responsible for these improvements (4). \nThe European Council recommends the screening of women aged 50 to 69 years through mammography every 2 years; organized screening programs (ie, population-based screening programs aimed at the entire resident population of a given age range and sex, designed to detect malignant disease during the detectable preclinical phase [before the occurrence of symptoms], organized at national or regional level, with an explicit policy, a team responsible for organization and for health care, and a structure for quality assurance [5]) are intended to reduce inequalities in access to early detection (6). Although these organized screening programs have been implemented in nearly all European Union countries, screening discrepancies exist, namely in coverage (ie, the proportion of the targeted population invited to have a screening according to the scheduled policy) and rates of participation (ie, the number of women who have a screening test as a proportion of all women who are invited to have a screening) (5,7). In Portugal (8), regional screening programs have been implemented in Centro since 1990, in Lisboa e Vale do Tejo since 1991, and in Alentejo since 1997; programs started later in Algarve (2005) and in Norte (2009). Except for in Algarve, where the Algarve Oncology Association (Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Oncol\u00f3gica do Algarve) is responsible for the organized screening of women aged from 50 to 69, the other regional programs are conducted by the Portuguese Cancer League (Liga Portuguesa Contra o Cancro) and target women aged 45 to 69 years. Nationally, geographic coverage has been increasing, from about 55% in 2009 to 72% in 2015 (8), whereas adherence to screening has slightly declined recently, from 64.5% in 2012 to 62% in 2015, and regional differences exist. \nAn evaluation of data from Portugal\u2019s National Health Survey 2005\u20132006 concluded that the use of mammography among eligible women (ie, women aged 45 to 69) varied by region, sociodemographic characteristics, and access to and use of health care services (9). Understanding the patterns of mammography use and monitoring changes in use is essential to improving national health policy for breast cancer control. This study aimed to describe the use of mammography by women in Portugal and to identify the determinants of its nonuse and underuse by examining data from the National Health Survey (NHS) 2014. Top Methods \nOur analysis was based on data collected as part of the NHS 2014, which is a community-based cross-sectional study that evaluated a sample, obtained through multistage stratified and cluster sampling, of the population living in Portugal. \nA sample of households was defined by using data from the 2011 Population and Housing Census; the sample was used as the sampling frame for household surveys conducted by Statistics Portugal. The sample consisted of 1,183 primary sampling units, selected systematically from larger geographical strata; the probability of selecting a primary sampling unit was proportional to the number of households in each unit. A random sample of the households was then selected, and all people aged 15 years or older living in these households at the date of the recruitment were eligible to participate. In each household, the selected person was the one whose previous birthday was closest to the date of the contact. The sample size was defined to ensure a homogeneous distribution of the participants among the 7 regions classified by NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) Level 2 (http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/345175/7451602/nuts-map-PT.pdf). The NUTS classification system is a hierarchical system for dividing the economic territory of the European Union into regions for the purpose of collecting and analyzing data (10). \nFrom September through December 2014, 22,538 households were approached and 18,204 people (56.4% women) were surveyed. All information was collected by using either computer-assisted personal interviewing or computer-assisted web interviewing (50% in each stratum). The questionnaire covered 4 thematic areas: health status, health care, health determinants, and income and health expenses. Use of mammography testing was assessed in a section on preventive care by asking 2 questions: \u201cHave you ever had a mammography (breast x-ray)?\u201d and, if yes, \u201cWhen was the last time?\u201d The latter question was followed by the response options \u201cin the last 12 months,\u201d \u201cbetween 1 year and less than 2 years,\u201d \u201cbetween 2 years and less than 3 years,\u201d and \u201c3 years or more.\u201d A total of 10,240 women provided information on mammography use. We restricted our analyses to women aged 30 years or older (n = 9,119). We further excluded data on 361 women for whom data were missing on the determinants of interest; our final sample consisted of 8,758 women. Women who reported having a previous mammogram were classified as ever-users and grouped further according to the time since the latest test: up to 2 years (including the options \u201cin the last 12 months,\u201d \u201cbetween 1 year and less than 2 years,\u201d) or 2 or more years (including the options \u201cbetween 2 years and less than 3 years,\u201d and \u201c3 years or more\u201d). The latter category (2 or more years) was defined as underuse. \nWe computed the prevalence of mammography testing and used Poisson regression models to compute age-adjusted and education-adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the determinants of mammography nonuse and underuse. All analyses were conducted with Stata version 11.2 (StataCorp LP) by using sampling weights computed according to design weight (ie, the inverse of the probability of selection of each primary sampling unit and of each household in each primary sampling unit, further corrected for nonresponse and for the effective number of participants evaluated, and taking into account the age- and sex-structures). For the determinants of nonuse, analyses were further stratified by age group. The analyses on determinants of underuse were restricted to the age group most commonly targeted by organized screening programs in Portugal (women aged 45 to 69). Top Results \nNearly half of the women in the study sample were aged 45 to 69 and therefore potentially eligible for breast cancer screening ( Table 1 ). By education level, 14.5% had not completed a basic level and 18.7% had completed more than a than secondary level. Nearly 20% of the women had access to health care also through other subsystems besides the national health system, and 17.8% had a private health insurance. \nThe overall prevalence of mammography use was 80.0% (95% CI, 78.8%\u201381.3%), whereas nonuse was 20.0% (95% CI, 18.7%\u201321.2%) (Figure). Of women eligible for breast cancer screening in 2014, 96.2% (95% CI, 95.3%\u201397.0%) had ever received a mammogram, and 3.8% (95% CI, 3.0%\u20134.6%) had never had one. By age group, the lowest prevalences of nonuse were among women aged 45 to 69, ranging from 2.1% (95% CI, 0.8%\u20133.4%) for women aged 60 to 64 years to 5.6% (95% CI, 3.5%\u20137.7%) for women aged 45 to 49. Among ever-users, the prevalence of underuse was 27.3% (95% CI, 25.7%\u201328.8%); the prevalence was lowest among women aged 45 to 69 (13.1% [95% CI, 11.5%\u201314.7%]), ranging from 10.2% (95% CI, 7.5%\u201313.0%) for women aged 60 to 64 years to 16.2% (95% CI, 12.5%\u201319.9%) for women aged 65 to 69. Figure. Prevalence of mammography use in Portugal among women aged 30 years or older, according to the elapsed time since most recent test, by age group. Data are from the National Health Survey 2014. [A tabular version of this figure is also available.] \nWomen aged 45 or older living in Alentejo, Algarve, RA A\u00e7ores, or RA Madeira were more likely than similarly aged women living in Norte to never have had a mammogram ( Table 2 ). Among women aged 30 to 44, compared with women living in Norte, women living in RA A\u00e7ores were more likely to never have had a mammogram, but women living in Lisboa were less likely to never have had a mammogram. Among women aged 70 or older, the prevalence of mammography nonuse was higher among women living in areas of intermediate density or thinly populated areas than among women in densely populated areas. Among women aged 45 to 69, non-Portuguese women were more likely than Portuguese women to never have had a mammogram. \nSingle women aged 45 to 69 were more likely than married women of that age to have never had a mammogram. By education level, the prevalence of mammography nonuse was significantly higher only among women with no basic educational level completed, compared with the highest level of education, except among women aged 70 or older, for whom the prevalence of nonuse was higher at all levels of education, compared with the highest level. Unemployed women at the time of the interview were more likely than employed women to have never had a mammogram in the age group 45 to 69. The prevalence of mammography nonuse was higher among women aged 45 or older living alone compared with similarly aged women in a household of 2 people. In the age group 30 to 44, the prevalence of nonuse was significantly higher among women in the 2 lowest quintiles of monthly household income per adult. \nWomen using only the NHS as their public health care provider were more likely to have never had a mammogram in the group aged 30 to 44, but we found no differences between women with private insurance and women without a private health insurance in any age group. In the age group 45 to 69, women who perceived their health status as very poor were less likely than women who perceived their health as fair to have never had a mammogram, while the opposite was observed for those who considered their health status as good or very good. In this same age group, women without a previous diagnosis of chronic disease were more likely to have never had a mammogram. The prevalence of mammography nonuse was significantly higher among women who had their most recent appointment with a general practitioner or a specialist physician more than one year before the interview and among who had never had a cervical cytology test or fecal occult blood test and/or colonoscopy in all age groups. Among women aged 45 to 69 years, the prevalence of mammography nonuse was higher among underweight women, compared with normal-weight women, and lower in former drinkers, compared with never-drinkers. \nWomen aged 45 to 69 living in Lisboa, Alentejo, Algarve, RA A\u00e7ores, and RA Madeira were significantly more likely than similarly aged women living in Norte to underuse mammography; so were non-Portuguese women, compared with Portuguese women ( Table 3 ). Single and divorced women, compared with married women, as well as those living in households consisting of more than 4 people were more likely to underuse mammography. By education level, the prevalence of mammography underuse was the lowest among women who completed a second basic educational level. \nWomen who perceived themselves as having a very good health were more likely than women who perceived their health as fair to underuse mammography, as were women who had their most recent appointment with a general practitioner or specialist physician more than one year before the interview and those who had never had a cervical cytology test or fecal occult blood test and/or colonoscopy. \nThe prevalence of mammography underuse was higher among women eating fewer than 5 portions of fruits and vegetables per day, compared with women who ate at least 5 portions, and among current smokers, compared with never-smokers, whereas the opposite was found for former drinkers. Former drinkers were less likely than never-drinkers to underuse mammography. Top Discussion \nOur data showed that 96.2% of women eligible for breast cancer screening in 2014 had ever received a mammogram, an increase of approximately 10% (from 87.6%) in mammography use since the 2005\u20132006 National Health Survey (9). However, a considerable percentage of women have never had a mammogram or did not follow screening. The prevalence of nonuse and underuse was lower among women aged 45 to 69, the age targeted for screening, than among women aged 30 to 44 and women aged 70 or older. Regional variations persisted, and patterns of mammography use differed according to sociodemographic characteristics and access to and use of health care services. \nAlthough the results of our study cannot be generalized to other settings, because our data depended on how breast cancer screening is performed in Portugal, namely through implementation of organized screening programs and local specificities of the health care system, our findings are similar to those reported for other countries using comparable methodologies. Countries such as France (12), Italy (13), and Spain (14) reported similar prevalences of mammography use based on data from recent national health surveys. \nWe found that rates of mammography nonuse and underuse among women aged 45 to 69 years were higher in the southern regions of Portugal than in the northern region. This finding is in accordance with a recent evaluation of the breast cancer screening program in the northern region of Portugal (15), which showed a participation rate of 74.5% in 2008\u20132009 and that most performance indicators were consistent with levels defined by the European Guidelines (5). However, a report in 2016 on population-based cancer screening programs in Portugal showed that geographic and population coverage and adherence to screening were at lower levels in the northern region than in other regions of Portugal (approximately 80% and 53% vs 98% and 65%, respectively) (8). Taking into account the report in 2016 and that organized screening in the northern region started later than screening in other regions, the lower prevalence of mammography nonuse in the northern region (2.9% among women aged 45 to 69 years), compared with other regions, found in our study may have been due to a higher prevalence of opportunistic screening in the northern region than in other regions. Opportunistic screening is screening outside an organized or population-based screening program, for example, following a recommendation made during a routine medical consultation, or a consultation for an unrelated condition revealing a potentially increased risk of cancer, or by self-referral. In addition, the territorial units defined by NUTS 2 do not entirely correspond to regions covered by the regional health administration responsible for implementing breast cancer screening programs. Some territorial differences between geographic regions and health regions may translate into an overestimation of mammography use in Lisboa and an underestimation in Centro. Nevertheless, our findings show that regional gaps exist and demonstrate insufficient coverage and/or insufficient participation by eligible women. \nOur results are in line with previous evaluations of breast cancer screening uptake by national health surveys, identifying poorer socioeconomic status and lower levels of use of health care services as the main determinants of mammography testing (12,16\u201319). On one hand, the prevalence of nonuse by education level was highest among women with no basic level of education completed, and we observed no significant differences according to income. Other studies also showed no association between women\u2019s economic situation and adherence to breast cancer screening recommendations (20). On the other hand, greater use of health care services, such as a recent interaction with a usual health care provider and ever having had a cervical cytology test, was associated with low prevalences of mammography nonuse and underuse. Although these associations were also reported in other studies (12,16\u201319), we additionally found that women who had ever had a fecal occult blood test and/or colonoscopy were also more likely to have received a mammogram. These findings suggest that the closer women are to the health care system, the easier is the process of becoming aware of the importance of monitoring breast cancer and that women should be encouraged to maintain regular contact with their family physicians. Our results also confirmed that potentially easier access to the health care system is associated with a lower risk of not being screened, at least among younger women. \nOther sociodemographic characteristics were identified as determinants of mammography use in our study, namely the degree of urbanization among older women. Other studies that account for population density support our findings (12,21). In our study, only marital information on legal marital status was available. Other studies have provided details on women\u2019s living arrangements (eg, living alone, living with partner), regardless of their legal marital status as single women (22). Therefore, a direct comparison of our results with the results of most other studies cannot be made, but our findings on legal marital status are consistent with our findings on household size. Mammography testing was less frequent among non-Portuguese women than among Portuguese women, consistent with the findings of several studies that identified immigrants as a vulnerable population in this context (12,18,19,23). \nIn our study, the prevalence of mammography nonuse increased as self-perceived health status improved, consistent with a study in Italy (24). These results point to the possible need for additional primary prevention efforts among women who perceive themselves as being healthy in the age group considered to be at higher risk for developing breast cancer (ie, women aged 45 to 69). It was also in this age group that the prevalence of nonuse was higher among women without a diagnosis of chronic disease than among women with such a diagnosis. Other studies reported similar findings (14,16), and, although differences according to the type of chronic disease were described (17,19,25,26), our results may indicate over-screening among women with a chronic disease. Research also consistently shows that obese women are less likely to undergo breast cancer screening than nonobese women (16,18,24\u201326), but in our study the highest prevalence of nonuse was among underweight women. \nOther studies have also reported higher levels of adherence to breast cancer screening among those who have healthy lifestyles, namely women who are physically active (14,17); however, research on the relationship between adherence and diet is less consistent (17). Our study found a significant positive association between mammography underuse and not following recommendations on fruit and vegetables intake (27) but only among women in the age range targeted for screening (aged 45 to 69). In our study, former drinkers were less likely than never-drinkers to underuse or not use mammography; this finding may conflict with those of a study in Spain (14), however, in the latter, only information on current alcohol consumption was provided. Similarly, current smokers were more likely to underuse mammography in our analysis. Only one study showed an association between smoking status and breast cancer screening uptake in line with our results (12); most studies reported no difference in adherence according to this lifestyle factor (24,25). \nThe main strength of this study is the evaluation of a large representative sample of women living in Portugal. The study provides information on patterns of mammography use and identifies the major determinants of use. These data can be used to improve the national health policy for breast cancer screening. However, this study also has several limitations. Although the 2 questions on mammography use in the NHS 2014 were part of a section referring to preventive care, we cannot ascertain that all women who reported having mammogram had one for screening purposes and not for diagnostic purposes. As a result, we may have underestimated the prevalence of mammography nonuse for screening purposes. Furthermore, even if all women who reported having a mammogram had one for screening purposes, no survey question asked whether the mammogram was received through an organized screening program or through opportunistic screening. This precludes a direct comparison of our results with the results of previous evaluations of organized screening programs and comparisons between organized screening programs and opportunistic screening (13,26). Additionally, no information on personal or family history of breast cancer was collected; this information could have influenced cancer screening initiation and frequency, especially among younger women. \nAlthough our results showed an increase in mammography use in the last 10 years in Portugal, regional differences persist, especially among women in the age range most commonly targeted by organized screening programs conducted at the national level. Differences according to sociodemographic characteristics and access to and use of health care services illustrate inequalities in mammography testing. This study provides useful information for a better allocation of resources for breast cancer screening, namely taking into account the regional and socioeconomic factors identified as possible barriers.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd14.170281 . PEER REVIEWED   \nLocal health authorities need small-area estimates for prevalence of chronic diseases and health behaviors for multiple purposes. We generated city-level and census-tract\u2013level prevalence estimates of 27 measures for the 500 largest US cities. \nMethods \nTo validate the methodology, we constructed multilevel logistic regressions to predict 10 selected health indicators among adults aged 18 years or older by using 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data; we applied their predicted probabilities to census population data to generate city-level, neighborhood-level, and zip-code\u2013level estimates for the city of Boston, Massachusetts. \nResults \nBy comparing the predicted estimates with their corresponding direct estimates from a locally administered survey (Boston BRFSS 2010 and 2013), we found that our model-based estimates for most of the selected health indicators at the city level were close to the direct estimates from the local survey. We also found strong correlation between the model-based estimates and direct survey estimates at neighborhood and zip code levels for most indicators. \nConclusion \nFindings suggest that our model-based estimates are reliable and valid at the city level for certain health outcomes. Local health authorities can use the neighborhood-level estimates if high quality local health survey data are not otherwise available. Top Introduction \nLocal governments need measures of population health at the level of small geographic areas for multiple purposes, such as planning public health prevention programs, allocating resources, formulating health policy, and health care decision making and delivery. However, little population health survey data exist at the county and subcounty levels. Although various national health surveys are available, such as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), direct estimates of population health measures are designed to be representative of the population at the state level (BRFSS) or larger regions (NHIS); direct estimates for small areas below the state level often are less reliable because of limited coverage or small sample sizes in the small areas that are covered (1,2). To obtain public health data at the small-area level, different approaches, including model-based estimation techniques, have been developed to produce local estimates of various chronic diseases and health-related behaviors (3\u20136). One such method is a multilevel model that includes area-specific random effects to account for between-area variations; this method has been shown to produce more valid and precise county-level estimates than other methods (7,8). \nWe previously applied a multilevel regression model and post-stratification (MRP) method using BRFSS data to estimate the prevalence of chronic health conditions and behaviors at multiple geographic levels (9). In brief, we constructed a multilevel logistic model and applied it to make predictions using US Census 2010 population counts at the smallest geographic level (the census block) that could be further aggregated to produce reliable health-indicator estimates at other geographic levels of interest. By comparing estimates generated by our model with direct county-level estimates from local surveys, such as the 2011 Missouri County-Level Study and the US Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey (ACS), we found that our estimates were reliable and could be used for estimating county-level population health measures (10). Considering the growing needs for local health data at ever-smaller geographic areas, it is necessary to further evaluate our method at subcounty levels. This is important because the method described here was used in an ongoing project, the 500 Cities Project (https://www.cdc.gov/500cities), which provides small-area estimates at the city and census tract levels for a selected set of measures related to public health priorities and impact. In the present study, we selected an independent source of data, the Boston BRFSS, to serve as a benchmark for validating our city-level estimates. Boston BRFSS was designed to collect samples for estimating public health measures that would be representative at the level of the city of Boston, Massachusetts. Additionally, it provided estimates of health measures at neighborhood and zip code levels. Although the survey design did not show how representative the estimates were, the results were adequate for comparison purposes to assess the advantages and disadvantages of our model-based estimates at such levels. Methods Data sources \nThe BRFSS is a national, state-based survey of the US adult population aged 18 years or older; it provides valid national and state-level statistics about selected risk behaviors and health conditions. It uses a disproportionate stratified sample design and is administered annually to households with landlines or cellular telephones by state health departments in collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the present study, we selected 10 health indicators from the 2013 BRFSS, which we defined in the same way they were defined in BRFSS (www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2014/pdf/codebook14_llcp.pdf): binge drinking, current smoking, no leisure-time physical activity, obesity, current asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure (excluding diabetes and high blood pressure that occur only during pregnancy), sleeping less than 7 hours, frequent mental distress, and frequent physical distress. Sleeping less than 7 hours was based on the question, \u201cHow many hours of sleep do you get in a 24-hour period?\u201d Frequent mental distress included reporting stress, depression, or problems with emotions for 14 days or more during the past 30 days. Frequent physical distress included reporting having physical illness and injury for 14 days or more during the past 30 days. All outcomes were categorized as binary variables (yes or no). Respondents who had missing values, refused to answer, or answered \u201cdid not know\u201d were excluded. The demographic variables were thirteen 5-year age groups (from 18 y to \u226580 y), sex (male and female), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian/Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander, other single race, 2 or more races, and Hispanic), and education attainment (<high school diploma, high school diploma, some college, and \u2265bachelor\u2019s degree). \nThe Boston BRFSS, which was administered separately from BRFSS by the Boston Public Health Commission, focused on the health of residents in Boston, Massachusetts. It was conducted in 2010 and 2013 and included many of the same core questions of BRFSS and questions particular to Boston. Boston BRFSS in both years featured a nonoverlapping, dual-frame sample design and was administered to households by random\u2013digit dialing to landline and cellular telephones. In 2010, 3,015 interviews were completed in the landline sample, and 306 interviews in the cellular telephone sample; in 2013, 2,448 interviews were completed in the landline sample and 1,572 interviews in the cellular telephone sample. Boston BRFSS data provided city-level information about the prevalence of selected health risk behaviors as well as knowledge of both health risks and beneficial health behaviors. In our analysis, we combined Boston BRFSS 2010 and 2013 data and defined health indicators in the same way they were described for the BRFSS. The survey included residents of 29 zip code areas (4 zip codes were excluded from calculation of direct survey estimates because they had fewer than 50 respondents, leaving 25 zip code areas included in the present study) and 15 neighborhoods (defined as clusters of adjacent zip codes). Statistical analysis \nIn the 500 Cities Project, we used the MRP modeling framework to estimate the prevalence of the selected health indicators for the 500 largest US cities by US 2010 Census population. Details about the MRP modeling framework can be found in our previous publication (9). Briefly, we constructed multilevel logistic regressions for each indicator: \nP ( Y ijk = 1 ) = logit \u22121 ( X i \u03b2 + re j + re k(j) ) \nwhere \nY is the health indicator that was categorized as yes or no; \nX i is a vector of demographic variables: individual-level age group (reference = 18\u201324 y), sex (reference = female), race/ethnicity (reference = non-Hispanic white alone), education attainment (reference = less than high school diploma) from the 2013 BRFSS, and county-level percentage of adults below 150% of the poverty line, which was obtained from the 5-year (2009\u20132013) ACS; \nre j is the state-level random effect; and \nre k(j) is the random effect of county nested in the state. \nWe used PROC GLIMMIX in SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc) to construct the models. The residual pseudo-likelihood estimation method was selected to estimate the model parameters (METHOD = RSPL), and Variance Components was selected as the model\u2019s covariance structure (TYPE = VC). Second, we estimated the prevalence at various geographic levels via post-stratification. We linked estimated parameters from both fixed effects and random effects with the local area population (2010 Census population data) to compute predicted probability of developing a given health indicator (eg, high blood pressure). To obtain prevalence estimates at the city, neighborhood, and zip code tabulation area levels, we aggregated the census-block\u2013level predicted probability to these respective levels. \nThe US Census Bureau does not publish census-tract\u2013level population data for education attainment by age, sex, and race. To address this issue, we used a bootstrap method to impute individual-level education attainment status during model prediction. This method is detailed elsewhere (11). The census-tract\u2013level percentage of population for education attainment and poverty variables were obtained from the 5-year (2009\u20132013) ACS. Because we had 1,000 simulation draws, the final estimates were described as the mean small-area estimates (SAEs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \nThe BRFSS model\u2013based estimates ( m ) for Boston from the 500 Cities Project were assessed by a comparison with direct Boston survey estimates ( s ), which were calculated by using SUDAAN (RTI International) by city, neighborhood (based on zip code), and zip code. For city-level comparison, we assessed the accuracy by observing whether the point estimate fell within the bounds of 95% CIs of the corresponding direct estimates. We calculated relative difference ([ m \u0336 s ] * 100/s) to indicate whether our estimates underestimated or overestimated the direct estimates. For the neighborhood-level and zip code-level comparisons, we calculated absolute difference (| m \u2212 s |) for each neighborhood and zip code respectively, and tabulated median (interquartile range) for all 15 neighborhoods and 25 zip codes. We measured the accuracy of model-based estimates by using the number and percentage of neighborhoods or zip codes with model-based estimates that were within 95% CIs of corresponding direct survey estimates. The correlation between the 2 sets of estimates was measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient ( r ) and Spearman \u03c1 (\u03b1 = 0.05 was used for statistical significance test). We also made maps of Boston, Massachusetts, by neighborhoods and zip codes to compare geographic patterns in the prevalence of each indicator between the 2 sets of estimates. The model-based estimates and direct estimates were shown on the maps as their quartiles among neighborhoods and zip codes respectively. Top Results \nWe used data on 483,865 (98.0%) BRFSS 2013 participants from 50 states and the District of Columbia in the multilevel logistic models to obtain model-based estimates for Boston. In Boston BRFSS 2010 and 2013, 7,340 participants (3,320 in 2010 and 4,020 in 2013) were included; item response rates for the selected health indicators were greater than 90%. Data on sleeping and no physical activity were available only in 2013. In the comparison of the means of city-level BRFSS model-based prevalence estimates with direct survey prevalence estimates, the model-based estimates tended to have narrower 95% CIs ( Table 1 ). Among the selected health indicators, the model-based estimates were close to the estimates obtained from the Boston BRFSS survey data for current smoking, no leisure-time physical activity, sleeping less than 7 hours, diabetes, high blood pressure, and current asthma. For example, the model-based prevalence estimate for diabetes (mean, 7.8%) was well within the 95% confidence interval (7.2%\u20138.7%) of the direct survey estimates (7.9%) from the Boston BRFSS survey. The model-based estimates of 4 health indicators (binge drinking, obesity, frequent mental distress, and frequent physical distress) were not within the bounds of the 95% CIs of the direct survey estimates. Except for binge drinking, the model-based estimates overestimated the prevalence of the 4 health indicators. The biggest discrepancy between the 2 estimates was observed for frequent mental distress (relative difference, 30.6%). \nWe also compared model-based estimates with direct survey estimates at the neighborhood level ( Table 2 ). The percentages of neighborhoods with model-based estimates that fell within the bounds of 95% CIs of the corresponding direct estimates ranged from 73.3%-100% (Accuracy in Table 2). The 2 sets of estimates showed strong correlation for binge drinking, no leisure-time physical activity, obesity, sleeping less than 7 hours, diabetes, high blood pressure, and frequent physical distress (no. of neighborhoods = 15; range of Pearson r = 0.62\u20130.89). Correlations were not significant for current smoking (no. of neighborhoods = 15, Pearson r = 0.30), current asthma (no. of neighborhoods = 15, Pearson r = 0.33) and frequent mental distress (no. of neighborhoods = 15, Pearson r = 0.31), which suggests no significant linear relationship between the 2 estimates derived from the 2 approaches. Spearman correlation showed similar results. However, some discrepancies exist between the 2 sets of estimates. First, the model-based estimates suggest a narrower range than that suggested by direct surveys. Second, the interquartile ranges of the absolute differences indicated that the 2 sets of estimates differed across the neighborhoods. Generally, the larger neighborhoods had smaller differences between the 2 sets of estimates than the smaller neighborhoods. \nThe prevalence of each indicator varied among neighborhoods (https://image.ibb.co/cD8YJa/17_0281_01a.jpg and https://image.ibb.co/iZPUrv/17_0281_01b.jpg). Yet the 2 sets of estimates differed in identifying the lowest prevalence and the highest prevalence for certain health indicators. For example, the prevalence of diabetes varied consistently by geography between the 2 estimates, whereas the prevalence of current smoking was indicated as lowest in model-based estimates and but modest to highest in the local survey. \nA similar pattern between the 2 sets of estimates was observed at the zip code level ( Table 3 ) (https://image.ibb.co/hF13Ja/17_0281_02a.jpg and https://image.ibb.co/gbLDJa/17_0281_02b.jpg). The correlations were moderate to strong for binge drinking, no leisure-time physical activity, obesity, sleeping less than 7 hours, current asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, and frequent physical distress (no. of zip codes = 25, range of Pearson r = 0.53\u20130.89). Spearman correlation showed similar results. The percentages of zip code areas with model-based estimates that fell within the bounds of 95% CIs of the corresponding direct estimates ranged from 76.0% to 88.0% (Table 3).The 2 sets of estimates had larger differences across the zip codes than neighborhoods. Compared with direct survey estimates, the model-based estimates tended to vary less in the prevalence among 2 or more adjacent zip codes (https://image.ibb.co/hF13Ja/17_0281_02a.jpg and https://image.ibb.co/gbLDJa/17_0281_02b.jpg). Top Discussion \nThis study compared estimates of 10 selected health indicators generated by the MRP method with direct survey estimates for the city of Boston. For city-level comparisons, the estimates showed strong agreement with the direct estimates for most of the indicators, yet discrepancies were remarkable for frequent mental distress. When comparisons were made at sub-city level, we found that model-based estimates had moderate or strong correlations with direct survey estimates for most indicators; however, depending on the health indicator, there were important differences between the 2 approaches to prevalence estimation. \nMany chronic diseases or conditions are affected by individual behavioral factors as well as contextual factors such as geographic location (12). Multilevel models can account for geographic variations by including random effects and have been suggested to be superior to the separate linear regression model for small-area estimation (7,8,13,14). Several applications of multilevel regression models in small-area estimation for chronic diseases or health-related behaviors have been described in recent years (5,6,15,16). Yet such applications require further evaluation because of the lack of external validation. The reason is that few health surveys were designed to generate sub-county estimates for chronic disease and health behavior indicators. Hudson used local administrative hospitalization data to validate estimates of mental disability generated by \u201cregression synthetic estimation fitted using area-level covariates\u201d for zip codes, towns, and cities in Massachusetts and found that Pearson correlation r ranged from 0.51 to 0.58 (17). Twigg and Moon compared the neighborhood-level SAEs generated by multilevel models by using a national dataset with local survey health data. Although the results from these local surveys were adequate for comparison, they were not designed for neighborhood-level estimates (18). The Boston BRFSS survey is desirable for the external validation and comparison at the city level because it was originally designed for estimation of city-level chronic health conditions and behaviors; it is contemporaneous with CDC\u2019s BRFSS and used the same survey questions for most of the health indicators. The 2 surveys (2010 and 2013) used the same design methodology and can be combined to obtain a larger sample size; and finally, the Boston BRFSS had high item-response rates. \nAlthough we found good consistencies for most of the selected indicators when comparing our city-level, model-based estimates with direct survey estimates, we found considerable discrepancies for binge drinking, obesity, frequent mental distress, and frequent physical distress, which may be attributable to a few types of bias. For example, a bias toward reporting lower weights in women and higher heights in men is well known in self-reported obesity data and such bias differs by demographic factors (19). Recall bias is more common in reporting health behaviors than in reporting diagnosed chronic diseases. Generally we found a better match between BRFSS model-based estimates and direct survey estimates for diagnosed chronic diseases (diabetes, high blood pressure, and current asthma) than for health behaviors. Frequent mental distress and frequent physical distress are self-evaluated and are not reliable indicators of illness; instead, they are considered to be indicators of self-reported quality of life. Additionally, sample size is a common concern for a local survey, particularly for those indictors with a low prevalence in the population, such as current asthma, frequent mental distress, and frequent physical distress. Finally, the model-based estimation approach may overestimate the prevalence of an indicator if public health interventions that targeted that indicator were implemented at the local level during or just before the survey period. This approach cannot detect or evaluate the effects of local-level interventions. \nWith regard to the comparisons between the 2 sets of estimates at neighborhood and zip code levels, moderate to strong correlation was observed for most of the indicators, which indicates that higher (or lower) values from one approach match the higher (or lower) values from the other. Yet limitations on each approach should be noted. First, although direct survey estimates are often considered as reliable benchmarks, they are vulnerable to many changes other than the real population changes and tend to overestimate the true ranges of SAEs (19,20). This overestimation became more evident when the area size was smaller. We observed wide ranges at the neighborhood and zip code levels. The extreme rates may reflect the low base denominator number (18). On the other hand, despite the advantages of multilevel modeling, the narrow ranges in model-based estimates may be artificially caused by the modeling process that shrank the highest and lowest rates towards the global mean of the data set (18). Second, the BRFSS model\u2013based estimates had low correlation with direct survey estimates for frequent mental distress and current smoking. Unlike for current smoking, the model-based estimate of frequent mental distress was different from the direct estimate at the city level as well. Thus, besides the reasons we mentioned above, this difference indicates that the model-based estimation may not take into account the complex cross-level variation that is known for frequent mental distress (21). \nIn summary, our results showed that our methods were able to provide many reliable estimates at the city level. Too often city-level direct estimates, which are preferable, are not available. The modeling approach can be used to meet the growing need for city-level data. Yet the method needs further refinement and assessment for certain health indicators, particularly complex health indicators such as frequent mental distress. At the sub-city levels, given that representativeness was not claimed for the local survey, validation was not easy to achieve. Yet model-based estimation provides useful population health information when high-quality survey data are not available. Our findings suggest further research is needed to identify models that improve reliability of estimates for sub-city geographic areas.

Although faith-based weight-loss interventions have been effective at promoting weight loss among blacks, little is known about how body image and religious views contribute to weight-related beliefs among religious black women. The purpose of this study was to examine whether demographic and health history factors, religious involvement, and beliefs about body image could explain motivation and confidence to lose weight among a church-affiliated sample of black women. \nMethods \nWe recruited 240 church-affiliated black women aged 18 to 80 years (average age, 55 y; SD, 12.3) in 2014 from 6 black churches that participated in a larger study, Project FIT (Faith Influencing Transformation), a clustered, diabetes/heart disease/stroke intervention among black women and men. We used baseline data from Project FIT to conduct a cross-sectional study consisting of a survey. Variables approaching significance in preliminary correlation and \u03c7 2 analyses were included in 2 multiple linear regression models examining motivation and confidence in ability to lose weight. \nResults \nIn final regression models, body mass index was associated with motivation to lose weight (\u03b2 = 0.283, P < .001), and beliefs about body image in relation to God predicted confidence to lose weight (\u03b2 = 0.180, P = .01). \nConclusion \nFaith-based, weight-loss interventions targeting black women should emphasize physical well-being and highlight the health benefits of weight management rather than the benefits of altering physical appearance and should promote positive beliefs about body image, particularly relating to God. Top Introduction \nBlack women are disproportionately burdened with obesity. An estimated 80% are overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] \u226525) (1,2), and cultural beliefs may contribute to high rates of obesity among black women (3,4). Black women\u2019s beliefs regarding an ideal body shape (ie, being shapely and curvy; having large breasts, hips, and buttocks) are perceived to be more attractive in the black community but tend to differ from those of mainstream archetypes (3). \nMany studies report that black women are less concerned about weight than women in other racial/ethnic groups (4), that they prefer large body shapes (5), that they have high levels of body satisfaction and self-esteem while overweight or obese, and that they tend not to believe that losing weight will improve quality of life (4,6\u20139). Furthermore, studies showed that black women who lost weight were concerned that they appeared too thin or unwell (10) and worried that a petite body frame might be viewed negatively (eg, as scrawny) (3). Conversely, some studies found that overweight and obese black women have weight-related concerns and would like to lose weight (11,12), particularly because of the effect of their weight on their health (13). In one study, obese black women reported that a larger body size could be healthy and attractive but expressed interest in losing weight and were self-conscious about their body size (14). Still, cultural norms that promote body acceptance, inaccurate perceptions of body size, and limited knowledge of weight-related health problems (12) may reduce motivation and confidence to lose weight. Little is known about what influences motivation and confidence to lose weight among black women, especially in settings that could extend the reach and effect of black female-focused, culturally tailored, weight-loss interventions. \nBlack churches have the potential to shift cultural body image norms and provide support for weight loss among black women. In national studies, more than 80% of black women described religion as very important, and almost 60% reported attending church services weekly (15). Most black churches have health or outreach ministries (eg, food and clothing pantries, day care) that can be tapped by health promotion programs to reach women in the communities they serve (16\u201318). Additionally, most churches promote the scripture that the body is made in the image of God and is the temple of God, encouraging members to take care of their bodies (19). \nDespite the growing number of obesity studies in black churches (17), virtually no studies have examined potential cultural and health contributors to weight-related beliefs among black women church-goers. Improving understanding of these beliefs could inform the design of tailored weight-loss interventions. The objective of this study was to explore whether demographic and health history factors, religious involvement, and body image beliefs would predict motivation and confidence to lose weight in a church-affiliated sample of black women. Top Methods \nWe used a cross-sectional design to examine baseline data that were collected over a 6-week period in October and November 2014 as part of larger intervention, Project FIT (Faith Influencing Transformation), a religiously tailored intervention for diabetes/heart disease/stroke education, screening, and linkage to care conducted in urban areas of Kansas City, Missouri, among black women and men. Analyses for Project FIT were performed in November 2016 (results have not been published). Participants for our study were recruited from 6 black churches that participated in Project FIT through announcements from pastors and other church leaders during church services and through church outreach events (eg, food pantry). \nWe recruited 240 black women from Project FIT. The response rate was 94% across all predictor variables and 98% for outcome variables. Participants met the following eligibility criteria: self-identified as black and female, were aged 18 to 80 years, did not have sickle cell anemia, were not pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and were willing to participate in a survey. Surveys were paper and pencil and assessed health-related beliefs and behaviors. Surveys took approximately 30 to 45 minutes to complete, and participants received $20 in cash for completing the survey. Participants provided written informed consent, and the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City institutional review board approved the study. Survey measures \nParticipants were asked to provide information on age, education level, income, marital status, and whether they had children. Income and marital status were dummy-coded to compare married women with all other groups (eg, single, widowed, divorced women) and to compare women with a monthly household income of more than $3,000 to women with a household income of $3,000 or less. Having children was measured as a dichotomous (yes/no) variable. \nHealth history variables collected were health insurance coverage, body mass index (BMI; kg/m 2 ), health care visits, diagnosed health conditions, and perceived stress. To calculate BMI, a member of the research team used a SECA stadiometer and scale (SECA) to measure height and weight without shoes. \nThree survey questions developed for this study assessed health care visits over the past 12 months (ie, physician visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations; Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.46) with responses ranging from none, once, twice, or 3 or more. Responses were summed, with total scores ranging from 0 (no health care visits) to 12 (nine or more health care visits). Fifteen dichotomous (yes/no) questions assessed diagnosed health conditions (eg, high blood pressure, diabetes, depression; Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.50). Responses were summed, with total scores ranging from 0 (no diagnoses) to 15 (maximum number of conditions). Perceived stress was measured by using questions adapted from the Perceived Stress Scale, which was designed for ease of use with community-member participants (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.84\u20130.86 in previous studies) (20). Fourteen questions asked participants to rate their experiences with stress (eg, \u201cFelt that you were unable to control the important things in your life\u201d; 1 = never to 5 = very often; Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.95). Questions with positive answers (eg, \u201cDealt successfully with irritating life hassles\u201d) were reverse-scored. Summed scores ranged from 14 (low stress) to 70 (high stress). \nTo assess religiosity, one question asked how many years participants had been church members. Seven questions, adapted from the Religious Background and Behavior Scale (21) and used in previous studies among faith-based black populations (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.77) (22), assessed participants\u2019 religiosity (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.74 for this study). The first question asked participants to describe their religious identity (ie, 1 = atheist, 2 = agnostic, 3 = unsure, 4 = spiritual, 5 = religious). Six additional questions asked participants about frequency of religious behaviors (eg, thought of God, prayed, attended a worship service) and were ranked on a scale of 0 (never) to 8 (more than once a day). Summed scores for the 7 religious identity and behavior items ranged from 7 (low religiosity) to 53 (high religiosity). \nParticipants were asked to rate satisfaction with their overall appearance and with their arms, waist, thighs, and buttocks on a scale of 1 (highly not satisfied) to 7 (highly satisfied) (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.92 for this study). Responses were summed, so that total scores ranged from 5 (low body satisfaction) to 35 (high body satisfaction). \nFive questions assessed participants\u2019 beliefs about their body in relation to God (eg, belief that \u201cMy body is a temple of God\u201d and that \u201cMy body is a gift from God.\u201d). Responses were rated on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree) (Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.74 for this study). Responses were summed, and scores ranged from 5 (no body image beliefs in relation to God) to 35 (strong body image beliefs in relation to God). \nTwo questions ranked how motivated participants were to lose weight and how confident they were that they could do so, both on a scale of 0 (not at all confident or motivated) to 10 (very confident or motivated). Data analysis \nDescriptive statistics were used to examine all variables. Preliminary analyses (ie, correlation, \u03c7 2 ) were performed to examine associations between predictor variables (ie, demographics, health history, religious involvement, body image beliefs) and motivation and confidence to lose weight. We used SPSS version 22.0 (IBM Corp) to enter variables that were significantly associated or approached significance (ie, P \u2264 .10) with motivation or confidence to lose weight into 2 separate multiple linear regression models with the first model examining motivation to lose weight and the second model examining confidence to lose weight. Significance levels were set a priori for both regression models at P < .05. Categorical variables (eg, marital status, income) were dummy-coded. All variables included in each of the linear regression models were entered in a single step. For the purposes of this cross-sectional study, explanatory variables are referred to as predictor variables with motivation and confidence to lose weight as outcomes (23). Top Results \nParticipants\u2019 average age was 55 years (standard deviation [SD], 12.3; range, 18\u201380 y). Most participants reported being married and having children, a college degree or higher, health insurance, and a monthly household income less than $3,000 ( Table 1 ). Average motivation to lose weight was 7.8 on a scale of 0 to 10 (SD, 2.7) and average confidence in ability to lose weight was slightly higher (mean, 8.0; SD, 2.5; scale 0\u201310). Age and having children were not related to motivation to lose weight ( Table 2 ) or confidence in ability to lose weight ( Table 3 ). Income and marital status were both positively related to motivation to lose weight in preliminary analyses. Income also was positively related to confidence in ability to lose weight in preliminary analyses; however, neither income nor marital status predicted motivation or confidence in ability to lose weight in final regression models. \nParticipants\u2019 average BMI was 32.8 (SD, 8.5; range, 18\u201354). In preliminary analyses BMI was significantly associated with motivation but not with confidence. BMI significantly predicted motivation to lose weight in the regression model. \nMost participants (87%) had visited their physician for a regular checkup in the past year, and 44% had visited their physician 3 or more times (overall scores for health care visits ranged from 3 to 10, scale 0\u201312). The most common place for routine medical care was a physician\u2019s office or health maintenance organization (73%). More than half (52%) had visited an emergency department, and 39% had been hospitalized in the past year. \nParticipants reported an average of 1 or 2 diagnosed health conditions (mean, 1.7; SD, 1.5; scale 1\u201315; range, 0\u20136 conditions), most commonly high blood pressure (57%), high cholesterol (39%), or diabetes (24%). Diagnosed health conditions and health care visits were not associated with motivation or confidence in preliminary analyses. \nParticipants reported an average perceived stress score of 36.7 (SD, 7.0; range, 20\u201355 on the Perceived Stress Scale). The association between perceived stress and motivation to lose weight approached significance in preliminary analyses, but stress did not predict motivation to lose weight in the regression model. Perceived stress was not associated with confidence in ability to lose weight in preliminary analyses. \nThe average length of time the woman had been a church member was 23 years (SD, 18.6; range, 1\u201372 y). The average religiosity score was 46.4 ( SD, 5.7; range, 21\u201353; scale 7\u201353). Most participants described themselves as religious (84%) and attended church at least weekly (93%). More than once per day, many participants thought of God (85%), prayed (75%), meditated (43%), or had direct experiences with God (43%); 38% read scriptures or holy writings almost daily. Religiosity and years as a church member were not significantly associated with motivation or confidence in ability to lose weight in preliminary analyses. \nAverage combined body satisfaction was 21.8 (SD, 7.9; range, 5\u201335; scale 5\u201335). Body satisfaction was not associated with motivation or confidence to lose weight in preliminary analyses. \nParticipants had very strong body image beliefs about their bodies in relation to God (mean, 32.4; SD, 6.8; range, 5\u201335, scale 5\u201335). In preliminary analyses, body image beliefs in relation to God approached significance for motivation to lose weight and were significantly associated with confidence to lose weight. In the regression model, body image beliefs in relation to God predicted confidence to lose weight. Top Discussion \nTo our knowledge, this study is among the first to examine body image and religiosity, demographics, and health history as predictors of motivation and confidence in ability to lose weight among church-affiliated black women. We found that women in this study were highly motivated and confident in their ability to lose weight. Moreover, BMI significantly predicted motivation to lose weight, which was an important finding considering the high levels of overweight and obesity among this study\u2019s church-affiliated participants and among similar populations in other church-based studies (16,17,24). \nSlightly more than one-fourth of participants had been diagnosed with at least one health condition, most commonly high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, which is consistent with previous estimates (1). Although overall poor health has been shown to motivate weight loss among black people (10,11,13), diagnosed health conditions among black women in our sample were not related to motivation or confidence in ability to lose weight. Previous research indicated that concerns about developing a chronic illness drove interest in weight-loss among black women (11,13) and that preventing or managing chronic illnesses was a primary reason to lose weight (10). Still, other studies showed that people living with chronic diseases tend to have little interest in weight loss (25), particularly because chronic illnesses can result in financial problems, pain, fatigue, limited physical functioning, or depression (26), which can inhibit weight loss. Moreover, most participants visited their physician for a regular checkup in the past year, and nearly half saw their physician multiple times. Slightly more than half of participants had visited an emergency department, and more than one-third had been hospitalized in the past year. Given the growing focus on patient-centered medicine and the high rates of contact with health care services among women in our sample, consideration should be given to how culturally tailored messages can be incorporated into physician visits or hospitalizations to increase motivation and confidence in ability to lose weight among black women at risk for, or living with, chronic diseases. Additionally, opportunities may exist for pastors and other church leaders to encourage weight loss when making hospital visits with their members. \nPerceived stress did not predict motivation or confidence in ability to lose weight. Previous studies of black women demonstrated a direct relationship between stress and consumption of larger portions of unhealthy foods (13). It is likely that the perception of stress is related to behaviors that can immediately mitigate its effects (eg, emotional eating) (27) and may dampen resolve to lose weight. Black women are also particularly susceptible to stressors (eg, racism, discrimination, low pay) that can exacerbate weight gain (28). Future studies should continue to explore the influence of perceived stress on weight management attitudes and behaviors. \nParticipants were highly religious, and consistent with other church-based studies, they attended church frequently (15,18). However, religiosity was not associated with motivation or confidence in ability to lose weight, which is likely due to a ceiling effect (ie, very high religiosity across the sample). Similarly, time as a church member was not associated with motivation or confidence in ability to lose weight. It has been suggested that the black church environment can influence weight-related health beliefs and behaviors, including exerting pressure to consume large portions or unhealthy foods at church events (24). Recommendations for weight-loss interventions designed for black people include faith-based changes to the church culture and environment (17,19), including incorporation of church policies to limit high-fat, high-calorie, and sodium-rich foods at church events. Faith-based programs may also benefit from efforts to reshape the health-related climate in church settings by increasing social support for healthy behavior change and promoting acceptability of weight-loss behaviors. \nDespite the high levels of overweight and obesity in our study sample, participants reported moderate levels of body satisfaction, which is consistent with previous studies that found positive body image perceptions among obese black women (6,7,9,). Yet, body satisfaction was not related to motivation or confidence in ability to lose weight. This finding is somewhat inconsistent with a previous study of overweight and obese women from a diverse sample that found that body satisfaction was the strongest predictor of current weight-loss efforts (29). Also, participants demonstrated equal body satisfaction across different body areas, which contrasts with the literature that suggests black women are not consistently satisfied with their bodies across all areas (11). These conflicting findings suggest that much remains to be learned about body image and motivation and confidence in ability to lose weight among church-affiliated black women. \nParticipants had strong beliefs about body image in relation to God, which were associated with motivation and confidence and significantly predicted confidence in ability to lose weight. Qualitative studies of church-affiliated black people have shown that believing that one\u2019s body is a temple of God was related to engagement in healthy behaviors (eg, abstaining from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs) (19). Faith-based weight-loss interventions for black women could be tailored to promote positive, faith-based attitudes about the body while encouraging preventive health behaviors (eg, physical activity, healthy eating). \nThis study had limitations. It was not guided by hypothesis or theory. Instead, we took an exploratory, stepwise approach for the inclusion of variables to be analyzed. Additionally, this study was cross-sectional, which limits causal inferences. Still, this study had several strengths, including a comprehensive list of demographic, health history, religious, and body image variables of a diverse church-affiliated sample of black women with representation across age, income, and marital status. This study also contributes to the literature on motivation and confidence in ability to lose weight among church-affiliated black women, a population with high rates of overweight and obesity. Recognition of the influence of BMI and body image beliefs in relation to God on motivation and confidence in ability to lose weight presents opportunities for black faith communities to tap this inherent cultural aspect of religiosity and church tenets to reduce the burden of obesity among black church-affiliated black women.

death rates are higher in rural areas than in urban areas \nContact: CDC Media Relations (404) 639-3286 \nRates of drug overdose deaths are rising in nonmetropolitan (rural) areas, surpassing rates in metropolitan (urban) areas, according to a new report in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report ( MMWR ) released today by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nDrug overdoses are the leading cause of injury death in the United States, resulting in approximately 52,000 deaths in 2015. This report analyzed trends in illicit drug use and disorders from 2003-2014 and drug overdose deaths from 1999-2015 in urban and rural areas. In 1999, drug overdose death rates for urban areas were higher than in rural areas (6.4 per 100,000 population versus 4.0 per 100,000). The rates converged in 2004, and in 2006 the rural rate began trending higher than the urban rate. In 2015, the most recent year in this analysis, the rural rate of 17.0 per 100,000 remained slightly higher than the urban rate of 16.2 per 100,000. \nUrban and rural areas experienced significant increases in the percentage of people reporting past-month illicit drug use. However, there were also significant declines in the percentage of people with drug use disorders among those reporting illicit drug use in the past year. The new findings also show an increase in overdose deaths between 1999 and 2015 among urban and rural residents. This increase was consistent across sex, race, and intent (unintentional, suicide, homicide, or undetermined). \n\u201cThe drug overdose death rate in rural areas is higher than in urban areas,\u201d said CDC Director Brenda Fitzgerald, M.D. \u201cWe need to understand why this is happening so that our work with states and communities can help stop illicit drug use and overdose deaths in America.\u201d \nAlthough the percentage of people reporting illicit drug use is less common in rural areas, the effects of use appear to be greater. The percentage of people with drug use disorders among those reporting past-year illicit drug use were similar in rural and urban areas. \nAdditional findings from the CDC study: In 1999, drug overdose death rates for urban areas were higher than in rural areas (6.4 per 100,000 population versus 4.0 per 100,000). The rates converged in 2004, and by 2006 the rural rate (11.7 per 100,000) was slightly higher than the urban rate (11.5 per 100,000). The percentage of people reporting past-month use of illicit drugs declined for youth ages 12-17 over a 10-year period but increased substantially in other age groups. The percentage of people reporting past-month use of illicit drugs was higher for urban areas during the study period. Among people reporting illicit drug use in the past year, drug use disorders decreased during the study period. In 2015, approximately six times as many drug overdose deaths occurred in urban areas than in rural areas (urban: 45,059; rural: 7,345). \nMost overdose deaths occurred in homes, where rescue efforts may fall to relatives who have limited knowledge of or access to life-saving treatment and overdose follow-up care. Considering where people live and where they die from overdose could improve interventions to prevent overdose. Understanding differences in illicit drug use, illicit drug use disorders, and drug overdose deaths in urban and rural areas can help public health professionals to identify, monitor, and prioritize responses. \nVisit HHS\u2019s Opioids web site for more information on their 5-point strategy to combat the opioid crisis. \nVisit CDC\u2019s Opioid Overdose web site for data, tools, and resources on opioid overdose prevention. \nVisit CDC\u2019s Rural Health web site for more information on rural health topics. ###", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brenda fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cdc reports rising rates of drug overdose deaths in rural areas cdc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rural health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T18:43:55.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd534ad71d9217c2c8cb341a9e43f18a9c8ff0e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5fuYWao3k44KR3ZENkCtRNiYh25WmV.E6cerEP74imsPSJCCMUXgnpXsl1pw_51EdWkol2BBzFmGizHeCbj6SZzCwRFJ73Wvv4nqa0vbq1To7VHdcUuiRN6qo0iUptuc3VTk4Tn5hUM8", "site_full": "blogs.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=479", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Your Environment and Your Health", "title": "Lead Free Kids: National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2017", "title_full": "Lead Free Kids: National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2017", "published": "2017-10-20T23:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd534ad71d9217c2c8cb341a9e43f18a9c8ff0e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5fuYWao3k44KR3ZENkCtRNiYh25WmV.E6cerEP74imsPSJCCMUXgnpXsl1pw_51EdWkol2BBzFmGizHeCbj6SZzCwRFJ73Wvv4nqa0vbq1To7VHdcUuiRN6qo0iUptuc3VTk4Tn5hUM8", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-20T23:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lead Free Kids: National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2017", "text": "Share Compartir \nJessica and Ben had their first child one month ago, and just bought a 1959 Midcentury-modern ranch style house. They want to do some renovation before moving in, but they know that homes built before 1978 often contain lead paint. They also know that even though exposures to lead in tap water have been greatly reduced during the last two decades, lead still can be found in some metal water taps, interior water pipes, pipes connected with lead solder, and pipes connecting a house to the main water pipe in the street. \nAlthough the sellers made no disclosures about lead paint or lead in tap water and the inspection revealed no issues, Jessica and Ben still want to be sure the home is safe for their baby. Because they know that no safe blood lead level in children has been identified, the couple are not going to take any chances with their baby\u2019s health. They find some helpful information on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) website: On the Renovation, Repair and Painting Program: Do-It-Yourselfers page, they learn that even if old lead-based paint is covered by layers of newer paint, stripping or sanding the surface could release hazardous lead dust. Jessica and Ben decide to hire a certified lead renovation, repair, and painting (RRP) contractor to remove any lead hazards from their home. RRPs are trained to reduce the chance of lead contamination by minimizing dust and cleaning thoroughly\u2014and they can do the painting, too! On the Basic Information about Lead in Drinking Water page, they learn how to get a quality report on the water coming into their house, and how to test their water for lead. Jessica and Ben decide to contact their community water system for a copy of their latest quality report, and find a testing laboratory in their state on EPA\u2019s page Contact Information for Certification Programs and Certified Laboratories for Drinking Water . \nJessica and Ben know they can cut back on renovation costs elsewhere to pay for the contractors to remove lead hazards from their home. What is most important is giving their new baby a clean, safe, lead-free home. Facts about lead exposure Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust are the most hazardous sources of lead for U.S. children. Houses built before lead-based paints were banned in 1978 are likely to contain some lead-based paint. About 24 million homes in the U.S. contain deteriorated lead-based paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house dust. The Safe Drinking Water Act ( http://www.epa.gov/sdwa ) and EPA\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule ( http://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/lead-and-copper-rule ) have greatly reduced exposures to lead in tap water. Lead found in tap water usually comes from the corrosion of older fixtures or from the solder that connects pipes. About 4 million homes with elevated lead levels are home to young children. An estimated 535,000 U.S. children ages 1-5 years have blood lead levels \u22655 \u00b5 g/dL which is known to damage health. For each seriously lead-poisoned child, medical and special education costs average over $5,600. \nClick here for the CDC\u2019s lead poisoning prevention infographic. Other sources of lead exposure \nChildren can come into contact with lead in some toys and toy jewelry, imported candy, and traditional home remedies. In addition, adults who work in occupations involving lead, such as mining or manufacturing, may accidentally bring lead into their homes from products they use at work. Some hobbies, like making stained glass, also use lead. Dangers to children\u2019s health from lead exposure \nExposure to lead can seriously harm a child\u2019s health. Even at low levels, lead exposure can cause damage to the brain and nervous system, slowing growth and development and lowering IQ. It can lead to problems with hearing and speech, behavior, paying attention, and learning. The great news is that lead poisoning is 100% preventable. Follow these steps to make your home lead-safe: If you have concerns about your child\u2019s exposure to lead, talk to your child\u2019s doctor about a simple blood lead test. CDC recommends blood lead testing at 1 and 2 years, with particular focus on children living in communities with a lot of older housing and high rates of poverty and children who are Medicaid-eligible. Talk to your local health department about testing paint and dust in your home for lead if you live in a home built before 1978. If your house has lead paint, renovate safely by hiring a certified lead renovation, repair, and painting (RRP) contractor. Get the latest quality report from your community water system and decide if you want to test your water for lead by a certified laboratory. Remove recalled toys and toy jewelry from children.

What is cholera? \nCholera is a disease spread by drinking water or eating food contaminated with cholera bacteria. Severe cholera is characterized by large amounts of watery diarrhea, often described as \u201crice-water stool\u201d because it can have a pale, milky appearance. It can also be accompanied by nausea and vomiting. If untreated, the loss of fluid can be deadly. But simple treatment, including replacing lost body fluids, can lower the risk of death to less than 1%.   cholera? \nBecause it is spread through contaminated food and water, cholera is easily prevented by sticking to safe eating and drinking habits and regularly washing hands . \nA newly licensed cholera vaccine (Vaxchora, PaxVax Corporation) prevents severe diarrhea caused by the most common type of cholera bacteria. This vaccine is available in the United States, and CDC recommends it for adults traveling to Koukou, Goz Beida, or Am Timan Districts. Avoiding unsafe food and water even after cholera vaccination will also help prevent cholera and many other diarrheal infections. Travelers should discuss the following questions with a healthcare provider when considering the vaccine: How common is cholera where I am going? How common is cholera in travelers to this area? What would put me at risk for cholera? Will I be able to receive rapid treatment (if needed) at my destination?

In law school, I focused on employment law, but I quickly realized I wasn\u2019t interested in a traditional legal career, and I committed to a career in public service, in some capacity. \nWhen I was appointed as a Presidential Management fellow to CDC in June 2001, I wasn\u2019t sure how my law degree or legal skillset would be used. But, a series of experiences\u2014including serving in the CDC Emergency Operations Center (EOC) after the 9/11 attacks less than six months after my appointment, and a series of mentors, including Gene Matthews, former CDC general counsel\u2014helped me understand the important role law plays in advancing public health goals. Those experiences gave me the confidence I needed to pursue my career and make a place for myself in public health law. \nPHLN: What does law have to do with public health? \nRansom: I can\u2019t think of one public health issue or challenge that can be solved without some contribution of a legal or policy solution. And, from my perspective, there is no public health without the law. From the creation of a health department, which is done by statute, or the passing of a clean indoor air ordinance, it is law that creates the framework that helps make healthy choices the norm. Once we understand the science and evidence-base, it takes the strategic power of the law to move us to lasting changes in health outcomes. \nPHLN: Please describe your career path. \nRansom: I began my career in public health when I was a fellow. My first appointment was with the Financial Management Office, Congressional and Legislative Branch, where one of my primary responsibilities was planning visits for members of Congress and their staff to CDC. In September, after the 9/11 attacks, I was asked to serve as an operations analyst in the EOC, where I was introduced to Anthony Moulton, who was serving as the first director of CDC\u2019s Public Health Law Program (PHLP). He asked me to join his team on a three-month detail to help plan the first national conference on public health law. Moving from the Financial Management Office to PHLP was a turning point in my career. I spent the next eight years working directly at the intersection of law and public health. Not only was I involved in shaping the beginnings of PHLP (the program was founded in 2000), but I also had the opportunity to direct the CDC Community Public Health Legal Preparedness Initiative, serve as the lead coordinator for CDC\u2019s annual Public Health Law Conference, and develop unique partnerships between CDC and the American Bar Association and the American Health Lawyers Association. \nIn 2009, I earned a master\u2019s degree in public health and spent the next two years working in the National Center for Environmental Health on the National Conversation on Public Health and Chemical Exposures project. In 2011, I received a phone call from Matthew Penn, who had just accepted the position as director of PHLP, and he asked me to return to PHLP. I\u2019d worked with Matthew previously, when he was an attorney for the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, so the answer was an easy yes. \nI specifically asked to lead PHLP\u2019s training and workforce development efforts. I was able to build a program from scratch and contribute to ensuring that public health practitioners across the country understand the role of law in their everyday practice of public health. \nPHLN: What do you do in your current position? \nRansom: As the team lead for public health law training and workforce development, my current focus is on increasing the competency of the public health law workforce to use law as a public health tool. I develop competency models; develop and deliver webinars and in-person training in public health law; and oversee the workforce development components of CDC\u2019s first cooperative agreement focused on building the legal capacity of the public health workforce. \nI present trainings, teach courses, and publish on a broad range of topics, including introduction to public health law, public health emergency law, careers in public health, law and ethics, and environmental public health law. \nPHLN: What kind of people do you train? \nRansom: Everyone! We take the concept of \u201cworkforce development\u201d very seriously! While our primary training audience tends to be state, tribal, local, and territorial public health practitioners and lawyers, we have offered training to a wide variety of partners across the health system, including law and public health students, healthcare providers, health lawyers, and members of professional organizations, such as the National Environmental Health Association, the American Health Lawyers Association, and the American Planning Association. \nPHLN: Congratulations! You recently won the American Public Health Association (APHA) Law Section Jennifer Robbins award. Can you please tell use a little bit about the award? \nRansom: Thank you! The Jennifer Robbins Award for the Practice of Public Health Law is offered by the APHA\u2019s Law Section. It recognizes an individual, typically at mid-career, for outstanding dedication and leadership in the field of public health law. Jennifer Robbins (1940\u20131987) was a public health lawyer who practiced in the Office for Civil Rights at the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. She subsequently served as an assistant attorney general in Maryland and was principal counsel for the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. \nI will be presented with the award at the Health Law Section reception at the APHA Annual Meeting on November 6. This is a huge honor, and it feels really good to have my contributions to the field be recognized by my peers! It\u2019s an extra special occasion because we will be launching the Public Health Law Academy at the meeting as well. \nPHLN: What is the Public Health Law Academy (the Academy)? \nRansom: It\u2019s an online, on-demand set of trainings developed by PHLP and ChangeLab Solutions (CLS). The overall strategy of the Academy is to infuse the public health workforce with improved competencies, confidence, and information needed to use legal and policy tools in evidence-based strategies to improve population health outcomes. \nThe training resources are easy to access and should be helpful to public health practitioners and health system partners, across all subject matter areas and levels of government. The trainings are hosted on a CDC-branded version of the Public Health Foundation\u2019s TRAIN platform as a primary vehicle for reaching the target audience. \nPHLN: What kind of courses are in the Academy? Who might find them useful? \nRansom: Currently, there are nine trainings in three clusters\u2014 Introduction to Public Health Law Hot Topics in Public Health Law A series of overview trainings on legal epidemiology \nOur introduction to public health law trainings explore the integral role that the law plays in the everyday practice of public health. It covers core public health law concepts that all public health practitioners need to know and includes courses about the history of public health law, preemption, and the structure of government. \nAdditionally, public health law is constantly evolving in response to public health emergencies like natural disasters, the opioid epidemic, and healthcare shortages. We have trainings in the Public Health Law Academy to address these issues, and our goal is to stay abreast of emerging issues so that the Academy is providing timely, relevant training opportunities. \nAnd, our legal epidemiology trainings are for public health practitioners interested in studying the connection between laws and public health. \nThese trainings are essential for all public health professionals, especially those at the local, state, or federal levels, who need to have a clear understanding of our legal system and the role it has played and continues to play in improving overall population health. Yet, despite this integral role, most public health practitioners and health professionals don\u2019t receive any formal public health law training. So, I hope that our partners across the health spectrum find the Academy useful. \nPHLN: How was the Academy created? \nRansom: It is a core project of a cooperative agreement between CDC and CLS\u2014the Public Health Law Capacity Building Cooperative Agreement . PHLP and CLS have spent the last four years working with subject matter experts, leaders in curriculum design, and continuing education experts to develop the Academy. \nPHLN: What is the State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial (STLT) Public Health Attorney Institute (the Institute)? \nRansom: It is a new training initiative offered by PHLP and consists of an intensive 2.5 day course designed specifically for attorneys who have been representing a STLT health agency for three years or less. The Institute provides an opportunity for these attorneys to fully immerse themselves in CDC culture in an invitation-only, interactive, boot-camp style training. Attendees are exposed to CDC\u2019s mission and vision, participate in competency-based training on the legal foundations for\u2014and the role of law in\u2014public health practice, and learn best practices in public health law from experts in the field. \nPHLN: How do STLT attorneys get to attend the Institute? \nRansom: Currently, invitees are determined based on a nomination process, and final attendees are selected based on a variety of factors, including budget. We limit the number of attendees to 10\u201312 and are always soliciting names for potential invitees. So, if you know of an attorney who meets the criteria, please send his or her name our way! \nPHLN: When is the next Institute? \nRansom: We held a pilot in late August 2017, and it was extremely successful. We are hopeful that we can offer this program annually, and we are looking at mid-to-late June 2018 for the next session. \nPHLN: PHLP has a robust internship program. Will you please describe the program, who is eligible for it, and what they might learn? \nRansom: Yes, we do! We offer three internship opportunities. Our Public Health Law Internship opportunity is a formalized entry-level experience for rising and current third-year law students who are interested in exploring careers in public health law. PHLP\u2019s Tribal Public Health Law Internship, also for current and rising third-year law students, focuses on issues at the intersection of tribal and Alaska Native and American Indian law, and public health. And, our Administrative and Communication Internship is specifically for students enrolled in masters-level programs earning degrees in public health, public policy, public administration, communication, business, and similar disciplines. These internships/externships are unpaid, but externship and practicum opportunities are available for students seeking academic credit as authorized by their schools. \nOur student interns are exposed to an in-depth understanding of government agency operations, legal epidemiology, and the role of law in advancing public health. Each intern is supervised by a preceptor, and provided with hands-on mentorship and a variety of trainings. \nPHLN: When is the deadline for the summer 2018 internship applications? \nRansom: To apply for the summer 2018 internship, students should submit a resume and cover letter to no later than January 31, 2018. \nPHLN: What career advice do you have for young public health and public health law practitioners? \nRansom: Bloom where you are planted! \nDon\u2019t get boxed into your dream career plan, but make sure you follow your heart. My undergraduate degree is in speech communications, and I thought I\u2019d end up as a corporate trainer. I went on to law school and was considering a career in employment law. When I was appointed as a fellow, I chose CDC primarily because it was in Atlanta, and my parents had retired in Augusta, Georgia\u2014I wanted to be close to my family. I had no real idea of what public health was, and I told myself I\u2019d stay at CDC for two years and then move on to a more \u201claw-focused\u201d career. When I arrived at CDC, I quickly found mentors who helped me discover my personal skill set and passions, and I dove into the substance of public health, which helped me understand and articulate how I\u2014as a lawyer, not in the Office of General Counsel, in an agency full of scientists\u2014could add value to CDC. Sixteen years and so many incredible experiences later, I\u2019m now at the point in my career where I\u2019ve hit the sweet spot\u2014I\u2019m effectively working at the intersection of corporate training, law, and public health. I am the happiest I\u2019ve been in my career, but only because I bloomed where I was planted. \nPHLN: Do you have any hobbies? \nRansom: I like to run 5Ks, go camping (glamping!), and travel! In my spare time, I\u2019m also a professional voice actress and provide the voice for a variety of audio and video productions.

Learn more about your role in prevention and join our efforts to stop bullying. What CDC Is Doing \nCDC works to prevent bullying before it starts. We support evidence-based actions in communities to more effectively prevent bullying and youth violence. Research on preventing bullying is still developing, but promising evidence is available for school-wide programs. CDC is a federal leader in conducting surveillance and research activities to better understand and prevent bullying.

Bullying at a Glance \nBullying is unwanted aggressive behavior by another youth or group of youth, who are not siblings or dating partners, which involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The behavior is repeated, or has the potential to be repeated, over time. Bullying includes actions such as making threats, spreading rumors, attacking someone physically or verbally, and excluding someone from a group on purpose. It can harm someone physically, emotionally, and academically. The damaging effects of bullying do not stop at the individual, and in fact, negatively impacts peers, families, schools, and even neighborhoods. Bullying can occur anywhere. It happens in-person and electronically (known as cyberbullying) as well as in and outside of schools. The latest 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey [2.77 MB] (YRBS) showed that 20 percent of high school students reported being bullied on school property in the 12 months before the survey. Additionally, 16 percent of high school students reported they have been bullied electronically in the past 12 months. 2 Electronic bullying or cyberbullying is bullying that occurs through email, a chat room, instant messaging, a website, text messaging, or videos or pictures posted on websites or sent through cell phones. According to the 2013 and 2015 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Surveys, 33 percent of students ages 12 to 18 who reported being bullied at school and 27 percent of students who reported being cyberbullied anywhere, indicated that they were bullied at least once or twice a month. 1, 3 Female students aged 12\u201318 were more likely than males to report being made fun of, called names, or insulted, to be the subject of rumors, and to be excluded from activities on purpose. However, male students were more likely to report being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. 2-3 Risk and Protective Factors \nNumerous factors can increase the risk of a youth engaging in or experiencing bullying. The presence of these factors, however, does not always mean that a young person will become someone who bullies or one who is bullied by others. \nFactors associated with a higher likelihood of engaging in bullying behavior include poor impulse control, harsh parenting by caregivers, and attitudes that accept violence. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of victimization include relationship difficulties, poor self-esteem, and being perceived by peers as different or quiet. \nFew researchers have looked at the factors that protect a youth from bullying others or from being bullied by others. What we do know is that having positive problem solving skills, supportive families, and a positive school climate can help decrease bullying behaviors. The CDC fact sheet, Understanding Bullying [264 KB] , provides more information about bullying and its prevention. \nVisit StopBullying.gov for additional resources and information.

UAVs have the potential to prevent injury and death in the construction industry where nearly 1,000 workers died in 2015. Advancements in UAV technology could help reduce construction-related injury and death from falls, toxic chemical exposures, electrical hazards, or traumatic injury from vehicle and equipment collisions. \nAs is the case with other emerging technologies, occupational safety assessments of UAVs lag behind technological advancements. UAVs may create new workplace hazards that need to be evaluated and managed to ensure their safe operation around human workers. A recent paper from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine \u201c Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Construction and Worker Safety \u201d describes the four major uses of UAVs, including their use in construction, the potential risks of their use to workers, approaches for risk mitigation, and the important role that safety and   can play in ensuring safe approaches to their use in the workplace. \nWhile the article provides a wealth of information on the major uses of UAVs, this blog focuses on UAV use in construction. The commercial segment of the $100 billion UAV market is predicted to be the fastest growing between 2016 and 2020, with the construction industry accounting for the largest share of the growth. 1 By 2025, the U.S. commercial UAV sector is forecast to surpass five billion dollars in investments. 2 \nThe emerging uses of UAVs in the construction industry range from aiding with construction project planning by aerial mapping of the construction site 3 to extending to the actual building of structures. 4 , 5 The most common UAV uses in construction are described below. \nMonitoring: Monitoring a large construction site is a challenge for construction management. A UAV can be deployed to send video footage of site conditions to construction management faster and more efficiently than can on-the-ground personnel. Video can be converted into a three-dimensional picture of the site and then compared to computerized architectural plans to show how accurately the project is progressing. 6 Monitoring information obtained by a UAV also serves as a useful input in the preparation of periodic construction progress reports. UAVs can be equipped with far and near infrared cameras, radar or laser-based range finders which can greatly enhance their surveillance and monitoring capabilities at a construction site. 7 In addition, tracking moving objects on construction sites such as people, equipment, and material are being developed, 8 as well as equipping UAVs with the capability of mapping indoor construction environments. 9 \nInspection: Often, UAVs can inspect a large worksite more efficiently through aerial photography than on-the-ground personnel can. UAV detection of hazardous conditions, materials and dangerous structures can aid in construction site hazard identification without placing a worker at risk. 10 , 11 Real-time UAV systems performing remote site inspections and violation detection at construction sites may be more efficient, safer and less costly than present construction site inspection methods. 7, 12 UAV inspection of awkward locations on and under bridges and along highway can not only reduce the cost of personnel inspecting the entire expanse of a highway road or structure, but also reduce the risk of working along a busy highway or erecting equipment close to the flow of traffic. Government inspections of construction sites could also be performed by a UAV. Because inspection of the site would be quicker than an individual government inspector walking an extensive construction site, UAVs could increase the scope and frequency of inspections of construction projects by federal, state and local government agencies. 13 Once potential violations were identified by aerial imaging, then inspectors could focus their investigation on sites where the potential violations were imaged. \nMaintenance: Using UAVs in carrying out planned or reactive maintenance inspections of tall structures, such as skyscrapers, bridges, and towers where access can be costly and pose a risk to workers of falling from a great height, appears to be a clear benefit for construction workers and managers. 14 New FAA rules permitting the commercial use of UAVs has prompted new guidelines for operating UAVs around vertical communications infrastructure. 15 \nOther Uses: UAVs have been proposed as material handling vehicles, transporting tools, equipment and materials at construction sites 16 or used to spray paint or waterproof a structural component. 17 UAVs can also be used to capture unique views of a structure for promotional photographic purposes. 14 Safety \nWhile there are many benefits to using UAVs in construction, the potential risks must be carefully studied. The presence of a UAV flying in close proximity to a human worker can create new hazards at a construction site, although data supporting the hazard potential of UAVs for workers are scarce. Safety professionals need to be aware of these new hazards, assess the risks arising from them, and apply controls to reduce the risks. There has been little published about the safety and health risks associated with the public or commercial use of UAVs. The military has begun to assess the adverse health effects among remote pilots operating UAVs over conflict areas and has reported stress reactions in military personnel arising from their work as UAV operators. 18 , 19 \nAbout 30 incidents of near-misses or crashes leading to human injury have been reported associated with the use of recreational UAVs. 20 Unstable flying conditions, operator errors, and faulty equipment may represent potential hazards to nearby workers from the commercial use of UAVs. Adding to the uncertainty about the hazards to workers from the emerging use of UAVs in construction and other industries, the arrival of autonomous or semi-autonomous UAVs may introduce new hazards arising from the absence of human control. \nIt is important to develop hazard identification, risk characterization and mitigation approaches to ensure the safe operation of commercial UAVs as the use of UAVs promises significant benefits for industry. These approaches might incorporate prevention-through design concepts such as lightweight manipulators, passive compliant systems, safe actuators, and passive robotic systems. Navigation and collision avoidance systems can be included in the design of commercial UAVs as a proactive safety measure. Collision avoidance in the three-dimensional environment is a main area of UAV design research. 21 Structural designs should consider stiffness and pliability factors that can reduce the impact force during collisions. Tools for the evaluation of UAV safety during the design 22 and certification stages 23 are being developed. \nAdequate training of operators is essential to ensure the safe operation of the UAV. A competent UAV operator is a person capable of identifying any potential hazard of operating a UAV in the particular construction site surroundings, especially any UAV operating condition that poses a hazard to workers on the ground. The competent UAV operator should be authorized by the construction manager to take prompt corrective measures to eliminate any hazard associated with operation of the UAV. Next Steps \nAs the use of public and commercial UAVs gain in popularity, it will be important to review their uses to ensure that hazards and risks to workers are identified and controlled. Collecting and analyzing objective data about negative safety outcomes in the future will also be important. There are several potential sources of information about injuries to workers from UAVs that may be useful including: The FAA database of injuries caused by commercial UAVs, collected under Part 107 requirements, The BLS Survey of Occupational Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) and the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) modified to facilitate identification of injuries caused by UAVs, Accident investigations by OSHA and Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation Program (FACE) investigations by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. \nOccupational safety and health professional organizations should invite speakers on UAV workplace applications to further increase awareness among their members. Safety professionals, organizations and government should adopt a proactive approach to the integration of UAV technology and work collaboratively to develop best safety practices that can promote the beneficial use of this promising new technology in construction and other industries while at the same time ensuring the safety and health of workers working with, nearby, and \u201cbelow\u201d these new workplace tools. \nIf you are using UAVs in your workplace, please share your experiences in the comment section below. \nJohn Howard, MD; Vladimir Murashov, PhD; and Christine Branche, PhD, FACE \nDr. Howard is the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. \nDr. Murashov is a Senior Scientist in the NIOSH Office of the Director. \nDr. Branche is the Principal Associate Director of NIOSH and the Director of the Office of Construction Safety and Health.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir murashov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine branche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murashov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "branche", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bls survey of occupational injuries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niosh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fatality assessment and control evaluation program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institute for occupational safety and health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "osha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "census of fatal occupational injuries", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of construction safety and health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T22:32:58.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a696b597336f333d4c9dfb7e8519c31791f1e87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5cd3ZYiEekJwm1gfNkKFdyH3zX4A8stwO8VjFOyxfgx3gKpTwoJk7W0rD6Z.Jzcnx6qOpavj.Me5", "site_full": "blogs.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://phpartners.org/rss_phpartners.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "PHPartners.org - News and Updates", "title": "Building the Future Preparedness and Response Workforce", "title_full": "Building the Future Preparedness and Response Workforce", "published": "2017-10-23T21:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a696b597336f333d4c9dfb7e8519c31791f1e87", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5cd3ZYiEekJwm1gfNkKFdyH3zX4A8stwO8VjFOyxfgx3gKpTwoJk7W0rD6Z.Jzcnx6qOpavj.Me5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "nlmphpcustserv@mail.nlm.nih.gov (phpartners.org)", "published": "2017-10-23T21:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Building the Future Preparedness and Response Workforce", "text": "To receive email updates about this page, enter your email address: Enter Email Address Building the Future Preparedness and Response Workforce Posted on When I think about public health preparedness and response I ask myself three questions: Who provides the infrastructure to train public health responders? Where do they learn what they know? Who helps a responder fulfill their mission? \nThe answers to these questions may rest in the TRAIN Learning Network (TRAIN). After the September 11th terrorist attacks, public health departments needed a way to track the preparedness-related training of professionals in their state, region, or locality. TRAIN was established in 2003 to offer a solution to the tracking challenge and help train the next generation of the public health workforce. \nThis network IS the track on which the trains run (pun intended)! If we equip responders with as many skills and as much knowledge as possible before an incident, we can expect: Increased expertise during a response, Just-in-time training that is more readily available, Quicker response and recovery efforts, and Greater resilience. What is TRAIN? \nTRAIN is a national learning network of agencies and organizations that deliver, track, and share trainings for professionals who protect and improve the public\u2019s health. The network identifies, develops, and promotes opportunities for professionals to build their skills and knowledge. \nTRAIN is an open platform, meaning that anyone, anywhere can access the training. Learners have access to thousands of health knowledge and skill-related courses. An emergency management specialist at a   can take courses in other disciplines or topic areas with content that is curated by the CDC or another partner in the network. \nLearners are able to search TRAIN for courses that are tagged with PHEP Capabilities or PHPR Core Competencies . You can register as a learner through your state\u2019s TRAIN affiliate or through CDC TRAIN . How does TRAIN work? \nTRAIN is a collaboration between 27 state health agencies and partners, as well as 3 federal partners \u2013   , Veterans Health Administration , and Medical Reserve Corps \u2013 who serve as TRAIN Learning Network affiliates. More than a thousand CDC-developed learning opportunities are available to all the registered learners in the TRAIN network. \nTRAIN affiliates operate branded online portals, which allow them to: Identify specific groups of learners for targeted courses or training plans Monitor training and completion of specific groups of learners, including the use of custom reports Partner on training with state, tribal, local, territorial, national, and international providers \nMeanwhile, organizations that provide training, including other government agencies, academic institutions, and nongovernmental organizations can: Assign training to a specific group of learners and monitor their progress towards completion Test knowledge and collect feedback, develop custom curricula, and access course data \nThe TRAIN approach fosters collaboration, saves cost by reducing duplication, and reaches learners across jurisdictional lines. This ensures that together, we can train the entire workforce with all the tools at our collective disposal.

The key is to keep children from coming in contact with lead. If children are lead poisoned they must be treated. Learn how to prevent children\u2019s exposure to lead. \nThere are many ways parents can reduce children\u2019s exposure to lead before they are harmed. Lead hazards in a child\u2019s environment must be identified and controlled or removed safely. Lead is invisible to the naked eye and has no smell. Common Ways Children Can Come in Contact with Lead \nYoung children often put toys, fingers, and other objects in their mouth as part of their normal development. This may put them in contact with lead paint or dust. \nOne common way children can be exposed to lead are chips and particles of old lead paint. Children can be directly exposed to lead from paint if they swallow paint chips. But exposure is more common from swallowing house dust or soil contaminated by leaded paint. This happens when lead paint chips get ground into tiny bits that become part of the dust and soil in and around homes; for example, when leaded paint is old or worn or is subject to constant rubbing (as on doors and windowsills and wells). In addition, lead can be scattered when paint is disturbed during destruction, remodeling, paint removal, or preparation of painted surfaces for repainting. \nExposure to lead can seriously harm a child\u2019s health. \nLead paint or dust are not the only ways children can come in contact with lead. Thirty percent of lead-poisoned children in certain areas across the United States may have been poisoned by other sources. These sources include: traditional home health remedies such as azarcon and greta, which are used for upset stomach or indigestion in the Hispanic community; imported candies; imported toys and toy jewelry; imported cosmetics; drinking water contaminated by lead leaching from lead pipes, solder, brass fixtures, or valves; and consumer products, including tea kettles and vinyl miniblinds. \nA variety of work and hobby activities expose adults to lead, including using an indoor firing range, making home repairs, remodeling a home, and making pottery. When adults whose jobs expose them to lead wear their work clothes home or wash them with the family laundry, their families can be exposed to lead. Families can also be exposed when adults bring scrap or waste material home from work. Get Treatment if You Think Your Child Has Been in Contact with Lead \nIf you think your child has been in contact with lead, contact your child\u2019s health care provider. He or she can help you decide whether to test your child\u2019s blood to see if it has high levels of lead. \nA blood lead test is the only way to find out if your child has a high lead level. Most children with high levels of lead in their blood have no symptoms. \nYour child\u2019s health care provider can recommend treatment if your child has been exposed to lead. \nSee frequently asked questions about lead and possible lead exposure. \nFor more information on sources of lead exposure and prevention tips, please visit our webpage or call CDC-INFO at 1-800-CDC-INFO (232-4636). National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week: Lead-Free Kids for a Healthy Future \nOctober 22-28 is National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week. Childhood lead poisoning is considered the most preventable environmental disease of young children. Approximately half a million U.S children ages 1-5 have blood lead levels above the blood lead value at which CDC recommends public health actions be initiated. \nNational Lead Poisoning Prevention Week occurs every year during the last full week in October. Many states and communities offer free blood lead testing and hold education and awareness events. For more information about National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week activities in your area, please contact your state or local health department . \nView the National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week Campaign Toolkit created by CDC and our federal partners to encourage information sharing, collaboration, and promotion of lead poisoning prevention activities.

Occurrence and Consequences of Playground-Related Injuries All Emergency Department-Treated, Playground-Related Injuries About 56% of playground-related injuries that are treated in EDs are fractures and contusions/abrasions. 1 About 75% of injuries related to playground equipment occur on public playgrounds. Most occur at a place of recreation or school. 1 Playground-Related TBIs The overall rate of ED visits for playground-related TBI has significantly increased in recent years (2005-2013). 1 About two-thirds of playground-related TBIs occurred at school and places or recreation or sports and often involved monkey bars, climbing equipment, or swings. 2 Most ED visits for playground-related TBIs occur during weekdays, Monday through Friday. 2 Playground-related TBI ED visits occurred frequently during the months of April, May, and September. 2 Deaths \nBetween 2001 and 2008, the Consumer Product Safety Commission investigated 40 deaths associated with playground equipment. The average age of children who died was six years old. Of these, 27 (68%) died from strangulation and six (15%) died from falls to the playground surface. 1 Most strangulation involved the combination of slides or swings and jump ropes, other ropes, dog leashes or clothes drawstrings. Injury Risk Factors All Emergency Department-Treated, Playground-Related Injuries While all children who use playgrounds are at risk for injury, boys sustain ED-treated injuries (55%) slightly more often than girls (45%). 3 Children ages 5 to 9 have higher rates of ED visits for playground injuries than any other age group. Most of these injuries occur at school.On public playgrounds, more injuries occur on monkey bars and climbing equipment than on any other equipment. 3 Playgrounds that are well maintained have fewer risks to children such as rusty or broken equipment. 4 Playground-Related TBIs Boys more often sustain playground-related TBIs compared to girls. 2 Most children who are treated for playground-related TBIs are 5 to 9 years of age. 2 Playground-related TBIs varied by age group and equipment type: 0-4 year olds are often injured on swings and slides. 2 5-9 year olds are often injured on swings, monkey bars, and climbing equipment. 2 10-14 year olds are often injured on swings, monkey bars, and climbing equipment. 2 5 to 14 year olds sustain TBIs more frequently at school. 2 What Can Be Done? \nTake steps to keep kids safe by: Checking that playgrounds have soft material under them such as wood chips, sand, or mulch. Reading playground signs and using playground equipment that is right for your child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s age. Making sure there are guardrails in good condition to help prevent falls.

Vaccination coverage in the United States for children aged 19\u201335 months exceeds 90% for most recommended childhood vaccines. Previous studies have found that few children receive all their vaccinations on time; however, few studies have examined whether a mother\u2019s country of birth affects her child\u2019s up-to-date vaccination status at various ages. \nWhat is added by this report? \nFewer than half of children born in Minnesota in 2011\u20132012 were up-to-date on their immunizations at 18 months, and only 70% were caught up by 36 months. Up-to-date vaccination status was lower among children with at least one foreign-born parent compared with that of children with two U.S.-born parents, and rates varied by mother\u2019s country of origin. Children with mothers born in Somalia and Eastern Europe had the lowest rates of up-to-date vaccination. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nRefugees and immigrants to the United States from certain regions might have greater difficulties getting their children vaccinated in a timely manner, compared with U.S.-born parents and parents from some other countries. Increased outreach to Eastern European and Somali immigrant, migrant, and refugee populations might benefit children in these communities by improving on-time receipt of recommended vaccinations. \nReceiving recommended childhood vaccinations on schedule is the best way to prevent the occurrence and spread of vaccine-preventable diseases ( 1 ). Vaccination coverage among children aged 19\u201335 months in the United States exceeds 90% for most recommended vaccines in the early childhood series ( 2 ); however, previous studies have found that few children receive all recommended vaccine doses on time ( 3 ). The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), using information from the Minnesota Immunization Information Connection (MIIC) and the MDH Office of Vital Records, examined early childhood immunization rates and found that children with at least one foreign-born parent were less likely to be up-to-date on recommended immunizations at ages 2, 6, 18, and 36 months than were children with two U.S.-born parents. Vaccination coverage at age 36 months varied by mother\u2019s region of origin, ranging from 77.5% among children born to mothers from Central and South America and the Caribbean to 44.2% among children born to mothers from Somalia. Low vaccination coverage in these communities puts susceptible children and adults at risk for outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, as evidenced by the recent measles outbreak in Minnesota ( 4 ). Increased outreach to immigrant, migrant, and refugee populations and other populations with low up-to-date vaccination rates might improve timely vaccination in these communities. \nA retrospective cohort study was conducted using existing birth certificate data from the Office of Vital Records and vaccination records from MIIC. The Office of Vital Records maintains electronic records for all births occurring in Minnesota. MIIC is a statewide immunization information system that includes vaccination records for children and adults residing in Minnesota. Most health care providers in Minnesota routinely submit data to MIIC; 92% of Minnesota children aged 24\u201335 months have at least two noninfluenza vaccination records in the system.* \nBirth records for children born in Minnesota during 2011\u20132012 were obtained from the Office of Vital Records and matched to immunization records by MIIC personnel in November 2016 using birth certificate numbers. All records were for children aged \u226536 months. The information of primary interest was foreign birth of one or both parents, stratified by mother\u2019s region of origin. This information was ascertained from birth records collected by the Office of Vital Records shortly after birth. The primary outcome of interest was the receipt of recommended vaccines at ages 2, 6, 18, and 36 months, \u2020 following the current recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. \u00a7 , \u00b6 Parental demographic characteristics were obtained from birth records maintained by the Office of Vital Records, including race, age, education, country of birth, maternal state of residence, and whether the mother participated in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program during pregnancy. The study protocol was reviewed by the University of Minnesota Institutional Review Board, and deemed exempt from requirement for human subjects research approval. \nChildren were categorized into the following regional groups, based on their mother\u2019s birth country: United States, Asia, Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Canada, Africa (excluding Somalia), Central and South America and the Caribbean, and Oceania/Other. Somalia and Mexico, the two largest groups of foreign-born mothers of children in the sample, were considered separately. All analyses were performed using statistical software. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05, using two-sided tests. Multivariate logistic regression models were adjusted for the following variables: maternal age, race, and educational attainment. These were then used to estimate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for up-to-date vaccinations recommended at ages 2, 6, 18, and 36 months, comparing children with at least one foreign-born parent with children with two U.S.-born parents. \nVaccination records and parental characteristic information were obtained for 135,389 children. Removed from the merged data set were 36,998 records with missing or unknown data on parental countries of birth, maternal state of residence, WIC participation status during pregnancy, parental age, education, or race; children whose status was \u201cnot living\u201d or \u201cunknown\u201d at time of birth record filing (150 children); and children born before 24 weeks\u2019 or after 42 weeks\u2019 gestation or whose gestational age was unknown (356), leaving a final sample of 97,885 (72.3%). Overall, 22% of children had at least one foreign-born parent, 30% of mothers participated in WIC during pregnancy, 80% of mothers were aged 20\u201334 years, nearly 80% were white, and 75% had attended at least some college ( Table 1 ). \nBirth of one or both parents outside the United States was significantly associated with a child\u2019s not being up-to-date on vaccinations at ages 2, 6, and 18 months, and not being caught up by age 36 months ( Figure ). There were differences in children\u2019s up-to-date status by mother\u2019s region of birth. The percentage of children up-to-date at all ages was higher among those whose mothers were born in Central and South America and the Caribbean, Mexico, and Africa (excluding Somalia) than the percentage among children of U.S.-born mothers. In every maternal regional category the percentage of children up-to-date declined from age 2 months to age 6 months and from age 6 months to age 18 months; however, except for children of Somali-born mothers, the percentage of children up-to-date at age 36 months was as high or higher than that at age 2 months. The lowest percentage of children up-to-date at ages 2, 6, and 18 months were those with mothers born in Eastern Europe; just over half of children whose mothers were born in Eastern Europe were up to date at age 36 months. Fewer than 10% of children whose mothers were born in Somalia were up-to-date at 18 months, although by 36 months, 44.2% had caught up. \nOverall, children with at least one foreign-born parent were 25% less likely to be current on their vaccinations at 36 months than were children born to two U.S.-born parents, after adjusting for maternal race, age, and educational attainment ( Table 2 ). Participation in WIC during pregnancy was significantly associated with being up-to-date at 2, 6, and 36 months. Children born to mothers from Africa (excluding Somalia), Central and South America and the Caribbean, and Mexico were significantly more likely to be up-to-date at ages 2, 6, 18, and 36 months compared with children with U.S.-born mothers. Children born to mothers from all other regions (Western Europe and Canada, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Somalia) were significantly less likely to be up-to-date at all ages than were children with U.S.-born mothers. Children with mothers from Somalia and Eastern Europe were least likely to be up-to-date at all ages. Top Discussion \nThis study found wide variation in up-to-date vaccination status at different ages among Minnesota children with U.S.-born parents and those with at least one foreign-born parent. Up-to-date status varied by the mother\u2019s country of origin, with children of mothers born in Eastern Europe, Western Europe and Canada, and Somalia being less likely than children with U.S.-born mothers to be up-to-date at all ages, and those with mothers born in African countries (excluding Somalia), Central and South America and the Caribbean, and Mexico being more likely than children with U.S.-born mothers to be up-to-date at all ages. Inadequate parental understanding of vaccination and weaker public health education programs in some regions might account for some of these findings, as well as economic and social factors influencing emigration, including fleeing war, religious persecution, or poverty ( 5 ). Somali parents in Minnesota have been reported to be more likely than non-Somali parents to have concerns about the safety of measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which has led to a decline in coverage with MMR and possibly other childhood vaccines ( 6 ). From April to August 2017, Minnesota experienced a measles outbreak, ending with 79 confirmed cases, including 65 in children of Somali descent ( 4 ). \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, health care provider participation in MIIC is voluntary, and MIIC might not account for children who receive immunizations in bordering states (excluding Wisconsin and North Dakota, which do exchange immunization data). Second, because of the nature of the data used, information on the health status of children in the study after birth was not available; therefore, it was not possible to determine whether any child had a medical contraindication to vaccination. Finally, the information gathered by the Office of Vital Records on parental countries of origin is self-reported and did not include information on when the parent arrived in the United States. \nParticipation in WIC was associated with an increased likelihood of up-to-date vaccination status, and engaging eligible foreign-born families in programs such as WIC might provide an opportunity to increase on-time vaccination ( 7 ). Focus groups, meetings, and conversations with the Somali community have been employed in an effort to understand the underlying reasons for low vaccination rates; similar work could be done with the Eastern European immigrant community and other populations with low immunization coverage or late vaccination. Possible strategies include outreach to community leaders, parents, interpreters, and spiritual leaders to provide information on vaccines and vaccine preventable diseases. Encouraging medical providers to use interpreters, take time to build trust, and assess vaccination status at every visit might improve vaccination coverage in these populations ( 8 ).

Workplace tobacco-control interventions have been effective in reducing cigarette smoking prevalence and exposure to secondhand smoke. \nWhat is added by this report? \nAnalysis of National Health Interview Survey data for 2014\u20132016 found that among working adults, 22.1% currently (every day or some days) used any form of tobacco product; 15.4% currently used cigarettes, 5.8% used other combustible tobacco products, 3.0% used smokeless tobacco, and 3.6% used electronic cigarettes; overall, 4.6% used two or more tobacco products. By industry, any tobacco product use ranged from 11.0% among education services to 34.3% among construction workers; use of two or more tobacco products was highest among construction industry workers. By occupation, any tobacco use ranged from 9.3% among life, physical, and social science workers to 37.2% among installation, maintenance, and repair workers; use of two or more tobacco products was highest among installation, maintenance, and repair workers. \nWhat are the implications for public health action? \nThese findings underscore the importance of continued implementation of proven strategies to prevent and reduce tobacco product use, including current use of multiple products among working adults. To maximize the health of workers, employers could also consider integrating comprehensive and effective tobacco cessation programs into health promotion programs in the workplace. \nCigarette smoking has declined considerably among U.S. adults over several decades ( 1 ); however, increases have occurred in the use of noncigarette tobacco products in recent years, and the use of multiple tobacco products has become common among current users of noncigarette tobacco products ( 2 , 3 ). Differences in tobacco use have also been observed across population subgroups, including among working adults ( 2 , 4 ). CDC analyzed National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data for 2014\u20132016 to describe the most recent prevalence estimates of current (every day or some days) tobacco product use among working U.S. adults by industry and occupation. Among working adults, 22.1% (32.7 million) currently used any form of tobacco; 15.4% used cigarettes, 5.8% used other combustible tobacco (cigars, pipes, water pipes or hookahs, very small cigars, and bidis), 3.0% used smokeless tobacco, and 3.6% used electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes); 4.6% (6.9 million) reported current use of two or more tobacco products. By industry, any tobacco use ranged from 11.0% among education services to 34.3% among construction workers; current use of two or more tobacco products was highest among construction workers (7.1%). By occupation, any tobacco use ranged from 9.3% among life, physical, and social science workers to 37.2% among installation, maintenance, and repair workers; current use of two or more tobacco products was highest among installation, maintenance, and repair workers (10.1%). Proven interventions to prevent and reduce tobacco product use, including current use of multiple products, among working adults are important ( 5 , 6 ). Workplace tobacco-control interventions have been especially effective in reducing cigarette smoking prevalence ( 7 ). \nNHIS data* are collected annually from a nationally representative sample of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population through a personal interview. Basic health and demographic information is collected for all family members. One adult aged \u226518 years per family is randomly selected to participate in the NHIS Sample Adult component of the survey, which contains questions on employment status and tobacco use. To improve the precision and reliability of estimates, NHIS data collected during 2014\u20132016 were combined. The NHIS Sample Adult component included 36,697 respondents in 2014, 33,672 respondents in 2015, and 33,028 respondents in 2016; response rates for those years were 60.8%, 55.2%, and 54.3%, respectively. The analysis was restricted to working adults (59,690; 57.7%). Respondents were considered to be currently working if, when asked about their employment status during the week before their interview, they reported that they were \u201cworking at a job or business,\u201d \u201cwith a job or business but not at work,\u201d or \u201cworking, but not for pay, at a family-owned job or business.\u201d Information on participants\u2019 current industry and occupation was coded by trained coders and grouped into 21 industry groups and 23 occupation groups. \u2020 \nCurrent cigarette smokers were defined as respondents who reported having smoked \u2265100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who reported now smoking \u201cevery day\u201d or \u201csome days.\u201d Current other combustible tobacco smokers were those who reported smoking tobacco products other than cigarettes (including cigars, pipes, water pipes or hookahs, very small cigars, and bidis) at least once during their lifetime and currently smoking \u201cevery day\u201d or \u201csome days.\u201d Current smokeless tobacco users were those who reported using smokeless tobacco products (including chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, or dissolvable tobacco) at least once during their lifetime and who currently use \u201cevery day\u201d or \u201csome days.\u201d Current e-cigarette users were those who reported using e-cigarettes at least once during their lifetime and current use \u201cevery day\u201d or \u201csome days.\u201d Any current tobacco users were those who reported using one or more tobacco products (cigarettes, other combustible tobacco products, smokeless tobacco, or e-cigarettes). Multiple tobacco users were those who reported current use of two or more tobacco products. \nData were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to be nationally representative. Prevalence estimates and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated overall and by sociodemographic characteristics, industry, and occupation. Estimates with a relative standard error >30% are not reported. Two-sided t-tests \u00a7 were used to determine statistically significant (p<0.05) differences between point estimates. \nDuring 2014\u20132016, among the annual estimated 242 million adults aged \u226518 years, 148 million (61.2%) were employed during the week before the interview. Among currently employed adults, 22.1% currently used any form of tobacco, including 15.4% who used cigarettes, 5.8% who used other combustible tobacco, 3.0% who used smokeless tobacco, and 3.6% who used e-cigarettes; 4.6% reported using two or more tobacco products. \nAny current tobacco use was highest among men (27.4%), non-Hispanic whites (whites) (24.8%), persons aged 18\u201334 years (24.9%), those with high school education or less (30.1%), those with no health insurance (33.9%), those living below the federal poverty level \u00b6 (28.5%), and those living in the Midwest (25.8%). Multiple tobacco product use was highest among men (6.5%), whites (5.5%), persons aged 18\u201334 years (6.0%), persons with a high school education or less (6.2%), and persons with no health insurance (7.7%) ( Table 1 ). \nCurrent tobacco use varied by industry ( Table 2 ) and occupation ( Table 3 ). Workers in the construction industry (34.3%) and installation, maintenance, and repair occupations (37.2%) had the highest reported use of any tobacco. Multiple tobacco product use was highest among workers in the construction industry (7.1%) and installation, maintenance, and repair occupations (10.1%). Cigarette smoking was highest among workers in the accommodation and food services industry (24.0%) and construction and extraction occupations (25.8%). Other combustible tobacco product use was highest among workers in the utilities industry (9.0%) and protective services occupations (10.2%). Smokeless tobacco use was highest among workers in the mining industry (14.3%) and installation, maintenance and repair occupations (9.6%). E-cigarette use was highest among workers in the accommodation and food services industry (5.8%) and installation, maintenance, and repair occupations (7.9%). Top Discussion \nDuring 2014\u20132016, an estimated one in five working U.S. adults (32.7 million; 22.1%) currently used some form of tobacco, and cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product. Overall, a decline in cigarette smoking, smokeless tobacco, and e-cigarette use was observed among U.S. workers ( 2 , 4 ). However, tobacco use varied by product type, sociodemographic characteristics, and industry and occupation, with a higher prevalence of any tobacco use among workers in the construction industries and installation, maintenance, and repair occupations. These findings underscore the importance of implementation of evidence-based interventions, in coordination with continued surveillance of all forms of tobacco products use, to reduce tobacco-related disease and death** among U.S. working adults, particularly industry and occupation groups with higher tobacco use prevalences ( 1 ). \nAmong working adult tobacco users, an estimated 6.9 million adults used two or more tobacco products. Use of multiple tobacco products is associated with increased risk for nicotine addiction, dependence, and adverse health effects ( 3 , 8 ). These health effects can lead to increased risks for tobacco-related morbidity and mortality ( 3 ). In addition, variations in multiple tobacco product use were observed across population groups, which is consistent with previous findings of higher prevalences of combustible and smokeless tobacco use among workers in certain industries and occupations ( 2 ). These findings underscore the importance of opportunities for targeted efforts to reduce tobacco use among populations with the greatest prevalence of tobacco use, including multiple tobacco product users. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the collected employment information applied only to the week before the interview. Some workers might have changed jobs, and thus, might have been in a different occupation or industry at the time of the survey interview. However, supplemental analyses examining the longest held job yielded similar results. Second, the extent of under- or overreporting of tobacco use could not be determined because tobacco use information was self-reported, and thus, was not validated by biochemical tests. However, comparison of self-reported smoking status with measured serum cotinine levels suggests generally high levels of correlation ( 9 ). Finally, estimates for some groups (e.g., management of companies and enterprises industry workers) and tobacco product use were unreliable and suppressed because of small sample sizes. \nContinued implementation of proven strategies to address tobacco use among U.S. adults is important ( 6 , 8 , 10 ). Proven strategies include anti-tobacco messages; comprehensive tobacco-free laws covering public places and worksites; providing comprehensive coverage for tobacco cessation treatments for employees; increased tobacco prices; and tailored interventions that help prevent initiation and encourage cessation among workers. Workplace tobacco-control interventions have been especially effective in reducing cigarette smoking prevalence ( 7 ). Previous research has indicated that workers at worksites that adopted or maintained smoke-free policies were twice as likely to quit smoking than those whose worksites did not implement such policies ( 7 ). To maximize the health of workers, employers can also consider integrating comprehensive and effective tobacco cessation programs into workplace health promotion programs ( 7 , 10 ).

During 2011\u20132015, the proportion of women who had HCV infection before their date of delivery increased 93%, from 1 in 368 pregnancies to 1 in 192 pregnancies. Among the infants born to women who had evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 34% received HCV testing per the recommendations and evidence of vertical transmission was documented in 4% of infants. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nAs the rate of HCV infection among women of childbearing age continues to increase nationally, practices for screening pregnant women for HCV and for monitoring infants born to HCV-infected mothers should be improved. Enhanced identification through testing all pregnant women with HCV risk factors and improved public health surveillance of infants at risk for HCV vertical transmission will improve identification, detection, and care for HCV-infected women and infants at risk for HCV vertical transmission. \nState surveillance during the last 10 years reveals a nationwide increase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young adults ( 1 ). The proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women is also increasing nationally ( 2 ). To estimate the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women and the frequency of confirmed HCV infection in their infants, maternal name and date of birth from HCV reports in the Wisconsin Electronic Disease Surveillance System (WEDSS) were linked to Wisconsin Medicaid data for 2011\u20132015 births. During this period, in the Wisconsin Medicaid population, the proportion of women who had evidence of HCV infection during pregnancy increased 93%, from 1 in 368 pregnancies to 1 in 192. Among 183 infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 34% received recommended HCV testing ( 3 ). Mother-to-infant (vertical) transmission was documented in 4% of infants. Improvements in HCV screening practices among pregnant women and infants could enhance identification of infants at risk for vertical transmission of HCV. \nFueled by the increase in injection drug use ensuing from the opioid epidemic, the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women is increasing nationwide ( 1 , 2 ). Vertical transmission is the most common mechanism of HCV infection for children, reported to occur in approximately 6% of infants born to women with HCV infection and approximately twice as often in women who are coinfected with HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) ( 4 , 5 ). Another risk factor that might increase the likelihood of vertical HCV transmission is presence of maternal HCV viremia (HCV RNA positivity) ( 5 ). Unlike other bloodborne infectious diseases that have a risk for vertical transmission, such as hepatitis B virus or HIV, for HCV there is no perinatal intervention available that has been shown to reduce vertical HCV transmission ( 4 \u2013 6 ). Clinical signs of pediatric HCV infection often manifest slowly and can range in severity from being asymptomatic to fatal; liver transplantation is sometimes required ( 7 , 8 ). \nDuring 2011\u20132015, the reported rate of HCV among persons aged 15\u201344 years in Wisconsin increased 81%, from 45.7 to 82.6 per 100,000 population; 3,013 (43%) reported cases in this age group were in women (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2016). Increases in the number of women of childbearing age with HCV in Wisconsin predict an increase in the number of infants at risk for vertical transmission. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion of women enrolled in Wisconsin Medicaid with HCV infection during pregnancy and estimate the frequency of HCV testing and infection in infants born to HCV-infected women. \nSince 2000, all HCV-positive laboratory tests in Wisconsin have been reportable to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services through WEDSS. To identify maternal HCV infection, Wisconsin Medicaid encounter data for pregnant women who delivered one or more infants during 2011\u20132015 were extracted and linked by maternal name and maternal date of birth to WEDSS. For women who matched to both data sources, WEDSS HCV surveillance data were reviewed for evidence of HCV infection (positive laboratory reports for anti-HCV antibody or RNA). The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Minimal Risk (Health Sciences) Institutional Review Board at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison. \nConsistent with a previous study ( 5 ), vertical transmission risk by pregnancy was classified based on presence of maternal HCV infection (anti-HCV antibody or HCV RNA). Women with HCV infection reported before their date of delivery were categorized into three risk groups: 1) high risk (evidence of viremia [RNA-positive] during pregnancy); 2) possible risk (evidence of viremia before pregnancy but no RNA results during pregnancy); and 3) unknown viremic risk (anti-HCV antibody-positive but no RNA results). Women in the cohort whose first reported HCV infection was after delivery were categorized separately, because HCV infection status during pregnancy was not known. The proportion of pregnancies at risk for vertical transmission was calculated as the number of pregnancies among Medicaid recipients who had evidence of HCV infection among all pregnancies in Medicaid recipients. \nAmong infants born to women at high risk, Medicaid encounter data were searched for evidence of HCV testing, indicated by a Current Procedural Terminology code or an International Classification of Diseases, 9th and 10th Revisions , Clinical Modification code for HCV infection from the date of birth through June 30, 2016 (last date with complete and available data). Medicaid encounter data for infants were linked by name and date of birth to WEDSS to identify evidence of HCV infection. Infants were classified as having been tested according to recommendations if the infant had an anti-HCV antibody test after age 18 months or two or more HCV RNA tests after age 2 months ( 3 ). HCV vertical transmission was determined through WEDSS data and was defined as a positive laboratory report of HCV infection in an infant tested for HCV per recommendations ( 3 ). \nAmong 146,267 Wisconsin Medicaid recipients who had a birth during 2011\u20132015, evidence of HCV infection before the delivery date was documented for 608 (0.4%) women. Among these women, 180 (30%) were classified as being at high risk, two of whom had HIV coinfection; 151 (25%) were classified as being at possible risk; and 277 (46%) were classified as having an unknown viremic risk. An additional 472 women had an HCV infection reported after their date of delivery ( Figure 1 ). The proportion of women with an HCV infection before their date of delivery increased 93% from 2011 (2.7 per 1,000) to 2015 (5.2 per 1,000) ( Figure 2 ); an increase from 1 in 368 pregnancies to 1 in 192. \nThe median age of women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy was 26 years (range = 18\u201347 years) ( Table ). Among the 180 women who had evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 142 (79%) were non-Hispanic white, compared with 52% of women who did not have any evidence of HCV infection during pregnancy (Table). \nAmong 183 infants born to women who had evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 92 (50%) were continuously enrolled in Medicaid for \u226518 months (range = 18\u201366 months). Among these infants, 31 (34%) were tested for HCV according to recommendations, including 24 who had an anti-HCV antibody test at age >18 months and seven who had at least two RNA tests at age >2 months. Vertical transmission was documented in seven (4%) of the 183 infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy. Top Discussion \nConsistent with national and other state studies ( 2 , 4 ), these findings demonstrate that among Wisconsin Medicaid recipients, the rate of HCV infection among pregnant women is increasing. A recent national study used birth certificates to document maternal HCV infection and found that 1 in 308 infants were born to HCV-infected women in 2014 ( 2 ). In Wisconsin, an estimated 30% of children born to women with HCV infection do not have HCV indicated on their birth certificate (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2017). The current study which used surveillance data mandated by state statute to identify maternal HCV infection and therefore might provide more complete HCV case ascertainment, found that the rate of births to Wisconsin Medicaid-recipients with HCV infection approximately doubled from 2011 to 2015, from 2.7% to 5.2%. \nThe age, race, and ethnicity of women with HCV infection during pregnancy in this study were similar to those in previously reported studies ( 1 , 2 , 4 ) and are consistent with trends among young adults with recent HCV infection in Wisconsin (Wisconsin Division of Public Health, unpublished data, 2016). Of interest is the young age of women who had evidence of HCV infection before delivery and after delivery (median age 27 and 24 years, respectively). Without appropriate treatment for HCV, infants subsequently born to HCV-infected women are at risk for mother-to-infant transmission. \nAmong a subset of infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy, 4% had confirmed infection. Prior studies have indicated a lack of adequate HCV testing among children born to HCV-infected women ( 4 , 9 ). In the current study, only 34% of Wisconsin Medicaid-recipient infants born to women with evidence of HCV viremia during pregnancy were tested for HCV according to recommendations ( 3 ), revealing a substantial gap in monitoring infants at risk for HCV vertical transmission. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, statewide surveillance data were used to identify HCV infection status and vertical transmission risk category. These data rely on reports from risk-based HCV testing and laboratory reporting and are likely to underestimate the number of women and children with HCV infection. Second, HCV RNA\u2013negative results were not reportable at the time of analysis. Therefore, the number of women with resolved HCV infection is unknown. However, because there are no approved treatment regimens for HCV during pregnancy, it is unlikely that women classified as at high risk had resolved infection before delivery. Third, only 50% of infants born to women at high risk were continuously enrolled in Medicaid, and therefore, HCV testing data for all infants were unavailable. Finally, this analysis of women and infants enrolled in Medicaid represents approximately 38% of the deliveries in Wisconsin during the study period.* \nEnhanced identification through HCV screening during pregnancy and public health follow-up to monitor infants at risk for vertical transmission are needed. The current recommendation for identifying HCV-infected pregnant women is through risk-based screening ( 3 , 10 ). Pregnancy and postpregnancy care might provide an opportune time to test women and link HCV-infected women to HCV care or treatment, because this is a time when a woman might be likely to use health care services. To improve surveillance of HCV vertical transmission, support identification of cases, and evaluate health outcomes of infected infants, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists \u2020 recently approved of and issued a position statement for reporting and national notification of perinatal HCV infection. Adoption of this position statement by state and local health departments, along with enhanced identification of HCV among women of childbearing age, can improve care for HCV-infected women and infants at risk for HCV vertical transmission ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "madison", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wisconsin department of health services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council of state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minimal risk (health sciences) institutional review board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin division of public health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T02:40:28.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e0d88b4bc34dc87dcbf9de576792b9ef3696386b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvUiJov8YOm3IqXbje6zgIqY-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/rss/mmwr.xml", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", "title": "Rapid Field Response to a Cluster of Illnesses and Deaths \u2014 Sinoe County, Liberia, April\u2013May, 2017", "title_full": "Rapid Field Response to a Cluster of Illnesses and Deaths \u2014 Sinoe County, Liberia, April\u2013May, 2017", "published": "2017-10-26T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/mm6642a4_Rapid_Field_Response_Cluster_Illnesses_Deaths.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e0d88b4bc34dc87dcbf9de576792b9ef3696386b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvUiJov8YOm3IqXbje6zgIqY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-26T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Rapid Field Response to a Cluster of Illnesses and Deaths \u2014 Sinoe County, Liberia, April\u2013May, 2017", "text": "Rapid Field Response to a Cluster of Illnesses and Deaths \u2014 Sinoe County, Liberia, April\u2013May, 2017 \nWeekly / October 27, 2017 / 66(42);1140\u20131143 Format: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Views: Metric Details \nJohn Doedeh, MD 1 ; Joseph Asamoah Frimpong, MPhil 2 ; Kwuakuan D.M.

Kainne Dokubo, MD 10 ( View author affiliations ) Summary \nWhat is already known about this topic? \nThe 2014\u20132015 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) outbreak in West Africa devastated Liberia\u2019s already fragile health system, and it took many months for the country to mount an effective response to the epidemic. Substantial efforts have been made to strengthen Liberia\u2019s health system to prevent, detect, and respond to future health threats. \nWhat is added by this report? \nIn April 2017, a cluster of 27 cases of unexplained illness, including 10 deaths, occurred in Sinoe County, Liberia. Response measures were immediately implemented to ascertain the cause of illness, control the outbreak and prevent new cases and deaths. Epidemiologic investigations revealed that the cases occurred in persons who attended a funeral event in Sinoe County, and laboratory testing confirmed Neisseria meningitidis as the cause of illness. The Liberia Ministry of Health declared that the illnesses and deaths were attributable to an outbreak of meningococcal disease. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nThe rapid response to the cluster of illnesses and deaths is a reflection of the increased public health and outbreak response capacity established in Liberia during and subsequent to the Ebola epidemic, which has enhanced global health security. The response also highlights the importance of enhanced surveillance systems, improved laboratory capacity, a trained workforce and emergency management capacity to prevent widespread disease outbreaks. \nOn April 25, 2017, the Sinoe County Health Team (CHT) notified the Liberia Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Public Health Institute of Liberia of an unknown illness among 14 persons that resulted in eight deaths in Sinoe County. On April 26, the National Rapid Response Team and epidemiologists from CDC, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) in Liberia were deployed to support the county-led response. Measures were immediately implemented to identify all cases, ascertain the cause of illness, and control the outbreak. Illness was associated with attendance at a funeral event, and laboratory testing confirmed Neisseria meningitidis in biologic specimens from cases. The 2014\u20132015 Ebola virus disease (Ebola) outbreak in West Africa devastated Liberia\u2019s already fragile health system, and it took many months for the country to mount an effective response to control the outbreak. Substantial efforts have been made to strengthen Liberia\u2019s health system to prevent, detect, and respond to health threats. The rapid and efficient field response to this outbreak of N. meningitidis resulted in implementation of appropriate steps to prevent a widespread outbreak and reflects improved public health and outbreak response capacity in Liberia. Top Investigation and Results \nSinoe, one of 15 counties in Liberia, is located in the southeastern part of the country and has an estimated population of 102,391 ( 1 ). The county has 33 clinics and one hospital (F.J. Grante Memorial Hospital), which serves as the referral health facility. In the early hours of April 25, 10 patients were admitted to F.J. Grante Hospital in critical condition with symptoms including headache, altered mental status, generalized weakness, abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea, which started after they attended a funeral event in Sinoe County on April 21 and 22. Five of the patients rapidly deteriorated and died within a few hours of admission. Three other patients with the same symptoms died before arrival at the hospital. Clinicians reported that a female patient aged 11 years with similar symptoms was admitted to the isolation ward on April 23 following illness onset the previous day and died a few hours after admission. \nSinoe CHT immediately notified national health authorities of the illnesses and deaths, and launched a county-led response with support from technical partners, using an Incident Management System that had been established during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola outbreak response ( 2 ). The multisectorial response comprised epidemiology/surveillance and data management, case management, infection prevention and control, laboratory, social mobilization and health promotion, psychosocial, and dead body management. All activities were coordinated by the County Health Officer and County Superintendent with support from technical partners; daily analyses and situational reports were shared with stakeholders. \nEpidemiologic investigations were aimed at identifying all cases and establishing linkages and potential exposures. The investigation was reviewed in accordance with CDC\u2019s human subjects review procedures and was determined to be nonresearch, routine public health activity. Based on symptoms reported among ill persons, a case was defined as the onset of two or more symptoms including headache, vomiting, mental confusion, or weakness, on or after April 10, 2017, in any person who had visited or lived in Sinoe County. A questionnaire was developed to gather demographic information, symptoms and onset date, as well as data on foods consumed, exposure to ill persons, travel history, and other potential exposures. Liberia Field Epidemiology Training Program\u2013trained surveillance officers conducted case investigations and active case finding, with supervision from CDC, WHO, AFENET, and national-level epidemiologists. \nTwenty-seven cases were identified over the course of the investigation in Sinoe County; 16 (59%) occurred in females. The median patient age was 19 years (range = 10\u201354 years). The outbreak peaked on April 23 with 12 cases ( Figure 1 ) and resulted in 10 deaths (case fatality ratio = 37%). Most cases were clustered around Teah Town community in Greenville city, Sinoe County ( Figure 2 ), which recorded 11 cases with six deaths. A number of patients were family members or friends of one another, resided in the same household or neighboring houses, and attended the same school or place of worship. Information was also obtained from close contacts of patients and persons who attended the funeral but had not fallen ill. \nThe outbreak was hypothesized to be linked to attendance at funeral events on April 21\u201322 (overnight wake on April 21 and funeral service and burial in the early afternoon on April 22, followed by a repast in the late afternoon on April 22). A 1:2 unmatched case-control study with 25 case-patients and 50 controls was conducted to compare the odds of exposure among case-patients and controls (asymptomatic funeral attendees and community members). Statistically significant association with exposure was determined at a p<0.05. The inferential analysis showed that cases were 22 times more likely to have attended the funeral wake than were controls (odds ratio [OR] = 22.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.78\u2013176.61) (p<0.05). Further analyses showed an association with food served at the wake, with the strongest association observed with consumption of tea (OR = 11.23, 95% CI 3.61\u201334.96). There were no reports of travel outside Liberia and no significant associations observed with other exposures analyzed. \nBlood, urine, and stool specimens were collected from patients, and oral swab and pericardial fluid specimens were collected from decedents. Twenty-three specimens tested negative for Lassa fever and Ebola virus by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction at the National Reference Laboratory in Liberia. Hematologic and chemistry analyses of biologic specimens were unrevealing, and water samples from Sinoe County tested negative for coliforms. Food samples from the funeral event were collected for further analysis and biologic specimens from patients were sent to international laboratories for additional diagnostic evaluation. Top Public Health Response \nActive case search and heightened surveillance in the community and health facilities were initiated to identify additional cases and persons at risk. Patients and their family members were interviewed by surveillance officers, clinical information was obtained from medical records, and a database was created to manage the epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory data. In addition to the 27 cases, 60 funeral attendees and 152 contacts of cases in Sinoe County were identified and monitored daily. \nPatients evaluated at the hospital were admitted to the isolation unit or emergency ward under close observation. Because the etiology of illness was initially unknown, clinicians provided supportive treatment, based on symptoms and physical examination findings of each patient, with intravenous fluids, supplemental oxygen, empiric antimicrobial therapy with broad spectrum antibiotics (including Ceftriaxone, Ciprofloxacin, and Metronidazole), and antimalarial therapy. Aside from one additional death that occurred on April 26, all seventeen subsequent patients who were managed at the hospital survived. Infection prevention and control standards and protocols were emphasized in health facilities and promoted in the community and at points of entry. Use of personal protective equipment by health care workers was reinforced, assessments for personal protective equipment availability were conducted, and adequate infection prevention and control supplies were provided to health facilities. \nThe social mobilization and health promotion team engaged community and religious leaders to raise awareness, dispel rumors, and overcome community resistance. Social mobilizers conducted house-to-house awareness activities and provided information to the public through radio talk shows and street broadcasters, encouraging ill persons to seek care at health facilities. A town hall meeting was convened to solicit information from community members and for health officials to answer questions from the public. Social mobilizers also accompanied surveillance officers during active case search, facilitating entry and surveillance activities in the community. The psychosocial team provided Psychosocial First Aid for bereaved families and conducted daily visits to patients who had been discharged from the hospital and patients who refused to seek care at the health facility. The dead body management team provided safe and dignified burials for decedents. Specimens collected from patients were transported daily via an existing sample transport network for testing at the National Reference Laboratory. Aliquots of specimens were sent to CDC for additional diagnostic evaluation and tested negative for heavy metals and organophosphates. \nIn addition to the 27 cases with 10 deaths reported in Sinoe County, four epidemiologically-linked cases, including three deaths, were reported in Montserrado and Grand Bassa Counties. The last death occurred on May 3 in Grand Bassa County and the last case linked to the cluster was reported on May 7. On May 8, Liberia MOH declared that the illnesses and deaths were attributable to a probable outbreak of meningococcal disease, based on detection of N. meningitidis in specimens tested at CDC headquarters in Atlanta. Top Discussion \nUnexplained health events have significant implications when illness results from an infectious etiology and immediate control measures are not implemented ( 3 ). The presentation of cases and preliminary epidemiologic data suggested a common source outbreak or toxic exposure, and a concerted effort was made to rule out possible infectious etiologies. Building on response structures established during the Ebola epidemic ( 2 ), the CHT rapidly established all technical components of the response with support from the national rapid response team and technical partners, and was able to respond immediately to the health threat at its source, a requirement for an effective outbreak response ( 4 ). \nThe 2014 Ebola epidemic devastated Liberia\u2019s already fragile health system, which was ill-prepared to respond to the initial cases of Ebola and prevent spread of infection ( 5 , 6 ). With support from international partners, the widespread outbreak was brought under control, and Liberia was declared free of Ebola virus transmission. The West Africa Ebola epidemic demonstrated that global health security relies on resilient health systems in all countries that are capable of rapidly detecting and controlling public health threats at their source ( 7 ). Support from CDC and other partners has increased capacity in core areas of disease surveillance, laboratory systems, workforce development and emergency operations, strengthening Liberia\u2019s public health system against future disease outbreaks. \nA robust surveillance system with capacity for immediate disease detection and reporting can facilitate response efforts and limit the magnitude of a potential outbreak ( 8 ). In Liberia, event-based surveillance for diseases of high epidemic potential or high morbidity and mortality is implemented through the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response system, which captures 14 priority diseases and conditions, including unexplained clusters of health events and deaths ( 9 ). The prompt detection and immediate notification by district and county-level surveillance officers trained through the CDC-supported Liberia Field Epidemiology Training Program enabled the rapid response. Enhanced in-country laboratory capacity facilitated rapid testing and rule-out of Ebola and Lassa fever. Effective case management likely increased survival among patients, even before the diagnosis was confirmed. \nAlthough the cause of illnesses and deaths was initially unknown, response measures were implemented while additional investigations were underway to determine the etiology and source of the outbreak. In 2014, an initial cluster of illnesses and deaths caused by Ebola took more than 90 days from detection to coordination of the emergency response and led to a widespread epidemic. In contrast, response efforts for this cluster of illnesses and deaths were initiated within less than 24 hours of detection. After effective control of the outbreak, WHO issued a notice on July 6, 2017, assessing the risk for recurrence of the meningococcal disease outbreak as low ( 10 ). Compared with the insufficient early response to the Ebola outbreak in Liberia in 2014, the rapid and effective response to this outbreak demonstrates the marked improvements in public health capacities in Liberia. Because public health emergencies such as Ebola and meningococcal disease outbreaks can rapidly spread internationally, these improvements in response capacity in Liberia contribute to enhance global health security.

Globally, the highest disease burden is observed in the African meningitis belt that stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia; however, sporadic meningococcal disease cases and outbreaks also occur worldwide. \nWhat is added by this report? \nFollowing the detection of an outbreak of an unknown etiology surrounding a funeral event in Liberia, a rapid laboratory response using the Taqman Array Card (TAC) and confirmatory direct real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays identified N. meningitidis serogroup C as the cause of the outbreak. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nPrompt and accurate detection of outbreaks allows public health officials to respond quickly and implement appropriate control measures. This report underscores the utility of TAC assay and direct real-time PCR in diagnosing outbreaks of unknown etiology. \nOn April 25, 2017, a cluster of unexplained illness and deaths among persons who had attended a funeral during April 21\u201322 was reported in Sinoe County, Liberia ( 1 ). Using a broad initial case definition, 31 cases were identified, including 13 (42%) deaths. Twenty-seven cases were from Sinoe County ( 1 ), and two cases each were from Grand Bassa and Monsterrado counties, respectively. On May 5, 2017, initial multipathogen testing of specimens from four fatal cases using the Taqman Array Card (TAC) assay identified Neisseria meningitidis in all specimens. Subsequent testing using direct real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed N. meningitidis in 14 (58%) of 24 patients with available specimens and identified N. meningitidis serogroup C (NmC) in 13 (54%) patients. N. meningitidis was detected in specimens from 11 of the 13 patients who died; no specimens were available from the other two fatal cases. On May 16, 2017, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia and the Ministry of Health of Liberia issued a press release confirming serogroup C meningococcal disease as the cause of this outbreak in Liberia. \nMeningococcal disease, caused by the bacterium N. meningitidis , is a serious febrile illness that most commonly manifests as meningitis or septicemia. N. meningitidis is classified into 12 serogroups based on its polysaccharide capsule; however, six serogroups (A, B, C, W, X, and Y) are responsible for a majority of meningococcal disease cases worldwide.* Meningococcal meningitis is characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or confusion. Meningococcal septicemia often begins with nonspecific signs and symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and diarrhea; in later stages, a hemorrhagic purpuric rash often occurs. However, absence of fever as well as hypothermia have been reported among persons with severe meningococcal septicemia ( 2 , 3 ). Worldwide, the greatest burden of meningococcal disease is in the African meningitis belt, which stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia, but does not include Liberia. Historically, N. meningitidis serogroup A (NmA) was responsible for majority of the epidemics in the meningitis belt. However, since 2010, the phased introduction of a meningococcal serogroup A conjugate vaccine (PsA\u2013TT, MenAfriVac) throughout the meningitis belt, has substantially reduced NmA incidence and eliminated NmA epidemics ( 4 ). Recently, the region has experienced epidemics of NmC occurring in Niger (2015, 2017) ( 5 ) and Nigeria (2017). \u2020 \nThe cases of unexplained illness in Liberia were tightly clustered in time, with illness onset from April 21, 2017, through April 30, 2017 ( Figure ). The outbreak case definition comprised two or more symptoms including headache, vomiting, mental confusion, or weakness, with illness onset on or after April 10, 2017, in any person who visited or lived in Sinoe County ( 1 ). Among the 31 reported cases, the predominant reported signs and symptoms included weakness (28; 90%), abdominal pain (25; 81%), headache (24; 77%), and vomiting (20; 65%); fever was reported in only six (19%) patients. There were no reports of travel outside Liberia among the funeral attendees. Upon identification of the cluster, oral swab and blood specimens from patients were immediately tested in Liberia for Ebola virus and Lassa virus; both were ruled out. Because most of the patients were afebrile, a noninfectious etiology was considered likely; however, the nonspecific symptoms reported could have also been caused by an infection. Specimens collected from patients during the outbreak investigation were sent to multiple international laboratories for additional testing. On May 2, 2017, seven specimens (three whole blood, three oral swabs, and one plasma) from four fatal cases and three urine specimens from three nonfatal cases were received at CDC headquarters in Atlanta for testing. The urine specimens from the three nonfatal cases were tested for toxic metals and organophosphate insecticide metabolites; findings were not consistent with an exposure that could explain the outbreak. On May 5, 2017, six specimens (three whole blood, one plasma, and two oral swab specimens) from the four fatal cases were tested using the TAC assay. Developed at CDC, the TAC assay is a rapid diagnostic microfluidics-based real-time PCR assay that allows for simultaneous detection of approximately 40 viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens found in blood or cerebrospinal fluid ( 6 ). N. meningitidis was detected in all six specimens. On May 6, 2017, all specimens from the four fatal cases, including the six specimens tested by TAC assay and the additional oral swab specimen, underwent confirmatory testing by direct real-time PCR at CDC. Using a molecular target different from the one used in the TAC assay, N. meningitidis species was confirmed in all seven specimens and NmC was identified as the specific serogroup in all seven specimens. \nOn May 9, 2017, CDC staff members deployed to Liberia to establish direct real-time PCR capacity for N. meningitidis testing in Liberia. Working with Liberian counterparts, the CDC team tested 56 additional specimens from 24 of the 31 cases initially identified as part of the outbreak. Overall, N. meningitidis was detected in specimens from 14 (58%) patients, 13 (54%) of which were confirmed as NmC and one which was nongroupable Nm (negative for invasive serogroups A, B, C, W, X, and Y). Notably, N. meningitidis was detected in specimens from 11 of the 13 patients who died; specimens from the other two fatal cases were not available for testing. On May 16, 2017, the National Public Health Institute of Liberia and the Ministry of Health of Liberia declared that the cluster of illness had been confirmed as a serogroup C meningococcal disease outbreak. \nPatients who tested positive for N. meningitidis by PCR (14 patients) had more severe illness than did those who tested negative (10 patients). The interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was shorter among PCR-positive patients (median = 1 day, range = 0\u20132 days) than among PCR-negative patients (median = 6.5 days; range = 1\u201310 days), and 11 of the 14 PCR-positive patients died, whereas all 10 PCR-negative patients survived. Among the 11 PCR-positive patients who died, the median interval from symptom onset to death was 1 day (range = 0\u20134 days). \nIn addition to rapid testing of outbreak specimens in Liberia, the CDC team trained the Liberian National Public Health Reference Laboratory staff members in the use of direct real-time PCR and culture for the three main bacterial meningitis pathogens in sub-Saharan Africa, N. meningitidis , Haemophilus influenzae , and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The CDC team also provided training on transport and storage of specimens from patients with suspected meningitis. These trainings strengthened capacity for meningitis testing in Liberia. Top Discussion \nIn this outbreak, after ruling out Ebola and Lassa virus, the low prevalence of fever, high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and clustered onset of illness resulted in a broad differential diagnosis that initially focused on toxic exposures rather than infectious disease. In addition, because Liberia is not located within the African meningitis belt, there was not a high index of suspicion for meningococcal disease. The prompt identification of the cluster by the Liberian authorities and the rapid response from CDC, which included testing using the TAC assay and direct real-time PCR, allowed N. meningitidis to be identified as the cause of the outbreak. Because N. meningitidis often colonizes the nasopharynx asymptomatically and can be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers, it is not possible to ascertain how the outbreak strain of NmC was introduced into this population. \u00a7 \nThe high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms among cases in this outbreak is unusual for a meningococcal disease cluster; however, a serogroup W meningococcal disease cluster with a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and a high case-fatality rate was recently reported from England ( 7 ). Generally, gastrointestinal symptoms are more commonly observed with meningococcal septicemia than with meningitis. The available data on meningococcemia in the African meningitis belt are sparse, but meningitis appears to be a more common clinical manifestation of N. meningitidis infection in this region than meningococcemia. Furthermore, in previous outbreaks, reported meningococcemia cases also presented with symptoms of meningitis ( 8 , 9 ). The high case-fatality rate is consistent with findings from other meningococcal disease outbreaks ( 7 , 8 ). \nThe use of a broad initial case definition was appropriate, given that the etiology of the outbreak was unknown; however, this case definition could capture patients with mild symptoms who are unlikely to have meningococcal disease. N. meningitidis was not detected in specimens from all patients, and the patients whose specimens tested negative by PCR had milder illness than did those who tested positive. This finding suggests that some PCR-negative patients likely did not have meningococcal disease; however, meningococcal disease cannot be ruled out definitively for patients who tested negative, because some specimens might have been collected several days after antibiotic treatment was initiated, when PCR might have lower sensitivity to detect N. meningitidis ( 10 ) . \nThis experience illustrates the importance of rapid laboratory confirmation in an outbreak investigation. The rapid detection of and response to the outbreak by Liberian health authorities is particularly noteworthy and highlights the impact of global health security capacity-building efforts on improving public health laboratory and emergency response capacities. This investigation also highlights the utility of the TAC assay in diagnosing outbreaks of unknown etiology, and shows the effectiveness of direct real-time PCR as a diagnostic tool for rapid response. Determination of the etiology of this outbreak enabled Liberian health authorities to implement appropriate response measures. With PCR capacity for identification of common causes of bacterial meningitis now available within the country, Liberia is in a stronger position to rapidly diagnose and effectively respond to additional meningococcal disease cases or outbreaks.

Nations Millennium Development Goal, adopted in 2000, set a target to reduce child mortality by two thirds by 2015. One indicator of progress toward this target was measles vaccination coverage. \nWhat is added by this report? \nFor the first time, annual estimated measles deaths were fewer than 100,000, in 2016. This achievement follows an increase in the number of countries providing the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) nationally through routine immunization services to 164 (85%) of 194 countries, and the vaccination of approximately 119 million persons against measles during supplementary immunization activities in 2016. During 2000\u20132016, annual reported measles incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million persons, annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84%, from 550,100 to 89,780, and an estimated 20.4 million deaths were prevented. However, the 2015 measles elimination milestones have not yet been met, and only one World Health Organization region has been verified as having eliminated measles. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nTo achieve measles elimination goals, countries and their partners need to act urgently to secure political commitment, raise the visibility of measles elimination, increase vaccination coverage, strengthen surveillance, and mitigate the threat of decreasing resources once polio eradication is achieved. Polio eradication resources have supported routine immunization services and surveillance activities. \nThe fourth United Nations Millennium Development Goal, adopted in 2000, set a target to reduce child mortality by two thirds by 2015. One indicator of progress toward this target was measles vaccination coverage ( 1 ). In 2010, the World Health Assembly (WHA) set three milestones for measles control by 2015: 1) increase routine coverage with the first dose of a measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) among children aged 1 year to \u226590% at the national level and to \u226580% in every district; 2) reduce global annual measles incidence to <5 cases per million population; and 3) reduce global measles mortality by 95% from the 2000 estimate ( 2 ).* In 2012, WHA endorsed the Global Vaccine Action Plan, \u2020 with the objective of eliminating measles in four World Health Organization (WHO) regions by 2015 and in five regions by 2020. Countries in all six WHO regions have adopted goals for measles elimination by or before 2020. Measles elimination is defined as the absence of endemic measles virus transmission in a region or other defined geographic area for \u226512 months, in the presence of a high quality surveillance system that meets targets of key performance indicators. This report updates a previous report ( 3 ) and describes progress toward global measles control milestones and regional measles elimination goals during 2000\u20132016. During this period, annual reported measles incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per million persons, and annual estimated measles deaths decreased 84%, from 550,100 to 89,780; measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths. However, the 2015 milestones have not yet been met; only one WHO region has been verified as having eliminated measles. Improved implementation of elimination strategies by countries and their partners is needed, with focus on increasing vaccination coverage through substantial and sustained additional investments in health systems, strengthening surveillance systems, using surveillance data to drive programmatic actions, securing political commitment, and raising the visibility of measles elimination goals. Top Immunization Activities \nTo estimate coverage with MCV1 and the second dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) through routine immunization services, \u00a7 WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) use data from administrative records (administrative coverage is calculated by dividing the vaccine doses administered by the estimated target population) and immunization coverage surveys reported annually by 194 countries. During 2000\u20132016, estimated MCV1 coverage increased globally from 72% to 85% ( Table 1 ), although coverage has not increased since 2009. Considerable variability in regional coverage exists. Since 2012, MCV1 coverage has remained essentially unchanged in the African Region (AFR) (72%), the Region of the Americas (AMR) (92%), and the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) (77%). In the European Region (EUR), MCV1 coverage has declined from 95% to 93% since 2012, with 51% of EUR member states reporting lower coverage since 2013. In the South-East Asia Region (SEAR), MCV1 coverage increased slightly since 2012, from 84% to 87%. The Western Pacific Region (WPR) is the only region that has achieved and sustained MCV1 coverage >95% (since 2008). Since 2000, the number of countries with MCV1 coverage of \u226590% increased globally from 85 (44%) in 2000 to 119 (61%) in 2015, and to 123 (63%) in 2016. However, among countries with \u226590% MCV1 coverage nationally, the percentage with \u226580% MCV1 coverage in all districts declined from 46% (52 of 112) in 2010 to 45% (49 of 110) in 2015 and 36% (44 of 123) in 2016. Among the estimated 20.8 million infants who did not receive MCV1 through routine immunization services in 2016, approximately 11 million (53%) were in six countries with large birth cohorts and suboptimal coverage: Nigeria (3.3 million), India (2.9 million), Pakistan (2.0 million), Indonesia (1.2 million), Ethiopia (0.9 million), and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (0.7 million). \nDuring 2000\u20132016, the number of countries providing MCV2 nationally through routine services increased from 98 (51%) to 164 (85%), with four countries (Guatemala, Haiti, Papua New Guinea, and Timor-Leste) introducing MCV2 in 2016. Estimated global MCV2 coverage steadily increased from 15% in 2000 to 60% in 2015 and 64% in 2016 (Table 1). During 2016, approximately 119 million persons received supplementary doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) during 33 mass immunization campaigns, known as supplementary immunization activities (SIAs), \u00b6 implemented in 31 countries ( Table 2 ). Based on doses administered, SIA coverage was \u226595% in 20 (61%) SIAs. Among the six countries that conducted post-SIA coverage surveys, estimated coverage was \u226595% in three, 90%\u201394% in two, and 84% in one. Top Disease Incidence \nCountries report the aggregate number of incident measles cases** , \u2020\u2020 to WHO and UNICEF annually through the Joint Reporting Form. In 2016, 189 (97%) countries conducted case-based surveillance in at least part of the country, and 191 (98%) had access to standardized quality-controlled testing through the WHO Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network. Nonetheless, surveillance was weak in many countries; fewer than half of countries (64 of 134; 48%) achieved the sensitivity indicator target of two or more discarded measles and rubella \u00a7\u00a7 cases per 100,000 population in 2016 compared with 2015 (80 of 135; 59%). \nDuring 2000\u20132016, the number of measles cases reported annually worldwide decreased 85%, from 853,479 in 2000 to 214,812 in 2015 and then to 132,137 in 2016; measles incidence decreased 87%, from 145 to 19 cases per 1 million population (Table 1). Compared with 2015, 2016 incidence decreased from 29 to 19 cases per million, although three fewer countries (173 of 194; 89%) reported case data in 2016 than did in 2015 (176 of 194; 92%). \u00b6\u00b6 The percentage of reporting countries with fewer than five measles cases per million population increased from 38% (64/169) in 2000 to 69% (119/173) in 2016. During 2000\u20132016, measles incidence of fewer than five cases per million was sustained in AMR (Table 1). \nDuring 2015\u20132016, the number of reported measles cases declined globally and in all regions (AFR, 31%; AMR, 98%; EMR, 71%; EUR, 84%; SEAR, 44%, and WPR, 11%). In addition to aggregate reporting, countries report measles case-based data to WHO monthly. In some countries large discrepancies exist between the two reporting systems. During 2016, some countries either did not report or reported only a fraction of monthly reported measles cases through the Joint Reporting Form (e.g., India reported 70,798 measles cases through monthly reporting, but only 17,250 through the Joint Reporting Form). \nGenotypes of viruses isolated from measles cases were reported by 60 (55%) of the 110 countries that reported at least one measles case in 2016. Among the 24 recognized measles virus genotypes, 11 were detected during 2005\u20132008, eight during 2009\u20132014, six in 2015, and five in 2016, excluding those from vaccine reactions and cases of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a fatal progressive neurologic disorder caused by persistent measles infection ( 4 ).*** In 2016, among 4,796 reported measles virus sequences, \u2020\u2020\u2020 666 were genotype B3 (36 countries); 44 were D4 (four); 1,407 were D8 (43); 87 were D9 (four); and 2,592 were H1 (13). Top Disease and Mortality Estimates \nA previously described model for estimating measles disease and mortality was updated with new measles vaccination coverage data, case data, and United Nations population estimates for all countries during 2000\u20132016, enabling derivation of a new series of disease and mortality estimates ( 5 ). Based on the updated data, the estimated number of measles cases declined from 29,068,400 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 20,606,800\u201355,859,000) in 2000 to 6,976,800 (95% CI = 4,190,500\u201328,657,300) in 2016. During this period, the number of estimated measles deaths declined 84%, from 550,100 (95% CI = 374,000\u2013896,500) in 2000 to 89,780 (95% CI = 45,700\u2013269,600) in 2016 (Table 1). Compared with no measles vaccination, measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths during 2000\u20132016 ( Figure ). Top Regional Verification of Measles Elimination \nIn 2016, four WHO regions had functioning regional verification commissions. In September 2016, the AMR regional verification commission declared the region free of endemic measles ( 6 ). In 2016, the EUR commission verified measles elimination in 24 countries ( 7 ). Two SEAR countries (Bhutan and Maldives) were verified as having eliminated measles in 2017 ( 8 ). The WPR commission reclassified Mongolia as having reestablished endemic measles virus transmission because of an outbreak that lasted >12 months; thus, five WPR countries (Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, Japan, and South Korea) and two areas (Macao Special Autonomous Region [SAR] [China] and Hong Kong SAR [China]) had verified measles elimination status in 2016 ( 9 ). Top Discussion \nDuring 2000\u20132016, increased coverage with MCV administered through routine immunization programs worldwide, combined with SIAs, contributed to an 87% decrease in reported measles incidence and an 84% reduction in estimated measles mortality. Measles vaccination prevented an estimated 20.4 million deaths during this period, and during 2016, for the first time ever, estimated measles deaths declined to fewer than 100,000. Furthermore, the number of countries with measles incidence of fewer than five per million population has increased, although considerable underreporting occurred, and AMR has maintained an incidence of fewer than five cases per million population during 2000\u20132016. The decreasing number of circulating measles virus genotypes suggests interruption of some chains of transmission. However, the 2015 global control milestones were not met, global MCV1 coverage has stagnated, global MCV2 coverage has reached only 64%, and SIA quality was inadequate to achieve \u226595% coverage in several countries. With suboptimal MCV coverage, outbreaks continued to occur among unvaccinated persons, including school-aged children and young adults. \nThe 2016 Mid-term Review of the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan 2012\u20132020 concluded that measles elimination strategies were sound, and the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization endorsed its findings. The review noted, however, that implementation of the strategies needs improvement. Measures should focus on strengthening immunization and surveillance systems. The Measles and Rubella Initiative should increase its emphasis on using surveillance data to drive programmatic actions. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, SIA coverage data might be biased by inaccurate reports of the number of doses delivered, doses administered to children outside the target age group, and inaccurate estimates of the target population size. Second, large differences between the estimated and reported incidence indicate variable surveillance sensitivity, making comparisons between countries and regions difficult to interpret. Finally, the accuracy of the results from the measles mortality model is affected by biases in all model inputs, including country-specific measles vaccination coverage and measles case-based surveillance data. \nThe decrease in measles mortality to fewer than 100,000 deaths in 2016 is one of five main contributors (along with decreases in mortality from diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia, and neonatal intrapartum deaths) to the decline in overall child mortality worldwide and progress toward the fourth United Nations Millennium Development Goal, but continued work is needed to help achieve measles elimination goals ( 10 ). Of concern is the possibility that the gains made and future progress in measles elimination could be reversed when polio-funded resources supporting routine immunization services, measles SIAs, and measles surveillance diminish and disappear after polio eradication. Countries with the highest measles mortality rely most heavily on polio-funded resources and are at highest risk for reversal of progress after polio eradication is achieved. Improved implementation of elimination strategies by countries and their partners is needed, with focus on increasing vaccination coverage with substantial and sustained additional investments in health systems, strengthening surveillance systems, using surveillance data to drive programmatic actions, securing political commitment, and raising the visibility of measles elimination goals.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "mcv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who strategic advisory group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations children\u2019s fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who global measles and rubella laboratory network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint reporting form", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "unicef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "who", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "papua new guinea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhutan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cambodia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south-east asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macao special autonomous region", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brunei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maldives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mongolia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong sar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic republic of the congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethiopia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T02:40:31.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf64b268f29ae4a92c9e6aa7db185cbf39b86c1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvYnU_XQofUsg4pacX_TnxNM-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/rss/mmwr.xml", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", "title": "Notes from the Field: Postexposure Prophylaxis for Rabies After Consumption of a Prepackaged Salad Containing a Bat Carcass \u2014 Florida, 2017", "title_full": "Notes from the Field: Postexposure Prophylaxis for Rabies After Consumption of a Prepackaged Salad Containing a Bat Carcass \u2014 Florida, 2017", "published": "2017-10-26T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/mm6642a7_Postexposure_Prophylaxis_Rabies_After_Consumption_Bat.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 23}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf64b268f29ae4a92c9e6aa7db185cbf39b86c1b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvYnU_XQofUsg4pacX_TnxNM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-26T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Notes from the Field: Postexposure Prophylaxis for Rabies After Consumption of a Prepackaged Salad Containing a Bat Carcass \u2014 Florida, 2017", "text": "Metric Details \nVikram Krishnasamy, MD 1 ,2 ; Matthew R.

Bats are known reservoirs for rabies virus, which causes rabies disease in both animals and humans ( 1 ). The persons who ate the salad contacted the Florida Department of Health (FLDOH), which notified CDC\u2019s Poxvirus and Rabies Branch. CDC and FLDOH determined that the immediate concern was for potential rabies virus exposure, because approximately 6% of bats submitted to U.S. public health departments annually test positive for rabies virus ( 2 , 3 ). \nAlthough percutaneous exposures are more likely to result in successful transmission of rabies virus to humans ( 1 ), transmission can occur when infectious material, such as saliva or nervous tissue from an infected animal, comes into direct contact with human mucosa ( 2 ). Infection with rabies virus causes an acute, progressive encephalitis that is nearly always fatal once clinical signs have begun. The disease is preventable if exposed persons receive timely postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), which includes human rabies immunoglobulin and 4 doses of inactivated rabies vaccine administered over 14 days ( 4 ). \nFLDOH submitted the bat carcass to CDC for rabies virus testing on April 4. Polymerase chain reaction and direct fluorescent antibody tests were inconclusive because of the deteriorated condition of the carcass. However, because the cranium of the bat was intact, exposure to brain material by the persons who consumed the salad was unlikely, although exposure to the bat\u2019s organs or peripheral nervous tissue was possible. PEP was recommended because laboratory test results were inconclusive and exposure to nervous tissue could not be ruled out. \nThe salad was purchased from a company A store location. After being notified of the investigation, company A removed the lot of prepackaged salad from all store locations on April 5. Company B (the prepackaged salad supplier) recalled the affected lot of salads on April 8. CDC advised consumers to contact their local health department for PEP evaluation only if the consumer had eaten a recalled prepackaged salad and had found animal material in the salad. CDC was not notified of any other reports of dead bats in prepackaged salads. \nTo identify where the bat might have been introduced into the prepackaged salad, CDC performed genetic analyses on the bat to determine its subspecies. Based on morphology and phylogenetic analyses (Bayesian inference and haplotype network analyses) of mitochondrial DNA sequence data (Cytb and D-loop), the bat was identified as a Mexican free-tailed bat ( Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana ), which is found throughout the southwestern United States. It is genetically distinct from T. brasiliensis cynocephala , which occurs in the southeastern United States ( Figure ) ( 5 ). \nThe investigation determined that cutting and harvesting of greens for the recalled salad occurred in fields in the west and southwest United States before they were transported to a processing plant in Georgia. At the processing plant, the greens were washed with chlorinated water and packaged. Given the physical condition of the bat (e.g., decomposed, bisected) and the geographic location of the fields and the processing plant, along with the genetic identification of the bat, investigators concluded the bat most likely came into contact with the salad material in the field during harvesting and cutting and was then transported to the processing facility. \nSeveral factors likely reduced the risk for rabies virus transmission to the two Florida consumers. No rabies virus was detected in the specimen, the bat\u2019s cranium was intact, and the salad was rinsed before packaging, thereby diluting any potential virus. In addition, mucosal membrane exposures have rarely been proven to result in rabies disease, and rabies virus does not survive more than a few days outside a host ( 2 ). Although this exposure was likely of low risk, this investigation was an example of effective industry and government collaboration to remove a product of concern from the marketplace rapidly to protect consumers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vikram krishnasamy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matthew e. wise", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matthew r. mauldin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rene e. condori", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emily pieracci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher wynens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin basler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura whitlock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pamela yager", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yoshinori nakazawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dana grissom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sherry worley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clint morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yu li", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william carson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james ellison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yan wallace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danielle stanek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie dement", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allison wellman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabies branch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida department of health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T02:40:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac74b0e14c84be5b510f1e67f35e65eed2b33d4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvZDTZt_ZZHwgNSToSkVDc6w-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/rss/mmwr.xml", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report", "title": "Notes from the Field: High Volume of Lyme Disease Laboratory Reporting in a Low-Incidence State \u2014 Arkansas, 2015\u20132016", "title_full": "Notes from the Field: High Volume of Lyme Disease Laboratory Reporting in a Low-Incidence State \u2014 Arkansas, 2015\u20132016", "published": "2017-10-26T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/mm6642a8_High_Volume_Lyme_Disease_Laboratory_Reporting.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac74b0e14c84be5b510f1e67f35e65eed2b33d4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvZDTZt_ZZHwgNSToSkVDc6w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-26T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Notes from the Field: High Volume of Lyme Disease Laboratory Reporting in a Low-Incidence State \u2014 Arkansas, 2015\u20132016", "text": "View suggested citation \nAlthough Arkansas lies within the geographic range of the principal Lyme disease tick vector, Ixodes scapularis , because of ecologic and entomologic factors, the risk for human infection is low, and no confirmed Lyme disease cases were reported in Arkansas during 2008\u20132014 ( 1 ). However, during 2015\u20132016, the Arkansas Department of Health (ADH) received several hundred potentially positive serologic laboratory reports for Lyme disease. Recommended serologic testing for Lyme disease is a two-tiered process; only if the first-tier enzyme immunoassay is positive or equivocal should the second-tier western blot be performed. A positive overall result can only be concluded when results of both individual tests are documented ( 2 ). Laboratory reports submitted to ADH during 2015\u20132016 did not always include complete or overall positive two-tiered serology results or associated clinical information needed to make a case determination. To facilitate Lyme disease surveillance in the setting of a high volume of reports and to ascertain whether local transmission of Lyme disease has occurred, ADH and CDC reviewed laboratory reports and clinical data, classified cases according to the surveillance definition, and investigated cases with potential for confirmation of Lyme disease. \nPaper laboratory reports of Lyme disease testing sent to ADH were matched by patient name and birth date with electronic laboratory surveillance data to consolidate reports. Reports were then sorted and prioritized for follow-up based on recommended laboratory criteria for diagnosis and available information. Among the 911 Lyme disease laboratory reports submitted to ADH during 2015\u20132016, a total of 582 combined reports for unique patients were identified. Among 295 reports with sufficient information to make a determination, 282 (95.6%) did not meet the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists surveillance criteria for Lyme disease.* Eleven (3.7%) met the probable (three reports) or suspected (eight) Lyme disease surveillance case definition, and two reports (0.7%) met the confirmed case definition. Further investigation of the two confirmed cases revealed that both patients were likely infected in high-incidence states. One patient had signs of arthritis soon after moving to Arkansas from the northeastern United States, but did not receive a diagnosis of and treatment for Lyme disease until nearly 1 year later, underscoring the fact that even where Lyme disease is rare, providers need to obtain a travel history and consider the diagnosis in patients with compatible symptoms who have lived in or visited states where Lyme disease is common. \nLyme disease is the most common vectorborne disease in the United States, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and the recently discovered Borrelia mayonii ( 3 ), but risk for infection is not uniform. In 2015, 95% of cases in the United States were reported from 14 states concentrated in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and upper Midwest regions ( 1 ). In Arkansas, host-seeking I. scapularis ticks are much less abundant, less prone to biting humans, rarely infected with B. burgdorferi , and prefer feeding on nonreservoir hosts ( 4 ). However, the occurrence of travel-related infections and the need to monitor for emergence of locally acquired infection underscore the importance of Lyme disease surveillance in Arkansas and other low-risk states. \nOf the hundreds of Lyme disease reports submitted to ADH during 2015\u20132016, many had incomplete information or negative laboratory results; however, the ADH Lyme disease surveillance system did identify two confirmed, travel-associated infections. The absence of similarly confirmed, locally acquired cases supports the view that autochthonous transmission of Lyme disease is either exceedingly rare or has not occurred in Arkansas. The risk for other tickborne diseases in Arkansas results in frequent requests for Lyme disease testing as part of a general tickborne disease serologic panel, even when Lyme disease is not suspected by the clinician. Strong clinical evidence supported by positive two-tiered serologic testing is essential to securing a diagnosis of Lyme disease in low-incidence states ( 2 , 5 ). \nFor reporting Lyme disease to public health authorities, health care providers should follow infectious disease testing recommendations and reporting guidelines set forth by state health departments and only submit reports for cases that have complete and positive test results and associated clinical information. Given that multiple laboratory tests, potentially performed and reported by different laboratories, might be necessary to determine Lyme disease case status, health departments need an efficient process to manage and interpret incoming laboratory reports.

Approximately 1 month after the flood, the Louisiana Office of Public Health received notification through electronic laboratory reporting of two patients with serologic evidence of leptospirosis (immunoglobulin M antibodies to Leptospira species). Both patients were hospitalized with severe illness at the time of laboratory testing and recovered after appropriate treatment. Hospital record review revealed that both patients were exposed to floodwater before illness onset. Because these two (sentinel) patients with leptospirosis represented a marked increase over the three cases reported in their respective parishes of residence during the previous 28 years ( 1 ), an investigation was undertaken to identify other cases of leptospirosis related to the 2016 flood. \nLeptospirosis is a bacterial disease caused by infection with pathogenic Leptospira species ( 2 ) . Humans can be infected through direct contact with urine from an infected animal or by contact with urine-contaminated soil or water, often during flooding ( 3 ). Approximately 90% of patients with leptospirosis experience a nonspecific, self-limited illness with symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, or headache ( 2 ). Pain in the calf and low back muscles and conjunctival suffusion without purulent discharge are distinctive features ( 2 ). Approximately 10% of patients develop severe illness, which is characterized by any combination of jaundice, renal failure, aseptic meningitis, cardiac arrhythmia, gastrointestinal symptoms, pulmonary hemorrhage, or circulatory collapse and is associated with a 5%\u201315% case fatality rate ( 2 ). \nSuspected leptospirosis cases were defined as the occurrence of fever with at least two nonspecific symptoms (myalgia, headache, jaundice, conjunctival suffusion, or maculopapular or petechial rash), or at least one diagnosis indicating severe illness (aseptic meningitis, renal insufficiency, pulmonary complications, electrocardiogram abnormalities, gastrointestinal symptoms, hemorrhage, or jaundice with acute renal failure) during August 13\u2013September 21, 2016 in a patient exposed to floodwater ( 4 ). The Louisiana Early Events Detection System (LEEDS), a statewide electronic syndromic surveillance system, was queried to identify patients treated in hospitals serving the flood region during August 13\u2013September 21 who had signs, symptoms, or diagnoses compatible with leptospirosis. The dates were selected to include the flooding period (August 11\u2013August 20) and a leptospirosis incubation period beginning 2 days after flooding started and continuing through 30 days after water recession ( 2 ). Hospital records of patients meeting the symptoms or diagnosis components of the case definition were reviewed; patients without fever or with laboratory evidence supporting an alternative diagnosis were eliminated. The remaining patients were interviewed to ascertain floodwater exposure; those with floodwater exposure provided whole blood and urine specimens for leptospirosis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and a serum specimen for microscopic agglutination test (MAT) testing. MAT was also performed on serum from both sentinel patients. An acute urine specimen from one sentinel patient was tested by PCR. All laboratory testing was performed by CDC. \nLEEDS queries yielded 69 patients warranting medical record review. After eliminating patients who did not meet the case definition based on medical record review, 13 of 18 patients who met the case definition were contacted for interview; among these, four reported floodwater exposure and submitted blood and urine specimens. MAT and PCR were negative for Leptospira spp. infection among all LEEDS-identified patients. Leptospirosis was confirmed by MAT in both sentinel patients; urine PCR identified Leptospira kirschneri DNA in one sentinel patient. \nLeptospira species are prevalent among Louisiana wildlife. According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), anti- Leptospira spp. seroprevalence in the Louisiana feral swine population was 71% in 2015 (Rusty Berry, DVM, LDWF, personal communication, November 9, 2016), which is markedly higher than the 26% estimated by the United States Department of Agriculture in 2012 ( 5 ). LDWF surveillance also identified a substantial increase in leptospirosis in the deer population, from an average seroprevalence of 7% during 2007\u20132012 to 42% during the 2015\u20132016 hunting season. (Rusty Berry, DVM, LDWF, personal communication, November 9, 2016 and July 6, 2017). \nNo additional confirmed cases of postflooding leptospirosis were identified. Nonetheless, cases might have been missed because of flood-related access to care difficulties and patients not seeking medical care for less than severe illness. However, given the endemicity of Leptospira spp. among Louisiana wildlife, including documented L. kirschneri in feral swine isolates ( 6 ), and the two recent flood-related cases of leptospirosis, a high index of suspicion for leptospirosis among patients with compatible symptoms and exposure to untreated water is warranted, especially during flooding. Educating the public about leptospirosis prevention and clinicians about its clinical presentation might decrease the prevalence of severe disease by enabling early identification and treatment.

The 2014 publication Providing Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (QFP) establishes standards for providing a core set of preventive services to promote these goals. These services include contraceptive care for persons seeking to prevent or delay pregnancy, pregnancy testing and counseling, basic infertility services for those seeking to achieve pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease (STD) services, and other preconception care and related preventive health services. QFP describes how to provide these services and recommends using family planning and other primary care visits to screen for and offer the full range of these services. This report presents baseline estimates of the use of these preventive services before the publication of QFP that can be used to monitor progress toward improving the quality of preventive care received by women and men of reproductive age. \nPeriod Covered: 2011\u20132013. \nDescription of the System: Three surveillance systems were used to document receipt of preventive health services among women and men of reproductive age as recommended in QFP. The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) collects data on factors that influence reproductive health in the United States since 1973, with a focus on fertility, sexual activity, contraceptive use, reproductive health care, family formation, child care, and related topics. NSFG uses a stratified, multistage probability sample to produce nationally representative estimates for the U.S. household population of women and men aged 15\u201344 years. This report uses data from the 2011\u20132013 NSFG. \nThe Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and shortly after pregnancy among women who deliver live-born infants in the United States. Annual PRAMS data sets are created and used to produce statewide estimates of preconception and perinatal health behaviors and experiences. This report uses PRAMS data for 2011\u20132012 from 11 states (Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia). \nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a nationally representative survey of noninstitutionalized civilians in the United States. NHIS collects data on a broad range of health topics, including the prevalence, distribution, and effects of illness and disability and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. Households are identified through a multistage probability household sampling design, and estimates are produced using weights that account for the sampling design, nonresponse, and poststratification adjustments. This report uses data from the 2013 NHIS for women aged 18\u201344 years. \nResults: Many preventive health services recommended in QFP were not received by all women and men of reproductive age. For contraceptive services, including contraceptive counseling and advice, 46.5% of women aged 15\u201344 years at risk for unintended pregnancy received services in the past year, and 4.5% of men who had vaginal intercourse in the past year received services in that year. For sexually transmitted disease (STD) services, among all women aged 15\u201324 years who had oral, anal, or vaginal sex with an opposite sex partner in the past year, 37.5% were tested for chlamydia in that year. Among persons aged 15\u201344 years who were at risk because they were not in a mutually monogamous relationship during the past year, 45.3% of women were tested for chlamydia and 32.5% of men were tested for any STD in that year. For preconception care and related preventive health services, data from selected states indicated that 33.2% of women with a recent live birth (i.e., 2\u20139 months postpartum) talked with a health care professional about improving their health before their most recent pregnancy; of selected preconception counseling topics, the most frequently discussed was taking vitamins with folic acid before pregnancy (81.2%), followed by achieving a healthy weight before pregnancy (62.9%) and how drinking alcohol (60.3%) or smoking (58.2%) during pregnancy can affect a baby. Nationally, among women aged 18\u201344 years irrespective of pregnancy status, 80.9% had their blood pressure checked by a health care professional and 31.7% received an influenza vaccine in the past year; 54.5% of those with high blood pressure were tested for diabetes, 44.9% of those with obesity had a health care professional talk with them about their diet, and 55.2% of those who were current smokers had a health professional talk with them about their smoking in the past year. Among all women aged 21\u201344 years, 81.6% received a Papanicolaou (Pap) test in the past 3 years. \nReceipt of certain preventive services varied by age and race/ethnicity. Among women with a recent live birth, the percentage of those who talked with a health care professional about improving their health before their most recent pregnancy increased with age (range: 25.9% and 25.2% for women aged \u226419 and 20\u201324 years, respectively, to 35.9% and 37.8% for women aged 25\u201334 and \u226535 years, respectively). Among women with a recent live birth, the percentage of those who talked with a health care professional about improving their health before their most recent pregnancy was higher for non-Hispanic white (white) (35.2%) compared with non-Hispanic black (black) (30.0%) and Hispanic (26.0%) women. Conversely, across most STD screening services evaluated, testing was highest among black women and men and lowest among their white counterparts. \nReceipt of many preventive services recommended in QFP increased consistently across categories of family income and continuity of health insurance coverage. Prevalence of service receipt was highest among women in the highest family income category (>400% of federal poverty level [FPL]) and among women with insurance coverage for each of the following: contraceptive services among women at risk for unintended pregnancy; medical services beyond advice to help achieve pregnancy; vaccinations (hepatitis B and human papillomavirus [HPV], ever; tetanus, past 10 years; influenza, past year); discussions with a health care professional about improving health before pregnancy and taking vitamins with folic acid; blood pressure and diabetes screening; discussions with a health care professional in the past year about diet, among those with obesity; discussions with a health care professional in the past year about smoking, among current smokers; Pap tests within the past 3 years; and mammograms within the past 2 years. \nInterpretation: Before 2014, many women and men of reproductive age were not receiving several of the preventive services recommended for them in QFP. Although differences existed by age and race/ethnicity, across the range of recommended services, receipt was consistently lower among women and men with lower family income and greater instability in health insurance coverage. \nPublic Health Action: Information in this report on baseline receipt during 2011\u20132013 of preventive services for women and men of reproductive age can be used to target improvements in the use of recommended services through the development of research priorities, information for decision makers, and public health practice. Health care administrators and practitioners can use the information to identify subpopulations with the greatest need for preventive services and make informed decisions on resource allocation. Public health researchers can use the information to guide research on the determinants of service use and factors that might increase use of preventive services. Policymakers can use this information to evaluate the impact of policy changes and assess resource needs for effective programs, research, and surveillance on the use of preventive health services for women and men of reproductive age. Top Introduction \nIn 2014, CDC published Providing Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and the U.S. Office of Population Affairs (QFP) ( 1 , 2 ). QFP recommends a core set of preventive health services for women and men of reproductive age (i.e., 15\u201344 years) that can help them achieve their desired number and spacing of healthy children and improve their overall health. Recommended services include contraceptive care for persons seeking to prevent or delay pregnancy, pregnancy testing and counseling, basic infertility services for those seeking to achieve pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease (STD) services, and other preconception care and related preventive health services (e.g., screening for smoking, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and breast and cervical cancer). QFP encourages use of the family planning visit to assess the need for each of these services and offer them as recommended. QFP also encourages screening all women and men of reproductive age about their need for family planning services, even when their initial reason for seeking services is not related to preventing or achieving pregnancy. For each of these preventive services, QFP describes the subpopulations recommended to receive them and how often they should be provided (Appendix A). \nThese family planning services are recommended because of evidence of their protective effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes and other conditions that affect the overall health of women and men of reproductive age ( 1 \u2013 5 ). Illustrating the need for these services, the most recent estimates for the United States indicate that each year 2.8 million (45%) of all pregnancies are unintended ( 6 ), approximately 30% of births occur within an interpregnancy interval <18 months since the last live birth ( 7 ), and approximately 9.6% of infants are born preterm ( 8 ). In addition, many women of reproductive age have health conditions (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and STDs) that can adversely affect their health and the health of their future pregnancies ( 9 \u2013 11 ) (Appendix B), and 6.7% of married women of reproductive age are infertile ( 12 ). The hypothesized pathway between delivery of recommended preventive services and improved health outcomes illustrates that recommendations and implementation support lead to receipt of preventive services (short-term outcomes), which contributes to improvements in health-related behaviors and other intermediate outcomes that result in improvements in targeted health conditions (long-term health outcomes) ( Figure ). \nProvision of the preventive services recommended in QFP is also cost-effective and can result in substantial cost savings. For example, a recent analysis of 28 clinical preventive services, including many recommended in QFP (e.g., screening for tobacco and alcohol use, cervical cancer, hypertension, obesity, and human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and STDs such as chlamydia and gonorrhea), illustrates the cost-effectiveness of these services ( 13 ). Further, in 2010, the $2.2 billion investment in public funding for family planning programs and providers saved $15.8 billion, or approximately $7 for every $1 spent, by averting the need for public expenditures related to cervical cancer, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, infertility, unintended pregnancy, and low birth weight and preterm births ( 14 ). \nThe services recommended in QFP were developed on the basis of a rigorous review process ( 1 , 2 ). Whenever possible, QFP followed existing clinical recommendations from CDC, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and professional medical organizations such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics ( 15 \u2013 28 ); yet QFP also fills gaps in existing clinical recommendations, particularly with regard to provision of contraceptive counseling. \nThis report presents estimates of the use of recommended preventive health services among women and men aged 15\u201344 years during 2011\u20132013, the period shortly before QFP was published. By aligning the subpopulation included in each estimate with the population recommended for receipt of each service and matching the timeframe with the recommended interval for each service, this report documents the baseline receipt of preventive health services among persons in need of them, before the publication of QFP. The findings can be used to identify populations that were not receiving recommended preventive health services and opportunities for improving access, particularly where notable gaps exist. Methods Description of the Surveillance Systems \nThe National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) is conducted by CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics in collaboration with other agencies of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. NSFG focuses on fertility, sexual activity, contraceptive use, reproductive health care, family formation, child care, and other topics among the U.S. household population of women and men of reproductive age. After six periodic cycles from 1973 to 2002, NSFG has employed a continuous fieldwork design since 2006, with interviews conducted over 48 weeks every year. NSFG uses a stratified, multistage probability sample to create nationally representative estimates of sexual behavior, contraceptive use, and sexual and reproductive health care service usage. Details of NSFG have been described elsewhere ( 29 ) and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/index.htm . This report uses data from the 2011\u20132013 NSFG, which had response rates of 73.4% and 72.1% for a final sample size of 5,601 women and 4,815 men, respectively. \nThe Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver a live-born infant in participating U.S. states and New York City. All PRAMS reporting areas use a standardized data collection method developed by CDC. This standard method uses a mixed mode delivery, including mailed questionnaires beginning 2\u20133 months after the delivery of a live-born infant to allow for collection of information related to postpartum maternal and infant experiences and up to 15 follow-up telephone calls with nonresponders during the first 9 months of the postpartum period. The questionnaire consists of a core set of questions included for all reporting areas and standard questions chosen by each reporting area from a pretested list. Survey data are linked to selected birth certificate data and weighted to account for complex sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage. Details of PRAMS methodology have been described previously ( 30 ) and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/PRAMS/ . This report uses 2011\u20132012 PRAMS data from 11 states (Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, and West Virginia) that achieved an overall weighted response rate of 65%. The data included in this report are from responses to standard questions adopted selectively by individual states, and thus the number of states and women included in each estimate varies by question. \nThe National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, is an annual, nationally representative, in-person survey and is one of the nation\u2019s primary sources of general health information. Data from NHIS provide annual estimates of health care access and use, health conditions, health behaviors, and other health-related information for the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Interviews are conducted in respondents\u2019 homes. In some instances, follow-up telephone calls are conducted to complete the interviews. Selected health and demographic information is collected for all household members; one sample child (if any children aged \u226417 years are present) and one sample adult are randomly selected from each family in NHIS to answer more detailed health-related questions. Although some overlap in content exists, the sample child and sample adult respondents answer different questions; therefore, only estimates for sample adult women aged 18\u201344 years are within the scope of this report. Details of NHIS have been described elsewhere ( 31 ) and are available at https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm . This report uses data from the 2013 NHIS, which had a response rate of 61.2% for the sample adult component for a final sample size of 8,244 women aged 18\u201344 years. Selection of Indicators \nIndicators were selected for each of the service areas recommended in QFP for women of reproductive age and select services recommended for men of reproductive age. Estimates for use of services related to preventing, delaying, or achieving pregnancy (contraception and medical services for achieving pregnancy) were obtained from NSFG. Estimates for STD prevention services (STD testing and vaccines) were obtained from NSFG and NHIS. Estimates for use of preconception care services among women with a recent live birth were obtained from PRAMS. Estimates of preconception care and related preventive health services among women, irrespective of pregnancy status, were obtained from NHIS. \nIn defining each service variable, the timeframe was matched to the interval recommended in QFP for receipt of that service, and the subpopulation in need of each service was aligned as closely as possible to the subpopulation recommended in QFP to receive that service. Because of this alignment, for the majority of the services in this report, receipt among the full included population should be considered the standard against which estimates can be compared. However, for some clinical recommendations, the frequency of screening is not specified (e.g., some USPSTF recommendations encourage periodic screening without definition of the term), which should be considered when interpreting these findings. For other services, estimates were generated across strata to separate out populations where less complete usage might be expected. For example, QFP recommends that contraceptive services, including contraceptive counseling,* be offered to women who are at risk for unintended pregnancy. \u2020 Accordingly, only women who were at risk for unintended pregnancy were included in estimates for contraceptive services. Receipt was measured for the past year because women using moderately effective methods \u00a7 need to obtain a prescription from a health care professional each year and women using less effective methods, \u00b6 or no method, might benefit from annual counseling to help them assess the suitability of a more effective method and then potentially obtain that method or a prescription. Because women using permanent and long-acting reversible methods** do not necessarily need contraceptive services every year but might benefit from contraceptive counseling, separate estimates were generated for women who were using these methods. \nWith respect to services for achieving pregnancy, estimates were limited to women with infertility. \u2020\u2020 Estimates were used to characterize whether these women had ever received advice and whether they had ever received any additional services (infertility testing, ovulation stimulation, surgery to correct blocked tubes, artificial insemination, and other types of medical help). \nWith respect to STD screening, CDC recommends annual chlamydia testing for all sexually active women aged <25 years, whereas STD testing among men and older women, as well as testing for other STDs, is recommended on the basis of additional risk factors ( 1 , 2 , 15 ). Accordingly, the prevalence of chlamydia testing was estimated for all women aged <25 years who had oral, anal, or vaginal sex with at least one opposite sex partner in the past year. In contrast, estimates for older women (aged 25\u201344 years) and all men, as well as estimates for other STDs, were limited to those who were not in a mutually monogamous relationship, \u00a7\u00a7 which was used as a proxy for some of the additional risk factors included in STD testing recommendations ( 15 ). For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), because testing is recommended through routine clinical care for all persons aged 13\u201365 years, unless from a patient population with documented low prevalence of undiagnosed HIV infection ( 16 ), all adults aged 15\u201344 years were included in estimates of ever having been tested for HIV outside of blood donation. \nFor human papillomavirus (HPV), the vaccine was first available in 2006 and recommendations for women include vaccination at age 11\u201312 years, or at age 13\u201326 years if not previously vaccinated ( 17 , 18 ). Accordingly, as in other recent surveillance reports ( 32 ), overall estimates of having ever received the HPV vaccine were limited to women aged 18\u201326 years. For cervical cytology, Papanicolaou (Pap) tests are recommended once every 3 years for women aged 21\u201365 years or, for women aged 30\u201365 years, once every 5 years if done in combination with HPV testing ( 1 , 2 , 19 ). Because the HPV questions were not included on the 2013 NHIS questionnaire, estimates were only generated for receipt of a Pap test within the past 3 years. Women aged <21 years were excluded from overall estimates because they fell outside of age-based recommendations, and women aged >44 years were excluded because of the focus of this report on women of reproductive age. Estimates for women aged 18\u201320 years are provided as a measure of potential overscreening among younger women. \nFor some preconception care services (counseling before the most recent pregnancy on how to achieve a healthy pregnancy and selected preconception care topics), PRAMS data were used to limit estimates to women with a recent live birth. \u00b6\u00b6 For other preconception care services, all women of reproductive age were included in estimates, given the benefit of these services for improving their overall health as well as their pregnancy health. For blood pressure, QFP originally recommended routine screening among persons without recognized hypertension or other risk factors and annual screening for adolescents and prehypertensive adults (i.e., adults with blood pressure 120\u2013139 mm Hg/80\u201389 mm Hg); for diabetes, QFP originally recommended testing for asymptomatic adults with sustained high blood pressure (either treated or untreated) >135/80 mm Hg ( 1 , 20 \u2013 22 ). These recommendations have been updated to reduce the frequency of blood pressure screening among persons without risk factors to once every 3\u20135 years, and to limit diabetes screening to persons aged 40\u201370 years ( 2 , 23 , 24 ). Nonetheless, to assess screening according to the recommendations in place at the time, estimates of annual screening were generated; for blood pressure these estimates were among all women aged 18\u201344 years without a history of hypertension, and for diabetes these estimates were among all women aged 18\u201344 years with no previous diagnosis and a history of hypertension. \nAlthough QFP follows the USPSTF recommendation to measure weight and height and refer women and men with obesity for intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote sustained weight loss ( 25 ), estimates were made of the proportion of women with obesity who talked with a health care professional about diet as the closest proxy indicator available from the national surveillance data. Similarly, QFP follows the USPSTF recommendation that clinicians ask all adults about their tobacco use, advise them to stop using tobacco, and provide behavioral interventions, along with U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved pharmacotherapy for cessation if not pregnant ( 26 ). However, because of availability of national surveillance data, estimates were generated among current smokers for having spoken with a health care professional about their smoking. Because of the lack of a recommended timeframe for obesity and smoking screening and counseling, estimates were generated for receipt in the past year for both of these services. \nFor influenza and tetanus vaccines, receipt was estimated within the past year and past 10 years, respectively, to match the recommended interval for receipt of these vaccines. All women aged 18\u201344 years were included in estimates because of the inclusion of all adults in these recommendations ( 27 ). \nFinally, QFP follows the USPSTF recommendation to conduct mammography biennially for women aged 50\u201374 years and to screen women aged <50 years if other conditions support providing this service for an individual patient ( 1 , 2 , 28 ). Accordingly, biennial screening estimates were generated for women aged 30\u201344 years to assess prevalence of screening outside of age-based recommendations. Because receipt of mammography screening is asked only among women aged \u226530 years on the NHIS, women aged 18\u201329 years are not included in these estimates. Data Analysis \nAll estimates include the weighted prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each indicator, overall and stratified by age, race/ethnicity, family income as a percentage of federal poverty level (FPL), and continuity of insurance coverage. Age categories were specific to each data source (15\u201319, 20\u201324, 25\u201334, and 35\u201344 years [NSFG]; \u226419, 20\u201324, 25\u201334, and \u226535 years [PRAMS]; and 18\u201319, 20\u201324, 25\u201334, and 35\u201344 years [NHIS]). All three surveys used the same stratifications for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white [white], non-Hispanic black [black], Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other or multiple races) and income (\u2264138% FPL, 139%\u2013250% FPL, 251%\u2013400% FPL, and >400% FPL). Income categories were defined to correspond with the income eligibility maximum for Medicaid insurance coverage in states that expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act (\u2264138% FPL) and subsidized care provided through clinics receiving grant support through the Title X federal family planning program (\u2264250% FPL). In assigning respondents to income categories, income for each person was first assigned to the closest whole integer relative to FPL and then placed in the appropriate category. Stratifications for insurance coverage from NSFG and NHIS (continuous insurance coverage in the past year, insurance coverage with gaps in the past year, or no insurance coverage in the past year) differ from the stratifications for insurance coverage from PRAMS (had insurance coverage during the month before conception or did not have insurance coverage during the month before conception). \nTo provide general guidance on the statistical significance of differences, 95% CIs were compared across strata, with an emphasis on identifying differences between the highest and lowest categories for ordinal variables (i.e., age, income, and insurance coverage). In a report that contains multiple post-hoc comparisons, some statistical differences will occur because of chance. As a result, comparing CIs provides a general idea of the size of the differences versus the standard errors of each estimate and an indication of which differences might be significant. This is typically a conservative approach that might fail to note differences between estimates more often than formal statistical testing ( 33 ) and was selected to account for precision of estimates while also highlighting large differences ( 34 ). Lack of comment regarding the difference between any two estimates does not infer no difference exists. \nIn accordance with the reporting policies of specific surveillance systems, estimates are not reported when outcome data are considered insufficient to produce reliable estimates. For NSFG, estimates are not provided for outcomes with a numerator <5 or a denominator <100. For PRAMS, estimates are not reported for outcomes with a denominator <30; estimates that were based on 30\u201359 respondents are reported with a footnote stating they might not be reliable and should be used with caution. For NHIS, estimates are not provided for outcomes with a denominator <30 or a relative standard error (RSE)*** \u226550%; estimates with an RSE 30%\u201349% are reported with a footnote stating they might not be reliable and should be used with caution. All analyses were conducted using population weighted data and statistical software to account for the complex sample design of each survey. Presentation of Findings \nResults are presented in a manner consistent with the categories of services defined in QFP. For each category of services, selected findings are highlighted in the text and estimates are presented in tables that address the following groups: receipt of contraceptive services, medical services for achieving pregnancy, and STD testing and prevention services; receipt of preconception counseling services; and receipt of preconception care and related preventive health services. For each group of services, estimates of receipt among the population at risk are presented overall and then stratified by age, race/ethnicity, family income, and insurance coverage.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "papanicolaou", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "selected preventive health services for women", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "receipt of selected preventive health services for women", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. office of population affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. preventive services task force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national center for health statistics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsfg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fpl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "public health action", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american college of obstetricians", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national health interview survey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. department of health and human services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "medicaid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T02:40:42.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b65af3439e83e1ff93be28b05409165c6ce9b14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvdpYeRJOT_2HjWfgnlBjass-", "site_full": "www.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=5", "site_categories": ["law_government_and_politics", "home_and_garden", "tech", "hacking", "environmental_safety", "us_government_resources"], "section_title": "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)", "title": "EARLY RELEASE: Deaths Involving Fentanyl, Fentanyl Analogs, and U-47700 \u2014 10 States, July\u2013December 2016", "title_full": "EARLY RELEASE: Deaths Involving Fentanyl, Fentanyl Analogs, and U-47700 \u2014 10 States, July\u2013December 2016", "published": "2017-10-27T19:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/images/social-media/socialmedia_logo_600x300_72dp_fw.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 121, "comments": 0, "shares": 121}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b65af3439e83e1ff93be28b05409165c6ce9b14", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRyyUYu35AgslD2J3n_h.ZVAIFUgyAOpJvZs28mIUzbvdpYeRJOT_2HjWfgnlBjass-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-27T19:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "EARLY RELEASE: Deaths Involving Fentanyl, Fentanyl Analogs, and U-47700 \u2014 10 States, July\u2013December 2016", "text": "Deaths Involving Fentanyl, Fentanyl Analogs, and U-47700 \u2014 10 States, July\u2013December 2016 \nEarly Release / October 27, 2017 / 66 Format: Views equals page views plus PDF downloads Views: Summary \nWhat is already known about this topic? \nSharp increases in opioid overdose deaths since 2013 are partly explained by the introduction of illicitly manufactured fentanyl into the heroin market. Outbreaks related to fentanyl analogs also have occurred. One fentanyl analog, carfentanil, is estimated to be 10,000 times more potent than morphine. Fentanyl analogs are not routinely detected because specialized toxicology testing is required. \nWhat is added by this report? \nThis is the first report using toxicologic and death scene evidence across multiple states to characterize opioid overdose deaths. Fentanyl was involved in >50% of opioid overdose deaths, and >50% of deaths testing positive for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs also tested positive for other illicit drugs. Approximately 700 deaths tested positive for fentanyl analogs, with the most common being carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl. \nWhat are the implications for public health practice? \nIncreasing mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased overdose risk, because users are exposed to drug products that vary substantially in potency and that include some extremely potent products. Surveillance for opioid overdoses needs to expand to track the rapidly changing illicit opioid market. In fall 2017, CDC funded 33 jurisdictions to expand forensic toxicology testing. Increased implementation of evidence-based efforts targeting persons at high risk for using illicit opioids, including increased access to medication-assisted treatment and increased availability of naloxone, and innovative interventions are needed. \nPreliminary estimates of U.S. drug overdose deaths exceeded 60,000 in 2016 and were partially driven by a fivefold increase in overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (excluding methadone), from 3,105 in 2013 to approximately 20,000 in 2016 ( 1 , 2 ). Illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid 50\u2013100 times more potent than morphine, is primarily responsible for this rapid increase ( 3 , 4 ). In addition, fentanyl analogs such as acetylfentanyl, furanylfentanyl, and carfentanil are being detected increasingly in overdose deaths ( 5 , 6 ) and the illicit opioid drug supply ( 7 ). Carfentanil is estimated to be 10,000 times more potent than morphine ( 8 ). Estimates of the potency of acetylfentanyl and furanylfentanyl vary but suggest that they are less potent than fentanyl ( 9 ). Estimates of relative potency have some uncertainty because illicit fentanyl analog potency has not been evaluated in humans. This report describes opioid overdose deaths during July\u2013December 2016 that tested positive for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, or U-47700, an illicit synthetic opioid, in 10 states participating in CDC\u2019s Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) program.* Fentanyl analogs are similar in chemical structure to fentanyl but not routinely detected because specialized toxicology testing is required. Fentanyl was detected in at least half of opioid overdose deaths in seven of 10 states, and 57% of fentanyl-involved deaths also tested positive for other illicit drugs, such as heroin. Fentanyl analogs were present in >10% of opioid overdose deaths in four states, with carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl identified most frequently. Expanded surveillance for opioid overdoses, including testing for fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, assists in tracking the rapidly changing illicit opioid market and informing innovative interventions designed to reduce opioid overdose deaths. \nThe 10 states \u2020 reporting data abstracted information from preliminary death certificates and medical examiner/coroner reports on unintentional and undetermined opioid overdose deaths using standard definitions for variables. Data were entered into the State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS), the component of ESOOS designed for tracking fatal opioid overdoses. \u00a7 For each death, available data on demographic characteristics, circumstances of the overdose collected from death scene investigations (e.g., evidence of illicit drug use), and results of forensic toxicology testing were entered into SUDORS. Opioid overdose deaths occurring during July\u2013December 2016 with positive test results for fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and U-47700 in 10 states are described, and key demographic and overdose circumstance factors are stratified by substance. Full toxicology findings of decedents were reviewed, including the presence of heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Because heroin involvement in overdose deaths is difficult to distinguish from prescription morphine, deaths in which heroin was confirmed by toxicologic findings were combined with deaths in which heroin was suspected because morphine was detected and death scene evidence suggested heroin use. \u00b6 The use of medical examiner/coroner reports, previously unavailable across states, provides unique insights into specific substances and circumstances associated with overdoses, which can inform interventions. \nFentanyl was detected in 56.3% of 5,152 opioid overdose deaths in the 10 states during July\u2013December 2016 ( Figure ). Among these 2,903 fentanyl-positive deaths, fentanyl was determined to be a cause of death by the medical examiner or coroner in nearly all (97.1%) of the deaths. Northeastern states (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island) and Missouri** reported the highest percentages of opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl (approximately 60%\u201390%), followed by Midwestern and Southern states (Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), where approximately 30%\u201355% of decedents tested positive for fentanyl. New Mexico and Oklahoma reported the lowest percentage of fentanyl-involved deaths (approximately 15%\u201325%). In contrast, states detecting any fentanyl analogs in >10% of opioid overdose deaths were spread across the Northeast (Maine, 28.6%, New Hampshire, 12.2%), Midwest (Ohio, 26.0%), and South (West Virginia, 20.1%) (Figure) ( Table 1 ). \nFentanyl analogs were present in 720 (14.0%) opioid overdose deaths, with the most common being carfentanil (389 deaths, 7.6%), furanylfentanyl (182, 3.5%), and acetylfentanyl (147, 2.9%) (Table 1). Fentanyl analogs contributed to death in 535 of the 573 (93.4%) decedents. Cause of death was not available for fentanyl analogs in 147 deaths. \u2020\u2020 Five or more deaths involving carfentanil occurred in two states (Ohio and West Virginia), furanylfentanyl in five states (Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin), and acetylfentanyl in seven states (Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). U-47700 was present in 0.8% of deaths and found in five or more deaths only in Ohio, West Virginia, and Wisconsin (Table 1). Demographic characteristics of decedents were similar among overdose deaths involving fentanyl analogs and fentanyl ( Table 2 ). Most were male (71.7% fentanyl and 72.2% fentanyl analogs), non-Hispanic white (81.3% fentanyl and 83.6% fentanyl analogs), and aged 25\u201344 years (58.4% fentanyl and 60.0% fentanyl analogs) (Table 2). \nOther illicit drugs co-occurred in 57.0% and 51.3% of deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, respectively, with cocaine and confirmed or suspected heroin detected in a substantial percentage of deaths (Table 2). Nearly half (45.8%) of deaths involving fentanyl analogs tested positive for two or more analogs or fentanyl, or both. Specifically, 30.9%, 51.1%, and 97.3% of deaths involving carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl, respectively, tested positive for fentanyl or additional fentanyl analogs. Forensic investigations found evidence of injection drug use in 46.8% and 42.1% of overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, respectively. Approximately one in five deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs had no evidence of injection drug use but did have evidence of other routes of administration. Among these deaths, snorting (52.4% fentanyl and 68.8% fentanyl analogs) and ingestion (38.2% fentanyl and 29.7% fentanyl analogs) were most common. Although rare, transdermal administration was found among deaths involving fentanyl (1.2%), likely indicating pharmaceutical fentanyl (Table 2). More than one third of deaths had no evidence of route of administration. Top Discussion \nThis analysis of opioid overdose deaths in 10 states participating in the ESOOS program found that illicitly manufactured fentanyl is a key factor driving opioid overdose deaths and that fentanyl analogs are increasingly contributing to a complex illicit opioid market with significant public health implications. Previous reports have indicated that use of illicitly manufactured fentanyl mixed with heroin, with and without users\u2019 knowledge, is driving many fentanyl overdoses, particularly east of the Mississippi River ( 3 , 4 ). Consistent with these findings, at least half of opioid overdose deaths in six of the seven participating states east of the Mississippi tested positive for fentanyl. Over half the overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs tested positive for confirmed or suspected heroin (the most commonly detected illicit substance), cocaine, or methamphetamine. This supports findings from other reports indicating that fentanyl and fentanyl analogs are commonly used with or mixed with heroin or cocaine ( 3 , 4 ). Nearly half of overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, however, did not test positive for other illicit opioids, suggesting that fentanyl and fentanyl analogs might be emerging as unique illicit products. \nFentanyl and fentanyl analogs are highly potent and fast-acting synthetic compounds that can trigger rapid progression to loss of consciousness and death and thus might require immediate treatment and high doses of naloxone ( 5 ). Because of the potency of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs and the rapid onset of action, these drugs were determined by medical examiners and coroners to play a causal role in almost all fatal opioid overdoses in which they were detected. Injection, the most commonly reported route of administration in fatal overdoses, exacerbates these risks because of rapid absorption and high bioavailability. The high potency of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs, however, can result in overdose even when administered via other routes. Nearly one in five deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs had evidence of snorting, ingestion, or smoking, with no evidence of injection. Multiple overdose outbreaks and law enforcement drug product submissions across the country have reported counterfeit prescription pills laced with fentanyl and fentanyl analogs ( 10 ). \nWith few exceptions, fentanyl analogs are illicitly manufactured, because they do not have a legitimate medical use in humans. \u00a7\u00a7 The detection of fentanyl analogs in >10% of opioid overdoses in four states raises the concern that fentanyl analogs have become a part of illicit opioid markets in multiple states. The fentanyl analogs most commonly detected were carfentanil, furanylfentanyl, and acetylfentanyl. Carfentanil, which is intended for sedation of large animals, is much more potent than fentanyl, whereas furanylfentanyl and acetylfentanyl are less potent ( 9 ). Carfentanil contributed to approximately 350 overdose deaths in Ohio, but was detected in only one other state (West Virginia). Because of its extreme potency, even limited circulation of carfentanil could markedly increase the number of fatal overdoses. Recent data suggest that carfentanil deaths are occurring in multiple other states, including Kentucky, which reported 10 overdose deaths involving carfentanil in the second half of 2016 (Kentucky Department of Public Health, unpublished data, 2017) and New Hampshire, which reported 10 deaths in 2017. \u00b6\u00b6 Forty-six percent of SUDORS opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl analogs tested positive for fentanyl or an additional fentanyl analog, ranging from 31% for carfentanil to 97% for acetylfentanyl. The increased mixing or co-use of fentanyl, heroin, cocaine, and varying fentanyl analogs might contribute to increased risk for overdose because persons misusing opioids and other drugs are exposed to drug products with substantially varied potency. \nThe findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, results are limited to 10 states and therefore might not be generalizable. Second, the presence of fentanyl analogs is underestimated because commonly used toxicologic testing does not include fentanyl analogs, some fentanyl analogs are difficult to detect ( 9 ), and specialized testing for fentanyl analogs varied across states and over time. Third, the route of fentanyl and fentanyl analog administration must be interpreted cautiously because the data do not link specific drugs to routes of administration and thus the precise route of administration of fentanyl or fentanyl analogs cannot be determined in overdose deaths involving multiple substances (e.g., heroin and cocaine) and routes (e.g., injection and snorting). Fourth, the combination of deaths with toxicologic confirmation of heroin with those with detection of morphine and death scene evidence suggesting heroin use might have resulted in misclassification of some deaths. Finally, fentanyl source could not be definitively determined; however, only a small percentage of fentanyl deaths had evidence consistent with prescription fentanyl (e.g., transdermal use versus injection). \nIllicitly manufactured fentanyl is now a major driver of opioid overdose deaths in multiple states, with a variety of fentanyl analogs increasingly involved, if not solely implicated, in these deaths. This finding raises concern that in the near future, fentanyl analog overdose deaths might mirror the rapidly rising trajectory of fentanyl overdose deaths that began in 2013 and become a major factor in opioid overdose deaths. In response to this concern, CDC expanded ESOOS to 32 states and the District of Columbia in 2017 and added funding for all 33 recipients to improve forensic toxicologic testing of opioid overdose deaths to include capacity to test for a wider range of fentanyl analogs.*** Increased implementation of evidence-based efforts targeting persons at high risk for illicit opioid use, including increased access to medication-assisted treatment, increased availability of naloxone in sufficient doses, and other innovative intervention programs targeting this group, is needed to address a large and growing percentage of opioid overdose deaths involving fentanyl and fentanyl analogs.

By the 1970s, NIOSH researchers were pioneering the study of musculoskeletal health as professional ergonomists, examining physical and social components of work environments (such as conveyer belt height and lunch break routines, respectively) to mitigate musculoskeletal injury risks. The cost of musculoskeletal disorders is a serious health concern to the NIOSH Musculoskeletal Health Cross-Sector Program . Approximately one in three workers\u2019 compensation claims that result in paid time off are related to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). 1 As part of our observance of National Ergonomics Month , we are posting the first in a year-long series of blogs about musculoskeletal health- related research. The following blogs will focus on a variety of high-risk industries. \nNIOSH defines MSDs as soft-tissue injuries caused by sudden or sustained exposure to repetitive motion, force, vibration, and awkward positions. These disorders can affect the muscles, nerves, tendons, joints and cartilage in your upper and lower limbs, neck, and lower back. In the United States and Canada, more people are unable to work due to MSDs than any other group of diseases 2 . The mission of the NIOSH Musculoskeletal Health Cross-Sector Program is to reduce the burden of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) through a focused program of research and prevention that protects workers from MSDs, helps management mitigate related risks and liabilities, and helps practitioners improve the efficacy of workplace interventions. Important NIOSH accomplishments in the area of MSD research are highlighted on the NIOSH Ergonomics Topics page . \nOne of the most popular products related to NIOSH\u2019s MSD research is the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) , which has been the international standard for assessing risks associated with lifting tasks for more than 20 years. The NIOSH Musculoskeletal Health Cross-Sector Program recently published a free mobile lifting application called NLE Calc , allowing users to quickly calculate manual lifting risks as they occur on the job. NLE Calc uses the composite lifting index (CLI) to calculate manual lifting risks for multiple and complex lifting tasks. Workers, employers, and occupational   can easily download NLE Calc from Apple iTunes or Google Play , type the indicated measurements into the equation, and use the results to help identify ergonomic solutions for reducing the physical stresses associated with manual lifting. \nEven with the technology and resources we have today, preventing MSDs in the workplace can be challenging. About 1 in 5 workers in the United States is over the age of 65, so ergonomically comprehensive business solutions often require new equipment, new policies, and/or employee training geared towards the capabilities of an older working population. There is great need for additional, affordable ergonomics programs to promote musculoskeletal health in the workplace. Here are a few examples of where ergonomic interventions could have substantial impact: Health care personnel in hospitals, nursing homes, home care and emergency response settings are at high risk of developing neck, shoulder, and back injuries from lifting and handling patients. Assemblers and fabricators, especially those that work with small parts, are at risk of overexerting the muscles in their hands that are responsible for fine motor control. Firefighters, police, sheriff patrol officers, correctional officers and jailers are at high risk of developing sprained, strained, and torn muscles because the physical demands of their work often changes at a moment\u2019s notice. \nNIOSH has grown increasingly aware of the need to disseminate research findings and recommendations through new media channels in addition to the traditional outlets of scientific presentations, journal articles, and books. We would love to hear from you in the comment section below about if/how you have used our research, and areas you would like to see us focus on in the future.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) invites you to share stories that show how you do just that , so they can be a part of an exciting new exhibit at the David J. Sencer CDC Museum in Atlanta. \nThe exhibition\u2014to be held from Sept 22, 2019, through May 1, 2020, in Atlanta\u2014will recognize the public health contributions of the AI/AN community in a visually compelling, culturally appropriate manner. CDC\u2019s exhibition will showcase how native traditions and wisdom have affected public health in the past and present, and how AI/AN people have made a difference in the health of their people. \nCompared with other Americans, AI/AN people have higher rates of some diseases, disorders, and deaths. This call for stories offers an opportunity for individuals, tribes, tribal organizations, and others to showcase the strengths and resilience of tribal communities, their heritage and traditions, and how their culture addresses risk factors unique to tribes and promotes their health and well-being. What Types of Stories Are Needed? \nPlease send stories that highlight how native traditions and wisdom have affected health, or show contributions of specific AI/AN individuals to health and wellness among AI/AN people. CDC will consider stories that represent the diverse array of tribes, tribal organizations, health issues, and people of Indian Country and AI/AN culture, such as Locations\u2014reservation and non-reservation, urban, rural, all geographic areas across the United States Health issues\u2014environmental health, chronic diseases, infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and response, injury, behavioral health People\u2014individuals, tribes, organizations How to Submit a Story? CDC values the privacy and ownership rights of those in stories. As such, each agency, organization, or individual that contributes a story is responsible for obtaining any necessary permissions or releases from any parties involved in the story. \nStory submissions, which should be no more than two pages, single spaced, and size 12 font, can be emailed to by January 15, 2018. Please include website links to photos and pictures of objects that could be included in the exhibit, when available. \nAll submissions must include the following: Brief historical background information that puts the story in context. For example, what is the traditional or cultural practice? How did it contribute to health and wellness in AI/AN people in the past? A description of how this tradition or culture affects people\u2019s lives today. The impact could be lives saved, suffering reduced, fewer visits to health care facilities, adoption of a healthier lifestyle, or other similar benefits. This section should also describe how the practice is promoted among tribes and AI/AN people. A list of potential photographs, pictures, documents, media, and objects that can be used to illustrate the story. Is there artwork or children\u2019s drawings that represents the practice? Are there radio recordings, letters, posters, or other communications from public health efforts? Are there traditional objects that have evolved to become used in modern day? Are there objects that are still in use today? Please include images and files with the submission, if available. How Will Submissions Be Evaluated? \nSubmissions will be assessed based on the following criteria in the initial review: Impact . Is the story educational, inspiring, and persuasive? Does it clearly convey how the culture or tradition being practiced promotes health and wellness? Visual components. Are there compelling, high-resolution photographs that illustrate the story? Are there physical objects that are available for use in a museum exhibit? Are there opportunities for interactive displays or actions that could be part of an exhibit? Quality, clarity, and historical accuracy. Is the information presented accurately and clearly? \nCDC intends to showcase a broad array of public health success stories from across Indian Country, so even if a story isn\u2019t a part of the museum exhibit, it could still be showcased on other CDC channels, such as social media, websites, print materials, and presentations.

Hearing loss prevention is no exception. We have been aware of the harmful effects of overexposure to noise for over a century. Governmental recommendations and regulations have been designed to protect against these effects for decades, and we have a large body of research pointing out effective ways to prevent noise damage, yet noise-induced hearing loss still ranks among the most common occupational illnesses in the US. One reason may be that hearing researchers and government bodies have not effectively communicated what we know to those in a position to put this knowledge into action. Over the past several years, NIOSH researchers have focused on narrowing this \u201cknow-do\u201d gap by trying to improve our communication and dissemination efforts with safety and health professionals and the public through available communication channels and social media. \nOne of the great tools that NIOSH has made available for scientists and researchers to communicate with our stakeholders is The NIOSH Science Blog which allowed us to tackle some interesting and fun subjects. Since its launch ten years ago, the hearing loss prevention team at NIOSH has published nearly thirty blogs on various noise and hearing loss prevention topics. We covered topics such as the risk faced by specific groups of workers, ways of measuring the societal burden of this condition, and specific strategies and tools to help avoid the effects from loud noise. As we wrap up National Protect Your Hearing Month, we will revisit some that illustrate the range of topics covered. We hope that you will find at least one tip in these blogs that will help you close the \u201cknow-do\u201d gap in hearing health. If you have an idea to share, please comment below so others also can give it a try! \nSo How Accurate Are These Smartphone Sound Measurement Apps? (2014) \nThis has been the most successful NIOSH blog ever, with over 254,000 views and 166 comments. These days, it seems that almost everyone has a smartphone, and there is a smartphone app for almost everything \u2013 including noise measurement! At our last count, well over 200 sound measurement apps are available. To help everyone understand their usefulness, NIOSH conducted a study to examine the accuracy of some of them \u2014 we wanted to know whether they could be used to reliably measure noise levels in the workplace. Only a few apps met our test criteria, especially if used in conjunction with a calibrated external microphone. As a result of that study, we noticed that most apps did not provide noise measurement metrics commonly used in occupational noise monitoring. So we decided to develop and make available our own NIOSH SLM app . The app has been the most successful NIOSH mobile application launch, with over 92,000 downloads since its release less than 9 months ago. We\u2019ve written a blog on the app as well. Check it out here \u2013 New NIOSH Sound Level Meter App (2017). \nMeasuring the Impact of Hearing Loss on Quality of Life (2016) \nHearing loss can have a profound impact on quality of life. Hearing loss makes it difficult to understand what others are saying, especially in group situations or when there is background noise. As your hearing loss progresses, certain speech sounds become harder and harder to hear, and you find yourself needing to ask others to repeat themselves, which quickly becomes frustrating for everyone. Social gatherings, meetings, restaurants, theaters, and even church can become isolating activities because of the trouble understanding what people are saying and the inability to contribute to the conversation. Depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal can result, impacting an individual\u2019s quality of life. One way to measure this impact is to calculate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which estimate years of good health lost due to a disability. NIOSH has found that 2.5 healthy years are lost each year for every 1,000 noise-exposed U.S. workers because of hearing impairment. Nearly every occupational hearing loss is preventable; hopefully, closing the \u201cknow-do\u201d gap will reduce the number of DALYs suffered by US workers. \nVuvuzelas: What\u2019s the Buzz? (2010) \nRemember the 2010 World Cup in South Africa? Vuvuzelas (a type of plastic horn) took center stage at the competition with their energetic sound, but raised concerns because of the potential for very high sound levels. Just how loud were they? As we reported in our blog, average vuvuzela output is 131 dB and can reach a peak sound pressure level of 140 dB (about as loud as a jet engine during takeoff). With thousands of vuvuzelas being blown simultaneously, noise levels are certainly hazardous. Soccer fans may not experience a high risk for hearing loss if they only attend one or two games; however, athletes, referees, stadium workers, broadcasters, and others could be over-exposed during the course of a season. NIOSH recommends that everyone use hearing protection when attending events where vuvuzelas will be blown by spectators in the grandstand. \nHigher Speeds, Higher Decibels (2010) \nWorld Cup soccer isn\u2019t the only loud sporting event. Stock car racing is a popular spectator sport with more than 8 million spectators attending over 90 racing events each year. \u201c Noise is part of NASCAR ,\u201d fans often say, but if you are a driver, crew member, or a worker at these facilities, that noise can be hazardous to your hearing in the long run. NIOSH measured noise levels at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Indianapolis, Indiana, the Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee, and the Kentucky Speedways. We found that noise levels at these racetracks often exceed those found in some of the loudest industrial settings. Noise and administrative controls and hearing protection not only minimize the risk of noise-induced hearing loss, but can also be a competitive performance advantage by improving communication between drivers and crew. Our efforts aimed to raise awareness among drivers, crews, event workers, and spectators to make sure that activities they enjoy today don\u2019t impair their ability to hear and enjoy other activities in the future. \nThese Go to Eleven (2011) \nNearly everyone enjoys music. However, both musicians and audiophiles can find themselves with hearing loss or tinnitus if they listen too long to music louder than the recommended exposure limit. Once hearing loss sets in, music will never sound the same again. Musicians and entertainment workers have been an overlooked sector in terms of occupational safety and health. Hearing conservationists need to present safe listening tips from an artistic rather than a workplace safety point of view to meet the needs of these individuals. Special types of hearing protectors are available for listening to music without distorting the sound quality or interfering with the experience. Read about these and other NIOSH recommendations for reducing music-induced hearing loss in our follow-up blog \u2013 Turn it Down: Reducing the Risk of Hearing Disorders among Musicians : (2015). \nNIOSH HPD Well-Fit\u2122: The Future is Fit-Testing (2013) \nPerhaps one of the biggest \u201cknow-do\u201d gaps in hearing loss prevention is in the area of hearing protection. We know that the labelled Noise Reduction Ratings generally overestimate the amount of noise reduction that a worker receives from his hearing protector. We also know that each worker receives a different level of protection based on how well the device fits a particular ear, how deeply the worker inserts it, the type and condition of the protector, etc. So how can we know if a worker is adequately protected? The solution is individual fit-testing. Hearing protector fit-test systems have been around for a while now, and several commercial systems are available. However, some barriers exist to the widespread implementation of fit-testing. To address these barriers, NIOSH developed HPD Well-Fit TM , which uses standard technology available on just about any computer to fit-test any earplug in 5 minutes or less. Proactive safety and health professionals have begun using fit-testing as a part of their hearing loss prevention programs, ensuring that more and more workers are adequately protected. \nEven a Dummy Knows October is Protect Your Hearing Month (2012) \nIntroducing Nick\u2026 a NIOSH training mannequin used to raise awareness of hazardous sound levels among teenagers and young adults. Nick travels around to health fairs, conferences, meetings, and other events to measure sound levels produced by personal music devices. He is very popular and has traveled over 30,000 miles across more than ten states and two countries, educating young workers about the risks of hearing loss. Nick has many siblings all over the world who do the same thing. Check out our blog for a link with instructions for building a training mannequin of your own. \nIntroducing the Hearing Loss Prevention Program Evaluation Checklist : (2017) \nNoise-induced hearing loss continues to be one of the most common occupational disorders, even in workplaces where workers are enrolled in hearing loss prevention programs. We have the knowledge to change this. A good hearing loss prevention program requires several elements: noise measurement, noise control, hearing protection, hearing testing, education and training, record-keeping, and periodic program evaluation. A team of NIOSH-funded researchers from the University of Washington, University of Michigan, and Yale University have created two tools to help workplaces implement effective hearing loss prevention programs \u2013 a checklist to measure regulatory compliance and adoption of best practices, and a calculator to estimate program costs. Download these tools to close the \u201cknow-do\u201d gap at your worksite and let us know what you think so we can continue to improve them. \nSpeaking of improvements, check out our Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention webpage (or follow us on Twitter at @NIOSHNoise ) for additional information about our research and other resources to help with your hearing loss prevention efforts. \nDo you have an idea for the next blog on hearing loss prevention? Let us hear from you. Also, please share your tips for closing the know-do gap on occupational hearing loss. \nChrista L.

Traditionally, kids trick-or-treat at night \u2013 going house-to-house in their costumes. On average, children are more than twice as likely to be hit by a car and killed on Halloween than on any other day of the year. Children are at greater risk of injury than adults because they are small, have trouble judging distances and speeds, and have little to no experience with traffic rules. On the Trick-or-Treat trail? \nAs a parent or caregiver, there are a few important things you can do to protect your trick-or-treaters on the Halloween trail. Light the way. Bring glow sticks or a flashlight with extra batteries so your trick-or-treater can see (and be seen) in the dark. Be visible. Put reflective tape on clothes, costumes, and trick-or-treat bags so your trick-or-treater can be seen by passing motorists. Use the crosswalk. Cross the street at a crosswalk or intersection. Never cross the street from between parked cars and don\u2019t assume you have the right-of-way. Stay on the sidewalk. If available, use the sidewalk. Otherwise walk on the shoulder facing traffic. Pay attention. Distracted walking can be as hazardous as distracted driving so watch where you are going. Review traffic safety. Talk to your trick-or-treater about basic traffic laws before leaving the house. Driving on Halloween? Remove distractions. Put your phone in the glovebox or the back seat. Practice defensive driving. Be cautious and stay alert to reduce your risk of getting into a crash. Enter and exit driveways and alleys carefully. Watch your speed. Pay attention to the speed limit and drive slower when you are around pedestrians. Be prepared to stop. Trick-or-treaters may ignore crosswalks and traffic signals so stay alert. Do not pass a vehicle stopped at a crosswalk \u2013 they may be stopped for a pedestrian. Do not drive under the influence. Every 51 minutes, one person in the United States dies in a motor vehicle crash that involves an alcohol-impaired driver. Properly buckle kids no matter how short the trip. Properly buckling children in their car seats, booster seats, and seat belts when transporting them and making sure that their costumes don\u2019t interfere with them being properly buckled.

CDC is aware of media reports and anecdotal accounts of various infectious diseases in hurricane-affected areas, including Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (USVI). Because of compromised drinking water and decreased access to safe water, food, and shelter, the conditions for outbreaks of infectious diseases exist. \nThe purpose of this HAN advisory is to remind clinicians assessing patients currently in or recently returned from hurricane-affected areas to be vigilant in looking for certain infectious diseases, including leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, vibriosis, and influenza. Additionally, this Advisory provides guidance to state and territorial health departments on enhanced disease reporting. \n\nBackground Hurricanes Irma and Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico and USVI in September 2017, causing widespread flooding and devastation. Natural hazards associated with the storms continue to affect many areas. Infectious disease outbreaks of diarrheal and respiratory illnesses can occur when access to safe water and sewage systems are disrupted and personal hygiene is difficult to maintain. Additionally, vector borne diseases can occur due to increased mosquito breeding in standing water; both Puerto Rico and USVI are at risk for outbreaks of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. \nHealth care providers and public health practitioners   post-hurricane environmental conditions may pose an increased risk for the spread of infectious diseases among patients in or recently returned from hurricane-affected areas; including leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, vibriosis, and influenza. The period of heightened risk may last through March 2018, based on current predictions of full restoration of power and safe water systems in Puerto Rico and USVI. \nIn addition, providers in health care facilities that have experienced water damage or contaminated water systems should be aware of the potential for increased risk of infections in those facilities due to invasive fungi, nontuberculous Mycobacterium species, Legionella species, and other Gram-negative bacteria associated with water (e.g., Pseudomonas), especially among critically ill or immunocompromised patients. \nCholera has not occurred in Puerto Rico or USVI in many decades and is not expected to occur post-hurricane. \n\nRecommendations \nThese recommendations apply to healthcare providers treating patients in Puerto Rico and USVI, as well as those treating patients in the continental US who recently traveled in hurricane-affected areas (e.g., within the past 4 weeks), during the period of September 2017 \u2013 March 2018. Health care providers and public health practitioners in hurricane-affected areas should look for community and healthcare-associated infectious diseases. Health care providers in the continental US are encouraged to ask patients about recent travel (e.g., within the past 4 weeks) to hurricane-affected areas. All healthcare providers should consider less common infectious disease etiologies in patients presenting with evidence of acute respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, renal or hepatic failure, wound infection, or other febrile illness. Some particularly important infectious diseases to consider include leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, vibriosis, and influenza. In the context of limited laboratory resources in hurricane-affected areas, health care providers should contact their territorial or state health department if they need assistance with ordering specific diagnostic tests. For certain conditions, such as leptospirosis, empiric therapy should be considered pending results of diagnostic tests\u2014 treatment for leptospirosis is most effective when initiated early in the disease process. Providers can contact their territorial or state health department or CDC for consultation. Local health care providers are strongly encouraged to report patients for whom there is a high level of suspicion for leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid, and vibriosis to their local health authorities, while awaiting laboratory confirmation. Confirmed cases of leptospirosis, dengue, hepatitis A, typhoid fever, and vibriosis should be immediately reported to the territorial or state health department to facilitate public health investigation and, as appropriate, mitigate the risk of local transmission. While some of these conditions are not listed as reportable conditions in all states, they are conditions of public health importance and should be reported. \nGeneral health information about hurricanes and other tropical storms: https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/index.html Information about Hurricane Maria: https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/hurricanes/hurricane_maria.html Information for Travelers: Travel notice for Hurricanes Irma and Maria in the Caribbean: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/alert/hurricane-irma-in-the-caribbean Health advice for travelers to Puerto Rico: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/puerto-rico?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-single-001 Health advice for travelers to the U.S. Virgin Islands: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/usvirgin-islands?s_cid=ncezid-dgmq-travel-leftnav-traveler Resources from CDC Health Information for International Travel 2018 (the Yellow Book): Humanitarian Aid Workers: https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/advising-travelers-with-specific-needs/humanitarian-aid-workers", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pseudomonas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zika", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hurricane-affected areas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cdc health alert network", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cdc health information for international travel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usvi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "including puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-29T20:14:01.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8e83a111dd2a908d20bf228d3d19c82be09ec01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5fuYWao3k44KR3ZENkCtRNiYh25WmV.E6cerEP74imsPSJCCMUXgnpW1WBDkDWzzwie29mn6KUV6ygwhFi_PM3.45llDG_v93QMfqrxnT9Yi2NFaidAokiHs0jw1tqfOPxpHnBi5mmJqc_jth3xq.wQ-", "site_full": "blogs.cdc.gov", "site": "cdc.gov", "site_section": "http://www2c.cdc.gov/podcasts/createrss.asp?t=r&c=479", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Your Environment and Your Health", "title": "The Knowns and Unknowns about Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)", "title_full": "The Knowns and Unknowns about Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)", "published": "2017-10-30T18:19:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1459, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8e83a111dd2a908d20bf228d3d19c82be09ec01", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQt6lTFeQGo5fuYWao3k44KR3ZENkCtRNiYh25WmV.E6cerEP74imsPSJCCMUXgnpW1WBDkDWzzwie29mn6KUV6ygwhFi_PM3.45llDG_v93QMfqrxnT9Yi2NFaidAokiHs0jw1tqfOPxpHnBi5mmJqc_jth3xq.wQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-30T18:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Knowns and Unknowns about Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)", "text": "The Knowns and Unknowns about Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Posted on Share Compartir photo courtesy of Dr. Paul Mehta. \n\u201cIt is the \u2018knowns\u2019 that keep me humble, and the \u2018unknowns\u2019 that keep me challenged,\u201d says Paul Mehta, M.D. Paul is a medical epidemiologist and the principal investigator who provides oversight for the congressionally mandated National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Registry at the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) in Atlanta. \nALS is also known as \u201cLou Gehrig\u2019s disease,\u201d named after renowned baseball player Lou Gehrig who was diagnosed with ALS in 1939 when he was just 36. Over 75 years have passed since, and ALS continues to perplex researchers and patients alike. Humbling and Challenging \n\u201cAs a scientist it is both humbling and challenging to work at CDC/ATSDR. When you are a federal scientist, there are many challenges that must be overcome, especially when you are working with a disease like ALS, which has many unknowns and knowns,\u201d says Paul. The Knowns of ALS: ALS is a disease of the nerves and muscles that gets worse over time. Approximately 80% of patients die within 2 \u2013 5 years of diagnosis; the prognosis or outcome differs patient to patient. Ten percent of cases are genetic in origin; 90% of cases are sporadic (random) in origin. The disease affects mostly whites and mostly men. Current treatment extends life expectancy by only 2 \u2013 3 months on average. The Unknowns of ALS: How random cases of ALS could be linked to the environment. Where, what, and when environmental links occur. Why the disease affects mostly whites and mostly men. Why the disease affects veterans, and professional athletes. How ALS can be treated or cured. The National ALS Registry \nIn 2008, Congress passed the ALS Registry Act giving ATSDR the responsibility for developing and managing the registry, and in 2010, ATSDR launched the first and only ALS Registry in the United States. The population-based registry collects and analyzes data on persons with ALS in the United States. \nThe goal of the ALS Registry is to gather information that can be used to Estimate the number of new cases of ALS each year Estimate the number of people who have ALS at a specific point in time Understand more about who gets ALS and what factors affect the disease Examine the connection between ALS and other disorders that can be confused with ALS \nThere were almost sixteen thousand cases of ALS in the ALS Registry as of 2013. The Registry gets data from multiple sources such as Medicare, and the Veterans Administration, and from self-identification by individuals with ALS. ATSDR anticipates releasing its 2014 prevalence report later this year. \nDr. Mehta and his team work very closely with ALS advocacy and support groups, researchers, healthcare professionals, and others to encourage those living with ALS to join the Registry and take risk factor surveys. National ALS Biorepository and Research Notification System \nIn January 2017, ATSDR launched another component of the National ALS Registry\u2014the first national biorepository for ALS in the United States. The term \u201cbiorepository\u201d usually refers to a facility that collects and stores samples of biological material. Samples in the ALS biorepository could include blood, urine, and saliva, and are used to help advance ALS research. When a patient joins the Registry, he or she can choose to receive information on how to donate samples. There is no cost or fee for patients to participate. \nThe Registry collaborates with academic and private industry to assist with their recruitment efforts. Recruiting for clinical trials and studies can be difficult and expensive. The Registry\u2019s research notification system informs patients who have chosen to receive email about trials and studies they may be eligible for. \n\u201cResearchers can work with the Registry in a variety of ways, including obtaining data and/or samples from the Registry/Biorepository and requesting help recruiting for their clinical trials and studies. To date, thirty institutions have used this free mechanism to assist with recruitment and over 100,000 emails have been sent to patients,\u201d says Paul. PALS (Persons with ALS) \nWhat Dr. Mehta finds most humbling is meeting persons with ALS, known as \u201cPALS,\u201d as they are called. \u201cThe majority of them are selfless individuals. They themselves know that in their lifetime there may not be a treatment or a cure for ALS, but they want to help others. To me, that is very humbling. They range from those in their thirties, to middle-aged, and to the very old,\u201d he says. ALS does not discriminate and can affect anyone. \nDr. Mehta feels privileged to meet with PALS through partnership meetings and educational symposiums that are open to patients, and their essential caregivers throughout the country. He uses these opportunities to speak with them, learn their stories, and listen to their feedback about the National ALS Registry to learn what ATSDR can improve upon and do better. About Dr. Paul Mehta \nPaul is married, and the father of three sons: one in college, one in high school, and one in middle school. His wife works as a nurse practitioner at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Atlanta. And they have two dogs that add to their busy and boisterous household. When not working or parenting, he uses his very limited free time playing tennis, working out at the gym, catching up on reading, and watching U.S. and world news on TV, which he encourages his sons to do as well. \nAlthough Paul was born in New Delhi, India, he grew up in Toledo, Ohio, after his parents immigrated to the U.S. when he was five years old. He came to Atlanta after medical school in 2000. Paul trained in the National Health Service in England, making the decision to go into public health instead of private practice to have an impact on individual health, but on a broader scale. Post-graduate training in the National Health Service allowed him to see how public health is delivered in different parts of the world. \nGrowing up, Paul always wanted to be a physician. His father was in business, but relatives on his mother\u2019s side of the family were physicians \u2013 uncles, aunts, and cousins. So from an early age, he always had the drive to contribute to science and to care for individuals. \nPaul joined CDC in 2002 as a contractor, then became an employee in 2006, starting out as a team leader for CDC\u2019s Division of Select Agents and Toxins. He moved to what is now the Division of Toxicology and Human Health Sciences at ATSDR as principal investigator for ALS when a position opened up in October of 2013. Paul considers his work at CDC/ATSDR the high point of his career. Most Rewarding \nPaul feels privileged to work with a dedicated and cohesive team of about a dozen talented, hardworking epidemiologists, statisticians, health scientists, and health communicators, whose purpose is to make the ALS Registry the very best it can be. \u201cMost importantly, and most challenging, we are here to figure out the unknowns for ALS such as the environmental risk factors, who gets ALS, and why. We want to advance ALS research to try and determine the causes for ALS, leading to better treatments for the disease, and possibly a cure.\u201d \nATSDR advances this goal by funding research into environmental causes for ALS, and by working with some of the best scientists nationwide and around the world. Paul emphasizes the importance of being very open and working with partners both at home and abroad. \u201cYou can\u2019t work in a bubble,\u201d he says. Ice Bucket Challenge for ALS \nThe Ice Bucket Challenge is an activity involving the dumping of a bucket of ice and water over a person\u2019s head to promote awareness of ALS, and encourage donations to research. It went viral during July\u2013August 2014. The instigating force behind the Ice Bucket Challenge was Pete Frates, a baseball player from Boston who, like Gehrig, was diagnosed with ALS and helped garner attention for the disease. \nBecause about five to six thousand people die from ALS annually, and another five to six thousand are diagnosed with it, Paul was gratified to see national attention called to this devastating and fatal disease. \n\u201cALS is a rare disease, unlike Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s,\u201d says Paul, \u201cbut ALS shares some clinical characteristics with these diseases.\u201d One interesting and important difference is that Alzheimer\u2019s patients experience memory loss, but remain physically intact, while ALS patients retain their mental faculties, but their bodies completely fail them. Looking Ahead \nFor the first time in 20 years, a new drug, Radicava, was released this year to treat patients with ALS. While it does not cure ALS, it does slow the progression of the disease. And for those with a genetic component for ALS, there are early clinical trials underway to see if gene therapy can help slow down the disease as well. \n\u201cALS is a devastating and debilitating disease. We need to make certain that we have resources available both at the federal and private level, because there is currently no cure,\u201d says Paul. \u201cAt the federal level, a lot of the clinical trials are spearheaded by the Food and Drug Administration. The National Institutes for Health also conducts clinical trials, and at CDC/ATSDR we study the impact of ALS on public health, and who it affects.\u201d \nDr. Paul Mehta emphasizes that \u201ccurrently there are more unknowns than knowns about ALS, and with the National ALS Registry we are looking to figure out the \u2018why\u2019 of ALS, who gets ALS, and how. We are committed to advancing research and going forward with our partners to find better treatments for and solve the mysteries of ALS,\u201d he says.

In the past two years alone the continent has experienced infectious disease outbreaks of cholera , meningitis , Ebola Virus Disease , Lassa fever , and Yellow fever , and other public health emergencies such as drought and famine. Understanding the big picture Training participants from Zanzibar discuss the development of an emergency management program. \nIt is vitally important to have a big picture perspective on emergency management and response \u2013 if one country is not prepared for a public health emergency, then all the countries in the region are susceptible to public health threats that can easily cross borders and impact surrounding countries. This is where public health emergency management (PHEM) comes in. In-country PHEM capacities and systems can be strengthened to support global health security. When the workforce is trained, emergency management infrastructure is in place, and functional systems exist, a country is better positioned to execute a coordinated response that can mitigate risk and save lives. \nCDC and other international partners support ongoing efforts to help countries across Africa build capacity in outbreak detection and response . This includes preventing avoidable epidemics, detecting public health threats early, and responding rapidly and effectively to outbreaks of international concern. CDC provides expertise in PHEM to train emergency management technicians, provide input on emergency management operations, and guide development of functional processes and systems for ministries of health around the globe. Getting the workforce ready to respond \nIn August 2017, CDC spearheaded a 5-day PHEM workshop in partnership with the World Health Organization , the United States Defense Threat Reduction Agency , and Public Health England . The workshop brought together 55 emergency management staff members from across Africa to learn from experts in the field about how to enhance coordination and response capabilities of their country\u2019s PHEM programs. \nParticipants came from seven countries \u2013 Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria \u2013 which all share common interests and challenges related to emergency response. The training focused on developing core principles in PHEM, including trained staff, physical infrastructure, and processes to run a fully functional Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC). The training highlighted best practices, but since many of the participants had first-hand accounts of responding to public health events in their own countries, they were encouraged to share experiences and network with their peers. Sharing knowledge and expertise \nPublic health professionals who work in emergency response know that it\u2019s important to build relationships before an incident so that during a response you work effectively and efficiently with partners. One participant noted that the \u201crich, valuable contributions from other people\u2019s experiences to build upon what I already knew\u201d was one of the most rewarding parts of the workshop. \nThe tabletop exercises at the end of the workshop emphasized the importance of information and idea sharing. Participants engaged in tabletop exercises that simulated a response to a Yellow Fever outbreak in northern Tanzania. Participants were divided into 7 teams: management, plans, logistics, operations, finance and administration, communication, and partners. Each team had a mix of participants from different countries. Teams utilized information they had learned throughout the workshop to developed response products, including an organizational structure chart, objectives for the response, and an initial situation report. This exercise led to a robust conversation about different approaches to public health emergency response. Seeing response in action Public Health Emergency Operations staff survey the scene after mudslides in Regent, Sierra Leone. \nA highlight of the training was when Dr. Ally Nyanga, the Tanzania Ministry of Health PHEOC Manager and an alumni of the CDC Public Health Emergency Management Fellowship , took workshop participants on a tour of the Tanzania PHEOC, a small room on the third floor of the Ministry of Health building.
