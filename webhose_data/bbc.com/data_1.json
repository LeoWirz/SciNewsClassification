'Devastated and bereft' \nThe judge added: \"His family have been left devastated and bereft. \n\"You were all within a flat and consumed excessive amounts of alcohol and valium.\" \nJonathan Crowe, counsel for Duncan, said: \"Her life simply went off the rails.\" He said she had been diagnosed with PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and had described what happened in the attempted murder as \"horrifying\". \nHe said Duncan had acknowledged the life-changing effects of the attack for the victim. Mr Crowe said the murder bid was \"effectively committed in a vacuum of drugs and alcohol and an off-the-rails lifestyle\". \nDuncan, of Rosemount, Donaldson, of King Street, and Hutchison, of Dyce, all Aberdeen, had denied attempting to murder Mr Jones. \nHutchison and Donaldson launched the attack on Mr Jones after he had fallen asleep on a couch at a house in Auldearn Place in Aberdeen, with Duncan joining in. \nLady Scott said that, prior to the attack, there had been \"a background\" between Hutchison and Mr Jordan. Knuckle duster \nShe said: \"If you did not know beforehand, you were told during this attack your victim suffered a previous head injury.\" \nThe court heard three weeks before the murder bid, Hutchison punched a man \"for reasons unknown\" after approaching his car. \nThe victim fell to the ground and was repeatedly punched and kicked and suffered a broken jaw. \nHutchison also took part in an attack with Donaldson on a man in Gardner Drive, Aberdeen, on 20 February last year. \nThe pair repeatedly punched the man with a knuckle duster to the head to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. Hutchison also punched another man with the knuckle duster. \nDefence counsel Michael Anderson, for Hutchison, said: \"There was at the time of the offences a difficult drug problem which has to a degree been tackled.\" Related Topics ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mathew donaldson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hutchison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashley duncan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lady scott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee hutchison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan crowe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duncan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news woman", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donaldson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rosemount", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auldearn place", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aberdeen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dyce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gardner drive", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king street", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:47:36.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c717ea624bebfa62cdaacba6dbc5ebcb981d469e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qYDykC_Y41qSk8QUT1G8B8HwKt.HOhAmB1SVxEZipFay", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "http://heresalink.com/rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "(no title)", "title": "[BBC] Alvaro Morata: Chelsea striker suffers grade two hamstring injury which could sideline him for more than a month (4-8 weeks).", "title_full": "[BBC] Alvaro Morata: Chelsea striker suffers grade two hamstring injury which could sideline him for more than a month (4-8 weeks).", "published": "2017-10-03T13:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/43E5/production/_98118371_morata3.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 294, "comments": 0, "shares": 294}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c717ea624bebfa62cdaacba6dbc5ebcb981d469e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qYDykC_Y41qSk8QUT1G8B8HwKt.HOhAmB1SVxEZipFay", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T13:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "[BBC] Alvaro Morata: Chelsea striker suffers grade two hamstring injury which could sideline him for more than a month (4-8 weeks).", "text": "Read more about sharing.

'Taking sides' \nThe resolution referred to Prime Minister Theresa May's recent statement about wanting no infrastructure on the Irish border after Brexit. \nIt stated that position \"presumes\" the UK will have to stay in the internal market and customs union, or that Northern Ireland will stay in some form of internal market and customs union. Image copyright PA Image caption Guy Verhofstadt visited Belfast and an area near the Irish border last month \nThat part of the text has been welcomed by Sinn F\u00e9in but criticised by unionists. \nUlster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson said it showed that Mr Verhofstadt was \"taking sides\" in Northern Ireland. \n\"Mr Verhofstadt is essentially calling for an international border to be placed between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain,\" he said. \nMr Nicholson added that it would be a \"sad day\" if the parliament supported that text as it would be \"turning its back on decades of good relationships with all communities in Northern Ireland\". 'Important step forward' \nThat was echoed by the Democratic Unionist Party's Diane Dodds, who said \"there can be no question of a deal that cuts us adrift from our most important market and erects barriers in the UK single market\". \nSinn F\u00e9in's Martina Anderson said the resolution was \"an important step forward in recognising that the requirements of the north of Ireland are different from those in Britain\". \nShe also welcomed Mr Verhofstadt's comments on exploring how the Good Friday Agreement could be given legal protection as part of the withdrawal deal. \nMr Verhofstadt was in Belfast last month, and said during that visit it was up to the UK to find a way to avoid the imposition of new controls at the Irish border after Brexit. \nThe parliament's role in the Brexit process is to vote on the final deal. \nIts leaders are consulted by the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier, although he takes his direction from the European Council.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption More than half a million Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since August \nIn the graphic video, posted on her Facebook page last week, the beauty queen says Arsa's \"caliphate-style movement\" attacks were \"out of proportion\". \nSpeaking in English, Shwe Eain Si accuses the militants and their supporters of conducting a media campaign \"so that harbingers of terror and violence themselves [now seem] as if they are the oppressed\". \nHer video makes no mention of allegations that the Burmese military have carried out widespread atrocities against the Muslim Rohingya minority. The army, which has been accused of conducting ethnic cleansing, has said it is only targeting militants. \nThe latest outbreak of Rakhine violence began on 25 August when Arsa militants attacked security posts, triggering a military crackdown. More than 500,000 Rohingya have since fled to neighbouring Bangladesh. How we saw through the official story \nRakhine villagers and other minorities such as Hindus have also been affected by violence. \nBut correspondents say that the large wave of Rohingya migrants and their widespread claims of abuse at the hands of the military indicate their community has been disproportionately affected. \nShwe Eain Si is not the first beauty pageant winner to run into trouble in recent months. \nIn September the winner of Miss Turkey 2017 was stripped of her crown after it emerged she had shared a post referencing last year's coup attempt. Competition organisers said the tweet was \"unacceptable\".

The counsel for MGN said the group had apologised for its wrongdoing. \nThe exact figure of the settlement has not been revealed but most of the money would be distributed to good causes, Coogan said. \nIn court, Coogan's counsel, David Sherborne, told the judge the case concerned voicemail hacking, unlawfully obtaining personal information from third parties and surveillance by private investigators.

Activities 'concealed' \nCoogan complained to MGN in July 2015 and it admitted liability for the misuse of his private information. \nThe comedian issued his claim in October 2016 and tried to find out the extent of the wrongdoing and identify the relevant articles. \nThe level of damages, apology terms and admissions have now been agreed. \nRichard Munden, counsel for MGN, said it acknowledged Coogan was the target of unlawful activities and that they were concealed until years later. \nHe said: \"It apologises to Mr Coogan for its wrongdoing over a decade ago and for any articles that were the product of unlawful activity and for the concealment of these activities. \n\"MGN apologises to Mr Coogan and accepts that he and other victims should not have been denied the truth for so long.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve coogan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david sherborne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard munden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sherborne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leveson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mirror group newspapers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mgn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leveson inquiry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinity mirror", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:27:43.038+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7676d1bb75aa21cf473f3ad311b2824ab76b5e3f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvqS5Y2NWOFulMi4UKRuYvvA--", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "http://www.bbc.com/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BBC -

Foo Fighters Image copyright Greg Allen/REX/Shutterstock \nAfter Nirvana ended in 1994, Dave Grohl was recruited to perform with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers - who were without a drummer at the time - on Saturday Night Live. \nPetty was said to have been so impressed that he offered Grohl a permanent place in the band. But Grohl turned him down and started Foo Fighters instead. The biggest musical influence can be seen on the Foos' Wheels, which pays some homage to Petty's Learning To Fly.

opposition MPs, including singer-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi. \nMr Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, said he was targeted for opposing the ruling party's plan to scrap the presidential age limit. \nMr Kyagulanyi and MP Allan Ssewanyana said their homes shook and windows were shattered by the explosions. \nA government spokesman denied the government was behind the blasts. \n\"Flash grenades at opposition MPs' homes could be own scare tactics to frame government,\" Ofwono Opondo was quoted by the state-allied New Vision newspaper . \"There is no record or history of this NRM government killing political opposition,\" he added. \nMr Kyagulanyi said he had received death threats on a daily basis because of his opposition to the removal of the presidential age limit. \nHe would not be intimidated by the \"cowardly\" attacks, he said \n\"Thankfully no-one is hurt. But what kind of country are we now living in?\" he added in a Facebook post . \nMr Ssewanyana said the attacks took place in the early hours of Tuesday.

Roads were closed and they found an ambulance that they transferred the victims in to - but one of them died in Mr Cronk's arms. Going back in to help \nRobert Hayes, who works as a firefighter in Los Angeles, got his wife and friends out of the venue and promptly identified himself to the Swat team on site. He told Fox News that he had personally pronounced 20 people dead, working with a medic from the local fire department. \n\"It's just something that we do,\" he said. \n\"I wasn't trying to be a hero.\" \nTodd Blyleven, a former minor league baseball player, told the Washington Post that once his group of friends were safe, he went back inside to try and help others get out. The paper says he joined a \"group of volunteers\" and may have helped remove 30 or 40 people from the gunfire. \"I just felt like I had to,\" he said. \n\"I would hope that if I or my family, was in a situation like that, that someone would come in and get me.\" More on the victims \nLindsay Lee, a tattoo artist, was one of many who used her truck as an ambulance. In one video on Instagram, a man can be heard telling her: \"Right now, we need your truck. We just need to get people to the hospital.\" \nShe replied: \"Okay, go ahead, put them all in the back!\" \nShe wrote that one man had died in the truck and her fianc\u00e9 had carried him into the hospital. \n\"This was a nightmare, I've never run for my life like I did tonight,\" she continued. Giving blood \nIn the early hours of Monday morning, police appealed to people to stay away from Las Vegas Strip even though many wanted to pour in and help.

It's not about Boris Johnson. He sucks the oxygen, grabs the attention, \"the blond one\" excites the Tory crowds, as well as driving his colleagues up the wall with his behaviour. \nToday in a speech about \"the lion that will roar\", (wonder what he's trying to say there?) activists may cheer him and colleagues will gnash their teeth as, in a way only he can, he tickles the party's tummy. \nThe fuss around Boris Johnson is the symptom not the cause. The problem that is increasingly on people's minds at this grisly conference is that the Tories might be only at the start of a decline, which becomes impossible to escape. \nOne former minister says, \"there is a smell of decay\", another, that it is \"hopeless, but we are resigned to the nightmare\". Cabinet ministers fret that Theresa May simply doesn't have the ideas or imagination to reboot either her leadership or their party. Conservative conference: live updates \nOne of her colleagues says \"how did she blow the party up in 12 months?\", lamenting how her premiership has paralleled Gordon Brown, who after years of hoping to get to Downing Street arrived there with little to say, bewildered by the sudden challenge of the top job. Another says she looks \"bent and broken\". \nBut there is little evidence yet that there is anyone willing or brave enough to confront this publicly, the younger generations of Tory MPs are furious with the top brass, but none of them yet ready to step up to the plate. \nFor now, Mrs May's glum cabinet colleagues mostly believe the best option is to get behind her, to show loyalty with the hope of regaining authority to govern, the slow grind of government competence could restore credibility over time. \nThese are unpredictable times. One minister even told me they feel optimistic about the next election, believing the Corbyn phenomenon can't sustain for five years. \nBut in government and on the backbenches and in Manchester, optimism is a minority view. Stopping the slide the priority. \nThe fear here is not really that Boris Johnson is grabbing all the attention, it's that this party could be dying inside, and it finds itself with a leader who might struggle to stop the downward spiral.

Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale has been ruled out of Wales' last two World Cup qualifiers against Georgia and the Republic of Ireland with a calf strain. \nThe 28-year-old could be out for a month and that would also rule Bale out of the play-offs on 9-14 November. \nWales are second in Group D and if they keep that spot it could be enough to earn them a place in the play-offs. \nBale joined the Wales squad on Monday and, despite sitting out training, it had been hoped he would be fit. \nBut a scan revealed the severity of the injury and means Bale will not travel to Georgia for Friday's game in Tblisi and will play no part in the Cardiff clash with Republic of Ireland three days later. \nReal manager Zinedine Zidane had played down concerns about Bale's fitness, saying he rested him for Sunday's win over Espanyol as a precaution. \nBarnsley striker Tom Bradshaw has been called up to the Wales the squad in Bale's place. \nBale's absence is a huge blow to Welsh hopes of qualifying for a first World Cup since 1958. \nWales are second in Group D, trailing leaders Serbia by four points with two matches remaining. \nSecond place could be enough to earn Chris Coleman's team a place in the play-offs, which will see eight of the nine runners-up in qualifying groups play for four remaining places in Russia 2018. \nIn order to secure a play-off place, Wales would realistically need at least four points from the games against Georgia and the Republic of Ireland. \nTheir chances of doing so will be harmed by the injury to Bale, who has scored four goals so far in this campaign. Wales have failed to win a match without the Real Madrid forward since 2013, drawing three and losing three matches in his absence. \nThe former Tottenham player has also been in fine form for Real, scoring a brilliant goal in last week's 3-1 Champions League win over Borussia Dortmund before being forced off with the muscular problem which has sidelined him for this month's qualifiers. \nBale was in Cardiff on Monday to receive his players' player of the year award at the Football Association of Wales' annual ceremony. Analysis \nBBC pundit and ex-Wales international Robbie Savage \nFor Wales to be without Gareth Bale for two massive games is devastating. \nHis passion and desire to play for Wales is there for all to see... it is a huge, huge blow. \nIt will all be on the last game with Ireland, I believe. A point in Georgia won't be a bad result for me now. \nBut even if Wales win their two games, that might not be enough. These are two of the biggest games in Welsh football history. \nFingers crossed the lads can go out there and perform, but it is going to be very, very difficult.

Steve Lee was appointed Nottingham Panthers captain at the start of the season Captain Steve Lee says Nottingham Panthers are on the verge of something special as they look to become the first UK team to reach the knockout stages of the Champions Hockey League. \nPanthers, the lowest-ranked team in the CHL, need one regulation-time win in their last two matches to guarantee qualification for the knockout stages. \nLee told BBC Nottingham Sport: \"It is special with the wins we already have. \n\"If we could get one more and put us through, that would be really special.\" \nPanthers are top of Group F with eight points from four matches, with both their remaining games against TPS Turku. \nThey host Turku at the Nottingham Arena on Tuesday before travelling to Finland next week. \nNottingham, the 32nd seed in the prestigious European tournament, have already beaten Swiss side Bern at home, who are the fourth-ranked team in the CHL, while they have also defeated Czech side Mountfield home and away. \n\"We have done really well in the CHL,\" added Lee. \"It's a massive stage and we have played against some of the best teams in Europe. \n\"I don't think anyone thought we would be where we are. We all hoped, we were all positive and believed we had a chance. \n\"When it came round to it we started building momentum. Once we had that momentum, we were good and they were very, very good games to win. \n\"Hopefully we can achieve something very, very special.\" Analysis \nFormer Panthers player and coach Paul Adey \nIt will have an impact on how British ice hockey is viewed around Europe if they get through to the next round and I think people will look at the league a lot differently. \nNobody expected them to get to where they are at this moment in time and to go that next step would be really special. \nThey have the team to do it. When I watched them early on in some exhibition games, I thought they were really, really good. \nThey certainly have not looked back. I know results in the Elite League have not all gone their way, but in the Champions Hockey League they have played extremely well.

'Absolutely appalled' \nBut her failure to denounce the military or address allegations of ethnic cleansing has been criticised by world leaders and groups like Amnesty International. \nOther organisations are now reconsidering honours given to Ms Suu Kyi, BBC world affairs editor John Simpson said. \n\"I think it is perfectly natural to look around for ways of saying we disapprove utterly of what you are doing,\" he told BBC Radio Oxford. \nOxford City Council leader Bob Price supported the motion to remove her honour and confirmed it was an \"unprecedented step\" for the local authority. \nPeople are \"absolutely appalled\" by the situation in Myanmar, he said, adding it was \"extraordinary\" she had not spoken out about reported atrocities in the country. \nLast week it emerged St Hugh's College, Oxford, had removed a portrait of Ms Suu Kyi from display.

How can we pay homage to them [the Cuban guerrillas]? \n\"The Bolivian state, which represents the people, has the obligation to pay homage to us, we defended the nation and 59 soldiers gave their lives.\" \nThe Bolivian army fought a bitter battle against Che's small force of 47 men between 1966 and 1967 which ended when Che was captured and killed. \nThe veterans have rejected suggestions by Minister of Defence Reymi Ferreira who said that the commemorations were to be a way of \"healing wounds\" between Bolivia and Cuba. \nHowever, Mr Moreira said that it wasn't possible to pay tribute to \"a foreigner who had caused pain and grief to Bolivian families\". \n\"If Che had won, our country would be different. Thanks to us we have legally constituted governments.\" \nHe said the veterans planned to take part in a mass to remember their dead. \nBolivia is a political ally of Cuba and the left-wing government of President Evo Morales and the Caribbean island have close political and diplomatic relations.

Quiz those hand-picked pupils who show you around \nAs Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, admits, schools will always wheel out their star pupils for the open evening: \"They'll choose the pupils who are their ambassadors.\" \nAnd who can blame them? It would be rather worrying if a school gave the responsibility of showing prospective parents around to the naughty, often-caught-having-a-smoke-behind-the-bike-sheds boys and girls. \nBut former head of England's school watchdog Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, says asking these carefully selected pupils lots of questions can be very revealing. \n\"Most of the hand-picked students will say nice things about the schools,\" says Sir Michael. \"But ask them about achievement, ask them if they've made progress from year to year. \n\"Particularly if they are lower-school children, in Year 7, 8 or 9, ask them whether they've made sufficient progress since primary school, because all the data shows that when youngsters transfer from primary to secondary, their performance often dips. \n\"Ask if they are taught in mixed-ability classes - in all subjects, in some? Are there setting arrangements in the core subjects?\" 2. Ask to go to the toilet \nIt's inevitable that schools will want to show you around the newly refurbished library or the new sixth-form block. They'll be all shiny and new - how could you not be impressed? \n\"Schools are bound to spotlight their smartest classrooms and best facilities,\" says Geoff Barton. \"But this is no different from what we do when we show would-be vendors around our houses. \n\"But you can get beyond this by asking to have a tour with pupils, and asking to see, say, the toilets that pupils use. \n\"Toilets, in my experience, tell you a lot about a school's values.\" 3. Bring your child to the open evening/day \nMichelle Doyle Wildman, acting chief executive of the parent group PTA UK, says that while parents would do well to look at Ofsted reports and read up on a school's exam results, open days and evenings are not to be missed. \n\"There's no substitute for going to the school yourself - the opportunity to visit the school is invaluable.\" \nMichelle says it's important not to leave your child at home: \"Go along with your child and gauge their reaction on whether this is an environment in which they'll thrive. Fundamentally it's about finding the right match for your child.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Would my child fit in here? \nShe suggests letting the visit \"sink in\" before having a conversation about how they felt, as this \"gives them a chance to digest it\". 4. Listen to the head teacher's speech \nSir Michael says sizing up the head teacher is crucial - and he should know, he was one for many years before going to head up Ofsted. \n\"Parents need to listen to the head - leadership is everything in a school. If you've got a good head, everything flows from good leadership. \n\"So listen to the head teacher and make sure he or she is talking about progress and outcomes and is the sort of person and personality that will drive the school forward.\" \nMichelle Doyle Wildman adds: \"The head's speech gives you a good feel for the school. \n\"Is the school taking a whole-child approach or is it more focused on the academic achievement? That's a nuance you want to get in this process of looking at schools.\" 5. And then ask tough questions \nIf the head then takes questions after the big spiel, Sir Michael says parents should not be backwards in coming forwards. \n\"Try and get the head to talk about what they're doing to improve attainment and improve progress. \n\"What strategies have they got to ensure that children learn and achieve well? What are their intervention strategies? \n\"What are they doing with those youngsters who are underachieving? Ask the head to be very specific about that. \n\"Also, destination data - where are the children going at the end of their secondary school career?\" 6. Take a good look at the teachers \nGood leadership might be key, but it's teachers who'll have the most day-to-day impact on your child. \nGeoff Barton says: \"Staff should look like a corporate body, welcoming and keen to talk about the school.\" \nSir Michael says parents should ask themselves: \"What do the staff look like on the open evening? Do they look professional? Do they look like teachers? Are they well turned out?\" \nParents could legitimately ask about recruitment and retention, he adds. \n\"How many unfilled vacancies have you got? How many vacancies are covered by temporary staff and supply teachers?\" 7. Visit the school again - at home-time \nHaving attended what is an inevitably well-rehearsed open evening or day, Sir Michael recommends doing a bit of Sherlock work and going back when the pupils are leaving to go home. \n\"I think you can get a sense of a good school as you see the children coming out of the school,\" he says. \n\"Parents need to look at the behaviour, whether the uniform is still worn properly, whether they're congregating outside fast-food outlets misbehaving.

The Welsh budget is a major part of the assembly calendar - when Welsh Government ministers decide how much cash will be spent on the country's public services. \nBut this year there are some big changes, as the way that Wales' finances are run is shaken up. What is a Welsh budget? Image caption The budget is the responsibility of Mark Drakeford, the finance secretary \nFinance Secretary Mark Drakeford will deliver his draft budget for 2018/19 in the Senedd on Tuesday afternoon. \nIt will outline the pots of money which will go to each department of the Welsh Government. \nIt oversees Wales' health service, local government, education, housing policy, the arts, economic policy, transport and more. \nFrom what is announced, we will know if devolved Welsh services are, overall, getting more or less cash from the \u00a315.9bn they received this year. How is the Welsh Government funded and what is new this year? Image caption The Welsh Government will be part-funded from tax it sets from April \nIn the past the Welsh Government has been purely funded through a grant from the UK government. \nBut, from next April, the Welsh Government will be able to levy some small taxes and raise its own cash - namely stamp duty land tax and landfill tax. \nSo, on Tuesday, tax rates and bands will be published for the first time. What we will not hear Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Full details of spending plans will be released at a later date \nThe big omission is that the Welsh Government will not publish a breakdown of what is going to individual services when the initial budget is announced. \nMr Drakeford will outline what departments are getting, but is not expected to go into greater detail. \nThat is a big change from previous years and will mean it is unlikely that Welsh Government will provide a breakdown of what specific services are getting - at least when the budget is first announced. \nThe breakdown is being held back until later in October when ministers appear before committees of AMs. Who is getting what? Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Could some council services become unsustainable over the long term? \nMinisters have promised to protect the NHS, meaning sectors like local government could lose out as their share of the pot gets squeezed. \nA recent report by two Cardiff University-based think tanks said the Welsh Government should expect, at worst, a 3% cut to its \"block grant\" from HM Treasury by 2021/22. \nCurrently, the NHS gets 48% of the Welsh Government's revenue budget, which has risen from 39% in 2009/10. \nBut the think tanks estimated that this could have to rise to 56% to keep up with predicted growth in demand. \nThat means proportionally less money for other services. \nThe think tanks warned that in the future there could be questions on whether the full range of council services offered - like libraries and leisure centres - are affordable. How will the draft budget get through the assembly? Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Labour and Plaid Cymru have sealed a two-year deal to get the budget through the assembly \nLabour, which leads the Welsh Government, is in a minority in the assembly with 29 AMs - two short of a majority. \nBut Labour has chosen to agree a deal with Plaid Cymru for this year's and next's budget , putting it on a firmer footing than the razor-thin majority they would otherwise have with backing from two other AMs; former Plaid leader Lord Elis Thomas and Liberal Democrat Education Secretary Kirsty Williams. \nPlaid Cymru will not actually vote for the budget deal but it will allow it to pass votes in the assembly by abstaining. \nIn return, it said it has secured \u00a3210m in commitments, although about \u00a350m a year is actually rolled over from promises made in Plaid's last budget deal.

This year it expects to visit 180 schools. Image copyright Getty Images \nThe team of so-called \"associate assessors\" - practising principal teachers, depute head teachers or head teachers - will be extended and have more involvement. An existing teacher or practitioner will join every school inspection from April 2018, except when very small schools are being reviewed. \nMeanwhile Education Scotland plans to deploy most of its education staff to work with frontline leaders and practitioners. \nThey will work through the new regional improvement collaboratives being set up to help share good practice across council boundaries. The collaboratives will be expected to drive curriculum support and development. \nGraeme Logan, interim chief inspector of education said: \"For us to achieve our national endeavour of excellence and equity, we need the new Education Scotland to be supporting teachers and driving improvement in education for all learners across Scotland.\" \nHe added: \"Education Scotland is a partnership of people who believe passionately in the power of education to change lives. \n\"As well as our core staff team, we have 200 associates in all parts of Scotland - experienced teachers and practitioners who work with us directly. \n\"We want to extend this further so that there is a current practitioner on every inspection team to share practice more effectively.\" 'Young inspectors' \nEducation Scotland said the findings of inspections will help it further strengthen its leadership and professional learning programmes, \nThe agency also hopes to make more use of learners in its work. \nIt said young people would work with inspectors and support and drive improvement in learning and would set up a team of so-called \"young inspectors\". \nIt will publish a version of How good is our school? - the guide used for improvement in every school in Scotland - for young people by next April. \nThe changes at Education Scotland come as the government plans a major shake-up to school governance. \nHead teachers will be given a greater range of formal powers. \nThe threat of a major row with councils over the planned changes - especially the regional improvement collaboratives - appears to have gone away. \nA deal over the role of the collaboratives was agreed last week by education secretary John Swinney and council umbrella body Cosla. \nSome in local government had feared that the planned changes would seriously weaken the role of councils in the education system. \nEducation Scotland's plans also included what it calls a \"single approach\" to the inspection of early learning and childcare with the Care Inspectorate. \nIt says it would contribute to 1,800 inspections per year as it tried to support the expansion of care and learning for the youngest children in Scotland.

Robert Kubica won the Canadian Grand Prix with Sauber Williams are to give Robert Kubica two days of testing this month to establish whether the Pole can make his comeback to Formula 1 after seven years away. \nKubica, 32, has not raced in F1 since he suffered life-changing injuries in a rally accident in 2011, and he has only partial movement in his right arm. \nHe tested for Renault three times in the summer but the French team decided not to take its interest further. \nWilliams now want to evaluate him as a potential replacement for Felipe Massa. Media playback is not supported on this device Kubica's remarkable return to Formula 1 \nKubica is due to test initially at Silverstone after the Japanese Grand Prix before moving on to a full assessment test at the Hungaroring and both outings are expected to be private. \nWilliams declined to comment. \nThe team plan to run for two days at the site of the Hungarian Grand Prix, with Kubica driving one day and Williams reserve driver Paul di Resta the other to provide a benchmark for Kubica's performance. \nDi Resta, 31, also has an outside chance of being promoted to a race seat next season, but unless something changes, the decision over 2018 at this stage is fundamentally between Massa and Kubica. \nThe key question for Williams is whether Kubica is physically up to a return to F1. \nRenault said in August that they still had \"question marks\" over Kubica's readiness to return to F1 after a day's test at the Hungaroring in their 2017 car. \nBut his manager says the driver is ready to make a return and Kubica will be determined to use the Williams test as a chance to prove it. \nThe main question marks are over the strength and mobility in his right arm, which was partially severed in the accident in 2011, in which he also suffered multiple fractures throughout his body. \nWilliams will want to establish whether he can manage the car in long, demanding corners, of which the Hungaroring has several, and can turn it around a tight hairpin. \nHis physical endurance in terms of the strength of his arm over a race distance is also a concern. \nDi Resta filled in capably for Massa at the last minute when the Brazilian fell ill over the Hungarian Grand Prix weekend. \nThe Scot, who had last raced in F1 in 2013, qualified 0.7 seconds behind team-mate Lance Stroll despite not having sat in the car before qualifying started. \nMassa retired at the end of last season because Williams intended to partner Stroll with Finn Valtteri Bottas this season and could not get a driver elsewhere. \nBut when Bottas moved to Mercedes following the retirement of world champion Nico Rosberg, the 36-year-old returned. \nAlthough Stroll has impressed at some races, most notably Azerbaijan and Italy, Massa has comprehensively out-performed the 18-year-old Canadian rookie at most races this season, and has a sizeable advantage over him in qualifying of an average of around 0.7secs a lap. \nBut Williams are aware that Massa can be inconsistent and do not want to pass up the opportunity to take Kubica if he is close to the level he was before his accident.

The Scottish government has previously imposed a similar block on underground coal gasification (UCG) - a separate technique used to extract gas from coal seams deep underground - on environmental grounds.\nIt followed the introduction of a moratorium on both fracking and UCG in 2015, which saw a series of expert reports published on the potential health, environmental and economic impact of the controversial techniques, as well as a public consultation being carried out .\nMr Wheelhouse said the consultation came back with \"overwhelming\" opposition to fracking, with 99% of the 60,000 respondents supporting a ban. He said this showed that \"there is no social licence for unconventional oil and gas to be taken forward at this time\".\nImage caption Paul Wheelhouse said there was overwhelming public opposition to fracking The move comes almost exactly a year on from the UK government giving the go-ahead to horizontal fracking in Lancashire.\nShale gas is currently processed in Scotland at a site in Grangemouth, having been shipped in from abroad , but cannot be extracted from beneath Scottish soil under the current moratorium, which is enforced through planning regulations.\nMr Wheelhouse said local authorities would be instructed to continue this moratorium \"indefinitely\" - calling this \"action sufficient to effectively ban the development of unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland\".\nHe said: \"The decision I am announcing today means that fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland.\"\nLook back on the fracking statement on Holyrood Live Mr Wheelhouse's announcement was welcomed by environmental groups, with Friends of the Earth Scotland and WWF Scotland both hailing a victory for campaigners.\nWWF Scotland official Sam Gardner said it was \"excellent news\", saying \"the climate science is clear\" that fossil fuels should be \"left in the ground\".\nHowever Ineos said the move could see \"large numbers of Scottish workers leaving the country to find work\".\nTom Pickering, operations director of Ineos Shale, said: \"It is a sad day for those of us who believe in evidence-led decision making.\n\"The Scottish government has turned its back on a potential manufacturing and jobs renaissance and lessened Scottish academia's place in the world by ignoring its findings.\"\nImage copyright BBC Sport Image caption The first shipment of shale gas from the US arrived at Grangemouth in September 2016 The Scottish Conservatives also said Scotland would miss out on a \"much needed economic boost\" and high-skilled jobs as a result of the decision.\nTory MSP Dean Lockhart said ministers had ignored scientific and economic evidence to take a \"short-sighted and economically damaging decision which is nothing more than a bid to appease the green elements of the pro-independence movement\".\nHowever Labour MSP Claudia Beamish said the move did not go far enough, arguing that ministers were merely extending the existing moratorium which \"could be overturned at any point at the whim of a minister\".\nMs Beamish has a member's bill tabled at Holyrood calling for a \"full legal ban\", but Mr Wheelhouse said this would not be needed until his proposals.\nThe Scottish Greens also wanted a more permanent ban, with MSP Mark Ruskell saying the moratorium was \"legally shaky\" and open to challenge.\nThis was also echoed by Friends of the Earth Scotland, with Mary Church saying ministers should \"go further than relying on planning powers\" and \"instead commit to passing a law to ban the fracking industry for good\".\nScottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur welcomed the decision, saying that ministers had taken the \"scenic route\" but had ultimately decided \"effectively to ban fracking\".\nMSPs have previously voted to support a ban on fracking, but SNP members abstained from that vote.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "paul wheelhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wheelhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "grangemouth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holyrood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:02:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7294db350fb71d2ece6876338be1ecc3eb1de8c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvxPwckPg6LxOf9dtDdifhk5K_s4Lrgsbs", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Moldova profile -

BBC News", "text": "Stormont departments face \u00a31bn pressures next year By John Campbell BBC News NI Economics & Business Editor 3 October 2017 From the section Northern Ireland comments These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Reuters Image caption Northern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government since January Stormont departments are understood to be facing spending pressures of up to \u00a31bn in the next financial year. \nPressures do not necessarily mean cuts of the same amount, as funds can be reallocated between departments, or planned polices can be delayed. \nOn current projections, Stormont's block grant for day-to-day spending is due to fall by almost 2% in real terms in 2018/19 and a further 3% in 2019/20. \nThe Department of Finance said an incoming executive will make decisions. \nIt is possible the financial position could improve slightly following November's budget. \nThe funding package the DUP agreed with the Conservatives can only partly mitigate the funding pressures, as it is weighted towards capital spending. \nAt most, \u00a3310m of it could be used for day-to-day to spending over the next two years, mainly in health and education. Increasing faster \nPressures refer to a situation in which demand for services is increasing faster than the available budget. \nThe single largest spending pressure, of \u00a3400m, is in health. \nOther pressures include education \u00a3200m, skills \u00a350m, housing maintenance \u00a325m and public transport \u00a310m. \nThere are additional pressures of \u00a3100m related to the Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry. \nIf devolved government returns and the parties implement a lower level of corporation tax, that will cost an estimated \u00a3250m in its first year. \nAny increase in public sector pay would also add to financial pressure: Every 1% increase would add about \u00a360m to the salaries bill. Image caption Derek Baker said he was in \"a very difficult space\" \nLast week, the most senior official in the Department of Education said his department was facing pressures due to rising pay, special educational needs and maintenance costs. \nSpeaking to school principals and MLAs at Stormont recently, Derek Baker said: \"It is a very difficult space that I'm in financially.\" \nDepartment of Finance officials have long warned that Stormont budgets at the end of this decade would be tough. \nStormont's annual budget is just \u00a310bn for day-to-day spending, and around \u00a31bn for capital spending. 'Information gathering' \nA Department of Finance spokesperson said it had \"commissioned an information-gathering exercise to collect the necessary data that will allow a future executive to make key, informed decisions on a budget for 2018-19 and beyond\". \n\"It will be for an incoming executive to make decisions about funding levels and final budgets.\" \nNorthern Ireland has effectively been without a devolved government since January. \nIts institutions collapsed amid a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in about a botched green energy scheme . \nSubsequent talks failed to reach an agreement.

- BBC News", "text": "Why switching to fully electric cars will take time \n\"Wi-fi is fine if you are sitting with a few people in a meeting, or moving slowly around indoors,\" explains Rahim Tafazolli, head of Surrey University's 5G Innovation Centre. \n\"However, once you start to move quickly and the number of people increases to more than 10 - at Waterloo Station, for example - you need to have a system that can hand over connection between radio cells without causing a drop in signal, and which can accommodate several people simultaneously. \n\"Wi-fi can't do that.\" \nThis is because every wi-fi signal has a defined range, whereas 5G will be flexible, enabling mobile devices to switch automatically between the various newly available frequencies. \nOne frequency will be for long-range connections, across rural areas for example; one will be for urban environments, providing high numbers of users with high-speed connectivity; and there will also be a high-capacity frequency for densely populated areas, such as sports stadiums and railway terminals. \nThis flexibility will lead to \"an ever-expanding array of new business services\", Mr Tafazolli believes, and could be critical to the success of autonomous vehicles and the internet of things. \nFaster wireless connectivity should also give VR and augmented reality (AR) technologies a boost, argues Digital Catapult's Mr Scott. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Faster mobile connectivity could greatly improve virtual reality experiences \n\"If you have a very detailed, immersive VR experience and you try to run it over a mobile headset currently, there is enough latency... that it makes you feel sick,\" he explains. \nSo high-quality VR experiences rely on headsets being \"tethered\" to a computer, which provides the necessary computing power. \n5G offers the opportunity to recreate high-quality experiences on the move. \n\"It could enable you to have an experience comparable with home gaming on your mobile,\" says Mr Scott, \"allowing you to compete or collaborate with other people in real time.\" \nAndy Cummins of Brighton-based digital agency, Cogapp, says 5G will allow his firm to create much more exciting AR and VR content for visitors to museums and galleries. \n\"Without [5G] these types of experiences... would at best seem laggy and unintuitive,\" he says. \nAnd Tim Fleming, founder of Future Visual, another Brighton company preparing to trial 5G, says: \"We are very interested in in-store retail VR experiences, and creating a flagship VR experience that can be taken to any location. \n\"At the moment we have to use a dedicated PC, but with 5G you just need a headset and a mobile device. The heavy lifting is done in the cloud. That's very interesting.\" Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 5G enthusiasts say it could underpin smart cities and augmented reality services \nOf course, 5G roll-out is not without its technical challenges. \nInstalling all the base stations and antennae is very expensive, and many of today's devices will not be compatible with the new technology. \nIt is not clear at the moment who is going to pay for it. \nBut Ericsson's head of 5G commercialisation, Thomas Noren, is confident that 5G services will be cheaper to run because the network will be more energy efficient and production and operational costs will be lower. \nThere is clearly still much detail to iron out, but research consultancy Ovum predicts that there will be 389 million 5G subscriptions globally by the end of 2022. \nUsers still struggling with patchy 4G coverage maybe forgiven for being a little sceptical about the ambitious claims being made for 5G. \nBut the potential to transform a number of businesses - and create many new ones - is clearly there.

His last trial ended with a hung jury. \nA prosecution barrister told Antrim Crown Court on Tuesday that the Public Prosecution Service was \"not prepared to proceed again\". \nIt was requested that the charges be left on the books. \nThe judge said he believed that was the right decision. \nMr Bradley was not in court to hear the ruling. \nAt the end of his first trial in February, the Crown Court jury in Derry acquitted him of some charges but were not able to come to a verdict on the others. \nLast week, after an 11-day trial over five weeks in Omagh, another jury also failed to reach a definitive verdict. \nThe \"bedrock\" of the prosecution case was that Mr Bradley allegedly confessed, during eight interviews with detectives, to joining Syrian rebels opposed to President Bashar Assad and the so-called Islamic State. \nThe defence contended that, far from being a Muslim fundamentalist, Mr Bradley's only crime was being an attention-seeking fantasist.

an annual increase of 18,000 more individual female students. \nBut there are fewer male students starting this year than in 2011 - with the gender gap now at its widest ever point. Fees frozen \nThe reasons behind the gender difference in applications for university places are disputed - but for Maya, tuition fees were not going to be a deciding factor. \n\"If they had carried on increasing, I'd be thinking a bit harder. But I see it as an investment in what I want to do with my life,\" she said. Image caption Natalie is starting university as tuition fees in England are frozen \nMaya, a student from Hastings, is starting at Oxford University in the week when Theresa May announced a freeze in tuition fees at current levels of \u00a39,250. \nShe says she backs the cap and the prime minister's next step should be to cut the interest rate for student loan repayments, which has been increased this autumn to up to 6.1%. \nMaya was eligible for free meals while at school and was supported by a social mobility charity, the Villiers Park Educational Trust, which mentors potential university applicants. \nShe says that in applying to a university such as Oxford, it helped her to \"feel like a I have a right to be here\" and that \"this is not a closed world\". 'Good investment' \nNatalie Whitham, from Accrington, was also supported by Villiers Park. None of her family has previously been to university, but she is starting this week at Oxford. \nShe thought hard about the cost before applying and is glad the latest rise has been cancelled. \n\"The fees would have been a large aspect of why I wouldn't have gone,\" she says. \nBut like so many other female students, she decided that university was worth pursuing. \n\"I would definitely say it's a good investment.\" \nThe overall number of students has climbed consistently in recent decades - and is now within touching distance of the 50% target of young people set by Tony Blair when he was prime minister. \nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, has published a report saying that a changing economy needs even more graduates and in fact 70% of people should enter higher education. \nBut any further increase will depend on getting more boys into university. Why are there more women students? \nMary Curnock Cook, former head of the Ucas admissions service, believes the widening gender gap is becoming a bigger educational divide than between rich and poor. \nShe has warned that if current trends continue, the next generation of girls will be 75% more likely to go to university than their male peers. \nThere are many theories about what's behind the trend, including: Female students get better A-level results and so are likely to get more university places. Nursing has been made a graduate profession , and with its very high proportion of women entrants, this has pushed up overall female student numbers. An exam system based on coursework rather than final exams, which tended to favour more consistently conscientious girls. This is now being reversed in schools, but will take a number of years to show any impact. Women are likely to gain more, financially, from a degree , with a wider gap in earnings between graduate and non-graduate women than men Underachievement of white working class boys - a widely acknowledged problem that pushes down rates of male entry into university Related Topics ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean coughlan", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "natalie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natalie whitham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maya little", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary curnock cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick hillman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony blair", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news record", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bbc news", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "higher education policy institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "villiers park educational trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "accrington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hastings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:03:05.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "11288a37419d5baa111206c21609d6687b1146af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qYDykC_Y41qSn_10QIaLt70C1MS_krAG8dtUf4UGSK7XL_KpGqKQ548-", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2018: Alex Marshall ready for sixth lawn bowls appearance - BBC Sport", "title_full": "Commonwealth Games 2018: Alex Marshall ready for sixth lawn bowls appearance - BBC Sport", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.076, "main_image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/3D56/production/_98120751_bowl.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 643, "comments": 0, "shares": 643}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "11288a37419d5baa111206c21609d6687b1146af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qYDykC_Y41qSn_10QIaLt70C1MS_krAG8dtUf4UGSK7XL_KpGqKQ548-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Commonwealth Games 2018: Alex Marshall ready for sixth lawn bowls appearance - BBC Sport", "text": "Marshall shows off his two gold medals from Glasgow 2014 Alex Marshall will make his sixth Commonwealth Games appearance on the Gold Coast next year. \nThe 50-year-old Scottish bowler will be looking to add to his tally of four gold medals in Australia. \nHe will be joined in a 10-strong team by two fellow gold medallists from Glasgow 2014; Paul Foster and Darren Burnett. \nFoster was a pairs and fours winner along with Marshall, while Burnett is the defending singles champion. \nFoster, 44, won the world indoor championships for a fifth time this year and has a pairs gold from the Melbourne Commonwealth Games in 2006. \nCaroline Brown and Claire Johnston each return for a third Games, while Kay Moran makes her second appearance, 12 years after her silver medal in the pairs. \nLesley Doig and Stacey McDougall compete for the first time. \nDoig, 26, took home silver from the singles at the 2016 world championships as well as a bronze in the pairs. \nBowler Willie Wood holds the record for attending seven Games for Scotland, from 1974 to 2002, missing out in 1986. \nScotland lawn bowls team: \nCaroline Brown, Lesley Doig, Claire Johnston, Stacey McDougall, Kay Moran, Darren Burnett, Ronnie Duncan, Paul Foster, Alex Marshall, Derek Oliver \nTeam manager: Ricky Taylor, head coach: David Gourlay, coaches: George Sneddon, Sandra McLeish.

She's 88,\" added Jacko. \nA bit further north in Powys, Nick Larder , a 61-year-old grandfather, is returning from injury and is set to play for Welshpool rugby club's second team this season. \nThe former club chairman said he could not imagine life without playing sport at the weekend. \n\"I just love it,\" he said. \"I've always played a team sport and I really don't know what to do on a Saturday unless there is some sort of team sport.\" Image copyright Ian Francis Image caption Nick Larder, 61, said he hopes to carry on playing \"for another couple of years\" \nBut what about the big hits, the bone crunching tackles? They are not easy for a 21-year-old to take, never mind a 61-year-old. \n\"I was very pleased last year,\" Nick added. \"We played in a bit of a friendly game but I did get one very big hit and I was actually very pleased because it showed to me that I can still take it, so that's permission to carry on for another couple of years.\" \nAt Usk rugby club, Roger Morgan something of a legend. The 61-year-old grandfather, who is known as Chicky because he used to work with poultry, started his career at the Monmouthshire club in 1975 and has been ever-present since then. \n\"When I was 35 I was going to pack rugby in and play golf, but I've managed to do the two,\" he said. \n\"I don't get too involved with the tackling or anything, but I still love it, love it to bits, after the game and everything with the opposition. You can't fault it. You won't have a better game than this.\" \nRoger said he had to accept the odd quip from opponents, such as \"come on old man\", but he said it was all part of the game. \nHe said he usually replied with: \"I'd rather you'd run past me instead of through me.\" \nCan he ever see himself retiring? \n\"I've had so many testimonials over the last couple of years, I'm just plodding on,\" he added. \n\"I don't intend to play every week, but if we're short I'll make the numbers up so we can have a game.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carl yapp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jacko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominic williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nick larder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian francis image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter thomas", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news players", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rugby union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welsh rugby union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welshpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc radio wales", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "carmarthen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monmouthshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "powys", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:03:07.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6d6db37b086c48126cdcb62cb8110dd3c571182f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvpvBS4q5QmYOAyNaDTcnz63rqpmd2p7F8aePRCMcYoNU-", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bristol flat fire body: Second murder arrest - BBC News", "title_full": "Bristol flat fire body: Second murder arrest - BBC News", "published": "2017-10-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/530C/production/_98106212_mediaitem98102421.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6d6db37b086c48126cdcb62cb8110dd3c571182f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvpvBS4q5QmYOAyNaDTcnz63rqpmd2p7F8aePRCMcYoNU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bristol flat fire body: Second murder arrest - BBC News", "text": "These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Avon and Somerset Police Image caption Andrew Groves was found after the flat fire in Lawrence Weston on Friday night A second man has been arrested on suspicion of murder following the discovery of a body by firefighters in Bristol. \nThe body of \"dedicated family man\" Andrew Groves , 47, was found at a flat in Oakhanger Drive, Lawrence Weston, on Friday night. \nA post-mortem examination found he died from multiple blows to the head. \nA 41-year-old man has been arrested and remains in police custody, Avon and Somerset Police said. \nA man in his 30s, who was arrested over the weekend on suspicion of murder, also remains in police custody. \nOfficers are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption More than four million customers worldwide have used AncestryDNA, which requires users to send a saliva sample for testing \nBritish customer Richard Peace is taking no chances. \nHe enjoyed using the service but is now worried about the security of his data in the years ahead and has asked Ancestry to delete his DNA records. \n\"If they've only taken out the word, 'perpetuity,' but are still carrying on in practice, that's a little bit disingenuous I feel,\" he told the BBC. 'Only superficial' \nPrivacy protection lobby group Big Brother Watch agrees. \n\"There is no need for Ancestry DNA to hold on to this information any longer than is necessary after they have given back the results,\" said a representative. \n\"Your DNA is one of the most sensitive and personal pieces of data about you.\" \nNew York data protection lawyer Joel Winston, who spotted the original \"perpetuity clause\", was surprised. \n\"Ancestry changed their terms of service. But it seems the changes were only superficial,\" he said. Image copyright Bloomberg Image caption Ancestry warns \"there may be additional risks to participation that are currently unforeseeable\" \n\"This should remind consumers that they need to be wary of any terms and privacy policies that they agree to, due to complications and future risks.\" Ancestry.com denies exploiting users' DNA Risks \nFor those who read the small print, those risks are set out by Ancestry in its Informed Consent document. \nThe company explains that it shares users' DNA data with non-profit, business or government \"collaborators\", some of whom pay for the information. \n\"There is a potential risk that third parties could identify you from research that is made publicly available,\" the company warns, adding there is also \"a potential risk that the samples could be lost or taken while in transit or storage\". \nIt explains that while person-specific features are removed from users' records, DNA \"can be used as an identifier in combination with other information\". \nIt adds: \"There may be additional risks to participation that are currently unforeseeable.\" Responsibility \nEmily Taylor, editor of the Journal of Cyber Policy, argues the Ancestry row has developed because the law puts the burden of responsibility on the consumer. \n\"I don't necessarily think it's the right way to do things. I think data should actually time expire,\" she told You and Yours. \n\"But with the law as it is, and as it's going to be for the foreseeable future, it's up to users to decide whether or not they want their data deleted.\" \nA spokesman for the company told the BBC: \"Ancestry has an ongoing relationship with each of its members and strives to deliver value over the course of the relationship.\" \nYou and Yours is on BBC Radio 4 weekdays 12:15-13:00.

While we do not take our current position lightly, we have been in tougher places before - we overcame the challenges we faced then, and we will do so again.\" Share this page ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "derek adams", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "james brent", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brent", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "plymouth", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "plymouth argyle", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "green army", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "home park", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:03:11.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e76fc57f8ecb4c3ddb3bfc4d6fe1a5634022b6fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvxPzhac2TsNOOJaFvRDCuxaRqQbG5KgsO", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Eritrea profile - Media - BBC News", "title_full": "Eritrea profile - Media - BBC News", "published": "2017-10-03T12:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.034, "main_image": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/2015/newsspec_10857/bbc_news_logo.png?cb=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e76fc57f8ecb4c3ddb3bfc4d6fe1a5634022b6fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvxPzhac2TsNOOJaFvRDCuxaRqQbG5KgsO", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T12:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Eritrea profile - Media - BBC News", "text": "These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Eritrea is the only African country to have no privately-owned news media.

The few privately-owned newspapers were closed in 2001 as part of a crackdown on the opposition. \nOutlets run by Eritreans abroad provide alternative news, but their reach and influence inside Eritrea are limited. \nExile broadcasters include Paris-based Radio Erena, which broadcasts via shortwave in Tigrinya and Arabic. \nThere were around 71,000 internet users (1.3 per cent of the population) by 2017 (Internetworldstats.com). \nDespite having one of the lowest internet penetration rates in the world, Eritrea seeks to block many websites run by exiles, says Freedom House. \nEritrea has the lowest figure globally of mobile phone users, says the CPJ.

Image copyright News Letter \nTheir hotel is next to the Mandalay Bay, which Paddock used as his base for the attack, and Frances says the famous Vegas strip has turned into a \"ghost town\". \nThe Irish News hears from Londonderry woman Aoife McAdams, another celebrating her birthday in Las Vegas, who could see the scene of the \"crazy\" attack from her hotel window . \nThe News Letter uses its editorial to call for gun laws to be tightened in the United States, pointing out that massacres in which a dozen or more people are killed have happened on a near-yearly basis over the past decade \n\"Controlling guns is a matter for Americans,\" the paper says. \n\"But if it does not happen, a by-product of the right to bear arms will be these appalling and tragic massacres.\" Image copyright Daily Mirror \nBack in Northern Ireland, the Daily Mirror notes that it's been 100 days since the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) struck its \u00a31bn deal with the Conservatives to prop up Theresa May's minority government. \nAnd the paper asks when the money will finally be made available to tackle problems facing the health and education services as well as fuelling major infrastructure projects. \nThe paper pressed Downing Street but says: \"There was no answer.\" \nSo, it poses the same question to the DUP - when's the cash coming? \n\"There's not a timescale as such,\" the party says. 'Charge more, work less' \nIt's all about the money over at the Irish News, too, and again health is on the agenda. \nThe paper says a leading medic has revealed that locum GPs in Northern Ireland are naming their price, charging as much as \u00a3500 for a day's work . \nThat comes amid a \"massive shortage\" of staff that has forced some surgeries to shut, it adds. \nWest Belfast GP Dr Michael McKenna tells the paper's health correspondent Seanin Graham that he turned down one locum's demand for \u00a3500 within the past fortnight. \n\"The majority of locums are reasonable but some people are taking advantage where they can charge more and work less,\" he says. Image copyright PA Image caption Working as a part-time locum GP is a lucrative business, says Dr McKenna \nTalking of big-money work, the Belfast Telegraph has the details of what the new director of the Public Prosecution Service will earn. \nWith Barra McGrory QC set to step down after six years in the post, Attorney General John Larkin has set about the search for a successor . \n\"The role demands an individual of the highest calibre and integrity,\" is what the job advertisement states. \nThe Telegraph reports that those applying must have at least 10 years of experience as a member of the Bar in Northern Ireland or have been a solicitor of the Court of Judicature for the same length of time. \nAnd whoever is successful will collect just over \u00a3181,000 a year.

Image caption Education Secretary Kirtsy Williams has delayed the roll-out of the new curriculum \nProf Donaldson, former Scottish chief inspector of schools, said \"progress remained good\" but warned against \"any loss of momentum in the whole dynamic of this reform\". \n\"Clearly, with the more time that passes, then the risk is people begin to relax and we lose the kind of dynamism that we need to have in the development process,\" he added. \n\"So I'm not disappointed about the extension of the timetable but I am determined that that extension should be used to full effect and that we just don't take longer to do what we would have done anyway.\" \nProf Donaldson was involved in the development of the Scottish curriculum, which faced problems during its implementation. \nA decline in Scotland's performance in the most recent international Pisa rankings has also prompted questions about whether it is a suitable model for the Welsh reforms. \nAsked about these concerns , Prof Donaldson denied Scotland was a model for Wales. \n\"It's a Welsh curriculum, it's a Welsh reform, it's a Welsh programme which is learning from the experience of other countries - one of which is Scotland. \n\"But Scotland's only one of the countries they want to learn from.\" \nHe urged schools to approach the new curriculum with \"gusto\" and welcomed how political parties were treating the reforms. \nThe Welsh Government spokesman said its approach would mean schools would have the time to engage with the development of the curriculum and be full prepared. \n\"As the OECD have recommended, we will continue our drive to create a curriculum for the 21st Century,\" he added, Related Topics ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bethan lewis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kirtsy williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirsty williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donaldson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news school", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "welsh government", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pisa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:03:15.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e2eb70bb5c81da9de5cb25b67ceffec974e865b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qeckkybPMllvVv.0K_xD4zVqmwZiDGZg51b33MnoC6eG78uv_qPaCi1Zou3NE_93ujQPDEtaPYpdOJ8pLZ..qwvJJzzrQVA_SC8Q6WSJFnQv", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Monarch boss: 'We were projected to lose \u00a3100m' -

However objectors have called for the club to look elsewhere. \nListeners in the north east of Scotland can hear a BBC Radio Scotland programme, on FM, about Aberdeen's stadium bid from 17:30.

'Place of rest' \n\"It's felt like I am living in a prison and cannot go anywhere,\" he said. \n\"I will appeal this, I am absolutely devastated. \n\"I have no right to work any more, I don't know if I can pay my mortgage and I have a baby. \n\"I have not claimed a single benefit since I've been in this country and have paid all my taxes. \n\"My wife is also a highly-qualified individual and she was a university lecturer in Pakistan and she had to give up her career just to join me in UK. \n\"I also haven't visited my father's last place of rest. \n\"I am now a patient of depression and on depression medicine.\" \nWhile his wait for a decision was relatively short compared to some, Mr Iqbal said he was shocked by a \"lack of compassion\" shown by the Home Office. \nHe lives in Barking with his wife and three-month-old son Muhammad.
