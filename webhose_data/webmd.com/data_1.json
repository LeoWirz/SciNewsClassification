This may explain the extended recovery period, Neidecker and his colleagues said. \nThe study findings were published Oct. 2 in the Journal of the American Osteopathic Association . \nThe results highlight \"the need to take a whole person approach to managing concussions, looking beyond the injury to understand the mental and emotional impacts on recovery when symptoms persist,\" Neidecker said. \nDoctors should get a full patient history to uncover factors that might complicate concussion recovery in teens, he said. \n\"Often in this age range, issues like migraines, depression and anxiety have not yet been diagnosed,\" Neidecker explained. \"So, if I ask a patient whether they have one of these conditions, they're likely to say 'No'. But when I ask about their experiences, I get a much clearer picture.\" \nThe research team focused on 102 girls and 110 boys, ages 11 to 18, with first-time sports concussions. Symptoms lasted a median of 28 days in girls (half more, half less) and 11 days in boys. Symptoms cleared up within three weeks in 42 percent of girls and 75 percent of boys.

But over the past 15 years, the disease has gained a new foothold in the United States, likely due to parents choosing not to vaccinate their children, a new study suggests.\nFrom 2001 to 2015 measles cases in the United States remained very low (less than 1 case per million people), but there's still been a signficant rise, the study found.\nOverall, measles incidence doubled -- from 0.28 per million in 2001 to 0.56 per million in 2015. Infants and young children were hit hardest, and most cases were among the unvaccinated, the research showed.\nThe findings suggest that, \"being unvaccinated rather than failure of vaccine is the main driver of measles spread,\" said lead researcher Nakia Clemmons, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe good news is that most parents are still protecting their children from measles by getting them the measles- mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine , she said.\n\"Thanks to high vaccination rates, measles cases among Americans has remained rare since the disease was eliminated,\" Clemmons said.\nMeasles outbreaks, however, can and do still occur in the United States, she said.\n\"Measles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world.

When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people, outbreaks are more likely to occur,\" Clemmons said.\nThe best way to protect children against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is to ensure they are up to date on vaccines, she said.\n\"Getting vaccines at the recommended ages protects children at the earliest age possible from serious vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Clemmons said.\nDr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\"The reason measles has come back is not because the virus has mutated. It's not because the vaccine isn't effective. It's because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\" said Offit, who wasn't involved with the study.\nContinued Measles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \"It's now spreading from one American to another.\"\nOffit, however, doesn't expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \"We used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \"Measles was a scourge in this country.\"\nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it's the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \"It's the canary in the coal mine,\" he said.\nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated.\nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found.\nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said.\nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States.\nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said.\nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed.\nOffit said it's not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines.\nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don't see and using biological fluids most people don't understand, he said.\n\"It's not surprising there's been pushback.

It\u2019s because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\u201d said Offit, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study. Continued \nMeasles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now spreading from one American to another.\u201d \nOffit, however, doesn\u2019t expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \u201cWe used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \u201cMeasles was a scourge in this country.\u201d \nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it\u2019s the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s the canary in the coal mine,\u201d he said. \nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found. \nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said. \nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States. \nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said. \nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed. \nOffit said it\u2019s not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines. \nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don\u2019t see and using biological fluids most people don\u2019t understand, he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising there\u2019s been pushback. Vaccines are a victim of their own success,\u201d Offit said. \nThe report was published as a letter in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . \nWebMD News from HealthDay Sources \nSOURCES: Nakia Clemmons, MPH, epidemiologist, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Paul Offit, M.D., director, Vaccine Education Center, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia; Oct. 3, 2017, Journal of the American Medical Association \nCopyright \u00a9 2013-2017 HealthDay.

About 89 percent of patients were men. Almost half were between the ages 18 and 29. \nThe average annual per-patient ER cost was slightly more than $5,000. Average in-patient hospital charge for gunshot victims was nearly $96,000, the study showed. \nHowever, overall ER admissions for gunshot wounds fell by 23 percent from 2006 to 2013. But there was a spike in gunshot-related ER and hospital admissions in 2014. \nThe proportion of gunshot-wound patients with a previously diagnosed mental health disorder rose from 5 percent to 7.5 percent during the study period, and the proportion of patients injured in accidental shootings increased from 34 percent to 37 percent. \nMost of the patients were injured in intentional (nearly 50 percent) or accidental shootings (35 percent), while attempted suicide accounted for 5 percent. \nThe incidence of mental health disorders was highest (40 percent) among patients injured by attempted suicide. Mental health disorders were also higher among patients injured while hunting (12.6 percent) or military-grade rifles (12.5 percent). Continued \nOf the patients in the study, more than 8 percent died in the ER or after admission to the hospital. Death rates were highest among patients age 60 and older (23 percent), those with the most severe injuries (33 percent), and those who attempted suicide (38.5 percent). \nThe study appears in the October issue of the journal Health Affairs . \nGani noted the study didn't include people who died from gunshot wounds before reaching the hospital or those who didn't go to a hospital, so it likely underestimates the overall burden of gunshot injuries and deaths. \nThe Las Vegas gunman, identified as Stephen Craig Paddock, 64, of Mesquite, Nev., fired into the crowd from his perch on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, across the street from the concert site, media reports said. \nSWAT teams stormed Paddock's hotel room and found he had killed himself, authorities said. He had as many as 10 guns with him, including rifles, according to published reports. \nBesides the dead, more than 400 other victims were taken to the hospital for injuries, authorities said.

It is the fifth straight year Humira topped the list of all drug sales. \nLevothyroxine, for thyroid conditions, was the most commonly prescribed drug, as it has been for each of the 5 years, with 123 million prescriptions in 2016. \nThe total number of all prescriptions dispensed in 2016 hit 4.4 billion, up 1.9% from 2015, on par with increases seen in earlier years. \n\"Notably,\" the authors of the report say, \"chronic prescriptions with 3-month duration have increased dramatically in the last 2 years, and prescriptions grew by 3.3% when adjusting for prescription size.\" \nUse of pain medications, both narcotic and nonnarcotic, was down 1% as restrictions on prescribing and distributing have become more common, according to the report. \nIn the report, authors Murray Aitken, executive director of the QuintilesIMS Institute, and Michael Kleinrock, research director, write that invoice spending on medications -- the amount pharmacy or hospital customers paid distributors -- in 2016 grew more slowly than in the previous year. \nSpending grew by 4.8% in 2016, slowing significantly from 8.9% in 2015. \nThe report says that was largely due to smaller price increases for name-brand products, fewer new products, and lower spending on hepatitis C treatments in 2016. \nThe report estimates that 226,000 new patients were treated with hepatitis C medicines in 2016, down by 23,000 from the year before.

This makes it tough for tobacco control advocates to adopt a pragmatic strategy focused on the devices, said Dr. Louis DePalo, a professor of pulmonology with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nFDA-approved nicotine replacement products such as gum or patches are considered safe and are used alongside counseling and therapy to help people kick their addiction, DePalo said. Gum and patches also aren't as pleasurable as using an e-cigarette, and that enjoyment might make it more difficult for someone to wean themselves off e-cigarettes. \n\"E-cigarettes in an unregulated environment just don't offer you the exit strategy of being part of a comprehensive smoking cessation strategy,\" said DePalo, who had no role in the new study. Continued \nFor the study, Levy and his colleagues crafted optimistic and pessimistic scenarios under which smokers start adopting e-cigarettes, and then projected out how many lives would be saved and extended under those scenarios. \nThe optimistic scenario assumes that: Cigarette smoking would decline to 5 percent of the U.S. population as e-cigarettes become the more popular option, down from the current 16 percent. New smokers would take up e-cigarettes rather than tobacco. People would quit e-cigarettes at about the same rate they quit tobacco. E-cigarettes carry 5 percent of the health risk of tobacco cigarettes. \nThe pessimistic scenario paints a somewhat darker picture, as expected. It assumes that: About 10 percent of Americans would still smoke tobacco; more never-smokers would take up e-cigarettes. Vapers would quit at half the rate of smokers. E-cigarettes carry about 40 percent of the risk of smoking. \nThis less-rosy outlook reflects some of the recent science regarding e-cigarettes. \nFor example, a September study in the Journal of the American Heart Association linked the nicotine in e-cigarettes to adrenaline level spikes that could increase the risk of heart attack. Also, a study in JAMA Pediatrics estimated that teens and young adults who use e-cigarettes are nearly four times more likely to graduate to full-fledged tobacco smoking. \nNevertheless, both scenarios predicted that millions of former smokers would live many more years thanks to e-cigarettes. \n\"What the scientists have discovered is it's not the nicotine that causes nearly all the deaths,\" Levy said. \"It's all the other stuff in cigarettes that people inhale.\" \nFDA regulation of e-cigarettes could pave the way to the devices becoming a more accepted form of nicotine replacement, Levy and DePalo said. \n\"The FDA has begun to look very seriously at an e-cigarette strategy,\" Levy said. \"The FDA commissioner explicitly stated about two months ago that e-cigs will be a prime component of tobacco control strategies here on.\" \nBut DePalo worries that such a strategy might imply that continued nicotine addiction is acceptable compared to the hazards of smoking, unless more is done to help e-cigarette users eventually wean themselves off the devices. Continued \n\"As a pulmonologist, the idea that tobacco could be outlawed is so appealing to me,\" DePalo said. \"That's what we all want. The question is, would we be making a deal with the devil regarding e-cigarettes? If they were regulated by the FDA, maybe that deal is one we want to make.\" \nThe new study was published Oct. 2 in the journal Tobacco Control .

Despite some closure of the racial \"gap\" in breast cancer survival, black women are still more likely to die of the disease than their white peers, the study found.\nEven though the rate of breast cancer diagnosis was slightly lower among black women than whites between 2010 and 2014, over about the same time period, black breast cancer patients were still 42 percent more likely to die of the disease than their white peers.\nAccording to breast cancer specialist Dr. Cynara Coomer, that's probably due to a combination of factors. Black patients are more prone to be affected by aggressive, tough-to-treat breast tumors, she noted. But they also often lack access to the targeted treatments that can best fight these tumors.\nSo, when it comes to surviving breast cancer, \"there remains a disparity between black women and white women across the country,\" said Coomer, who directs the Florina Rusi-Marke Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.\nThe vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed among women aged 50 and older, the ACS found, and older women account for most deaths from the disease as well.\nStill, race seemed to play a role here, as well. The median age of diagnosis for women overall in the United States is 62, but the disease tends to strike black women at a younger age, the report showed.\nContinued The median age for breast cancer deaths is 68, but black patients died younger -- at 62, on average.\nAll of this means that, overall, breast cancer kills more black women than white women in the United States.\nThere was reason to hope, however, because this health disparity may be stabilizing in some parts of the country, the ACS said. For example, breast cancer death rates among black women ranged from 22 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the report found.\nBut in seven states the researchers saw no significant difference in death rates between black and white patients -- showing that the racial gap can be closed.\nWhile genetics and differences in overall health play a big role in the survival gap between blacks and whites, so do \"social and structural factors,\" said Carol DeSantis, of the ACS's surveillance and health services research branch.\n\"Increasing access to health care to low-income populations\" might shrink this racial gap even further across the country, she explained.\nCoomer agreed, saying that black women with aggressive tumors, in particular, \"would be better served with health care teams or centers that provide comprehensive breast treatment.\"\nAccording to Bernik, progress is being made.\n\"The fact that we are finally seeing a close in the gap between our excellent outcomes between black and white women is also encouraging,\" she said, \"especially since black women are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancers.\"\nExcluding skin cancers, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women, trailing only lung cancer. It's estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and 40,610 will die from the disease.\nThe research was published Oct. 3 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Breast Cancer Facts & Figures .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T07:02:32.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e124f964a006845cf183958149786939bc38de52", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ON3yeLA.GVVdFFzWSLY3rOjGgoR8cp3rD4qhOCEuCImiySfdZB4lSn4i557EzbY5whtfhohJLmuWBhyriNgstvTwFiuX9PSE_58o6qY2CyTHqrapuG4lXzY-", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "https://www.webmd.com/default.htm", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD - Better information.

But over the past 15 years, the disease has gained a new foothold in the United States, likely due to parents choosing not to vaccinate their children, a new study suggests. \nFrom 2001 to 2015 measles cases in the United States remained very low (less than 1 case per million people), but there's still been a signficant rise, the study found. \nOverall, measles incidence doubled -- from 0.28 per million in 2001 to 0.56 per million in 2015. Infants and young children were hit hardest, and most cases were among the unvaccinated, the research showed. \nThe findings suggest that, \"being unvaccinated rather than failure of vaccine is the main driver of measles spread,\" said lead researcher Nakia Clemmons, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe good news is that most parents are still protecting their children from measles by getting them the measles- mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine , she said. \n\"Thanks to high vaccination rates, measles cases among Americans has remained rare since the disease was eliminated,\" Clemmons said. \nMeasles outbreaks, however, can and do still occur in the United States, she said. \n\"Measles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world. Unvaccinated U.S. residents returning from overseas travel and foreign visitors to the U.S. may develop measles and expose people in United States. When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people, outbreaks are more likely to occur,\" Clemmons said. \nThe best way to protect children against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is to ensure they are up to date on vaccines, she said. \n\"Getting vaccines at the recommended ages protects children at the earliest age possible from serious vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Clemmons said. \nDr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\"The reason measles has come back is not because the virus has mutated. It's not because the vaccine isn't effective. It's because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\" said Offit, who wasn't involved with the study. Continued \nMeasles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \"It's now spreading from one American to another.\" \nOffit, however, doesn't expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \"We used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \"Measles was a scourge in this country.\" \nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it's the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \"It's the canary in the coal mine,\" he said. \nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found. \nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said. \nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States. \nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said. \nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed. \nOffit said it's not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines. \nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don't see and using biological fluids most people don't understand, he said. \n\"It's not surprising there's been pushback. Vaccines are a victim of their own success,\" Offit said. \nThe report was published as a letter in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .

In that timeframe, participants (who were about 45 years old, on average) underwent physical exams, and filled out lifestyle and medical questionnaires. Mental health assessments were also completed.\nThe Norwegian pollsters conducted a follow-up survey between 1995 and 1997 among roughly two-thirds of the original participants.\nAbout 7 percent of those tracked through 1997 had developed depression, while about 9 percent had developed clinical levels of anxiety, the findings showed.\nContinued Exercise did not appear to have any impact on anxiety risk. But investigators found that, regardless of gender or activity intensity, regular exercise lasting at least an hour per week was linked to a lower risk for developing depression over time.\nThe study authors calculated that roughly 12 percent of the depression cases might have been prevented if those who had become depressed had previously routinely engaged in one hour of low-intensity activity a week.\nExercising more than one hour per week did not, however, appear to substantially decrease depression risk even further; the lion's share of the protective impact appeared to max out at the one-hour mark.\nBut as to how and why such a minimal amount of regular exercise might help stave off depression, the study team wrote that \"the bulk of the observed protective effect remains unexplained.\" And the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and lower risk of depression.\nHarvey and his colleagues reported their observations in the Oct. 3 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry .\nSimon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said that \"there are probably many mechanisms at play that could explain how this works. But it doesn't have the same effect on anxiety, so we just don't know yet exactly what's happening.\"\nHowever, Rego added, \"What we do know is that what they've identified is a very low bar of entry. We're talking about just an hour of activity a week. And it doesn't have to be vigorous or intense. You don't need to go out to a spin class or sign up for a running club. This could just be getting people who aren't moving much to just increase their daily walking habit. That's all.\"\nSo, he explained, \"while we don't have all the definitive answers yet, this is a very promising finding because this is something many people may find easy to do.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alan mozes healthday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "simon rego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel harvey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "school of psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montefiore medical center/albert einstein college of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american journal of psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T07:03:13.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bf9ed37a557a7a4c984363134fb3661e6b3f5798", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OApKdUSK3KlWpn0UjoTMszxV0vjIZmGTnvpBkVwHEZDs8oNxOr3X51rUHGW6r0nubWo1JWjgNwQYV62kMW0sNC4-", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "https://www.webmd.com/default.htm", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD - Better information.

The awareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and overweight is not yet widespread,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC deputy director, said during a midday media briefing.\nThe 13 cancers include: brain cancer; multiple myeloma; cancer of the esophagus; postmenopausal breast cancer; cancers of the thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus and colon, the researchers said.\nSpeaking at the news conference, Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said early evidence indicates that losing weight can lower the risk for some cancers.\nAccording to the new report from the CDC and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, these 13 obesity-related cancers made up about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014.\nAlthough the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, increases in overweight and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress, the researchers said.\nOf the 630,000 Americans diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight or obesity in 2014, about two out of three occurred in adults aged 50 to 74, the researchers found.\nExcluding colon cancer, the rate of obesity-related cancer increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. During the same time, rates of non-obesity-related cancers dropped, the findings showed.\nIn 2013-2014, about two out of three American adults were overweight or obese, according to the report.\nFor the study, researchers analyzed 2014 cancer data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and data from 2005 to 2014.\nContinued Key findings include:\nOf all cancers, 55 percent in women and 24 percent in men were associated with overweight and obesity. Blacks and whites had higher rates of weight-related cancer than other racial or ethnic groups. Black men and American Indian/Alaska Native men had higher rates of cancer than white men. Cancers linked to obesity increased 7 percent between 2005 and 2014, but colon cancer decreased 23 percent. Screening for colon cancer is most likely the reason for that cancer's continued decline, Schuchat said. Cancers not linked to obesity dropped 13 percent. Except for colon cancer, cancers tied to overweight and obesity increased among those younger than 75. The new report was published online Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .\nDr. Farhad Islami is strategic director of cancer surveillance research for the American Cancer Society.\nHe said it's \"important to note that only a fraction of the cancers included in the calculation in this report are actually caused by excess body weight.\"\nAccording to Islami, \"many are attributable to other known risk factors, like smoking, while for many others, the cause is unknown. Obesity is more strongly associated with some cancers than others.\"\nThe World Cancer Research Fund estimates that \"20 percent of all cancers in the United States are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol, and poor nutrition. The American Cancer Society is currently doing its own extensive calculation of the numbers and proportions of cancer cases attributable to excess body weight, the results of which will be published soon,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven reinberg healthday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "farhad islami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schuchat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne schuchat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa richardson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "world cancer research fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cancer prevention and control", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national cancer institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T07:03:27.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5e8fd9b01ffe517cf210b5355d7c9ec82ca1e95", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ONEgjUWeDkhx9xxq_EBWU_i_VWzCl2l581fecTo3BSM956JhHj3.29pud4trBrRqdmJAp9crPeFaIlFloYKvCA..fL0nhIiSYA--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "https://www.webmd.com/default.htm", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD - Better information.

The drugs are potentially curing 13% to 22% of the 3 million to 5 million infected patients in the United States, the authors write.\nThe report predicts spending will continue to lessen in the next 5 years.\n\"The outlook for medicine spending through 2021 is for mid-single digit growth driven by further clusters of innovative treatments, offset by a rising impact from brands facing generic or biosimilar competition,\" the authors write.\nTop 10 Branded Medicines by Sales (in billions) Medicine 2012 2016 Humira (adalimumab; made by AbbVie) 4.5 13.6 Harvoni (ledipasvir and sofosbuvir; made by Gilead) 0.0 10.0 Enbrel (etanercept; made by Amgen) 4.2 7.4 Lantus Solostar (insulin glargine injection; made by Sanofi) 2.3 5.7 Remicade (infliximab; made by Janssen Biotech) 3.8 5.3 Januvia (sitagliptin; made by Merck) 2.6 4.8 Advair Diskus (fluticasone/salmeterol; made by GlaxoSmithKline) 4.6 4.7 Lyrica (pregabalin; made by Pfizer) 1.9 4.4 Crestor (rosuvastatin; made by AstraZeneca) 4.8 4.2 Neulasta (pegfilgrastim; made by Amgen)\u200e 3.4 4.2 Total U.S. market 317.8 450.0", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael kleinrock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray aitken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbvie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "janssen biotech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glaxosmithkline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pfizer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quintilesims institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astrazeneca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanofi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merck", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "januvia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pregabalin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:13:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8929ca461eb26cb67278ccad0703d9cf1d2d6c46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8J5xKEIBwXS4rkHB6ne7lDWi1NcfncDsbx9Ijp78ThAFp.vcAxqABxYfh1pwNurjVQm_5Vq__lr8811umUdbb89s0SldykivfzHHMheOJ30K2AfI5Y_std4KLgPtArVgQRtGs0JOCRp.", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Breast Cancer Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "title_full": "Breast Cancer Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 143, "comments": 0, "shares": 143}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8929ca461eb26cb67278ccad0703d9cf1d2d6c46", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8J5xKEIBwXS4rkHB6ne7lDWi1NcfncDsbx9Ijp78ThAFp.vcAxqABxYfh1pwNurjVQm_5Vq__lr8811umUdbb89s0SldykivfzHHMheOJ30K2AfI5Y_std4KLgPtArVgQRtGs0JOCRp.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breast Cancer Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives", "text": "By Mary Elizabeth Dallas HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- New research finds the number of American women who've lost their lives to breast cancer has fallen precipitously in the past 25 years, with more than 322,000 lives saved in that time.\nOverall, advances in care have led to a 39 percent drop in breast cancer deaths of between 1989 and 2015, according to new research from the American Cancer Society (ACS).\nOne specialist who works with breast cancer patients daily was heartened by the news.\n\"Early screening and better treatments are finally starting to pay off with better outcomes,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\nHowever, the ACS was quick to point out that not every segment of Americans benefited equally. Despite some closure of the racial \"gap\" in breast cancer survival, black women are still more likely to die of the disease than their white peers, the study found.\nEven though the rate of breast cancer diagnosis was slightly lower among black women than whites between 2010 and 2014, over about the same time period, black breast cancer patients were still 42 percent more likely to die of the disease than their white peers.\nAccording to breast cancer specialist Dr. Cynara Coomer, that's probably due to a combination of factors. Black patients are more prone to be affected by aggressive, tough-to-treat breast tumors, she noted. But they also often lack access to the targeted treatments that can best fight these tumors.\nSo, when it comes to surviving breast cancer, \"there remains a disparity between black women and white women across the country,\" said Coomer, who directs the Florina Rusi-Marke Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.\nThe vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed among women aged 50 and older, the ACS found, and older women account for most deaths from the disease as well.\nStill, race seemed to play a role here, as well. The median age of diagnosis for women overall in the United States is 62, but the disease tends to strike black women at a younger age, the report showed.\nContinued The median age for breast cancer deaths is 68, but black patients died younger -- at 62, on average.\nAll of this means that, overall, breast cancer kills more black women than white women in the United States.\nThere was reason to hope, however, because this health disparity may be stabilizing in some parts of the country, the ACS said. For example, breast cancer death rates among black women ranged from 22 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the report found.\nBut in seven states the researchers saw no significant difference in death rates between black and white patients -- showing that the racial gap can be closed.\nWhile genetics and differences in overall health play a big role in the survival gap between blacks and whites, so do \"social and structural factors,\" said Carol DeSantis, of the ACS's surveillance and health services research branch.\n\"Increasing access to health care to low-income populations\" might shrink this racial gap even further across the country, she explained.\nCoomer agreed, saying that black women with aggressive tumors, in particular, \"would be better served with health care teams or centers that provide comprehensive breast treatment.\"\nAccording to Bernik, progress is being made.\n\"The fact that we are finally seeing a close in the gap between our excellent outcomes between black and white women is also encouraging,\" she said, \"especially since black women are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancers.\"\nExcluding skin cancers, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women, trailing only lung cancer. It's estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and 40,610 will die from the disease.\nThe research was published Oct. 3 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Breast Cancer Facts & Figures .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mary elizabeth dallas healthday reporter", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coomer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie bernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carol desantis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cynara coomer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rusi-marke comprehensive breast center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staten island university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T08:13:51.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9f32fb9c8df916579d1d91ea13814cda60a05c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8FPL7yRJfldV7L5GkKwIwt0AGYj__o8bTALc7vGBLiUt.R3.RZ1tHASA9Xe682z1GQqCl43gvQG.ZRW.58BNEZ42KJVfWQo6IloucBvQPfjS", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "title_full": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 26, "comments": 0, "shares": 26}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 18}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9f32fb9c8df916579d1d91ea13814cda60a05c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8FPL7yRJfldV7L5GkKwIwt0AGYj__o8bTALc7vGBLiUt.R3.RZ1tHASA9Xe682z1GQqCl43gvQG.ZRW.58BNEZ42KJVfWQo6IloucBvQPfjS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steven Reinberg", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "text": "By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- There's a link between obesity and 40 percent of all the cancers diagnosed in the United States, health officials reported Tuesday.\nThat doesn't mean too much weight is causing all these cancer cases, just that there's some kind of still-to-be explained association, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nStill, the study findings suggest that being obese or overweight was associated with cancer cases involving more than 630,000 Americans in 2014, and this includes 13 types of cancer .\n\"That obesity and overweight are affecting cancers may be surprising to many Americans. The awareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and overweight is not yet widespread,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC deputy director, said during a midday media briefing.\nThe 13 cancers include: brain cancer; multiple myeloma; cancer of the esophagus; postmenopausal breast cancer; cancers of the thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus and colon, the researchers said. \nSpeaking at the news conference, Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said early evidence indicates that losing weight can lower the risk for some cancers.\nAccording to the new report from the CDC and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, these 13 obesity-related cancers made up about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014.\nAlthough the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, increases in overweight and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress, the researchers said.\nOf the 630,000 Americans diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight or obesity in 2014, about two out of three occurred in adults aged 50 to 74, the researchers found.\nExcluding colon cancer, the rate of obesity-related cancer increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. During the same time, rates of non-obesity-related cancers dropped, the findings showed.\nIn 2013-2014, about two out of three American adults were overweight or obese, according to the report.\nFor the study, researchers analyzed 2014 cancer data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and data from 2005 to 2014.\nContinued Key findings include:\nOf all cancers, 55 percent in women and 24 percent in men were associated with overweight and obesity. Blacks and whites had higher rates of weight-related cancer than other racial or ethnic groups. Black men and American Indian/Alaska Native men had higher rates of cancer than white men. Cancers linked to obesity increased 7 percent between 2005 and 2014, but colon cancer decreased 23 percent. Screening for colon cancer is most likely the reason for that cancer's continued decline, Schuchat said. Cancers not linked to obesity dropped 13 percent. Except for colon cancer, cancers tied to overweight and obesity increased among those younger than 75. The new report was published online Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .\nDr. Farhad Islami is strategic director of cancer surveillance research for the American Cancer Society.\nHe said it's \"important to note that only a fraction of the cancers included in the calculation in this report are actually caused by excess body weight.\"\nAccording to Islami, \"many are attributable to other known risk factors, like smoking, while for many others, the cause is unknown. Obesity is more strongly associated with some cancers than others.\"\nThe World Cancer Research Fund estimates that \"20 percent of all cancers in the United States are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol, and poor nutrition.

In that timeframe, participants (who were about 45 years old, on average) underwent physical exams, and filled out lifestyle and medical questionnaires. Mental health assessments were also completed.\nThe Norwegian pollsters conducted a follow-up survey between 1995 and 1997 among roughly two-thirds of the original participants.\nAbout 7 percent of those tracked through 1997 had developed depression, while about 9 percent had developed clinical levels of anxiety, the findings showed.\nContinued Exercise did not appear to have any impact on anxiety risk. But investigators found that, regardless of gender or activity intensity, regular exercise lasting at least an hour per week was linked to a lower risk for developing depression over time.\nThe study authors calculated that roughly 12 percent of the depression cases might have been prevented if those who had become depressed had previously routinely engaged in one hour of low-intensity activity a week.\nExercising more than one hour per week did not, however, appear to substantially decrease depression risk even further; the lion's share of the protective impact appeared to max out at the one-hour mark.\nBut as to how and why such a minimal amount of regular exercise might help stave off depression, the study team wrote that \"the bulk of the observed protective effect remains unexplained.\" And the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and lower risk of depression.\nHarvey and his colleagues reported their observations in the Oct. 3 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry .\nSimon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said that \"there are probably many mechanisms at play that could explain how this works. But it doesn't have the same effect on anxiety, so we just don't know yet exactly what's happening.\"\nHowever, Rego added, \"What we do know is that what they've identified is a very low bar of entry.

But New Yorkers are within 3.2 miles of a clinic, while Wyoming residents must travel nearly 170 miles to access these services, according to researchers from the Guttmacher Institute in New York City. \n\u201cHow far a woman has to travel for an abortion is a key measure of access, alongside stigma, restrictive laws and financial constraints,\u201d said study author Jonathan Bearak. \n\u201cOur findings illustrate the vast differences in access to abortion mapped across the U.S., with women in remote, rural areas facing the longest journeys for an abortion,\u201d Bearak added. \nThe study results were published Oct. 3 in The Lancet Public Health . \nLaws in 14 states require that women have in-person counseling followed by an 18- to 72-hour waiting period before an abortion, the researchers noted. This can pose a substantial barrier \u201cas women in these areas may also need to travel to and from the clinic twice,\u201d Bearak said in a journal news release. \nFor the study, researchers mapped the population of women of childbearing age and then looked at publicly accessible abortion clinics. They calculated how far the women would have to travel in each state and county. \nThe researchers found that on average in 2014: Women in 23 states were within 15 miles of a clinic. In 16 states, the average distance was within 29 miles, while women in eight states averaged 30 to 89 miles away from an abortion clinic. Some women in three states are more than 90 miles away from an abortion clinic. In remote areas of South Dakota, an abortion clinic could be more than 330 miles away. Between 2011 and 2014, the average distance to an abortion clinic increased by at least 30 miles for women living in remote counties in Texas, Iowa, Montana and Missouri. All of these states, except for Iowa, tightened laws restricting access to abortion, according to the study. On the flip side, the average distance to an abortion clinic for women in Kansas and Maine was significantly reduced. Continued \nNearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and 42 percent of these end in an abortion, the authors noted. \n\u201cThis study tells only part of the story. For women seeking specific types of providers, such as those who accept Medicaid, do abortions at later gestations, or are hospital-based, the distance might be even longer,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a commentary linked to the study. \n\u201cBecause provider availability decreases with each week of gestation, even a week\u2019s delay can reduce the number of providers substantially,\u201d Upadhyay wrote. \nWebMD News from HealthDay \nSOURCE: The Lancet Public Health , news release, Oct. 3, 2017 \nCopyright \u00a9 2013-2017 HealthDay.

HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- New research finds the number of American women who've lost their lives to breast cancer has fallen precipitously in the past 25 years, with more than 322,000 lives saved in that time.\nOverall, advances in care have led to a 39 percent drop in breast cancer deaths of between 1989 and 2015, according to new research from the American Cancer Society (ACS).\nOne specialist who works with breast cancer patients daily was heartened by the news.\n\"Early screening and better treatments are finally starting to pay off with better outcomes,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\nHowever, the ACS was quick to point out that not every segment of Americans benefited equally. Despite some closure of the racial \"gap\" in breast cancer survival, black women are still more likely to die of the disease than their white peers, the study found.\nEven though the rate of breast cancer diagnosis was slightly lower among black women than whites between 2010 and 2014, over about the same time period, black breast cancer patients were still 42 percent more likely to die of the disease than their white peers.\nAccording to breast cancer specialist Dr. Cynara Coomer, that's probably due to a combination of factors. Black patients are more prone to be affected by aggressive, tough-to-treat breast tumors, she noted. But they also often lack access to the targeted treatments that can best fight these tumors.\nSo, when it comes to surviving breast cancer, \"there remains a disparity between black women and white women across the country,\" said Coomer, who directs the Florina Rusi-Marke Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City.\nThe vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed among women aged 50 and older, the ACS found, and older women account for most deaths from the disease as well.\nStill, race seemed to play a role here, as well. The median age of diagnosis for women overall in the United States is 62, but the disease tends to strike black women at a younger age, the report showed.\nContinued The median age for breast cancer deaths is 68, but black patients died younger -- at 62, on average.\nAll of this means that, overall, breast cancer kills more black women than white women in the United States.\nThere was reason to hope, however, because this health disparity may be stabilizing in some parts of the country, the ACS said. For example, breast cancer death rates among black women ranged from 22 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the report found.\nBut in seven states the researchers saw no significant difference in death rates between black and white patients -- showing that the racial gap can be closed.\nWhile genetics and differences in overall health play a big role in the survival gap between blacks and whites, so do \"social and structural factors,\" said Carol DeSantis, of the ACS's surveillance and health services research branch.\n\"Increasing access to health care to low-income populations\" might shrink this racial gap even further across the country, she explained.\nCoomer agreed, saying that black women with aggressive tumors, in particular, \"would be better served with health care teams or centers that provide comprehensive breast treatment.\"\nAccording to Bernik, progress is being made.\n\"The fact that we are finally seeing a close in the gap between our excellent outcomes between black and white women is also encouraging,\" she said, \"especially since black women are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancers.\"\nExcluding skin cancers, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women, trailing only lung cancer. It's estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and 40,610 will die from the disease.\nThe research was published Oct. 3 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Breast Cancer Facts & Figures .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mary elizabeth dallas healthday reporter", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coomer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie bernik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carol desantis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cynara coomer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "acs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rusi-marke comprehensive breast center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "staten island university hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:26:53.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42e7dd83dee7d94b4f98f9f04dc14bc21c81e21e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OApKdUSK3KlWpn0UjoTMszxV0vjIZmGTnvpBkVwHEZDs8oNxOr3X51rUHGW6r0nubWo1JWjgNwQY1nyDpSfB1LfJuZm2_AL6A3TLtHS4DlOj", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "title_full": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 25, "comments": 0, "shares": 25}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 18}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42e7dd83dee7d94b4f98f9f04dc14bc21c81e21e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OApKdUSK3KlWpn0UjoTMszxV0vjIZmGTnvpBkVwHEZDs8oNxOr3X51rUHGW6r0nubWo1JWjgNwQY1nyDpSfB1LfJuZm2_AL6A3TLtHS4DlOj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steven Reinberg", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer", "text": "By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- There's a link between obesity and 40 percent of all the cancers diagnosed in the United States, health officials reported Tuesday.\nThat doesn't mean too much weight is causing all these cancer cases, just that there's some kind of still-to-be explained association, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nStill, the study findings suggest that being obese or overweight was associated with cancer cases involving more than 630,000 Americans in 2014, and this includes 13 types of cancer .\n\"That obesity and overweight are affecting cancers may be surprising to many Americans. The awareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and overweight is not yet widespread,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC deputy director, said during a midday media briefing.\nThe 13 cancers include: brain cancer; multiple myeloma; cancer of the esophagus; postmenopausal breast cancer; cancers of the thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus and colon, the researchers said. \nSpeaking at the news conference, Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said early evidence indicates that losing weight can lower the risk for some cancers.\nAccording to the new report from the CDC and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, these 13 obesity-related cancers made up about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014.\nAlthough the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, increases in overweight and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress, the researchers said.\nOf the 630,000 Americans diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight or obesity in 2014, about two out of three occurred in adults aged 50 to 74, the researchers found.\nExcluding colon cancer, the rate of obesity-related cancer increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. During the same time, rates of non-obesity-related cancers dropped, the findings showed.\nIn 2013-2014, about two out of three American adults were overweight or obese, according to the report.\nFor the study, researchers analyzed 2014 cancer data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and data from 2005 to 2014.\nContinued Key findings include:\nOf all cancers, 55 percent in women and 24 percent in men were associated with overweight and obesity. Blacks and whites had higher rates of weight-related cancer than other racial or ethnic groups. Black men and American Indian/Alaska Native men had higher rates of cancer than white men. Cancers linked to obesity increased 7 percent between 2005 and 2014, but colon cancer decreased 23 percent. Screening for colon cancer is most likely the reason for that cancer's continued decline, Schuchat said. Cancers not linked to obesity dropped 13 percent. Except for colon cancer, cancers tied to overweight and obesity increased among those younger than 75. The new report was published online Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .\nDr. Farhad Islami is strategic director of cancer surveillance research for the American Cancer Society.\nHe said it's \"important to note that only a fraction of the cancers included in the calculation in this report are actually caused by excess body weight.\"\nAccording to Islami, \"many are attributable to other known risk factors, like smoking, while for many others, the cause is unknown. Obesity is more strongly associated with some cancers than others.\"\nThe World Cancer Research Fund estimates that \"20 percent of all cancers in the United States are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol, and poor nutrition.

But New Yorkers are within 3.2 miles of a clinic, while Wyoming residents must travel nearly 170 miles to access these services, according to researchers from the Guttmacher Institute in New York City.\n\"How far a woman has to travel for an abortion is a key measure of access, alongside stigma, restrictive laws and financial constraints,\" said study author Jonathan Bearak.\n\"Our findings illustrate the vast differences in access to abortion mapped across the U.S., with women in remote, rural areas facing the longest journeys for an abortion,\" Bearak added.\nThe study results were published Oct. 3 in The Lancet Public Health .\nLaws in 14 states require that women have in-person counseling followed by an 18- to 72-hour waiting period before an abortion, the researchers noted. This can pose a substantial barrier \"as women in these areas may also need to travel to and from the clinic twice,\" Bearak said in a journal news release.\nFor the study, researchers mapped the population of women of childbearing age and then looked at publicly accessible abortion clinics. They calculated how far the women would have to travel in each state and county.\nThe researchers found that on average in 2014:\nWomen in 23 states were within 15 miles of a clinic. In 16 states, the average distance was within 29 miles, while women in eight states averaged 30 to 89 miles away from an abortion clinic. Some women in three states are more than 90 miles away from an abortion clinic. In remote areas of South Dakota, an abortion clinic could be more than 330 miles away. Between 2011 and 2014, the average distance to an abortion clinic increased by at least 30 miles for women living in remote counties in Texas, Iowa, Montana and Missouri.

Infants and young children were hit hardest, and most cases were among the unvaccinated, the research showed.\nThe findings suggest that, \"being unvaccinated rather than failure of vaccine is the main driver of measles spread,\" said lead researcher Nakia Clemmons, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe good news is that most parents are still protecting their children from measles by getting them the measles- mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine , she said.\n\"Thanks to high vaccination rates, measles cases among Americans has remained rare since the disease was eliminated,\" Clemmons said.\nMeasles outbreaks, however, can and do still occur in the United States, she said.\n\"Measles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world.

When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people, outbreaks are more likely to occur,\" Clemmons said.\nThe best way to protect children against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is to ensure they are up to date on vaccines, she said.\n\"Getting vaccines at the recommended ages protects children at the earliest age possible from serious vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Clemmons said.\nDr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\"The reason measles has come back is not because the virus has mutated. It's not because the vaccine isn't effective. It's because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\" said Offit, who wasn't involved with the study.\nContinued Measles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \"It's now spreading from one American to another.\"\nOffit, however, doesn't expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \"We used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \"Measles was a scourge in this country.\"\nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it's the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \"It's the canary in the coal mine,\" he said.\nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated.\nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found.\nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said.\nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States.\nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said.\nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed.\nOffit said it's not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines.\nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don't see and using biological fluids most people don't understand, he said.\n\"It's not surprising there's been pushback. Vaccines are a victim of their own success,\" Offit said.\nThe report was published as a letter in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steven reinberg healthday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul offit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "offit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemmons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nakia clemmons", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mmr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vaccine education center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:26:53.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f52c987aa0ad917a7dc0f72cf1282c9721f9556", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OIRlVhSPJLMofY4G.gfvtP8mHYQAq.b2FCMsX.tTOG6eCe08bE2DZRpw2nHT_PF_WNC5WW60UVf9jRGBr3Hca7CaNSuSBGWESBx7M283VlTgZC3C12arcNqUgE42e1aHckDCLKifq2.N", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "title_full": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f52c987aa0ad917a7dc0f72cf1282c9721f9556", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OIRlVhSPJLMofY4G.gfvtP8mHYQAq.b2FCMsX.tTOG6eCe08bE2DZRpw2nHT_PF_WNC5WW60UVf9jRGBr3Hca7CaNSuSBGWESBx7M283VlTgZC3C12arcNqUgE42e1aHckDCLKifq2.N", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan Mozes", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Moving Just 1 Hour a Week May Curb Depression Risk", "text": "By Alan Mozes HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Career couch potatoes, take heart : Just one hour a week of any kind of exercise may lower your long-term risk for depression , new research suggests.\nThe finding comes from a fresh analysis of a Norwegian survey that tracked exercise habits, along with depression and anxiety risk, among nearly 34,000 adults.\nAfter a closer look at the data, a team of British, Australian and Norwegian analysts determined that people who engage in just an hour of exercise per week -- regardless of intensity level -- face a 44 percent lower risk for developing depression over the course of a decade than those who never exercise at all.\n\"The key finding from this study is that doing even a small amount of regular exercise seems to protect adults against future depression ,\" said study author Samuel Harvey. \n\"This was not a case of more is better; the vast majority of the mental health benefits of exercise was realized when individuals moved from doing no regular activity to 1 or 2 hours per week,\" Harvey explained.\n\"Also, the mental health benefits were there regardless of the intensity of the physical activity,\" he added. \"There is great evidence that there are many physical health benefits to more regular exercise, but the mental health benefits leveled out after 2 hours.\" \nHarvey is an associate professor with the School of Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. \"The important point here is that any type of physical activity -- even just walking -- had similar levels of mental health benefits,\" he concluded.\nThe original survey was launched between 1984 and 1986. In that timeframe, participants (who were about 45 years old, on average) underwent physical exams, and filled out lifestyle and medical questionnaires. Mental health assessments were also completed.\nThe Norwegian pollsters conducted a follow-up survey between 1995 and 1997 among roughly two-thirds of the original participants.\nAbout 7 percent of those tracked through 1997 had developed depression, while about 9 percent had developed clinical levels of anxiety, the findings showed.\nContinued Exercise did not appear to have any impact on anxiety risk. But investigators found that, regardless of gender or activity intensity, regular exercise lasting at least an hour per week was linked to a lower risk for developing depression over time.\nThe study authors calculated that roughly 12 percent of the depression cases might have been prevented if those who had become depressed had previously routinely engaged in one hour of low-intensity activity a week.\nExercising more than one hour per week did not, however, appear to substantially decrease depression risk even further; the lion's share of the protective impact appeared to max out at the one-hour mark.\nBut as to how and why such a minimal amount of regular exercise might help stave off depression, the study team wrote that \"the bulk of the observed protective effect remains unexplained.\" And the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and lower risk of depression.\nHarvey and his colleagues reported their observations in the Oct. 3 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry .\nSimon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said that \"there are probably many mechanisms at play that could explain how this works. But it doesn't have the same effect on anxiety, so we just don't know yet exactly what's happening.\"\nHowever, Rego added, \"What we do know is that what they've identified is a very low bar of entry. We're talking about just an hour of activity a week. And it doesn't have to be vigorous or intense. You don't need to go out to a spin class or sign up for a running club. This could just be getting people who aren't moving much to just increase their daily walking habit. That's all.\"\nSo, he explained, \"while we don't have all the definitive answers yet, this is a very promising finding because this is something many people may find easy to do.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alan mozes healthday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "simon rego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel harvey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "school of psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montefiore medical center/albert einstein college of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american journal of psychiatry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T21:26:53.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "740967434b797a0b9e6ca50dda44c2ae854f09ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OL3W7vP9O6u66hRZbW_EowbbdywQflZ2vML_jRS0TaExqGI5l.GPdtI2yCQ9wjTIxM2Dcv2NbP0vjpJF9bJhLwJwZsGIh60mWiInzB4k18mprozE9Vjzlk7p67pK9J_Z0.Ju9weWiddEX9uQ4Xs57QY-", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Testing 30-Day Death Risk From Heart Failure", "title_full": "Testing 30-Day Death Risk From Heart Failure", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "740967434b797a0b9e6ca50dda44c2ae854f09ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OL3W7vP9O6u66hRZbW_EowbbdywQflZ2vML_jRS0TaExqGI5l.GPdtI2yCQ9wjTIxM2Dcv2NbP0vjpJF9bJhLwJwZsGIh60mWiInzB4k18mprozE9Vjzlk7p67pK9J_Z0.Ju9weWiddEX9uQ4Xs57QY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert Preidt", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Testing 30-Day Death Risk From Heart Failure", "text": "By Robert Preidt HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers say they've developed a simple tool that predicts the 30-day risk of death for acute heart failure patients treated in the emergency department.\nHeart failure means that the heart isn't pumping as effectively as it should. Acute episodes of heart failure account for more than 1 million hospitalizations each in the United States and Europe a year.\nSpanish Ministry of Health researchers led by Oscar Miro of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona used 13 factors to assess death risk in these patients.

In this new research, scientists honed in on the microorganisms that would be living in close quarters with crews aboard spacecraft. \nResearchers from Germany, the United Kingdom and Austria, led by the German Aerospace Center, enlisted a crew of six male \"Marsonauts.\" They lived inside a mock spacecraft in Moscow from June 2010 to November 2011. \nDuring the mock Mars mission, the researchers monitored how the composition of bacteria changed over time. What they found was that the diversity of germs dropped dramatically during the equivalent of a space flight to Mars. \n\"Until now, little was known about the influence of long-term confinement on the microorganisms that live inside habitats that may one day be used to travel to other planets, and whether the structure of the microbiota changes with time,\" said study author Petra Schwendner, from the University of Edinburgh. \n\"Ours is the first comprehensive long-time study that investigates the microbial load, diversity and dynamics in a closed habitat -- a mock-up spacecraft -- for 520 days, the full duration of a simulated flight to Mars,\" she said. \nDuring the mock mission, the crew never left the closed habitat. They were also subjected to a regimented lifestyle that future Mars astronauts will face. This involved a strict diet and schedule, which included cleaning the habitat and conducting scientific experiments. \nThe crew also collected 360 microbial samples from the air and various surfaces at 18 intervals. \nThe study showed communal areas, sleep areas, the gym, and the bathroom had the greatest volume and diversity of bacteria while the medical space had the least. \nThe researchers noted, however, that microbial diversity aboard the \"spacecraft\" declined dramatically during the mission. \nThe findings were published Oct. 3 in the journal Microbiome . Continued \n\"In addition to potential health risks for the crew, some of these microorganisms could have a negative impact on spacecraft, as they grow on and might damage spacecraft material,\" Schwendner said in a journal news release. \n\"To ensure the systems' stability, countermeasures may be required to avoid development of highly resistant, adapted microorganisms, and a complete loss of microbial [germ} diversity,\" she said. \nThe crew was the main source of human-associated bacteria within the habitat, but the prolonged confinement seemed to have the most significant effect on the bacterial community, the researchers found. \nThe study authors suggested their findings provide insight on habitat maintenance and could help scientists develop strategies to ensure a healthy environment for astronauts during future deep space missions.

But New Yorkers are within 3.2 miles of a clinic, while Wyoming residents must travel nearly 170 miles to access these services, according to researchers from the Guttmacher Institute in New York City. \n\"How far a woman has to travel for an abortion is a key measure of access, alongside stigma, restrictive laws and financial constraints,\" said study author Jonathan Bearak. \n\"Our findings illustrate the vast differences in access to abortion mapped across the U.S., with women in remote, rural areas facing the longest journeys for an abortion,\" Bearak added. \nThe study results were published Oct. 3 in The Lancet Public Health . \nLaws in 14 states require that women have in-person counseling followed by an 18- to 72-hour waiting period before an abortion, the researchers noted. This can pose a substantial barrier \"as women in these areas may also need to travel to and from the clinic twice,\" Bearak said in a journal news release. \nFor the study, researchers mapped the population of women of childbearing age and then looked at publicly accessible abortion clinics. They calculated how far the women would have to travel in each state and county. \nThe researchers found that on average in 2014: Women in 23 states were within 15 miles of a clinic. In 16 states, the average distance was within 29 miles, while women in eight states averaged 30 to 89 miles away from an abortion clinic. Some women in three states are more than 90 miles away from an abortion clinic. In remote areas of South Dakota, an abortion clinic could be more than 330 miles away. Between 2011 and 2014, the average distance to an abortion clinic increased by at least 30 miles for women living in remote counties in Texas, Iowa, Montana and Missouri. All of these states, except for Iowa, tightened laws restricting access to abortion, according to the study. On the flip side, the average distance to an abortion clinic for women in Kansas and Maine was significantly reduced. Continued \nNearly half of pregnancies in the United States are unintended, and 42 percent of these end in an abortion, the authors noted. \n\"This study tells only part of the story. For women seeking specific types of providers, such as those who accept Medicaid , do abortions at later gestations, or are hospital-based, the distance might be even longer,\" said Ushma Upadhyay, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, in a commentary linked to the study. \n\"Because provider availability decreases with each week of gestation, even a week's delay can reduce the number of providers substantially,\" Upadhyay wrote.

But over the past 15 years, the disease has gained a new foothold in the United States, likely due to parents choosing not to vaccinate their children, a new study suggests. \nFrom 2001 to 2015 measles cases in the United States remained very low (less than 1 case per million people), but there\u2019s still been a signficant rise, the study found. \nOverall, measles incidence doubled \u2014 from 0.28 per million in 2001 to 0.56 per million in 2015. Infants and young children were hit hardest, and most cases were among the unvaccinated, the research showed. \nThe findings suggest that, \u201cbeing unvaccinated rather than failure of vaccine is the main driver of measles spread,\u201d said lead researcher Nakia Clemmons, an epidemiologist at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThe good news is that most parents are still protecting their children from measles by getting them the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, she said. \n\u201cThanks to high vaccination rates, measles cases among Americans has remained rare since the disease was eliminated,\u201d Clemmons said. \nMeasles outbreaks, however, can and do still occur in the United States, she said. \n\u201cMeasles is still commonly transmitted in many parts of the world. Unvaccinated U.S. residents returning from overseas travel and foreign visitors to the U.S. may develop measles and expose people in United States. When measles gets into communities of unvaccinated people, outbreaks are more likely to occur,\u201d Clemmons said. \nThe best way to protect children against measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases is to ensure they are up to date on vaccines, she said. \n\u201cGetting vaccines at the recommended ages protects children at the earliest age possible from serious vaccine-preventable diseases,\u201d Clemmons said. \nDr. Paul Offit is director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. \n\u201cThe reason measles has come back is not because the virus has mutated. It\u2019s not because the vaccine isn\u2019t effective. It\u2019s because a critical number of parents have chosen not to vaccinate their children,\u201d said Offit, who wasn\u2019t involved with the study. Continued \nMeasles is now endemic in the United States at a very low level, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now spreading from one American to another.\u201d \nOffit, however, doesn\u2019t expect that measles will reach the epidemic proportions it once had. \u201cWe used to have 3 to 4 million cases a year, 48,000 hospitalizations and 500 deaths a year, he said. \u201cMeasles was a scourge in this country.\u201d \nSince measles is the most contagious of all the vaccine-preventable diseases, it makes sense it\u2019s the disease to come back first. It could be the harbinger of the return of other diseases, Offit said. \u201cIt\u2019s the canary in the coal mine,\u201d he said. \nUsing data from the CDC, the researchers looked at the number of measles cases in the United States that occurred after the disease was nearly eradicated. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, nearly 1,800 cases of measles were reported. People who suffered from the disease were an average of 15 years old and nearly half were girls, the researchers found. \nNearly 70 percent of those who came down with measles were not vaccinated. It was unknown if another 18 percent who contracted measles had been vaccinated or not, Clemmons said. \nAbout 27 percent of measles cases were imported from other countries; the rest were acquired in the United States. \nMeasles was most likely to affect infants ages 6 to 11 months and toddlers 12 to 15 months. The rate of measles started to drop beginning at 16 months, the researchers said. \nThe number of measles cases each year varied between 24 and 658, the study showed. \nOffit said it\u2019s not unusual for parents to be wary of vaccines. \nKids are subjected to 26 different vaccinations and as many as five shots at one time to prevent diseases most people don\u2019t see and using biological fluids most people don\u2019t understand, he said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising there\u2019s been pushback. Vaccines are a victim of their own success,\u201d Offit said. \nThe report was published as a letter in the Oct. 3 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association . \nWebMD News from HealthDay Sources \nSOURCES: Nakia Clemmons, MPH, epidemiologist, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Paul Offit, M.D., director, Vaccine Education Center, Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia; Oct. 3, 2017, Journal of the American Medical Association \nCopyright \u00a9 2013-2017 HealthDay.

It also found that nearly 6 percent of teens reported having more than one concussion . \nThese findings show that the number of middle school and high school students who will suffer a concussion in their lifetime is greater than thought, said lead researcher Phil Veliz. \n\"The prevalence of concussions may be much higher than what is reported from emergency room data,\" said Veliz, a research assistant professor at the University of Michigan. \n\"Participation in contact sports shows a strong association with reporting a diagnosed concussion,\" he added. \nThese findings suggest a greater need for prevention efforts in schools and communities, \"particularly with respect to interscholastic sports and youth sport organizations that operate outside the school environment,\" Veliz said. \nHowever, at least one specialist questioned the findings because of the study design. \nDr. John Kuluz is director of traumatic brain injury and neurorehabilitation at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami. His first concern is that the question about concussion was only added to the survey in 2016, so it's not possible to see if a trend exists or to compare it with previous years, he noted. \nSecond, the report asked participants to report diagnosed concussions, but isn't clear who made the diagnoses, he said. \nFinally, self-reported data is always suspect, because it's subjective, Kuluz said. It relies on participants to remember and report accurately, which is not always the case, he noted. \nFor the study, Veliz and his colleagues collected data from more than 13,000 boys and girls in grades 8, 10 and 12, who took part in the 2016 Monitoring the Future survey. \nThe survey is done annually in schools across the country. \nFor the first time, last year's survey included the question: \"Have you ever had a head injury that was diagnosed as a concussion?\" Continued \nThe survey also took into account variables such as gender, race and ethnicity, grade level, and participation in sports within the past year. \nThe researchers found that 19.5 percent of the teens said they had had at least one diagnosed concussion in their lifetime. Fourteen percent reported one diagnosed concussion, and 5.5 percent reported being diagnosed with a concussion more than once. \nFactors that increased the odds of a concussion included being male, white, in a higher grade and participating in competitive sports, the findings showed. \nTaking part in contact sports -- such as football -- significantly increased the risk of a concussion. About 11 percent of those participating in contact sports reported more than one concussion. \nKuluz said that many concussions are never diagnosed because their symptoms are so mild they aren't noticed. \nBut concussions can be serious and need a doctor's care, he explained. \n\"After a head injury, coaches and parents should suspect a concussion when a child starts having headaches, blurry or changed vision, balance problems, and if they have lost consciousness,\" Kuluz said. \nThe report was published Sept. 26 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). \nLong-term damage caused by repeated blows to the head has garnered much attention in recent years. A study published in July in JAMA said chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) -- a condition that can mimic Alzheimer's disease -- was found in 99 percent of brains donated by 111 former NFL players.

The survey also found that one in three people said another person whose care they were closely involved with had experienced a medical error. \nMost medical errors were associated with diagnosis and patient-provider communications. Outpatient settings were a common site of medical errors. \nOn average, respondents who experienced a medical error identified at least seven different factors that caused the error. Nearly half of those who noted an error told medical staff or other workers at the health care facility about it. \nMost people feel that health care providers have the prime responsibility for patient safety. But survey participants also said that patients and their families have a role, too. \nStill, most people said they didn't worry personally about patient safety, the survey found. \nWhen medical errors occur, they often have lasting impact on the patient's physical and emotional health, finances, or family relationships. \nThe survey was done by the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute and NORC at the University of Chicago. \n\"The survey results show that Americans recognize that patient safety is a critically important, but complex, issue,\" Dr. Tejal Gandhi, chief clinical and safety officer, IHI, and president of the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute, said in an organization news release.

People with diabetes don't have enough insulin to cover their bodies' basic needs for the hormone.\nThe researchers thought by mapping the genetic makeup of insulinoma tumors, they might come up with the genomic recipe for regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin. And if they could use that \"recipe\" to make a drug that would trigger the body to make insulin, they could treat -- or possibly even reverse -- diabetes.\nThe study's senior author, Dr. Andrew Stewart, said the researchers have mapped approximately 90 insulinoma tumors at this point, but only 38 were included in the current study.\n\"We have an actual wiring diagram in molecular terms for beta cell replication, and there are different mutation patterns that lead to beta cell regeneration. We've found about 30 different pathways,\" said Stewart.\nHe directs the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\nStewart said it wasn't a complete surprise to see that there were multiple pathways, instead of just one or two. For example, he said, there isn't just one set of molecules that makes growth plates during childhood.\n\"We found many additional pathways... This is a data mine for diabetes researchers,\" he said.\nInsulin, which is made in the pancreas, is used to usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as energy.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin, and may not make enough insulin. About 29 million people in the United States have this type of diabetes, which is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to mistakenly destroy insulin-producing beta cells. People with type 1 diabetes must replace that lost insulin through injections or an insulin pump. Approximately 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.\nContinued With the information from this new study, the researchers hope to find or develop drugs that could work on one of those newly identified pathways. But it's important that the pathway doesn't have any other serious effects.\nStewart and his colleagues published a study in Nature Medicine in 2015 showing how the drug harmine could prompt beta cell regeneration in the lab and in mice. The pathway linked to harmine was one of the ones found in the current paper, too.\nBut \"harmine is a hallucinogen,\" Stewart said.\nSo, if taken as a pill or given as a shot, it would affect the whole body and produce unwanted side effects.\n\"We still need a way to deliver it specifically to the beta cells,\" said Stewart.\nThere's also a concern that a drug like an insulinoma could cause the body to produce too much insulin, leading to potentially dangerous side effects.\nAndrew Rakeman is assistant vice president of research for JDRF -- formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\"You don't want to replicate the lack of control of an insulinoma. The question is can we find ways to switch these pathways on and then switch them off?\" said Rakeman, who wasn't involved in the new study.\nHe also pointed out that it's important that any drug just targets the beta cells and doesn't encourage cell growth in other areas.\nStewart said a therapy developed from these pathways would likely be for people with type 2 diabetes first. People with type 1 diabetes have the added issue of the autoimmune attack, which could destroy any newly made cells.\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, some sort of immune system suppression might be necessary, Stewart said. Rakeman said it's possible repeated treatments might keep enough beta cells alive to be effective, though that remains to be seen.\nFor now, Stewart and Rakeman said these findings are hopeful.\n\"Amazing things are happening in the world of beta cell regeneration,\" Stewart said.\nRakeman agreed. \"We understand much more about what's happening with beta cells. We can take those lessons and build out therapeutic targets,\" he said.\nContinued The study was published Oct. 3 in the journal Nature Communications .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T18:44:44.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c80dc8b2e3ba18cb48712bc0d376047fd3be143", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8GeFg2Ev2XoU5Wgq5F8aci6lP79s2bd0ExkMzQtbosnTBdaPR47QozCOQt_ZwGPYatm309L8jQbp3EC9zcrb7kh2ERFPeKKzWX3qBF4Ve1avRJcrlP_ykcI-", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Melatonin Sales Skyrocket, But Is Sleep Aid Safe?", "title_full": "Melatonin Sales Skyrocket, But Is Sleep Aid Safe?", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/video/melatonin_sleep_video/650x350_melatonin_sleep_video.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16, "comments": 0, "shares": 16}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c80dc8b2e3ba18cb48712bc0d376047fd3be143", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8GeFg2Ev2XoU5Wgq5F8aci6lP79s2bd0ExkMzQtbosnTBdaPR47QozCOQt_ZwGPYatm309L8jQbp3EC9zcrb7kh2ERFPeKKzWX3qBF4Ve1avRJcrlP_ykcI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brunilda  Nazario, MD", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Melatonin Sales Skyrocket, But Is Sleep Aid Safe?", "text": "Oct. 5, 2017 -- Walk the vitamin aisle of your local grocery store and you\u2019ll find everything from flavored teas and mouth sprays to raspberry gummies and animal-shaped chews, all containing the purported sleep aide melatonin . In all, U.S. consumers will spend more than $437 million on melatonin supplements in 2017, up from $159 million in 2010, according to Nutrition Business Journal . More than 3 million adults and a half-million children take it, and that number is expected to grow as more sleep -deprived families clamor for cheap \u201cnatural\u201d remedies.\nBut with such growth also come concerns that consumers have an oversimplified view of the potent, complex hormone . Taken at the right time, in the right dose, it can, indeed, repair a sleep schedule thrown off kilter by jet lag, a long weekend filled with late nights, or certain circadian rhythm disorders .\nBut for insomnia that happens now and then, research shows its effectiveness is limited. And some fear that if misused, it may do harm.\nExperts also question how safe it is for children. Australian experts called the increase in use among children \u201calarming\u201d and warned in 2015 that parents shouldn\u2019t give it to their children.\n\u201cA lot of people just take it right before they go to bed as if it were a sleeping pill,\u201d says Michael Breus, PhD, a California-based clinical psychologist who specializes in sleep disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\nWorks for Some, Not for Others Discovered in 1958, melatonin is a potent hormone naturally produced in the body to help regulate our circadian rhythm, or natural body clock. Light is the switch that controls it: As daylight fades, levels of melatonin begin to rise about 2 hours before bedtime, nudging us to become sleepy. In the morning, when light hits the eyes, it signals the brain to halt melatonin production, and we grow alert.\n\u201cMelatonin is a sleep regulator, not a sleep initiator,\u201d explains Breus, author of \u201cGood Night: The Doctor\u2019s 4-week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health.\u201d \nSince the 1980s, dietary supplement makers have billed melatonin made in a lab as a promising sleep aid. But its effects on occasional insomnia aren't impressive.\nOne review of 15 studies involving 284 subjects found that those who took melatonin before bed fell asleep just 3.9 minutes faster on average and slept 13 minutes longer. Another, of 19 studies involving 1,700 people, found melatonin users fell asleep 7 minutes faster on average and slept 8 minutes longer.\n\u201cWhen you are already making melatonin naturally at night, taking a little bit more exogenously is kind of like spitting in the ocean. It doesn\u2019t do much,\u201d says Cathy Goldstein, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Sleep Medicine Clinic. \u201cFor general insomnia, I think it\u2019s a waste of money.\u201d\nAlfred Lewy, MD, professor emeritus at Oregon Health & Science University and a pioneer in melatonin research, says he has found that a larger dose (3 mg) can promote sleep, but only in about one-third of people who take it. \u201cIt works for some people, but not for others. You just have to try it and find out which one you are.\u201d\nExperts do agree that melatonin can have a big effect on treating circadian rhythm disorders like delayed sleep phase disorder (extreme night owls), advanced sleep phase disorder (extreme morning larks), or shift work disorder. In these cases, the body makes melatonin too late or too early, creating a mismatch between when the person should sleep and when they feel like it.\n\u201cSay you are an extreme night owl who only begins to feel sleepy at 4 a.m. and likes to sleep until noon. You could take low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg) at 11 p.m., well before your natural melatonin kicks in. Not only will it help you feel sleepy earlier, it will start to pull your internal clock earlier too,\u201d explains Goldstein.\nMelatonin also works great for jet lag from eastward travel, says Breus, who recommends taking 0.5 mg of melatonin 90 minutes before bedtime in the place you\u2019re traveling to.\nAfter a weekend of staying up late and sleeping in, a low (0.3 mg) dose of melatonin late Sunday afternoon can also help you get to sleep at a regular hour and avoid the \u201cMonday morning blues\u201d that often happen when your days off disrupt your body clock, says Lewy. (Caution: If you are one of those people melatonin makes sleepy, don\u2019t drive after taking it).\nHis research also suggests that for some patients, as little as 0.3 mg of melatonin daily in the late afternoon may ease symptoms of winter depression brought on by shorter days and shifting circadian rhythms. But because a small number of people respond better when taking the melatonin in the morning, he only recommends its use for this purpose under a doctor\u2019s guidance.\n\u201cThe challenge with melatonin is that it\u2019s complicated. If you take it at the wrong time, it can shift your body clock in the wrong direction, and that can cause problems,\u201d Lewy says.\nSafety Concerns on the Rise While short-term use (a few months or less) of melatonin is thought to be safe in healthy adults, it can boost blood sugar, so it is not recommended for people with diabetes, Goldstein says. Taking too much can also lead to bad dreams and grogginess the next day, and it can make many drugs less effective, including high blood pressure medications, seizure medications, and birth control pills, Breus says.\nBecause dietary supplements are not regulated as much as prescription drugs, quality can vary wildly from bottle to bottle. One recent study found that 71% of melatonin supplements surveyed did not contain exactly what they said on the label. Some had more than four times as much melatonin as indicated, and 26% contained the powerful neurotransmitter serotonin, a chemical found in many antidepressant medications.\nWhen it comes to children\u2019s use, concerns abound.\nThe American Association of Poison Control Centers reports that calls about melatonin have skyrocketed 114% nationwide since 2012, with 79% of the 24,000 calls in 2016 involving children. Parents often call poison control after their children have taken it unintentionally or taken too much. That can lead to nausea, diarrhea, headaches, changes in mood, lasting sleepiness the next day, and bedwetting, experts say.\nExperts are also not sure if using melatonin would harm children.\nWe really don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s safe to take long-term.\nathy Goldstein, MD, assistant professor of neurology, University of Michigan Sleep Medicine Clinic In 2015, researchers from Australia published a study pointing to research that linked melatonin use on rodents to changes in puberty. The report also notes that in the early 1990s, scientists were looking into high doses of melatonin as possible human birth control because of the way it could affect the reproductive system.\nThe findings were in animals, and no research to date has shown similar effects in children.\n\"Considering the small advances melatonin provides to the timing of sleep, and considering what we know about how melatonin works in the body, it is not worth the risk to child and adolescent safety,\" warned lead author David Kennaway, head of the Circadian Physiology Laboratory at the University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute.\nSome research has shown that children with developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have low nighttime melatonin levels that may help cause poor sleep patterns. If it's well-timed and under the supervision of a doctor, melatonin may help normalize their sleep and daytime behavior, Breus notes.\nBut as a sleep aid for healthy but restless youth?\n\u201cI would never use it,\u201d he says.\nThere are no studies, however, that say melatonin is unsafe for kids.\nBut for adults with body clocks thrown off for one reason or another, it is absolutely worth trying, they say.\nJust choose your brand wisely, keep your dose well under 3 mg to avoid bad side effects, and once your sleep schedule is back on track, stop taking it.\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s safe to take long-term,\u201d says Goldstein.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists have pinpointed a mechanism that helps flu viruses mutate rapidly, which could lead to new ways to fight the flu .\nBecause flu viruses mutate quickly, flu vaccines have to be redesigned every year.\nThe MIT researchers found that to mutate rapidly, flu viruses use a group of proteins called chaperones in infected cells in the host (a person or animal with the flu).\nBlocking flu viruses from using the host cells' chaperones could help prevent the viruses from developing resistance to existing drugs and vaccines , the study authors said.\n\"It's relatively easy to make a drug that kills a virus, or an antibody that stops a virus from propagating, but it's very hard to make one that the virus doesn't promptly escape from once you start using it,\" senior study author Matthew Shoulders, an associate professor of chemistry, said in an MIT news release.\n\"Our data suggest that, at some point in the future, targeting host chaperones might restrict the ability of a virus to evolve and allow us to kill viruses before they become drug-resistant,\" he said.\nThe study was published recently in the journal

\nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Bypassing leafy green veggies could take a toll on teens ' heart health , new research suggests.\nTeens who ate the least vitamin K -rich foods -- such as spinach, cabbage, iceberg lettuce and olive oil -- had triple the risk for enlargement of the heart 's left pumping chamber compared to their greens -eating peers, according to the study.\nChanges in the heart's left pumping chamber are usually seen in adults with chronic high blood pressure . Hearts that become bigger are less efficient and less effective, said the study authors from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\n\"Those who consumed less [vitamin K] had more risk,\" Dr. Norman Pollock, the study's corresponding author, said in a university news release.\nFor the study, researchers asked 766 healthy teens, aged 14 to 18, to wear activity monitors for seven days and to record what they ate. Most participants tracked their diet for at least six days. The teens also underwent an echocardiography test to examine their left ventricle.\nOnly 25 percent of the study participants had even adequate intake of vitamin K, the researchers found. And overall, about 10 percent of the teens had some level of enlargement in their left heart ventricle.\nThe study's co-first author, Mary Ellen Fain, a second-year student at the medical college, said, \"Even at that age, it seemed to make a difference in their hearts.\"\nThe findings held even after considering other possible contributing factors, such as gender, race, physical activity and blood pressure, Fain said.\nHowever, the study doesn't establish a direct causal relationship.\nVitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health. This nutrient may also improve activity of a protein, known as matrix Gla protein, which helps prevent calcium deposits from forming within blood vessels.\nThe researchers said more studies are needed to assess the association between vitamin K intake and long-term heart health.\nThe findings were published Oct. 2 in The Journal of Nutrition .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T18:44:46.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4f90a0b3e6eeffaf3ceea023903b2e19808c185", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8GybOhUALZsAe_H3tAS6EF2fF94rqYwT9tJLHGsUEXJC7cC5Oii5BKgtgq5skfgA3hyS5ZcS0XO1Kc8RyKCmU8Dby3.NbI7RfpqsDrVEhQECuNcpFjDP3Ia_wbCBOFBakPnQ0BnhlI8VWexRIlyWJQSnfWwWtiu4wQ--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "High Blood Pressure Tied To Women's Dementia Risk", "title_full": "High Blood Pressure Tied To Women's Dementia Risk", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 138, "comments": 0, "shares": 138}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4f90a0b3e6eeffaf3ceea023903b2e19808c185", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8GybOhUALZsAe_H3tAS6EF2fF94rqYwT9tJLHGsUEXJC7cC5Oii5BKgtgq5skfgA3hyS5ZcS0XO1Kc8RyKCmU8Dby3.NbI7RfpqsDrVEhQECuNcpFjDP3Ia_wbCBOFBakPnQ0BnhlI8VWexRIlyWJQSnfWwWtiu4wQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dennis Thompson", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "High Blood Pressure Tied To Women's Dementia Risk", "text": "By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Women who develop high blood pressure in their 40s could be much more vulnerable to dementia later in life, a new study suggests.\nThat increased risk could run as high as 73 percent, the researchers reported, but the same did not hold true for men.\nThese new findings suggest that high blood pressure can start playing a role in brain health even earlier than previously thought, said lead researcher Paola Gilsanz, a postdoctoral fellow with the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Research in Oakland.\nPrior studies have linked high blood pressure with dementia, but \"it wasn't clear if hypertension before one's 50s was a risk factor,\" Gilsanz said.\nA healthy circulatory system is key to a healthy brain, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association.\n\"The brain is a very metabolically active organ in the body. It requires an outsized amount of oxygen and other nutrients,\" said Fargo, who wasn't involved with the study. \"Because of that, there's a very, very rich blood delivery system in the brain. Anything that happens to compromise that is going to compromise the overall health and function of the brain.\"\nBecause of that, it stands to reason that long-term exposure to high blood pressure could leave one more vulnerable to dementia as they enter old age, Gilsanz said.\nGilsanz and her colleagues reviewed the records of more than 5,600 patients of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system, tracking them from 1996 onward for an average 15 years to see who developed dementia.\nThey found that people with high blood pressure in their 30s did not appear to have any increased risk of dementia.\nBut women who developed high blood pressure in their 40s did have an increased risk of dementia, even after the researchers adjusted for other factors like smoking, diabetes and excess weight.\nHowever, the study did not prove that early high blood pressure caused dementia risk to rise in women, just that there was an association.\nContinued Men did not have a similar risk from high blood pressure in their 40s, but that could be because they were more likely to die before they grew old enough to suffer from dementia, Gilsanz noted.\nOther factors such as genetic differences, lifestyle differences and sex-specific hormones also might separate men and women when it comes to dementia risk associated with high blood pressure, Fargo said.\n\"It's really interesting to see there was an association among women but not men,\" Gilsanz said. \"Given that women have higher rates of dementia than men, understanding why this may be is a large area of interest for us. Future research should really look at sex-specific pathways that might be at play, to disentangle the risk factors for men and women.\"\nFargo said it makes sense that people with long-term exposure to high blood pressure would be more likely to develop dementia.\n\"Your dementia risk is really a lifelong thing,\" Fargo said. \"People think about dementia in late life, because that's when it's common to see the clinical symptoms. But everything that is setting you up for cognitive decline is occurring throughout your life.\"\nBut Fargo sees this as an opportunity, given that high blood pressure can be controlled with medication and lifestyle changes.\n\"These modifiable risk factors are the most powerful weapons we have in our arsenal to fight dementia,\" he said. \"It's a target that is addressable.\"\nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the journal Neurology .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T18:44:47.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8198a52b8f7861e35d541846038f13c97f6c132e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8GeFg2Ev2XoU5Wgq5F8aci6lP79s2bd0ExkMzQtbosnTbFFLMSoFrjuFTbS8t7i4Pej7M0w8D2k0eRm.g4yKYjiABpUnBDwKHJI6KPP.UFzeFdvOfJx1JGY6aEo8hvV_ug--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Working Night Shifts May Widen Your Waistline", "title_full": "Working Night Shifts May Widen Your Waistline", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8198a52b8f7861e35d541846038f13c97f6c132e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8GeFg2Ev2XoU5Wgq5F8aci6lP79s2bd0ExkMzQtbosnTbFFLMSoFrjuFTbS8t7i4Pej7M0w8D2k0eRm.g4yKYjiABpUnBDwKHJI6KPP.UFzeFdvOfJx1JGY6aEo8hvV_ug--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan Mozes", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Working Night Shifts May Widen Your Waistline", "text": "By Alan Mozes HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Workers who regularly pull overnight shifts may be more prone to pack on the pounds, a new analysis suggests.\nThe finding involved an in-depth look at 28 studies conducted between 1999 and 2016.\nAll the investigations explored the health impact of shift work, in which employees are regularly asked to either alternate between daytime and overnight schedules or to exclusively work overnight hours.\nAn estimated 700 million men and women around the world now follow that work pattern, representing about 20 percent of the global workforce, the researchers said.\nAnd while the numbers varied by study, the new analysis determined that, on average, routinely working a night shift seems to boost the risk for becoming obese or overweight by 29 percent.\nAlthough the review could not prove cause-and-effect, nutrition experts expressed little surprise at the finding.\nConnie Diekman, director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis, suggested that sleep disruption is without question the main culprit.\n\"As studies have demonstrated, and this study supports, the human body is programmed to sleep when it is dark, allowing hormones that impact hunger and satiety to reset for the next day,\" she explained.\n\"When people are awake when they should be sleeping, the hormones related to hunger and satiety appear to be thrown off, resulting in changes in eating, changes in metabolism and a tendency to eat more than we need,\" Diekman said.\nThat point was seconded by Penny Kris-Etherton, a professor of nutrition at Penn State University.\n\"Sleep deprivation is a major stressor that should be avoided as much as possible,\" she said, noting that by working night shifts, people are inevitably working against their natural biological clocks.\nNeither Diekman nor Kris-Etherton were part of the current review team, which was led by M. Sun of the JC School of Public Health and Primary Care at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nThe investigators reported their findings in the Oct. 4 issue of Obesity Reviews .\nAccording to the International Labour Organization, any schedule that requires working between midnight and 5 a.m. is considered night-shift work.\nContinued The review revealed that workers who are permanently assigned to overnight work are particularly prone to accumulating excess weight, compared with those who alternate between day and night shifts.\nThe report also suggested that the longer a worker engages in regular night-shift work, the higher the risk for gaining weight. In addition, abdominal obesity risk was specifically found to shoot up by 35 percent among those who routinely work nights.\nThat particular finding could ring public health alarm bells, given that abdominal fat has long been associated with metabolic syndrome. The syndrome includes high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, and it drives up the risk for developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke.\nWhat's more, less than 3 percent of these workers adapted their sleep schedules to accommodate night-time work, suggesting that many were likely not getting a sufficient amount of sleep on a routine basis.\n\"This [has] an impact on the circadian rhythm,\" said Diekman, referring to everyone's natural 24-hour internal sleep clock.\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, wakefulness naturally hits its lowest point between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., at the center of a standard night shift.\nNight shifts also challenge a worker's ability to access good food and exercise regularly, noted Kris-Etherton.\nOne solution, she said, is to \"bring healthy foods and snacks to the workplace to eat.\"\nAdvanced planning is key, agreed Diekman. \"Preparing dishes ahead of time is an easy way to have better options,\" she said.\n\"If your workplace does not offer good options or if you only have vending machines, think about better food choices that you could carry, and then how those choices can pair with what is available onsite,\" Diekman suggested.\n\"And, of course, remember that if you can get more movement into your workday it will help you with energy levels and possibly weight,\" Diekman added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T18:44:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b23476ee619545c0fb1f2160d76631ce6823826d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8ODjxZ3FRx62uT4TqJrMrzX8vIJ0qtb4Dk9GIwQLG10mas7ROdPUhZyDYlOpAbvTC9HmzmzUUMlfK_0PpFf.xWmJsn5l9fU1sVSAAliJ9lJJoV4wmzyllaP6mDbxZWHDoA--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "title_full": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 110, "comments": 0, "shares": 110}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b23476ee619545c0fb1f2160d76631ce6823826d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8ODjxZ3FRx62uT4TqJrMrzX8vIJ0qtb4Dk9GIwQLG10mas7ROdPUhZyDYlOpAbvTC9HmzmzUUMlfK_0PpFf.xWmJsn5l9fU1sVSAAliJ9lJJoV4wmzyllaP6mDbxZWHDoA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Randy Dotinga", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "text": "By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Urinary tract infections (UTIs) plague millions of Americans each year. Now, researchers say they've developed a test that can tell in minutes whether or not a particular antibiotic can clear up the problem.\nThe issue is an important one, doctors say, since many of the bacteria behind UTIs have grown resistant to certain antibiotics . And, left untreated, these infections can have serious effects, especially in the frail and elderly.\n\"We live in an era of multidrug-resistant bacteria, so-called 'superbugs' that can cause life-threatening infections,\" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Sunil Sood, who reviewed the new study.\n\"Modern molecular techniques to distinguish bacteria that are resistant from those that are susceptible to common antibiotics could be lifesaving,\" said Sood. He is chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.\nAccording to the study authors, current urine tests can rapidly spot a UTI , but it can still take days for the exact germs -- and the proper antibiotic to use against them -- to be identified.\nIn the new study, researchers led by Nathan Schoepp, of the California Institute of Technology, developed a new way of analyzing germs in urine samples. Instead of isolating germs and waiting for them to grow, the researchers used a \"DNA amplification\" technique to analyze the bacteria's genome, or \"genetic blueprint.\"\nThe investigators tested the new screen out on 51 urine samples containing either antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-susceptible strains of bacteria.\nReporting in the Oct. 4 issue of Science Translational Medicine , Schoepp's team said the new test can render results in less than 30 minutes. Those results confirmed that urine samples held germs that were either susceptible or resistant to two common antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Furadantin and Macrodantin).\nAccording to the researchers, the test might also prove useful in other areas of treatment of infectious disease.\nSood said that, if this work pans out, it could be a real advance in care.\n\"The technique used by Schoepp and colleagues has the potential to identify such bacteria within the time frame of an office or emergency room visit,\" he explained. \"If further developed, this method could help doctors to more rapidly treat infections with the right antibiotics.\"\nDr. Howard Selinger directs family medicine at Quinnipiac University's Frank D. Netter MD School of Medicine in Hamden, Conn.

Babies younger than 6 months old are placed on the mat between the pillows to keep them in a specific position while they are sleeping.\nBut putting babies to sleep on or near soft objects, such as positioners, toys, pillows and loose bedding, increases the risk for accidental suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS ), the American Academy of Pediatrics says.\nSome babies have been found in dangerous positions next to a positioner they had been placed in for sleeping. Federal officials also reported that infants have died after being placed in one of these products. In most cases, the infants got out of position, rolled onto their stomachs and suffocated, the FDA explained.\nThe agency urged parents and caregivers to always put babies on their back for naps and when they go to sleep at night.\nBabies should never sleep with a positioner, pillow, blanket, sheets, a comforter or a quilt, the FDA advised.\nInfants' sleeping surfaces should be bare and free of any loose items. Appropriate clothing keeps babies warm enough while they are sleeping.\nThe FDA regulates baby products that claim to cure, treat, prevent or reduce a disease or condition. Some sleep positioner companies claim that their products prevent SIDS. But the FDA noted it has never cleared an infant sleep positioner that promises to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS since there is no scientific evidence to back up this claim.\nSome companies market their products as helpful for easing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition that causes stomach acids to back up into the esophagus. Others suggest their positioners help prevent flat head syndrome (plagiocephaly), a deformation caused by pressure on one part of the skull.\nContinued But while some products were previously approved for GERD and flat head syndrome, the FDA asked these companies to stop marketing these items since the risks associated with their use outweighed any possible benefits.\nEvery year about 4,000 infants die unexpectedly while sleeping due to suffocation, SIDS or another unknown cause, according to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\nThe FDA urged parents and caregivers to talk to their child's doctor if they have questions about putting babies to sleep safely.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T18:44:49.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68adc54f305efb7364436e7bffef087fa2454a61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8OdOLZF.DA2y1i6MG25cSYJPTJSzDjIASssH2DE0I7ljgJh3H33QT7dRnpzV2U3HFN.8YGJf1QBFRfdK1x44RihwYTmSQSe8.HJ50WxRmiBMVWdrU.BEFdiN0uQIokT.Gw--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Heart Attack Survivors Often Leave Job Behind", "title_full": "Heart Attack Survivors Often Leave Job Behind", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4, "comments": 0, "shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68adc54f305efb7364436e7bffef087fa2454a61", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8OdOLZF.DA2y1i6MG25cSYJPTJSzDjIASssH2DE0I7ljgJh3H33QT7dRnpzV2U3HFN.8YGJf1QBFRfdK1x44RihwYTmSQSe8.HJ50WxRmiBMVWdrU.BEFdiN0uQIokT.Gw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Randy Dotinga", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Heart Attack Survivors Often Leave Job Behind", "text": "By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Recovering from a heart attack can be a long, painful process, and now a new study finds that almost one-quarter of those patients who returned to work ultimately left their jobs over the following year.\nThe findings suggest that \"even though patients return to work after a heart attack , they may still require individual adjustments at their workplaces in order to stay employed,\" said study author Dr. Laerke Smedegaard Petersen. She is a graduate student at Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark.\nAn estimated 676,000 people in the United States survive heart attacks each year, according to the American Heart Association. Many survivors are of working age: The average age of heart attack is 65 for men and 72 for women, the association says.\nThe new study examined the medical and work records of over 22,000 patients in Denmark who were employed before suffering heart attacks between 1997 and 2012.\nOf those, 91 percent returned to work within a year. But within a year of going back to work, 24 percent of the patients had left their jobs. That's three times the normal rate of leaving a job, the researchers reported. It's not clear, however, whether the heart attack survivors quit their jobs, or were fired or laid off.\nPatients aged 30 to 39 and 60 to 65, and those who had heart failure, diabetes or depression, were especially likely to leave their jobs. Workers with higher incomes and more education were more likely to stay on the job, the findings showed.\nPetersen said the percentage of heart attack patients who return to work and then leave their jobs may be even higher in the United States.\n\"In Denmark, all citizens have equal access to health care and all patients receive treatment free of charge,\" she explained.\nOne U.S. expert said the findings are sobering.\n\"The study is an important reminder that recovery is often measured in months and years, not just weeks,\" said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.\nContinued \"To understand the impact of a heart attack requires that we fully understand people's roles and function. We should study how best to help people fully resume their prior activities and have the choice as to whether they want to continue working,\" Krumholz explained.\nKarina Davidson, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, said fatigue and an inability to perform manual labor are some of the reasons why heart attack survivors leave their jobs.\n\"Patients after a heart attack do indeed have a long road to recovery, and cardiac rehabilitation, strong family support and follow-up with their medical care are important components to ensure the best recovery possible,\" she said. \"Returning to work full-time will be realistic for some patients, but not for all.\"\nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the Journal of the American Heart Association .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T18:45:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19461f14c827f13b5d7c60cbcd321e28b53b24fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OMM_pNIgGIKVsWxNdTXx9nM7wGGBk4Pk.cjlLyN1lvIf..2hudnSTpCS92V2RYMsjdNftAJ5wjumpSWomo_ZbKdSHs3sfbgioDM6xisjbroXeftEtSh.jVs-", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Melatonin Sales Skyrocket, But Is Sleep Aid Safe?", "title_full": "Melatonin Sales Skyrocket, But Is Sleep Aid Safe?", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/video/melatonin_sleep_video/650x350_melatonin_sleep_video.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 737, "comments": 0, "shares": 737}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19461f14c827f13b5d7c60cbcd321e28b53b24fd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OMM_pNIgGIKVsWxNdTXx9nM7wGGBk4Pk.cjlLyN1lvIf..2hudnSTpCS92V2RYMsjdNftAJ5wjumpSWomo_ZbKdSHs3sfbgioDM6xisjbroXeftEtSh.jVs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brunilda  Nazario, MD", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Melatonin Sales Skyrocket, But Is Sleep Aid Safe?", "text": "Oct. 5, 2017 -- Walk the vitamin aisle of your local grocery store and you\u2019ll find everything from flavored teas and mouth sprays to raspberry gummies and animal-shaped chews, all containing the purported sleep aide melatonin . In all, U.S. consumers will spend more than $437 million on melatonin supplements in 2017, up from $159 million in 2010, according to Nutrition Business Journal . More than 3 million adults and a half-million children take it, and that number is expected to grow as more sleep -deprived families clamor for cheap \u201cnatural\u201d remedies.\nBut with such growth also come concerns that consumers have an oversimplified view of the potent, complex hormone . Taken at the right time, in the right dose, it can, indeed, repair a sleep schedule thrown off kilter by jet lag, a long weekend filled with late nights, or certain circadian rhythm disorders .\nBut for insomnia that happens now and then, research shows its effectiveness is limited. And some fear that if misused, it may do harm.\nExperts also question how safe it is for children. Australian experts called the increase in use among children \u201calarming\u201d and warned in 2015 that parents shouldn\u2019t give it to their children.\n\u201cA lot of people just take it right before they go to bed as if it were a sleeping pill,\u201d says Michael Breus, PhD, a California-based clinical psychologist who specializes in sleep disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\nWorks for Some, Not for Others Discovered in 1958, melatonin is a potent hormone naturally produced in the body to help regulate our circadian rhythm, or natural body clock. Light is the switch that controls it: As daylight fades, levels of melatonin begin to rise about 2 hours before bedtime, nudging us to become sleepy. In the morning, when light hits the eyes, it signals the brain to halt melatonin production, and we grow alert.\n\u201cMelatonin is a sleep regulator, not a sleep initiator,\u201d explains Breus, author of \u201cGood Night: The Doctor\u2019s 4-week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health.\u201d \nSince the 1980s, dietary supplement makers have billed melatonin made in a lab as a promising sleep aid. But its effects on occasional insomnia are not significant.\nIt works for some people, but not for others. You just have to try it and find out which one you are.\nAlfred Lewy, MD, Oregon Health & Science University One review of 15 studies involving 284 subjects found that those who took melatonin before bed fell asleep 3.9 minutes faster on average and slept 13 minutes longer. Another, of 19 studies involving 1,700 people, found melatonin users fell asleep 7 minutes faster on average and slept 8 minutes longer.\n\u201cWhen you are already making melatonin naturally at night, taking a little bit more exogenously is kind of like spitting in the ocean. It doesn\u2019t do much,\u201d says Cathy Goldstein, MD, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Sleep Medicine Clinic. \nAlfred Lewy, MD, professor emeritus at Oregon Health & Science University and a pioneer in melatonin research, says he has found that a larger dose (3 mg) can promote sleep, but only in about one-third of people who take it. \u201cIt works for some people, but not for others. You just have to try it and find out which one you are.\u201d\nExperts do agree that melatonin can have a big effect on treating circadian rhythm disorders like delayed sleep phase disorder (extreme night owls), advanced sleep phase disorder (extreme morning larks), or shift work disorder. In these cases, the body makes melatonin too late or too early, creating a mismatch between when the person should sleep and when they feel like it.\n\u201cSay you are an extreme night owl who only begins to feel sleepy at 4 a.m. and likes to sleep until noon. You could take low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg) at 11 p.m., well before your natural melatonin kicks in. Not only will it help you feel sleepy earlier, it will start to pull your internal clock earlier too,\u201d explains Goldstein.\nMelatonin also works great for jet lag from eastward travel, says Breus, who recommends taking 0.5 mg of melatonin 90 minutes before bedtime in the place you\u2019re traveling to.\nAfter a weekend of staying up late and sleeping in, a low (0.3 mg) dose of melatonin late Sunday afternoon can also help you get to sleep at a regular hour and avoid the \u201cMonday morning blues\u201d that often happen when your days off disrupt your body clock, says Lewy. (Caution: If you are one of those people melatonin makes sleepy, don\u2019t drive after taking it).\nHis research also suggests that for some patients, as little as 0.3 mg of melatonin daily in the late afternoon may ease symptoms of winter depression brought on by shorter days and shifting circadian rhythms. But because a small number of people respond better when taking the melatonin in the morning, he only recommends its use for this purpose under a doctor\u2019s guidance.\n\u201cThe challenge with melatonin is that it\u2019s complicated. If you take it at the wrong time, it can shift your body clock in the wrong direction, and that can cause problems,\u201d Lewy says.\nSafety Concerns on the Rise While short-term use (a few months or less) of melatonin is thought to be safe in healthy adults, it can boost blood sugar, so it is not recommended for people with diabetes, Goldstein says. Taking too much can also lead to bad dreams and grogginess the next day, and it can make many drugs less effective, including high blood pressure medications, seizure medications, and birth control pills, Breus says.\nBecause dietary supplements are not regulated as much as prescription drugs, quality can vary wildly from bottle to bottle. One recent study found that 71% of melatonin supplements surveyed did not contain exactly what they said on the label. Some had more than four times as much melatonin as indicated, and 26% contained the powerful neurotransmitter serotonin, a chemical found in many antidepressant medications.\nWhen it comes to children\u2019s use, concerns abound.\nThe American Association of Poison Control Centers reports that calls about melatonin have skyrocketed 114% nationwide since 2012, with 79% of the 24,000 calls in 2016 involving children. Parents often call poison control after their children have taken it unintentionally or taken too much. That can lead to nausea, diarrhea, headaches, changes in mood, lasting sleepiness the next day, and bedwetting, experts say.\nExperts are also not sure if using melatonin would harm children.\nWe really don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s safe to take long-term.\nCathy Goldstein, MD, assistant professor of neurology, University of Michigan Sleep Medicine Clinic In 2015, researchers from Australia published a study pointing to research that linked melatonin use on rodents to changes in puberty. The report also notes that in the early 1990s, scientists were looking into high doses of melatonin as possible human birth control because of the way it could affect the reproductive system.\nThe findings were in animals, and no research to date has shown similar effects in children.\n\"Considering the small advances melatonin provides to the timing of sleep, and considering what we know about how melatonin works in the body, it is not worth the risk to child and adolescent safety,\" warned lead author David Kennaway, head of the Circadian Physiology Laboratory at the University of Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute.\nSome research has shown that children with developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have low nighttime melatonin levels that may help cause poor sleep patterns. If it's well-timed and under the supervision of a doctor, melatonin may help normalize their sleep and daytime behavior, Breus notes.\nBreus says he would not use melatonin on otherwise healthy kids. There is little research, however, on melatonin's safety for children. \nCraig Canapari, MD, who directs the Yale Pediatric Sleep Center, says while he shares Kennaway\u2019s concerns, he has \u201cseen first hand the consequences of poor sleep on children and families.\u201d He writes on his blog that he often uses it, but his goal it to help children get to sleep with as few medications as possible. He says it may be an option if:\nBehavioral changes haven\u2019t worked Other medicals causes of insomnia have been ruled out Your doctor thinks it is safe and willing to work with you on using it And for adults with body clocks thrown off for one reason or another, it is absolutely worth trying, experts say.\nJust choose your brand wisely, keep your dose well under 3 mg to avoid bad side effects, and once your sleep schedule is back on track, stop taking it.\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s safe to take long-term,\u201d says Goldstein.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:27:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b881fbf054173c30122d829e58af24e3e9781966", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OLvAhoPJlkxqpekNCZIC1csmzMfnTY9qeKIJ6oTf03tKK6OA_FKuFIjaoDxEkdQ.b5vDgf1iHnPmbc_JROZ4kX_RcKv7na4skFthFBNewr2uid.6EDYmbzgWuNAed1stBQ--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Rare Tumor May Point the Way to Diabetes Treatment", "title_full": "Rare Tumor May Point the Way to Diabetes Treatment", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b881fbf054173c30122d829e58af24e3e9781966", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OLvAhoPJlkxqpekNCZIC1csmzMfnTY9qeKIJ6oTf03tKK6OA_FKuFIjaoDxEkdQ.b5vDgf1iHnPmbc_JROZ4kX_RcKv7na4skFthFBNewr2uid.6EDYmbzgWuNAed1stBQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Serena Gordon", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Rare Tumor May Point the Way to Diabetes Treatment", "text": "By Serena Gordon HealthDay Reporter \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A rare, benign tumor that grows in the pancreas may give doctors the tools they need to help people with diabetes make more insulin .\nThese tumors are called insulinomas because they secrete the hormone insulin in excessive amounts. People with diabetes don't have enough insulin to cover their bodies' basic needs for the hormone.\nThe researchers thought by mapping the genetic makeup of insulinoma tumors, they might come up with the genomic recipe for regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin. And if they could use that \"recipe\" to make a drug that would trigger the body to make insulin, they could treat -- or possibly even reverse -- diabetes.\nThe study's senior author, Dr. Andrew Stewart, said the researchers have mapped approximately 90 insulinoma tumors at this point, but only 38 were included in the current study.\n\"We have an actual wiring diagram in molecular terms for beta cell replication, and there are different mutation patterns that lead to beta cell regeneration. We've found about 30 different pathways,\" said Stewart.\nHe directs the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\nStewart said it wasn't a complete surprise to see that there were multiple pathways, instead of just one or two. For example, he said, there isn't just one set of molecules that makes growth plates during childhood.\n\"We found many additional pathways... This is a data mine for diabetes researchers,\" he said.\nInsulin, which is made in the pancreas, is used to usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as energy.\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin, and may not make enough insulin. About 29 million people in the United States have this type of diabetes, which is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle.\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to mistakenly destroy insulin-producing beta cells. People with type 1 diabetes must replace that lost insulin through injections or an insulin pump. Approximately 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association.\nContinued With the information from this new study, the researchers hope to find or develop drugs that could work on one of those newly identified pathways. But it's important that the pathway doesn't have any other serious effects.\nStewart and his colleagues published a study in Nature Medicine in 2015 showing how the drug harmine could prompt beta cell regeneration in the lab and in mice. The pathway linked to harmine was one of the ones found in the current paper, too.\nBut \"harmine is a hallucinogen,\" Stewart said.\nSo, if taken as a pill or given as a shot, it would affect the whole body and produce unwanted side effects.\n\"We still need a way to deliver it specifically to the beta cells,\" said Stewart.\nThere's also a concern that a drug like an insulinoma could cause the body to produce too much insulin, leading to potentially dangerous side effects.\nAndrew Rakeman is assistant vice president of research for JDRF -- formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.\n\"You don't want to replicate the lack of control of an insulinoma. The question is can we find ways to switch these pathways on and then switch them off?\" said Rakeman, who wasn't involved in the new study.\nHe also pointed out that it's important that any drug just targets the beta cells and doesn't encourage cell growth in other areas.\nStewart said a therapy developed from these pathways would likely be for people with type 2 diabetes first. People with type 1 diabetes have the added issue of the autoimmune attack, which could destroy any newly made cells.\nFor people with type 1 diabetes, some sort of immune system suppression might be necessary, Stewart said. Rakeman said it's possible repeated treatments might keep enough beta cells alive to be effective, though that remains to be seen.\nFor now, Stewart and Rakeman said these findings are hopeful.\n\"Amazing things are happening in the world of beta cell regeneration,\" Stewart said.\nRakeman agreed. \"We understand much more about what's happening with beta cells. We can take those lessons and build out therapeutic targets,\" he said.\nContinued The study was published Oct. 3 in the journal Nature Communications .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

HealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists have pinpointed a mechanism that helps flu viruses mutate rapidly, which could lead to new ways to fight the flu .\nBecause flu viruses mutate quickly, flu vaccines have to be redesigned every year.\nThe MIT researchers found that to mutate rapidly, flu viruses use a group of proteins called chaperones in infected cells in the host (a person or animal with the flu).\nBlocking flu viruses from using the host cells' chaperones could help prevent the viruses from developing resistance to existing drugs and vaccines , the study authors said.\n\"It's relatively easy to make a drug that kills a virus, or an antibody that stops a virus from propagating, but it's very hard to make one that the virus doesn't promptly escape from once you start using it,\" senior study author Matthew Shoulders, an associate professor of chemistry, said in an MIT news release.\n\"Our data suggest that, at some point in the future, targeting host chaperones might restrict the ability of a virus to evolve and allow us to kill viruses before they become drug-resistant,\" he said.\nThe study was published recently in the journal

spinach, cabbage, iceberg lettuce and olive oil -- had triple the risk for enlargement of the heart 's left pumping chamber compared to their greens -eating peers, according to the study.\nChanges in the heart's left pumping chamber are usually seen in adults with chronic high blood pressure . Hearts that become bigger are less efficient and less effective, said the study authors from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\n\"Those who consumed less [vitamin K] had more risk,\" Dr. Norman Pollock, the study's corresponding author, said in a university news release.\nFor the study, researchers asked 766 healthy teens, aged 14 to 18, to wear activity monitors for seven days and to record what they ate. Most participants tracked their diet for at least six days. The teens also underwent an echocardiography test to examine their left ventricle.\nOnly 25 percent of the study participants had even adequate intake of vitamin K, the researchers found. And overall, about 10 percent of the teens had some level of enlargement in their left heart ventricle.\nThe study's co-first author, Mary Ellen Fain, a second-year student at the medical college, said, \"Even at that age, it seemed to make a difference in their hearts.\"\nThe findings held even after considering other possible contributing factors, such as gender, race, physical activity and blood pressure, Fain said.\nHowever, the study doesn't establish a direct causal relationship.\nVitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health. This nutrient may also improve activity of a protein, known as matrix Gla protein, which helps prevent calcium deposits from forming within blood vessels.\nThe researchers said more studies are needed to assess the association between vitamin K intake and long-term heart health.\nThe findings were published Oct. 2 in The Journal of Nutrition .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:27:41.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "49439edf8a79c700b67d0be00b1dffd52c01e7eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OOYe0RqcYr94ZTBjCeo1R6Q_OjJArcpkZ56mGWgBImVMllH0wt3.6qi8sjQnFmUpqZ1nurPzrGaC7lSCIjCzMw_DQSN9TuXSSxmOYTwJOeypfPBBUk9bKAXoJFaTdL60eh0I_6COYgPO8JTHqZbMXNiocxtr6fwH2g--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "High Blood Pressure Tied To Women's Dementia Risk", "title_full": "High Blood Pressure Tied To Women's Dementia Risk", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "49439edf8a79c700b67d0be00b1dffd52c01e7eb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OOYe0RqcYr94ZTBjCeo1R6Q_OjJArcpkZ56mGWgBImVMllH0wt3.6qi8sjQnFmUpqZ1nurPzrGaC7lSCIjCzMw_DQSN9TuXSSxmOYTwJOeypfPBBUk9bKAXoJFaTdL60eh0I_6COYgPO8JTHqZbMXNiocxtr6fwH2g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dennis Thompson", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "High Blood Pressure Tied To Women's Dementia Risk", "text": "Homepage / Nutrition / Excessive Blood Strain Tied To Girls's Dementia Danger Excessive Blood Strain Tied To Girls's Dementia Danger By Carmige Posted on \nBy Dennis Thompson \nHealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. four, 2017 (HealthDay Information) \u2014 Girls who develop hypertension of their 40s could possibly be way more susceptible to dementia later in life, a brand new research suggests. \nThat elevated danger might run as excessive as 73 p.c, the researchers reported, however the identical didn\u2019t maintain true for males. \nThese new findings recommend that hypertension can begin enjoying a job in mind well being even sooner than beforehand thought, stated lead researcher Paola Gilsanz, a postdoctoral fellow with the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Division of Analysis in Oakland. \nPrior research have linked hypertension with dementia, however \u201cit wasn\u2019t clear if hypertension earlier than one\u2019s 50s was a danger issue,\u201d Gilsanz stated. \nA wholesome circulatory system is vital to a wholesome mind, stated Keith Fargo, director of scientific packages and outreach for the Alzheimer\u2019s Affiliation. \n\u201cThe mind is a really metabolically lively organ within the physique.

Sun of the JC School of Public Health and Primary Care at The Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nThe investigators reported their findings in the Oct. 4 issue of Obesity Reviews .\nAccording to the International Labour Organization, any schedule that requires working between midnight and 5 a.m. is considered night-shift work.\nContinued The review revealed that workers who are permanently assigned to overnight work are particularly prone to accumulating excess weight, compared with those who alternate between day and night shifts.\nThe report also suggested that the longer a worker engages in regular night-shift work, the higher the risk for gaining weight. In addition, abdominal obesity risk was specifically found to shoot up by 35 percent among those who routinely work nights.\nThat particular finding could ring public health alarm bells, given that abdominal fat has long been associated with metabolic syndrome. The syndrome includes high blood pressure, high cholesterol and high triglyceride levels, and it drives up the risk for developing heart disease, diabetes and stroke.\nWhat's more, less than 3 percent of these workers adapted their sleep schedules to accommodate night-time work, suggesting that many were likely not getting a sufficient amount of sleep on a routine basis.\n\"This [has] an impact on the circadian rhythm,\" said Diekman, referring to everyone's natural 24-hour internal sleep clock.\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, wakefulness naturally hits its lowest point between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., at the center of a standard night shift.\nNight shifts also challenge a worker's ability to access good food and exercise regularly, noted Kris-Etherton.\nOne solution, she said, is to \"bring healthy foods and snacks to the workplace to eat.\"\nAdvanced planning is key, agreed Diekman. \"Preparing dishes ahead of time is an easy way to have better options,\" she said.\n\"If your workplace does not offer good options or if you only have vending machines, think about better food choices that you could carry, and then how those choices can pair with what is available onsite,\" Diekman suggested.\n\"And, of course, remember that if you can get more movement into your workday it will help you with energy levels and possibly weight,\" Diekman added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:27:45.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c1a2e8baceabc1e3bf06faae5f8edbbed7308ea6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OMhCBQ8BCqh._WAm66IsjuG2UldFcUOi5T_xg6VqaX8D4k_d92X.1u4BefGshfcaC3diBXH7yXrOqvWNwJeu.i3lhoSRyRW9PJSb9rzZ.EJj0.Ibe7N5M4p4oqasL5iC9w--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "title_full": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c1a2e8baceabc1e3bf06faae5f8edbbed7308ea6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OMhCBQ8BCqh._WAm66IsjuG2UldFcUOi5T_xg6VqaX8D4k_d92X.1u4BefGshfcaC3diBXH7yXrOqvWNwJeu.i3lhoSRyRW9PJSb9rzZ.EJj0.Ibe7N5M4p4oqasL5iC9w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Randy Dotinga", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "text": "By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Urinary tract infections (UTIs) plague millions of Americans each year. Now, researchers say they've developed a test that can tell in minutes whether or not a particular antibiotic can clear up the problem.\nThe issue is an important one, doctors say, since many of the bacteria behind UTIs have grown resistant to certain antibiotics . And, left untreated, these infections can have serious effects, especially in the frail and elderly.\n\"We live in an era of multidrug-resistant bacteria, so-called 'superbugs' that can cause life-threatening infections,\" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Sunil Sood, who reviewed the new study.\n\"Modern molecular techniques to distinguish bacteria that are resistant from those that are susceptible to common antibiotics could be lifesaving,\" said Sood. He is chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.\nAccording to the study authors, current urine tests can rapidly spot a UTI , but it can still take days for the exact germs -- and the proper antibiotic to use against them -- to be identified.\nIn the new study, researchers led by Nathan Schoepp, of the California Institute of Technology, developed a new way of analyzing germs in urine samples. Instead of isolating germs and waiting for them to grow, the researchers used a \"DNA amplification\" technique to analyze the bacteria's genome, or \"genetic blueprint.\"\nThe investigators tested the new screen out on 51 urine samples containing either antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-susceptible strains of bacteria.\nReporting in the Oct. 4 issue of Science Translational Medicine , Schoepp's team said the new test can render results in less than 30 minutes. Those results confirmed that urine samples held germs that were either susceptible or resistant to two common antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Furadantin and Macrodantin).\nAccording to the researchers, the test might also prove useful in other areas of treatment of infectious disease.\nSood said that, if this work pans out, it could be a real advance in care.\n\"The technique used by Schoepp and colleagues has the potential to identify such bacteria within the time frame of an office or emergency room visit,\" he explained. \"If further developed, this method could help doctors to more rapidly treat infections with the right antibiotics.\"\nDr. Howard Selinger directs family medicine at Quinnipiac University's Frank D.

At first, it was believed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations might account for up to 8 percent of breast and ovarian cancers.\nThe researchers noted the risk is likely much higher because in many cancers there is no evidence of mutation but the expression of the BRCA genes is silenced.\n\"Understanding this mechanism will provide the predictive power for doctors trying to establish a patient's personal risk of developing cancer,\" Sung said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:28:01.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2f6b9f848dbab68b2c25230ab9f4100eaac5e41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OBRg6u6wBGgFwh4AsNbdpyDld0dgELn3TvUeeSk1ENpOPAggeLcCEZE1rarASWIvDlYD9z4SxOygkN_HvnFtYBnHDFm4fMVsbBqMF5Al3KL8ULcKX5Fre5jG6Vypb9bKbA--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "title_full": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2f6b9f848dbab68b2c25230ab9f4100eaac5e41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OBRg6u6wBGgFwh4AsNbdpyDld0dgELn3TvUeeSk1ENpOPAggeLcCEZE1rarASWIvDlYD9z4SxOygkN_HvnFtYBnHDFm4fMVsbBqMF5Al3KL8ULcKX5Fre5jG6Vypb9bKbA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Sleep Positioners' a Danger to Baby: FDA", "text": "By Mary Elizabeth Dallas HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Infants should be put to sleep on their backs on a firm, empty surface and never placed on a sleep positioner, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says.\nThe agency warned parents and caregivers that these products, also known as \"nests\" or \"anti-roll\" supports, can prevent babies from breathing .\nThe two most common sleep positioners include two raised pillows or \"bolsters\" attached to a mat. Babies younger than 6 months old are placed on the mat between the pillows to keep them in a specific position while they are sleeping.\nBut putting babies to sleep on or near soft objects, such as positioners, toys, pillows and loose bedding, increases the risk for accidental suffocation and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS ), the American Academy of Pediatrics says.\nSome babies have been found in dangerous positions next to a positioner they had been placed in for sleeping. Federal officials also reported that infants have died after being placed in one of these products. In most cases, the infants got out of position, rolled onto their stomachs and suffocated, the FDA explained.\nThe agency urged parents and caregivers to always put babies on their back for naps and when they go to sleep at night.\nBabies should never sleep with a positioner, pillow, blanket, sheets, a comforter or a quilt, the FDA advised.\nInfants' sleeping surfaces should be bare and free of any loose items. Appropriate clothing keeps babies warm enough while they are sleeping.\nThe FDA regulates baby products that claim to cure, treat, prevent or reduce a disease or condition. Some sleep positioner companies claim that their products prevent SIDS. But the FDA noted it has never cleared an infant sleep positioner that promises to prevent or reduce the risk of SIDS since there is no scientific evidence to back up this claim.\nSome companies market their products as helpful for easing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition that causes stomach acids to back up into the esophagus. Others suggest their positioners help prevent flat head syndrome (plagiocephaly), a deformation caused by pressure on one part of the skull.\nContinued But while some products were previously approved for GERD and flat head syndrome, the FDA asked these companies to stop marketing these items since the risks associated with their use outweighed any possible benefits.\nEvery year about 4,000 infants die unexpectedly while sleeping due to suffocation, SIDS or another unknown cause, according to the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\nThe FDA urged parents and caregivers to talk to their child's doctor if they have questions about putting babies to sleep safely.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:28:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b5cfe4dfee3a09bb39c8e5377b868d23a711c8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OL3W7vP9O6u66hRZbW_EowbLQd0v2.qjnh1clafDRkNequ1GfqKxHBaSClv9APCJmjtsGuYqHpfohhCDN8oATojQ3Lwp578GTko.Ih820C.vzZDD5Ycb8q81YBdDulp03w--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Heart Attack Survivors Often Leave Job Behind", "title_full": "Heart Attack Survivors Often Leave Job Behind", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b5cfe4dfee3a09bb39c8e5377b868d23a711c8f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OL3W7vP9O6u66hRZbW_EowbLQd0v2.qjnh1clafDRkNequ1GfqKxHBaSClv9APCJmjtsGuYqHpfohhCDN8oATojQ3Lwp578GTko.Ih820C.vzZDD5Ycb8q81YBdDulp03w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Randy Dotinga", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Heart Attack Survivors Often Leave Job Behind", "text": "By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Recovering from a heart attack can be a long, painful process, and now a new study finds that almost one-quarter of those patients who returned to work ultimately left their jobs over the following year.\nThe findings suggest that \"even though patients return to work after a heart attack , they may still require individual adjustments at their workplaces in order to stay employed,\" said study author Dr. Laerke Smedegaard Petersen. She is a graduate student at Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark.\nAn estimated 676,000 people in the United States survive heart attacks each year, according to the American Heart Association. Many survivors are of working age: The average age of heart attack is 65 for men and 72 for women, the association says.\nThe new study examined the medical and work records of over 22,000 patients in Denmark who were employed before suffering heart attacks between 1997 and 2012.\nOf those, 91 percent returned to work within a year. But within a year of going back to work, 24 percent of the patients had left their jobs. That's three times the normal rate of leaving a job, the researchers reported. It's not clear, however, whether the heart attack survivors quit their jobs, or were fired or laid off.\nPatients aged 30 to 39 and 60 to 65, and those who had heart failure, diabetes or depression, were especially likely to leave their jobs. Workers with higher incomes and more education were more likely to stay on the job, the findings showed.\nPetersen said the percentage of heart attack patients who return to work and then leave their jobs may be even higher in the United States.\n\"In Denmark, all citizens have equal access to health care and all patients receive treatment free of charge,\" she explained.\nOne U.S. expert said the findings are sobering.\n\"The study is an important reminder that recovery is often measured in months and years, not just weeks,\" said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut.\nContinued \"To understand the impact of a heart attack requires that we fully understand people's roles and function. We should study how best to help people fully resume their prior activities and have the choice as to whether they want to continue working,\" Krumholz explained.\nKarina Davidson, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, said fatigue and an inability to perform manual labor are some of the reasons why heart attack survivors leave their jobs.\n\"Patients after a heart attack do indeed have a long road to recovery, and cardiac rehabilitation, strong family support and follow-up with their medical care are important components to ensure the best recovery possible,\" she said. \"Returning to work full-time will be realistic for some patients, but not for all.\"\nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the Journal of the American Heart Association .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:28:06.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7dd86c100e0a1a1bc091cd7509dde9304b872e67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ON3yeLA.GVVdH0p5ttDTpD7079zgzE7i44oLqiGAZPPKKPjpPP5p0nM_TenpZPFaeJDsrk_NbHpPl78V2nMef.QWkq7DCcVgmDqXTZ8EMwoj", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Teens Who Avoid Veggies Could Face Heart Issues", "title_full": "Teens Who Avoid Veggies Could Face Heart Issues", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7dd86c100e0a1a1bc091cd7509dde9304b872e67", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ON3yeLA.GVVdH0p5ttDTpD7079zgzE7i44oLqiGAZPPKKPjpPP5p0nM_TenpZPFaeJDsrk_NbHpPl78V2nMef.QWkq7DCcVgmDqXTZ8EMwoj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Teens Who Avoid Veggies Could Face Heart Issues", "text": "Teens Who Avoid Veggies Could Face Heart Issues Leafy green veggies are a good source of the vital nutrient \nBy Mary Elizabeth Dallas \nHealthDay Reporter \nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Bypassing leafy green veggies could take a toll on teens ' heart health , new research suggests. \nTeens who ate the least vitamin K -rich foods -- such as spinach, cabbage, iceberg lettuce and olive oil -- had triple the risk for enlargement of the heart 's left pumping chamber compared to their greens -eating peers, according to the study. \nChanges in the heart's left pumping chamber are usually seen in adults with chronic high blood pressure . Hearts that become bigger are less efficient and less effective, said the study authors from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. \n\"Those who consumed less [vitamin K] had more risk,\" Dr. Norman Pollock, the study's corresponding author, said in a university news release. \nFor the study, researchers asked 766 healthy teens, aged 14 to 18, to wear activity monitors for seven days and to record what they ate. Most participants tracked their diet for at least six days. The teens also underwent an echocardiography test to examine their left ventricle. \nOnly 25 percent of the study participants had even adequate intake of vitamin K, the researchers found. And overall, about 10 percent of the teens had some level of enlargement in their left heart ventricle. \nThe study's co-first author, Mary Ellen Fain, a second-year student at the medical college, said, \"Even at that age, it seemed to make a difference in their hearts.\" \nThe findings held even after considering other possible contributing factors, such as gender, race, physical activity and blood pressure, Fain said. \nHowever, the study doesn't establish a direct causal relationship. \nVitamin K is essential for blood clotting and bone health. This nutrient may also improve activity of a protein, known as matrix Gla protein, which helps prevent calcium deposits from forming within blood vessels. \nThe researchers said more studies are needed to assess the association between vitamin K intake and long-term heart health. \nThe findings were published Oct. 2 in The Journal of Nutrition .

This leaves them unable to manufacture a protein that helps break down certain fatty acids. Acid buildup then begins to attack nerves, muscles and the brain .\nMost boys with the disease do not reach adulthood.\nUntil now, the only viable treatment has been a kind of stem cell therapy , but it comes with dangers and only one in five boys with the disease can find a suitable stem cell donor.\nBut the new gene therapy , reported online Oct. 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine , gets around that problem. Doctors remove the boy's own stem cells, genetically alter them in the lab so they now carry the missing gene behind adrenoleukodystrophy, and then inject the altered stem cells back into the patient.\nFifteen of the 17 boys who tried the therapy in the new study are neurologically stable and have no disability two years later, according to a team led by Dr. Florian Eichler, of Harvard Medical School in Boston. All of the boys had a severe form of the disease, affecting the brain.\nWriting in a journal editorial, Dr. Marc Engelen, of Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, said that he believes the treatment \"will have a positive impact on the lives of our patients.\"\n\"For many years, gene therapy has shown great promise, but clinical applications have always seemed just beyond the horizon,\" Engelen wrote. But the new approach \"appears to be poised as a real treatment option for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy,\" he added.\nPaul and Liliana Rojas, of Dover Plains, N.Y., have two sons -- Brian, 7, and Brandon, 10 -- affected by adrenoleukodystrophy. Because the therapy is only effective when used early in the disease, Brian was able to get the treatment while his older brother was not, the couple told the Associated Press .\nContinued According to his parents, Brandon appeared to be a typical child until about the age of 7, when he began to drool and experience learning problems at school. His adrenoleukodystrophy diagnosis came three years ago, and at the time doctors advised that Brian get tested, too.\n\"We were driving to one of the Disney parks and had to pull over to get the call,\" Paul Rojas told the AP . \"Once we got off the phone, we both looked at each other and said we need to move forward now and save our younger son any way we can.\"\nThe new treatment is likely to be expensive. According to Engelen, a similar therapy, used for another rare disease, had a price tag over about $1 million per patient.\nAccording to the AP , costs for the boys treated in the study were covered by government grants and the therapy's maker, Bluebird Bio Inc., of Cambridge, Mass.\nAnd not all of the boys benefited, the researchers noted. Two of the 17 boys died -- one from the disease itself, and the other from complications linked to a donor transplant after the boy had withdrawn from the study.\nWill this treatment receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration? Current FDA rules require that outcomes for gene therapy recipients be tracked for 15 years, so the boys in the Boston trial will continue to be monitored. Speaking to the AP , lead researcher Dr. David Williams said that eight more boys are being enrolled into the study as Bluebird seeks approval for the treatment in the United States and Europe.\nAdrenoleukodystrophy first came to public attention with the release of the movie \"Lorenzo's Oil\" in 1992. The film depicted the true-life fight of one couple to develop their own treatment from olive and rapeseed oils to help their son, Lorenzo. While the treatment didn't turn out to be a cure, Lorenzo died in 2008 at age 30, two decades longer than most patients' expected lifespan.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T21:41:52.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "669ee501baebbcd817882b726e7911f16e13fd0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8HH8HUoBv5xcz4gAqCDT4JXnxpG4kILHJck_sdubwYI996Y4w_WHXzSm2hRWpZeCTaKLnzxfIRDCacyMefc7ht01Bfk8J2kdA9FfDsySPCUH3pDbEa1P0grl3yXTZW0Wjw--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Mother Sent To Jail for Refusing to Vaccinate Son", "title_full": "Mother Sent To Jail for Refusing to Vaccinate Son", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 647, "comments": 0, "shares": 647}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "669ee501baebbcd817882b726e7911f16e13fd0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8HH8HUoBv5xcz4gAqCDT4JXnxpG4kILHJck_sdubwYI996Y4w_WHXzSm2hRWpZeCTaKLnzxfIRDCacyMefc7ht01Bfk8J2kdA9FfDsySPCUH3pDbEa1P0grl3yXTZW0Wjw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "webmd.com", "published": "2017-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mother Sent To Jail for Refusing to Vaccinate Son", "text": "It's prison time for a Michigan woman who defied a court order and refused to have her son vaccinated.

It most likely starts in the womb, and the mother's diet during pregnancy might have an influence, DeVilbiss said. \nThomas Frazier is chief science officer of Autism Speaks, an advocacy group. \"The finding of multivitamin use associated with lower risk of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability is consistent with previous studies,\" he said.\nExpectant mothers and women planning to become pregnant should talk with their doctors and follow the physician's recommendations, Frazier said. \nThose trying to conceive \"may benefit from starting multivitamin supplementation before getting pregnant,\" he said.\nHowever, DeVilbiss said it's too early to recommend multivitamins specifically for lowering autism risk.\n\"From a single study, we can't make any definitive statement or policy recommendations, because the results of other studies have been inconsistent,\" she said.\nBecause the study was observational, it's possible that women who take a multivitamin during pregnancy might engage in other healthy behaviors that account for the reduced autism risk, DeVilbiss said. \nContinued Ideally, a trial that randomly assigns women to multivitamins or no supplements could pin down whether vitamins really reduce autism risk, she said. \nFor the study, DeVilbiss and her colleagues collected data on 273,107 mother and child pairs from Stockholm.\nThe children were born between 1996 and 2007 and were followed at least to age 4 and to 15 in some cases.\nMothers reported their use of folic acid, iron and multivitamin supplements at their first prenatal visit. Cases of child autism spectrum disorder were identified using national registers.\nThe research team took into account other factors that might influence the health of mothers and children, and said only multivitamin use appeared to explain the difference in autism cases.\nEvidence that iron or folic acid lowered the risk of autism was not consistent, DeVilbiss said.\nHowever, the study may suffer from several limitations, the researchers said. For one, it was not known which supplements the women took, the timing or the doses. \nEven so, \"pregnant women should take multivitamins,\" said Dr. Ruth Milanaik, director of the neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up program at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\n\"In addition, women should continue to take their vitamins after pregnancy while they are breast-feeding,\" said Milanaik, who wasn't involved in the study. \nThe report was published Oct. 4 in the medical journal the BMJ .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T21:41:52.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19341ee94450b0ed0b1587cdcddabddafde19944", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OHE4jHDgJCzEccotuZnjlNRhs_Xq7huz8bjS4tHfwBPVszbRDX1.SCNwWoSfyyjO5GDET0536efR9WnH1K1f1ySnRK88em2BRfIqnLArMVHPE1nSWrBpmOk-", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Scientists Learn How Flu Virus Changes So Quickly \u2013 WebMD", "title_full": "Scientists Learn How Flu Virus Changes So Quickly \u2013 WebMD", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.183, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 0, "shares": 14}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19341ee94450b0ed0b1587cdcddabddafde19944", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OHE4jHDgJCzEccotuZnjlNRhs_Xq7huz8bjS4tHfwBPVszbRDX1.SCNwWoSfyyjO5GDET0536efR9WnH1K1f1ySnRK88em2BRfIqnLArMVHPE1nSWrBpmOk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Scientists Learn How Flu Virus Changes So Quickly \u2013 WebMD", "text": "Scientists Learn How Flu Virus Changes So Quickly Interrupting that process could lead to better ways to treat or prevent flu \nBy Robert Preidt \nHealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, Oct. 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists have pinpointed a mechanism that helps flu viruses mutate rapidly, which could lead to new ways to fight the flu . \nBecause flu viruses mutate quickly, flu vaccines have to be redesigned every year. \nThe MIT researchers found that to mutate rapidly, flu viruses use a group of proteins called chaperones in infected cells in the host (a person or animal with the flu). \nBlocking flu viruses from using the host cells' chaperones could help prevent the viruses from developing resistance to existing drugs and vaccines , the study authors said. \n\"It's relatively easy to make a drug that kills a virus, or an antibody that stops a virus from propagating, but it's very hard to make one that the virus doesn't promptly escape from once you start using it,\" senior study author Matthew Shoulders, an associate professor of chemistry, said in an MIT news release. \n\"Our data suggest that, at some point in the future, targeting host chaperones might restrict the ability of a virus to evolve and allow us to kill viruses before they become drug-resistant,\" he said. \nThe study was published recently in the journal eLife .

She is with the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, in Germany.\nDr. Luana Colloca, a researcher at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, agreed.\n\"This is not merely a reflection of people's biases,\" said Colloca, who wrote an editorial published with the study.\n\"Expectations do modulate symptoms and patients' responses to treatment,\" she said.\nFor the study, Tinnermann's team recruited 49 healthy volunteers and randomly assigned them to test one of two itch-relieving \"medical creams.\"\nIn reality, both creams were identical and contained no active ingredients. However, people in both groups were told that the products could have the side effect of making the skin more sensitive to pain.\nThere was only one apparent difference between the two phony creams: One came in fancy packing with a high price tag; the other was cheap.\nAfter participants applied the creams to their forearms, the researchers had them undergo a standard test that measured their tolerance for heat-induced pain.\nIt turned out that people who'd used the expensive cream were more sensitive to pain during the tests. On average, their pain rating hovered around a 15 -- within the \"mild\" pain range -- whereas people using the cheap cream barely registered any discomfort.\nContinued It's likely, Tinnermann said, that people expect a pricey medication to be potent -- which could also make them expect more side effects.\nColloca agreed. We are all \"vulnerable\" to such outside influences, she said, be it a drug's price or how it's given (by IV versus mouth, for instance).\nHowever, we are not just imagining those placebo or nocebo effects, both researchers noted.\nUsing functional MRI brain scans, Tinnermann's team found specific patterns of nervous system activity in people who had a nocebo response to the pricey cream.\nThat included a change in \"communication\" between certain brain structures and the spinal cord, Tinnermann said.\nAccording to Colloca, research like this can have practical uses. Doctors could, for instance, inform patients that drug prices or other factors can sway their expectations about a treatment's benefits and risks -- and that, in turn, can influence whether they feel better or develop side effects.\nThere is, however, no research into whether that kind of knowledge helps prevent patients from the nocebo effect, Tinnermann said.\nBut, she added, health professionals can be aware that patients' expectations \"play a huge role in medicine\" -- and be mindful of how they talk about a medication and its possible side effects.\nIt's an important matter, Colloca said, because the nocebo effect can cause people to stop taking needed medications.\nColloca pointed to the example of cholesterol-lowering statins.\nThe potential for those medications to cause muscle pain has been widely reported. And one recent study found evidence that this knowledge can make statin users more likely to report muscle pain side effects.\nOther research, Colloca said, has shown that when people stop taking their statins, their risk of heart attack and stroke rises.\nThe new study was published in the Oct. 6 issue of Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T02:24:39.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de23079e96b640a04bfd1b53b29e168e5d440e0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OL3W7vP9O6u66hRZbW_EowZYbZsPU3FJn03rLVfhlDvuBgsQBRf5vOLTelt8AgJo4OSOuJDchBVkv.J963jn5bQLpgJ4RgXw5w--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://conservativeangle.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Conservative Angle", "title": "11 Possible Heart Symptoms You Shouldn't Ignore", "title_full": "11 Possible Heart Symptoms You Shouldn't Ignore", "published": "2017-10-06T02:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/thumbnails_daily_images/2010/01_2010/6_serious_heart_symptoms_you_shouldnt_ignore.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 23, "comments": 0, "shares": 23}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 35}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de23079e96b640a04bfd1b53b29e168e5d440e0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OL3W7vP9O6u66hRZbW_EowZYbZsPU3FJn03rLVfhlDvuBgsQBRf5vOLTelt8AgJo4OSOuJDchBVkv.J963jn5bQLpgJ4RgXw5w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EdJenner", "published": "2017-10-06T02:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "11 Possible Heart Symptoms You Shouldn't Ignore", "text": "WebMD article on 11 possible symptoms of heart problems that you may not be aware of, such as dizziness, fatigue, and nausea.

In all, U.S. consumers will spend more than $437 million on melatonin supplements in 2017, up from $159 million in 2010, according to Nutrition Business Journal . More than 3 million adults and a half-million children take it, and that number is expected to grow as more sleep -deprived families clamor for cheap \u201cnatural\u201d remedies.\nBut with such growth also come concerns that consumers have an oversimplified view of the potent, complex hormone . Taken at the right time, in the right dose, it can, indeed, repair a sleep schedule thrown off kilter by jet lag, a long weekend filled with late nights, or certain circadian rhythm disorders .\nBut for insomnia that happens now and then, research shows its effectiveness is limited. And some fear that if misused, it may do harm.\nExperts also question how safe it is for children. Australian experts called the increase in use among children \u201calarming\u201d and warned in 2015 that parents shouldn\u2019t give it to their children.\n\u201cA lot of people just take it right before they go to bed as if it were a sleeping pill,\u201d says Michael Breus, PhD, a California-based clinical psychologist who specializes in sleep disorders. \u201cIt\u2019s not that simple.\u201d\nWorks for Some, Not for Others Discovered in 1958, melatonin is a potent hormone naturally produced in the body to help regulate our circadian rhythm, or natural body clock. Light is the switch that controls it: As daylight fades, levels of melatonin begin to rise about 2 hours before bedtime, nudging us to become sleepy. In the morning, when light hits the eyes, it signals the brain to halt melatonin production, and we grow alert.\n\u201cMelatonin is a sleep regulator, not a sleep initiator,\u201d explains Breus, author of \u201cGood Night: The Doctor\u2019s 4-week Program to Better Sleep and Better Health.\u201d\nSince the 1980s, dietary supplement makers have billed melatonin made in a lab as a promising sleep aid. But its effects on occasional insomnia are not significant.\nIt works for some people, but not for others. You just have to try it and find out which one you are.\nAlfred Lewy, MD, Oregon Health & Science University One review of 15 studies involving 284 subjects found that those who took melatonin before bed fell asleep 3.9 minutes faster on average and slept 13 minutes longer. Another, of 19 studies involving 1,700 people, found melatonin users fell asleep 7 minutes faster on average and slept 8 minutes longer.\n\u201cWhen you are already making melatonin naturally at night, taking a little bit more exogenously is kind of like spitting in the ocean. It doesn\u2019t do much,\u201d says Cathy Goldstein, MD, an assistant professor of neurology Michigan Sleep Medicine Clinic.\nAlfred Lewy, MD, professor emeritus at Oregon Health & Science University and a pioneer in melatonin research, says he has found that a larger dose (3 mg) can promote sleep, but only in about one-third of people who take it. \u201cIt works for some people, but not for others. You just have to try it and find out which one you are.\u201d\nExperts do agree that melatonin can have a big effect on treating circadian rhythm disorders like delayed sleep phase disorder (extreme night owls), advanced sleep phase disorder (extreme morning larks), or shift work disorder. In these cases, the body makes melatonin too late or too early, creating a mismatch between when the person should sleep and when they feel like it.\n\u201cSay you are an extreme night owl who only begins to feel sleepy at 4 a.m. and likes to sleep until noon. You could take low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg) at 11 p.m., well before your natural melatonin kicks in. Not only will it help you feel sleepy earlier, it will start to pull your internal clock earlier too,\u201d explains Goldstein.\nMelatonin also works great for jet lag from eastward travel, says Breus, who recommends taking 0.5 mg of melatonin 90 minutes before bedtime in the place you\u2019re traveling to.\nAfter a weekend of staying up late and sleeping in, a low (0.3 mg) dose of melatonin late Sunday afternoon can also help you get to sleep at a regular hour and avoid the \u201cMonday morning blues\u201d that often happen when your days off disrupt your body clock, says Lewy. (Caution: If you are one of those people melatonin makes sleepy, don\u2019t drive after taking it).\nHis research also suggests that for some patients, as little as 0.3 mg of melatonin daily in the late afternoon may ease symptoms of winter depression brought on by shorter days and shifting circadian rhythms. But because a small number of people respond better when taking the melatonin in the morning, he only recommends its use for this purpose under a doctor\u2019s guidance.\n\u201cThe challenge with melatonin is that it\u2019s complicated. If you take it at the wrong time, it can shift your body clock in the wrong direction, and that can cause problems,\u201d Lewy says.\nSafety Concerns on the Rise While short-term use (a few months or less) of melatonin is thought to be safe in healthy adults, it can boost blood sugar, so it is not recommended for people with diabetes, Goldstein says. Taking too much can also lead to bad dreams and grogginess the next day, and it can make many drugs less effective, including high blood pressure medications, seizure medications, and birth control pills, Breus says.\nBecause dietary supplements are not regulated as much as prescription drugs, quality can vary wildly from bottle to bottle. One recent study found that 71% of melatonin supplements surveyed did not contain exactly what they said on the label. Some had more than four times as much melatonin as indicated, and 26% contained the powerful neurotransmitter serotonin, a chemical found in many antidepressant medications.\nWhen it comes to children\u2019s use, concerns abound.\nThe American Association of Poison Control Centers reports that calls about melatonin have skyrocketed 114% nationwide since 2012, with 79% of the 24,000 calls in 2016 involving children. Parents often call poison control after their children have taken it unintentionally or taken too much. That can lead to nausea, diarrhea, headaches, changes in mood, lasting sleepiness the next day, and bedwetting, experts say.\nExperts are also not sure if using melatonin would harm children.\nWe really don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s safe to take long-term.\nCathy Goldstein, MD, assistant professor of neurology, University of Michigan Sleep Medicine Clinic In 2015, researchers from Australia published a study pointing to research that linked melatonin use on rodents to changes in puberty. The report also notes that in the early 1990s, scientists were looking into high doses of melatonin as possible human birth control because of the way it could affect the reproductive system.\nThe findings were in animals, and no research to date has shown similar effects in children.\n\"Considering the small advances melatonin provides to the timing of sleep, and considering what we know about how melatonin works in the body, it is not worth the risk to child and adolescent safety,\" warned lead author David Kennaway, head of the Circadian Physiology Laboratory Adelaide's Robinson Research Institute.\nSome research has shown that children with developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have low nighttime melatonin levels that may help cause poor sleep patterns. If it's well-timed and under the supervision of a doctor, melatonin may help normalize their sleep and daytime behavior, Breus notes.\nBreus says he would not use melatonin on otherwise healthy kids. There is little research, however, on melatonin's safety for children.\nCraig Canapari, MD, who directs the Yale Pediatric Sleep Center, says while he shares Kennaway\u2019s concerns, he has \u201cseen first hand the consequences of poor sleep on children and families.\u201d He writes on his blog that he often uses it, but his goal it to help children get to sleep with as few medications as possible. He says it may be an option if:\nBehavioral changes haven\u2019t worked Other medicals causes of insomnia have been ruled out Your doctor thinks it is safe and willing to work with you on using it And for adults with body clocks thrown off for one reason or another, it is absolutely worth trying, experts say.\nJust choose your brand wisely, keep your dose well under 3 mg to avoid bad side effects, and once your sleep schedule is back on track, stop taking it.\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know yet if it\u2019s safe to take long-term,\u201d says Goldstein.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T03:20:40.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63b9c61fef18bf9a1fd92051d7a751b38721fc81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OMhCBQ8BCqh._WAm66IsjuG2UldFcUOi5T_xg6VqaX8D4k_d92X.1u4BefGshfcaC3diBXH7yXrOqvWNwJeu.i3lhoSRyRW9PJOYVGKGM0PG", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "title_full": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.103, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 117, "comments": 0, "shares": 117}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63b9c61fef18bf9a1fd92051d7a751b38721fc81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3OMhCBQ8BCqh._WAm66IsjuG2UldFcUOi5T_xg6VqaX8D4k_d92X.1u4BefGshfcaC3diBXH7yXrOqvWNwJeu.i3lhoSRyRW9PJOYVGKGM0PG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Faster Test Coming for Antibiotics Against UTIs?", "text": "By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter\nWEDNESDAY, Oct. 4, Urinary tract infections (UTIs) plague millions of Americans each year. Now, researchers say they've developed a test that can tell in minutes whether or not a particular antibiotic can clear up the problem.\nThe issue is an important one, doctors say, since many of the bacteria behind UTIs have grown resistant to certain antibiotics . And, left untreated, these infections can have serious effects, especially in the frail and elderly.\n\"We live in an era of multidrug-resistant bacteria, so-called 'superbugs' that can cause life-threatening infections,\" said infectious disease specialist Dr. Sunil Sood, who reviewed the new study.\n\"Modern molecular techniques to distinguish bacteria that are resistant from those that are susceptible to common antibiotics could be lifesaving,\" said Sood. He is chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y.\nAccording to the study authors, current urine tests can rapidly spot a UTI , but it can still take days for the exact germs -- and the proper antibiotic to use against them -- to be identified.\nIn the new study, researchers led by Nathan Schoepp, of the California Institute of Technology, developed a new way of analyzing germs in urine samples. Instead of isolating germs and waiting for them to grow, the researchers used a \"DNA amplification\" technique to analyze the bacteria's genome, or \"genetic blueprint.\"\nThe investigators tested the new screen out on 51 urine samples containing either antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic-susceptible strains of bacteria.\nReporting in the Oct. 4 issue of Science Translational Medicine , Schoepp's team said the new test can render results in less than 30 minutes. Those results confirmed that urine samples held germs that were either susceptible or resistant to two common antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and nitrofurantoin (Macrobid, Furadantin and Macrodantin).\nAccording to the researchers, the test might also prove useful in other areas of treatment of infectious disease.\nSood said that, if this work pans out, it could be a real advance in care.\n\"The technique used by Schoepp and colleagues has the potential to identify such bacteria within the time frame of an office or emergency room visit,\" he explained. \"If further developed, this method could help doctors to more rapidly treat infections with the right antibiotics.\"\nDr. Howard Selinger directs family medicine at Quinnipiac University's Frank D. Netter MD School of Medicine in Hamden, Conn. He agreed that the new test could speed care, but said cost is a concern, too.\n\"We must demonstrate that directed therapy delivers better value, by improving quality and lowering overall cost,\" Selinger said. \"This will allow for insurance coverage and not cause patients to bear the brunt of the cost of this new technology.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T06:53:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a4670b5ea2cd70cebfb31325de6544f14742e5ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcrrQfw395J3EJ035uPp1tjt8vE5Os6vlYddYHgzJNsEDXiTt0EAMJU.n_anQkJMBZ0T5EuJTnJ6BgsnSAxON9tZq_ZoaHB8om8vpTKYZjMg--", "site_full": "pets.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "55 in 12 States Hit With Puppy Poop Infections", "title_full": "55 in 12 States Hit With Puppy Poop Infections", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 1.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 158, "comments": 0, "shares": 158}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4670b5ea2cd70cebfb31325de6544f14742e5ad", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRcrrQfw395J3EJ035uPp1tjt8vE5Os6vlYddYHgzJNsEDXiTt0EAMJU.n_anQkJMBZ0T5EuJTnJ6BgsnSAxON9tZq_ZoaHB8om8vpTKYZjMg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "55 in 12 States Hit With Puppy Poop Infections", "text": "55 in 12 States Hit With Puppy Poop Infections CDC says bacteria can be transmitted by handling dogs \nBy Robert Preidt \nHealthDay Reporter \nFRIDAY, Oct. 6, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Cute, yes, but touching them might send you to the hospital. \nPuppies are transmitting potentially deadly Campylobacter bacteria infections via contaminated poop to the humans who handle them, with 55 people now sickened in an outbreak reaching across 12 states. \nIn the latest update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency says cases rose from 39 in mid-September to 55 reported by Tuesday. \n\"Evidence suggests that puppies sold through Petland are a likely source of this outbreak,\" the CDC said in a news release issued Sept 11. \"Petland is cooperating with public health and animal health officials to address this outbreak.\" \nSince mid-September, \"four more hospitalizations have been reported, bringing the total to 13,\" the CDC said in its Tuesday update, but so far \"no deaths have been reported.\" \nCampylobacter infections linked to the puppies have now been reported between September 2016 and October 2017 in Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri, New Hampshire, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming, the CDC said. \nCampylobacter is a bacteria that causes people to develop diarrhea (sometimes bloody), cramping, abdominal pain and fever within two to five days of exposure to the organism, said Dr. Sophia Jan, director of general pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. \nThis is a common cause of diarrhea in the United States, she said. \n\"The illness typically lasts about a week without treatment,\" Jan said. But for people with compromised immune systems, campylobacter infections can be life-threatening, she added. \nMost cases in humans occur from eating raw or undercooked chicken, or eating foods that have been cross-contaminated by infected poultry products, Jan noted. \nHowever, humans can get infected from contact with the stool of an infected puppy, she added. \nMany of the people sickened in this outbreak were Petland employees, while others had either bought a Petland puppy, shopped at Petland or visited someone who had purchased a puppy from Petland, the CDC said. \nInfected dogs may or may not show signs of illness, such as diarrhea, vomiting or a fever, so it's important to take precautions when around dogs, the CDC says. \nTo prevent catching campylobacter from dogs, the CDC advises that you: Wash your hands thoroughly after touching dogs, their poop, or their food. Take extra care that children wash their hands carefully after playing with puppies or dogs. Pick up and dispose of dog poop, especially in areas where children might play. Contact your veterinarian if you notice any signs of illness in your puppy or dog.

This leaves them unable to manufacture a protein that helps break down certain fatty acids. Acid buildup then begins to attack nerves, muscles and the brain . \nMost boys with the disease do not reach adulthood. \nUntil now, the only viable treatment has been a kind of stem cell therapy , but it comes with dangers and only one in five boys with the disease can find a suitable stem cell donor. \nBut the new gene therapy , reported online Oct. 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine , gets around that problem. Doctors remove the boy's own stem cells, genetically alter them in the lab so they now carry the missing gene behind adrenoleukodystrophy, and then inject the altered stem cells back into the patient. \nFifteen of the 17 boys who tried the therapy in the new study are neurologically stable and have no disability two years later, according to a team led by Dr. Florian Eichler, of Harvard Medical School in Boston. All of the boys had a severe form of the disease, affecting the brain. \nWriting in a journal editorial, Dr. Marc Engelen, of Emma Children's Hospital in Amsterdam, said that he believes the treatment \"will have a positive impact on the lives of our patients.\" \n\"For many years, gene therapy has shown great promise, but clinical applications have always seemed just beyond the horizon,\" Engelen wrote. But the new approach \"appears to be poised as a real treatment option for cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy,\" he added. \nPaul and Liliana Rojas, of Dover Plains, N.Y., have two sons -- Brian, 7, and Brandon, 10 -- affected by adrenoleukodystrophy. Because the therapy is only effective when used early in the disease, Brian was able to get the treatment while his older brother was not, the couple told the Associated Press . Continued \nAccording to his parents, Brandon appeared to be a typical child until about the age of 7, when he began to drool and experience learning problems at school. His adrenoleukodystrophy diagnosis came three years ago, and at the time doctors advised that Brian get tested, too. \n\"We were driving to one of the Disney parks and had to pull over to get the call,\" Paul Rojas told the AP . \"Once we got off the phone, we both looked at each other and said we need to move forward now and save our younger son any way we can.\" \nThe new treatment is likely to be expensive. According to Engelen, a similar therapy, used for another rare disease, had a price tag over about $1 million per patient. \nAccording to the AP , costs for the boys treated in the study were covered by government grants and the therapy's maker, Bluebird Bio Inc., of Cambridge, Mass. \nAnd not all of the boys benefited, the researchers noted. Two of the 17 boys died -- one from the disease itself, and the other from complications linked to a donor transplant after the boy had withdrawn from the study. \nWill this treatment receive approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration? Current FDA rules require that outcomes for gene therapy recipients be tracked for 15 years, so the boys in the Boston trial will continue to be monitored. Speaking to the AP , lead researcher Dr. David Williams said that eight more boys are being enrolled into the study as Bluebird seeks approval for the treatment in the United States and Europe. \nAdrenoleukodystrophy first came to public attention with the release of the movie \"Lorenzo's Oil\" in 1992. The film depicted the true-life fight of one couple to develop their own treatment from olive and rapeseed oils to help their son, Lorenzo. While the treatment didn't turn out to be a cure, Lorenzo died in 2008 at age 30, two decades longer than most patients' expected lifespan.

It most likely starts in the womb, and the mother's diet during pregnancy might have an influence, DeVilbiss said. \nThomas Frazier is chief science officer of Autism Speaks, an advocacy group. \"The finding of multivitamin use associated with lower risk of autism spectrum disorder with intellectual disability is consistent with previous studies,\" he said. \nExpectant mothers and women planning to become pregnant should talk with their doctors and follow the physician's recommendations, Frazier said. \nThose trying to conceive \"may benefit from starting multivitamin supplementation before getting pregnant,\" he said. \nHowever, DeVilbiss said it's too early to recommend multivitamins specifically for lowering autism risk. \n\"From a single study, we can't make any definitive statement or policy recommendations, because the results of other studies have been inconsistent,\" she said. \nBecause the study was observational, it's possible that women who take a multivitamin during pregnancy might engage in other healthy behaviors that account for the reduced autism risk, DeVilbiss said. Continued \nIdeally, a trial that randomly assigns women to multivitamins or no supplements could pin down whether vitamins really reduce autism risk, she said. \nFor the study, DeVilbiss and her colleagues collected data on 273,107 mother and child pairs from Stockholm. \nThe children were born between 1996 and 2007 and were followed at least to age 4 and to 15 in some cases. \nMothers reported their use of folic acid, iron and multivitamin supplements at their first prenatal visit. Cases of child autism spectrum disorder were identified using national registers. \nThe research team took into account other factors that might influence the health of mothers and children, and said only multivitamin use appeared to explain the difference in autism cases. \nEvidence that iron or folic acid lowered the risk of autism was not consistent, DeVilbiss said. \nHowever, the study may suffer from several limitations, the researchers said. For one, it was not known which supplements the women took, the timing or the doses. \nEven so, \"pregnant women should take multivitamins,\" said Dr. Ruth Milanaik, director of the neonatal neurodevelopmental follow-up program at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y. \n\"In addition, women should continue to take their vitamins after pregnancy while they are breast-feeding,\" said Milanaik, who wasn't involved in the study. \nThe report was published Oct. 4 in the medical journal the BMJ .

Treatment-related worries might make you feel sick \nBy Amy Norton \nHealthDay Reporter \nTHURSDAY, Oct. 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Pricey drugs may make people more vulnerable to perceiving side effects, a new study suggests -- and the phenomenon is not just \"in their heads.\" \nThe study delved into the so-called \"nocebo effect.\" It's the negative version of the well-known placebo effect, where people feel better after receiving a therapy because they expected good things. \nWith the nocebo effect, patients' worries over treatment side effects make them feel sick. \nIn this study, researchers found that people were more likely to report painful side effects from a fake drug when told it was expensive. \nBut it wasn't just something people were \"making up.\" Using brain imaging, the researchers traced the phenomenon to specific activity patterns in the brain and spine . \n\"These findings are a strong argument against the perception of placebo and nocebo effects as being only 'fake' effects -- created purely by imagination or delusions of the patient,\" said lead researcher Alexandra Tinnermann. She is with the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, in Germany. \nDr. Luana Colloca, a researcher at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, agreed. \n\"This is not merely a reflection of people's biases,\" said Colloca, who wrote an editorial published with the study. \n\"Expectations do modulate symptoms and patients' responses to treatment,\" she said. \nFor the study, Tinnermann's team recruited 49 healthy volunteers and randomly assigned them to test one of two itch-relieving \"medical creams.\" \nIn reality, both creams were identical and contained no active ingredients. However, people in both groups were told that the products could have the side effect of making the skin more sensitive to pain. \nThere was only one apparent difference between the two phony creams: One came in fancy packing with a high price tag; the other was cheap. \nAfter participants applied the creams to their forearms, the researchers had them undergo a standard test that measured their tolerance for heat-induced pain. \nIt turned out that people who'd used the expensive cream were more sensitive to pain during the tests. On average, their pain rating hovered around a 15 -- within the \"mild\" pain range -- whereas people using the cheap cream barely registered any discomfort. Continued \nIt's likely, Tinnermann said, that people expect a pricey medication to be potent -- which could also make them expect more side effects. \nColloca agreed. We are all \"vulnerable\" to such outside influences, she said, be it a drug's price or how it's given (by IV versus mouth, for instance). \nHowever, we are not just imagining those placebo or nocebo effects, both researchers noted. \nUsing functional MRI brain scans, Tinnermann's team found specific patterns of nervous system activity in people who had a nocebo response to the pricey cream. \nThat included a change in \"communication\" between certain brain structures and the spinal cord, Tinnermann said. \nAccording to Colloca, research like this can have practical uses. Doctors could, for instance, inform patients that drug prices or other factors can sway their expectations about a treatment's benefits and risks -- and that, in turn, can influence whether they feel better or develop side effects. \nThere is, however, no research into whether that kind of knowledge helps prevent patients from the nocebo effect, Tinnermann said. \nBut, she added, health professionals can be aware that patients' expectations \"play a huge role in medicine\" -- and be mindful of how they talk about a medication and its possible side effects. \nIt's an important matter, Colloca said, because the nocebo effect can cause people to stop taking needed medications. \nColloca pointed to the example of cholesterol-lowering statins. \nThe potential for those medications to cause muscle pain has been widely reported. And one recent study found evidence that this knowledge can make statin users more likely to report muscle pain side effects. \nOther research, Colloca said, has shown that when people stop taking their statins, their risk of heart attack and stroke rises. \nThe new study was published in the Oct. 6 issue of Science .

Forgoing morning meal may reduce cardiac health and boost odds for diabetes, study suggests \nBy Amy Norton \nHealthDay Reporter \nMONDAY, Oct. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Middle-aged adults who routinely skip breakfast are more likely to have clogged heart arteries than those who enjoy a big morning meal, a new study finds. \nThe findings are the latest to link breakfast to better heart health . \nThey suggest that people who eat breakfast -- especially a hearty one -- are less likely to harbor plaques in their arteries. \nPlaques are deposits of fat, calcium and other substances that can build up in arteries, causing them to harden and narrow -- a condition called atherosclerosis . Atherosclerosis can lead to heart attacks , strokes and other complications. \nThe new study does not prove that skipping breakfast directly harms people's arteries. \n\"It's not that you skip breakfast, you get plaques,\" said senior researcher Jose Penalvo, of Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston. \nBut, he said, there are several reasons that forgoing the morning meal could contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis. \nFor many people, skipping breakfast is part of a \"cluster\" of bad habits, said Penalvo. These people tend to eat out a lot, and opt for nutritionally dubious convenience foods, for instance. \nOn top of that, Penalvo said, skipping breakfast may have negative effects on appetite-regulating hormones, blood sugar and insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar). \nPrior studies have shown that breakfast fans are less likely to be obese or have diabetes or heart disease. \nBut the current study actually used objective tests, Penalvo said. The researchers used ultrasound to screen middle-aged adults for \"subclinical\" atherosclerosis -- early plaque buildup that is not causing any symptoms. \nThe study included more than 4,000 adults ages 40 to 54 from Spain. Three percent were chronic breakfast-skippers, while 27 percent regularly had a big breakfast. That meant they ate more than 20 percent of their daily calories at their morning meal. \nMost people -- 70 percent -- ate a relatively low-calorie breakfast. \nIt turned out that those three groups also differed in their odds of subclinical atherosclerosis. \nNearly 75 percent of breakfast-skippers showed such plaque buildup. That compared with 57 percent of people who ate a big breakfast, and 64 percent of those who favored a light one. Continued \nBreakfast fans were healthier in many ways, the study found. They generally ate more fruits and vegetables, seafood and lean meat, for instance. They were also less likely to be obese or have high blood pressure, diabetes or unhealthy cholesterol levels. \nBut even with all those factors weighed, breakfast-skipping, itself, was still tied to a higher risk of atherosclerosis. \nKim Larson is a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \nShe said the findings are important, in part, because many adults -- around 30 percent -- routinely skip breakfast. \nAnd some people, she noted, purposely cut out breakfast when they're trying to lose weight. \nThat's a bad idea, Larson explained, because of the effects on appetite and eating habits the rest of the day. \n\"People who skip breakfast generally make up for it later in the day,\" said Larson, who wasn't involved in the study. In the end, she said, they typically down more calories over the course of the day, versus people who eat breakfast. \nThe current study did not dig into the nutritional quality of people's breakfast choices. But when it comes to preventing disease, Larson said, \"quality matters.\" \nA bagel and coffee is \"better than nothing,\" she noted. However, Larson recommended that breakfast include a healthy mix of protein, carbohydrates and fat. \nShe acknowledged that time is an obstacle. Many people are rushed in the morning and end up eating a muffin in the car. \nBut breakfast does not need to be extravagant to be healthy, Larson said. Some of her suggestions: oatmeal with nuts and fruit; whole-grain toast with nut butter; granola mixed with yogurt and fruit; and apple slices with peanut butter. \nPenalvo encouraged people to look at it this way: Eating a healthy breakfast is actually an enjoyable way to potentially curb your heart disease risk. \n\"This is a really positive message,\" he said. \nOf course, breakfast is not a stand-alone solution. Penalvo said it should be part of a generally healthy diet and other good habits such as regular exercise. \nThe findings were published Oct. 2 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .

Mundell \nHealthDay Reporter \nMONDAY, Oct. 2, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- As news pours in from Las Vegas on the record level of carnage inflicted by a shooter at yet another crowded public event, psychiatrists urge young people and their parents to not give way to fear. \nMedia reports say retiree Stephen Paddock, of Mesquite, Nev., killed at least 58 people and injured more than 500 at a crowded country music festival on the Las Vegas strip late Sunday. Police later found Paddock dead in his hotel room near the scene of the shooting. \nThe horrific killings come on the heels of other senseless tragedies perpetrated on young people who were simply enjoying a night out. Twenty-two attendees at an Ariana Grande concert were killed in Manchester, U.K., this past May, and 49 revelers were shot down in 2016 at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. \nIn the aftermath of these bloody and random attacks on young people at festive gatherings, the nerves of young would-be concertgoers or club attendees are bound to be frayed, psychiatrists say. \nCertainly, \"for those attending the concert in Las Vegas, their life will be marked as 'before' or 'after' the concert,\" said Dr. Victor Fornari. He directs child and adolescent psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital, in Glen Oaks, N.Y. \n\"For those who were injured or lost a loved one, the impact of the event may be traumatic,\" Fornari said. \"Trauma coupled with loss may lead to a traumatic bereavement, often colored by so many complex emotions.\" \nAnd for those who witnessed the attack but survived, the psychological impact can be severe, he said. At these moments, the close support of family is key, as is the services of a trained trauma counselor, Fornari said. \nAnd what about the millions of young Americans who simply learned of the carnage via media? \nAccording to Fornari, people should remember that thousands of concerts and other group events occur nationwide every day, and the chances of encountering violence at any one event remain extremely slim. \n\"Parents need to recognize that attending a concert is generally a safe event,\" he said. \"The acts of violence we have seen are rare events, and should not interfere with young people from attending concerts.\" Continued \nDr. Matthew Lorber, a psychiatrist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. \n\"It is natural for parents to be fearful [after such events], but they have to be careful to not teach teens to be afraid of everything, but rather teach teens smart safety precautions,\" he said. \n\"You do not want your children to be afraid of going out to crowded events for the rest of their lives, and even worse have them avoiding doing it out of fear,\" Lorber said. \"The long-term effects of being exposed to these fear-invoking events can be traumatic, and it is important for parents to limit teens' exposures, and have an open dialogue answering all questions.\" \nAgreeing with Fornari, Lorber stressed that for the average young American, \"these events are very rare, and the chances of something happening at an event they are at are almost zero.\" \nAnd how should concerned parents address the fears of younger children? \nAccording to Lorber, \"It is inappropriate to talk about these things to children under 8, although at times they cannot be avoided because of peers talking about them. In that case, parents should address children's concerns, but reinforce that they are safe, their parents will protect them, and there are many more good people in the world who try and help others.\" WebMD News from HealthDay Sources SOURCES: Victor Fornari, M.D., director, child and adolescent psychiatry, Zucker Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, N.Y., and Cohen Children's Medical Center, New Hyde Park, N.Y.; Matthew Lorber, M.D., psychiatrist, Lenox Hill Hospital; Washington Post ; The New York Times Copyright \u00a9 2013-2017 HealthDay.

It requires an outsized amount of oxygen and other nutrients,\" said Fargo, who wasn't involved with the study. \"Because of that, there's a very, very rich blood delivery system in the brain. Anything that happens to compromise that is going to compromise the overall health and function of the brain.\"\nBecause of that, it stands to reason that long-term exposure to high blood pressure could leave one more vulnerable to dementia as they enter old age, Gilsanz said.\nGilsanz and her colleagues reviewed the records of more than 5,600 patients of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system, tracking them from 1996 onward for an average 15 years to see who developed dementia.\nThey found that people with high blood pressure in their 30s did not appear to have any increased risk of dementia.\nBut women who developed high blood pressure in their 40s did have an increased risk of dementia, even after the researchers adjusted for other factors like smoking, diabetes and excess weight.\nHowever, the study did not prove that early high blood pressure caused dementia risk to rise in women, just that there was an association.\nContinued Men did not have a similar risk from high blood pressure in their 40s, but that could be because they were more likely to die before they grew old enough to suffer from dementia, Gilsanz noted.\nOther factors such as genetic differences, lifestyle differences and sex-specific hormones also might separate men and women when it comes to dementia risk associated with high blood pressure, Fargo said.\n\"It's really interesting to see there was an association among women but not men,\" Gilsanz said. \"Given that women have higher rates of dementia than men, understanding why this may be is a large area of interest for us. Future research should really look at sex-specific pathways that might be at play, to disentangle the risk factors for men and women.\"\nFargo said it makes sense that people with long-term exposure to high blood pressure would be more likely to develop dementia.\n\"Your dementia risk is really a lifelong thing,\" Fargo said. \"People think about dementia in late life, because that's when it's common to see the clinical symptoms. But everything that is setting you up for cognitive decline is occurring throughout your life.\"\nBut Fargo sees this as an opportunity, given that high blood pressure can be controlled with medication and lifestyle changes.\n\"These modifiable risk factors are the most powerful weapons we have in our arsenal to fight dementia,\" he said. \"It's a target that is addressable.\"\nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the journal Neurology .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T19:04:30.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b41d754feaf7eac7e7ca3eecf47624ffed3f4dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ONrfcf3wQHtP_GV4Qe6F81LOivzN6dKZqxb0Z3Es5XwdBZUJmJJHCCmU_2xNumTEr9yRVpznytJoFRZhm_cFKbSKJhWdevzCSw--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "", "title": "Recall: Ground Turkey at Publix, Aldi, Weis", "title_full": "Recall: Ground Turkey at Publix, Aldi, Weis", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.12, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/news/2017/10_2017/ground_turkey_recall/650x350_ground_turkey_recall.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 300, "comments": 0, "shares": 300}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b41d754feaf7eac7e7ca3eecf47624ffed3f4dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ONrfcf3wQHtP_GV4Qe6F81LOivzN6dKZqxb0Z3Es5XwdBZUJmJJHCCmU_2xNumTEr9yRVpznytJoFRZhm_cFKbSKJhWdevzCSw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kristen", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Recall: Ground Turkey at Publix, Aldi, Weis", "text": "Recall: Ground Turkey at Publix, Aldi, Weis By Kristen Linsalata \nOct. 3, 2017 -- A North Carolina company is recalling 38,475 pounds of ground turkey that may be contaminated with metal shavings, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). \nPrestage Inc., a supplier for Publix, Aldi, and Weis supermarkets, produced the ground turkey on Sept. 25 and 26. \nFSIS says it heard about the problem on Sept. 27, when someone at one of the stores noticed metal shavings in a package of ground turkey and told the agency.

She\u2019s an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland. \nAccording to the team, \u201cphysicians\u2019 white coats are frequently contaminated, but seldom cleaned.\u201d \nFor that very reason, the United Kingdom already mandates that doctors be \u201cbare below the elbows\u201d as a means of lowering the chance that germs on a dirty coat sleeve will be transmitted to a patient. \nBut is sleeve length really a factor in the transmission of infections? \nTo find out, John\u2019s group had health care workers wear either short- or long-sleeved white coats while examining a mannequin with surfaces that had been contaminated with a harmless-but-communicable virus. \nThe workers then went and examined a second mannequin \u2014 replicating normal hospital \u201crounds\u201d where doctors might visit numerous patients. \nThe researchers then tested both the sleeves and the wrists of each worker for a certain \u201cDNA marker\u201d that indicated the presence of the virus. \nThe result: \u201ccontamination with the DNA marker was detected significantly more often on the sleeves and/or wrists when personnel wore long- versus short-sleeved coats,\u201d the researchers reported. \nIn fact, while virus was detected on none of the sleeves or wrists of 20 workers wearing the short-sleeved coats, it was found on one-quarter (five out of 20) of those donning long sleeves. \nAnd in one of those cases, the virus had made its way to the second mannequin \u2014 showing how a doctor\u2019s sleeve might transmit germs patient-to-patient. \nThe findings add weight to the recommendation for short-sleeved coats for physicians, the researchers noted. Continued \nDr. Alan Mensch is a pulmonologist and senior vice president of medical affairs at Northwell Health\u2019s Syosset Hospital in Syosset, N.Y. Reviewing the findings, he agreed that keeping in-hospital infections to a minimum is crucial. \n\u201cPatients come to the hospital to get well, and it is the hospital\u2019s duty to accomplish that without causing a new infection,\u201d he said. \nHe called the new findings \u201cintriguing,\u201d but said they also raise many questions. \n\u201cThough short sleeves may prevent transmission of [viral] DNA, will they decrease infections?\u201d he wondered. And, \u201cShould we advise health care providers to wash their wrists along with their hands \u2014 and will that decrease infection transmission?\u201d \nThe findings were presented Oct. 4 in San Diego at ID Week, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

The new rules would also affect hundreds of thousands of women who get free contraception under the Affordable Care Act .\nThe expected action from the White House fulfills a promise President Donald Trump made to voters during the 2016 election campaign.\nAccording to the Times , wording in the new rules offers an exemption to any employer based on \"moral convictions\" or because it objects to covering birth control services \"based on its sincerely held religious beliefs.\"\nThe Trump administration wording says that expanding exemptions was needed so that all religious objections to contraceptive coverage could be accommodated. \"Application of the mandate to entities with sincerely held religious objections to it does not serve a compelling governmental interest,\" it says.\nThe birth control mandate was the focus of intense litigation during the Obama Administration, as companies, hospitals, charitable groups and other organizations with moral objections sought to distance themselves from providing birth control to female employees. In one such case, an order of nuns called the Little Sisters of the Poor said the mandate would make them \"morally complicit in grave sin,\" the Times reported.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump told voters that he would \"make absolutely certain religious orders like the Little Sisters of the Poor are not bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs.\"\nBut the new move is expected to prompt even more legal battles -- this time from groups advocating for women and public health.\nContinued In a statement, Dr. Anne Davis, consulting medical director for Physicians for Reproductive Health, said the rollback could send many American women \"back to the days when patients couldn't afford the birth control that helps them live healthier lives.\"\n\"No matter where they work, women need and deserve birth control access,\" Davis said. \"An employer's beliefs have no place in these private decisions, just as they would not in any other conversation about a patient's health care. It's a dangerous intrusion into a woman's privacy and her ability to get the care she needs.\"\nDana Singiser, Planned Parenthood's vice president of public policy and government affairs, agreed.\n\"Let's be clear: this rule has nothing to do with religion. Under the Affordable Care Act religious organizations already have an accommodation that still ensures their employees get coverage through other means,\" she said. \"This rule is about taking away women's fundamental health care, plain and simple.\"\nBut the Trump administration said that in expanding exemptions, it is honoring objections to contraceptive coverage on moral as well as purely religious grounds.\n\"Congress has a consistent history of supporting conscience protections for moral convictions alongside protections for religious beliefs,\" the administration said.\nCompanies that now decide to opt out of contraceptive coverage are required to notify employees, the new rules state.\nThe new rules are to take effect immediately, the Trump administration said, because \"it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to engage in full notice and comment rule-making.\" Public comments are being accepted, however.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T20:41:43.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5b1942b135740f684043884e07398b673ceac46d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8BLv1YYRg8ytCQLLHJRepo.Fy4fasCkd1a4nEdxBMGUn0kewu_SIigvnlfKq_d5GB6gJ.WLuL3tHh0gPNFlKjIlUan310WyQIoLMIjygmfFXHHFnHM0LsZdiSKJyeB4SFw--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://conservativeangle.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "Conservative Angle", "title": "Docs Need Trick Up Their Sleeves To Fight Germs", "title_full": "Docs Need Trick Up Their Sleeves To Fight Germs", "published": "2017-10-06T20:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://conservativeangle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Conservative-Angle-Logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14, "comments": 0, "shares": 14}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5b1942b135740f684043884e07398b673ceac46d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8BLv1YYRg8ytCQLLHJRepo.Fy4fasCkd1a4nEdxBMGUn0kewu_SIigvnlfKq_d5GB6gJ.WLuL3tHh0gPNFlKjIlUan310WyQIoLMIjygmfFXHHFnHM0LsZdiSKJyeB4SFw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "EdJenner", "published": "2017-10-06T20:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Docs Need Trick Up Their Sleeves To Fight Germs", "text": "By EJ Mundell HealthDay Reporter \nFRIDAY, Oct. 6, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- With antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\" continuing to be a threat in U.S. hospitals, doctors are looking for innovative ways to cut down on disease transmission.\nNow, research suggests one solution may be within arm's reach -- literally.\nPhysicians' white coats with sleeves above the elbow were much less likely to have traces of infectious viruses on them than long-sleeved versions, the study found.\n\"These results provide support for the recommendation that health care personnel wear short sleeves to reduce the risk for pathogen transmission,\" concluded a team led by Amrita John. She's an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland.\nAccording to the team, \"physicians' white coats are frequently contaminated, but seldom cleaned.\"\nFor that very reason, the United Kingdom already mandates that doctors be \"bare below the elbows\" as a means of lowering the chance that germs on a dirty coat sleeve will be transmitted to a patient.\nBut is sleeve length really a factor in the transmission of infections?\nTo find out, John's group had health care workers wear either short- or long-sleeved white coats while examining a mannequin with surfaces that had been contaminated with a harmless-but-communicable virus.\nThe workers then went and examined a second mannequin -- replicating normal hospital \"rounds\" where doctors might visit numerous patients.\nThe researchers then tested both the sleeves and the wrists of each worker for a certain \" DNA marker\" that indicated the presence of the virus.\nThe result: \"contamination with the DNA marker was detected significantly more often on the sleeves and/or wrists when personnel wore long- versus short-sleeved coats,\" the researchers reported.\nIn fact, while virus was detected on none of the sleeves or wrists of 20 workers wearing the short-sleeved coats, it was found on one-quarter (five out of 20) of those donning long sleeves.\nAnd in one of those cases, the virus had made its way to the second mannequin -- showing how a doctor's sleeve might transmit germs patient-to-patient.\nThe findings add weight to the recommendation for short-sleeved coats for physicians, the researchers noted.\nContinued Dr. Alan Mensch is a pulmonologist and senior vice president of medical affairs at Northwell Health's Syosset Hospital in Syosset, N.Y. Reviewing the findings, he agreed that keeping in-hospital infections to a minimum is crucial.\n\"Patients come to the hospital to get well, and it is the hospital's duty to accomplish that without causing a new infection,\" he said.\nHe called the new findings \"intriguing,\" but said they also raise many questions.\n\"Though short sleeves may prevent transmission of [viral] DNA, will they decrease infections?\" he wondered. And, \"Should we advise health care providers to wash their wrists along with their hands -- and will that decrease infection transmission?\"\nThe findings were presented Oct. 4 in San Diego at ID Week, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

Calming kids with food can start a vicious, fattening cycle, study says \nBy Randy Dotinga \nHealthDay Reporter \nTUESDAY, April 25, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Soothing your kids with food may stop the tears in the short-term. But researchers warn it can lead to unhealthy eating patterns long-term. \nParents who are \"emotional feeders\" can encourage \" emotional eating \" -- a habit linked to weight gain and eating disorders , the Norwegian-British study found. \n\"There is now even stronger evidence that parental feeding styles have a major influence on children's dietary habits and how children relate to foods and beverages when it comes to addressing their own emotions,\" said one expert, Rafael Perez-Escamilla. He's a professor of epidemiology and public health at Yale University's School of Public Health. \n\"Emotional feeding\" is \"what parents do when they provide foods or beverages to their children to calm them down, such as when a child is having a tantrum,\" added Perez-Escamilla, who wasn't involved with the study. \nRelying on junk food, desserts and sugary foods for comfort can lead to overeating, and later problems such as bulimia and binge-eating, said study lead author Silje Steinsbekk and colleagues. \n\"You don't feel like having a carrot if you're sad,\" said Steinsbekk, an associate professor of psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. \nFor the new study, the researchers looked at the feeding and eating habits of more than 800 children in Norway, starting at age 4. They checked in on the kids at ages 6, 8 and 10. \nAbout two-thirds of the children at all those ages showed signs of eating to make themselves feel better, judging by questionnaires answered by their parents. \nKids offered food for comfort at ages 4 and 6 displayed more emotional eating at ages 8 and 10, the study found. \nAlso, the researchers also found signs that kids who felt more easily comforted by food were fed more by parents for that purpose. \n\"Emotional feeding increases emotional eating and vice versa,\" Steinsbekk said. \nThe researchers spotted another trend: Children who became angry or upset more easily at age 4 were more likely to eat to feel better and to be fed by parents for that purpose. Continued \n\"This makes total sense as parents get very stressed out when their children are having a fit or crying non-stop,\" said Perez-Escamilla. \nBut there are better ways of dealing with discomfort, said Melissa Cunningham Kay, a research assistant with the University of North Carolina's Gillings School of Global Public Health. \n\"Feeling sad or angry are normal emotions. Rather than using food as a distraction from them, children should be taught to tolerate them and find other ways to cope,\" said Kay, who was not part of the study. \n\"Sometimes that may involve positive discipline and a few tears or even a full-on tantrum,\" said Kay. \"Parents should not fear this. It is a normal and a necessary part of development.\" \nPerez-Escamilla said parents should soothe upset kids by understanding and responding to their problems -- say, a wet diaper -- instead of offering food as a first response, he said. \nHe praised the new research, noting that the eating habits of kids and their parents are closely intertwined. \n\"Young children develop their eating habits by observing how their caregivers eat,\" he said. \"If they see their caregivers drinking soda and eating junk food and desserts when the caregiver is stressed or upset, then that's what the children will do when they are experiencing similar emotions.\" \n\"Emotional eating should be avoided at all costs,\" he added. \nStudy lead author Steinsbekk added: \"There's no reason to worry if you have a chocolate to feel better now and then. The problem is if this is your typical way of handling negative emotions.\" \nThe same goes for dealing with kids, he said. \"Parents are not supposed to be perfect, but good enough. Randomly using food to soothe your child is no big deal as long as you usually rely on other strategies,\" he said. \nThe study authors cautioned that their review relied on questionnaires answered by parents, not direct observation by the scientists. And they noted that it took place in Norway with a population that's well-educated and not very diverse, so the findings may not apply elsewhere. \nThe study appears April 25 in the journal Child Development .

And this is especially concerning in rural areas,\" said CDC director Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald. \n\"We need proven prevention efforts to help stop these deaths and the terrible pain and loss they cause,\" Fitzgerald said in an agency news release. \nBetween 2001 and 2015, more than 500,000 people took their own lives in the United States. Rates in rural areas were consistently higher than those in cities across all age groups, with working-age adults (aged 35 to 64) most at risk, the new report revealed. \nMoreover, by 2015, suicide was the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Native Americans and whites seemed especially vulnerable, the investigators found. \nFor the study, Asha Ivey-Stephenson and colleagues at the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control analyzed death-certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System. The researchers compared trends in suicide rates in rural counties to suicide rates in large and small metropolitan counties. \nOverall, rural counties saw 17 suicides per 100,000 people, compared to about 15 per 100,000 in medium/small metropolitan counties and just under 12 per 100,000 in large metropolitan counties. \nRace and gender also played a role, with males up to five times more likely to end their lives than women, regardless of where they lived, the findings showed. \nThe study also found that blacks in rural regions were less likely to die by suicide than blacks in urban areas. \nIn cities, suicide rates were highest among whites; in rural areas, suicide was most prevalent among American Indian/Alaska Natives. \nAll regions saw increases in suicide by firearms and hanging/suffocation, but rural residents were almost twice as likely to use guns as people in urban areas, according to the report.

He said, \"The trends in suicide rates by sex, race, ethnicity, age, and mechanism that we see in the general population are magnified in rural areas.\" \nAccording to Mercy, \"This report underscores the need for suicide prevention strategies that are tailored specifically for these communities.\" \nOne such program, called Sources of Strength, was developed with rural and tribal communities in North Dakota. At its core is an attempt to understand socioeconomic factors affecting suicide rates, the CDC authors noted in their report. \nHelp with suicide prevention is available 24 hours a day by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). \nThe study findings were published in the Oct. 6 issue of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .

It highlighted a terrible truth for Americans: We should know what to do if we have to deal with mass violence. Predicting such random and horrific events is impossible. But public safety experts and medical officials say we can boost our odds of survival by what we do before, during, and after an attack.\nBefore the Event Within seconds, festivalgoers who saw others being shot in Las Vegas became first responders, experts say. Being ready for such emergencies could help.\n\"Get trained in CPR and first aid ,\" suggests Sheldon Marks, MD, a doctor in Tucson, AZ, who volunteers with the city's Police Department SWAT team and has trained others how to handle active shooter situations.\nThe first-aid class should teach how to apply tourniquets and to dress wounds, he says.\nBefore going to events, have a plan in place with family and friends in case of emergency, Marks says. That should include where you will meet if something happens.\nAlways take basic safety equipment along, such as a flashlight, Marks says. Be sure your phone is fully charged, even though an emergency may take out reception or make the lines too jammed to get through.\n\"Memorize loved ones' phone numbers,\" suggests Natalia Derevyanny, a spokeswoman for the Cook County, IL, Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management. You might have to use someone else\u2019s phone, yours may get lost in the chaos, or the cell signals may be jammed.\n\"Wear appropriate shoes, or have them available,\" Marks says. You may have to escape quickly. \"Flip-flops and high heels are not a good way to escape.\"\nAt the Event When you arrive at a venue, check out the exits, Derevyanny says. \"There is always more than one way to exit,\" she says. Figure out your Plan B when you arrive. It might be a window, not a door.\nOnce in a public place, pay close attention to gut feelings and that ''hair standing up on your neck'' phenomenon that suggests something is off, says Derevyanny. \"If something seems off, or strange, report it to authorities.\"\nIf something seems off, or strange, report it.\nNatalia Derevyanny, a spokeswoman for the Cook County, IL, Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management For instance, she says, if you are at a public venue and notice everyone taking photos, that's typical. However, she says, if you suddenly notice someone taking pictures of the heating and cooling system, or something else unusual, that bears reporting.\nIf you're at an outdoor summer concert and someone there has a bulky jacket on, that, too, is suspicious, she says. \"Just be very aware of anything in your workplace or social life that is out of place or very odd,\" she says. \"If it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, it's time to call it in.\"\nDuring the Violence Public safety experts have a mantra: Run, hide, fight. Escaping is the first choice, if possible; if not, hiding might be next best. The last resort, of course, is to fight.\n\"Every situation is different,\" Derevyanny says. \"In the case of Las Vegas, everyone needed to run. There was no place to hide.\"\nWhen you run, Marks says, be aware that law enforcement, when on the scene, may be looking for other suspects. ''Run in a way you are not perceived as a threat,\" he says.\nIf you have any object that might look like a weapon, for instance, don't carry it that way.\nLas Vegas Blood Bank After the shooting, hundreds of people stood in line for hours to donate blood.\nSpeed is crucial. \"Don't go back for your backpack or purse,\" Marks says. \"People die trying to get their stuff.\"\nAs you run, try to look ahead and plan ahead -- you don\u2019t want to end up in a dead end or in a room with only one entrance and exit.\nHide behind something that not only conceals you but protects you, if possible. A steel door is better than a curtain, but you may have no choice. If you find a safe place, stay there and be quiet. Turn off the ringer on your phone.\nTrying to fight the attacker should be a last resort, the Department of Homeland Security says. But if you do, try to incapacitate him. \u201cAct with physical aggression,\u201d the agency says, and use any item you can as a weapon.\nCall 911 when you\u2019re sure it\u2019s safe.\nAfter the Violence If you become a first responder to someone with a gunshot wound, the goal is hemorrhage control, says Corey Slovis, MD, a professor and chairman of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.\nMake a tourniquet out of anything around, he says, such as a belt or ripped clothing. ''Tie it as high on the extremity [above the wound] as possible,\" he says. \"It's only tight enough if it hurts.\"\nPut it over a single bone, not two, he says, because that better compresses the blood vessel to stop the bleeding.\nIt's only tight enough if it hurts.\nCorey Slovis, MD, chairman of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Many doctors want more public access to tourniquets, with a goal of saving more gunshot victims, says Slovis, who's also medical director for the Metro Nashville Fire Department and Nashville International Airport.\nIn October, 2015, the White House launched \"Stop the Bleed,\" a national awareness campaign and call to action. It encourages bystanders to become trained and equipped to help in a bleeding emergency before professional help arrives.\nThe campaign advises these steps:\nMove the person to safety if needed. Apply firm and steady pressure to the bleeding site with both hands. Apply a dressing and press. If bleeding continues, apply a tourniquet. When it is safe to do so, ask if there is a place for survivors to reunite with family, Derevyanny says. If so, check in there.\nOften, law enforcement officials will want to get information from anyone at the scene of the shootings so they can investigate, she says.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sheldon marks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derevyanny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slovis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corey slovis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natalia derevyanny", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "department of homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas blood bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of homeland security & emergency management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metro nashville fire department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "police department swat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanderbilt university medical center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "az", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cook county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashville international airport", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T01:03:29.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6b298afc3b2f8ff6cf9ccae884952d1518d5a40b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ON8PZi2VqDMiUNbb7cti3yX7JfXly53bTuUCn_y9RQoXT2J58DJoRLUB_mQDaNXvH73fkgoPVV70H7Se1Ld8yATk0XvbIEGZzzw.1kbwD1JN4Tlrc8Sg1HzMvkFIuJJXag--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Suicide Up in U.S., Rural America Hit Hardest", "title_full": "Suicide Up in U.S., Rural America Hit Hardest", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 21, "comments": 0, "shares": 21}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6b298afc3b2f8ff6cf9ccae884952d1518d5a40b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ON8PZi2VqDMiUNbb7cti3yX7JfXly53bTuUCn_y9RQoXT2J58DJoRLUB_mQDaNXvH73fkgoPVV70H7Se1Ld8yATk0XvbIEGZzzw.1kbwD1JN4Tlrc8Sg1HzMvkFIuJJXag--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Suicide Up in U.S., Rural America Hit Hardest", "text": "By Mary Elizabeth Dallas HealthDay Reporter \nFRIDAY, Oct. 6, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Suicide in the United States is on the upswing, with rural Americans more likely to take their own lives than residents of urban counties, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.\n\"While we've seen many causes of death come down in recent years, suicide rates have increased more than 20 percent from 2001 to 2015.

At its core is an attempt to understand socioeconomic factors affecting suicide rates, the CDC authors noted in their report.\nHelp with suicide prevention is available 24 hours a day by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\nThe study findings were published in the Oct. 6 issue of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mary elizabeth dallas healthday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asha ivey-stephenson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brenda fitzgerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james mercy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national suicide prevention lifeline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national center for injury prevention and control", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc's division of violence prevention", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north dakota", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T01:03:31.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9b262889d53660821f0b12a5b05e34d60daaaeb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ONEgjUWeDkhx9xxq_EBWU_i_VWzCl2l581fecTo3BSM9w4S99jePmrjUojeiV4u_RQKnzK41awzB8jGi65NxhsqfNI4MwW94_lCxLZDoe8d6", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Cigna Says No to OxyContin", "title_full": "Cigna Says No to OxyContin", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 590, "comments": 0, "shares": 590}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 16}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9b262889d53660821f0b12a5b05e34d60daaaeb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.2xRn2_d3ONEgjUWeDkhx9xxq_EBWU_i_VWzCl2l581fecTo3BSM9w4S99jePmrjUojeiV4u_RQKnzK41awzB8jGi65NxhsqfNI4MwW94_lCxLZDoe8d6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "webmd.com", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cigna Says No to OxyContin", "text": "Most OxyContin prescriptions will no longer be covered in Cigna group health plans starting in January, the insurance giant announced.

Marks is director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\n\"Screening blood donations for the Zika virus is critical to preventing infected donations from entering the U.S. blood supply. Today's approval is the result of a commitment by the manufacturer to work rapidly and collaboratively with the FDA and the blood collection industry to respond to a public health crisis, and ensure the safety of blood in the U.S. and its territories.\"\nZika is spread mainly through mosquitoes carrying the virus. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact or blood transfusions.\nIn August of last year, the FDA advised all states to screen all donated blood and blood products with an experimental screening test accessible under an investigational new drug (IND) application.\nAn IND allows the FDA to authorize use of an experimental drug in emergency situations. The FDA recommended that an experimental Zika screening test be used until an approved test became available.\nSeveral blood collection centers opted to use the cobas Zika test, which is made by Roche Molecular Systems.\nResults from these screenings along with studies conducted by Roche showed the test is an effective way to screen donated blood for the virus. Five different labs found the test accurately identified 99 percent of all infected blood samples.\nZika can cause devastating birth defects in babies whose mothers are infected with the virus while pregnant. The most common of these is microcephaly, a condition in which the baby's head and brain is small and underdeveloped. Thousands of babies in Brazil were born with catastrophic neurological defects linked to the virus when the Zika outbreak there was at its height in 2015 and 2016.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mary elizabeth dallas healthday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "peter marks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zika", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roche molecular systems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for biologics evaluation and research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T01:03:54.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9debf251aa9b76676b2e398c5f96796225bc9319", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8AAjdsBfrveSDQUqOzkYu3tNiTWztcsbmRlno4RfWRUmtyd1fkVIq.JOiuRnkHvB4vMNR0A.GxpRl3ZmiKsPsKoCFisBaQ9_8zB_7D1ji_FtidtXLorHfbttgfIxCrxByA--", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "Too Much Sugar Can Harm Livers of Even Healthy Men", "title_full": "Too Much Sugar Can Harm Livers of Even Healthy Men", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 21, "comments": 0, "shares": 21}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9debf251aa9b76676b2e398c5f96796225bc9319", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8AAjdsBfrveSDQUqOzkYu3tNiTWztcsbmRlno4RfWRUmtyd1fkVIq.JOiuRnkHvB4vMNR0A.GxpRl3ZmiKsPsKoCFisBaQ9_8zB_7D1ji_FtidtXLorHfbttgfIxCrxByA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Too Much Sugar Can Harm Livers of Even Healthy Men", "text": "By Mary Elizabeth Dallas HealthDay Reporter \nFRIDAY, Oct. 6, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Here's news that might sour you on sweets: New research shows that overdoing it on sugar might harm the livers of otherwise healthy men.\nBritish researchers found that a sugar -rich diet was associated with unhealthily high levels of fat in both the blood and the liver .\nThe bottom line, said lead researcher Bruce Griffin, is that \"consuming high amounts of sugar can alter your fat metabolism in ways that could increase your risk of cardiovascular disease .\"\nGriffin is professor of nutritional metabolism at the University of Surrey in Guildford, England.\nOne U.S. nutritionist wasn't surprised by the findings.\n\"This study offers yet another valid reason to cut back on sugar,\" said Dana Angelo White. She is a dietitian and clinical assistant professor of sports medicine at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn.\n\"In addition to piling on the empty calories, sugar creates more metabolic work for the liver,\" she noted.\nIn the study, Griffin's team tracked the liver health of a group of middle-aged men with either high (11 men) or low (14 men) levels of fat in their liver.\nExcess fat accumulation in the liver is considered unhealthy, and the men with high fat levels already had a condition known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). According to the American Liver Foundation, NAFLD is tied to obesity and affects up to one-quarter of Americans.\nThe men were asked to follow one of two diets: a high-sugar diet, consuming 650 calories' worth of sugar each day for three months; or a low-sugar diet that contained no more than 140 calories of sugar per day.\nThe investigators found that the participants with NAFLD who followed the high-sugar diet developed changes in their fat metabolism -- the processes by which the body breaks down fats in the blood and uses them for energy. Those changes are well-known to be linked to a greater risk for heart disease, heart attacks and stroke, the research team said.\nBut similar changes were also noted in the livers of otherwise healthy men who had a low level of liver fat when the study began.\nContinued In this group, men developed higher levels of this fat in the liver after switching to the high-sugar diet. The researchers also found changes in their fat metabolism that were similar to the men who already had NAFLD.\n\"Our findings provide new evidence that consuming high amounts of sugar can alter your fat metabolism in ways that could increase your risk of cardiovascular disease,\" Griffin said in a university news release.\nThe study authors said their findings are particularly concerning since the prevalence of NAFLD is on the rise among children as well as adults.\n\"While most adults don't consume the high levels of sugar we used in this study, some children and teenagers may reach these levels of sugar intake by over-consuming fizzy drinks and sweets,\" Griffin said. \"This raises concern for the future health of the younger population, especially in view of the alarmingly high prevalence of NAFLD in children and teenagers, and exponential rise of fatal liver disease in adults.\"\nDr. Rachel Bond helps direct Women's Heart Health at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. Reviewing the findings, she said that the study's \"conclusion that a sugar-laden diet may raise your risk of dying of heart disease is something we cannot ignore. In my practice, I emphasize that even a spoonful of sugar, albeit in excess, could potentially be putting one's heart at increased risk.\"\nBut White added that it's not always easy to track just how much sugar you might consume each day.\n\"It's really difficult for consumers to assess how much sugar they are consuming, since it's found in so many unexpected places,\" she explained.\n\"Sugar is not only found in candy, soda and cookies, it's in sauces and condiments, and lots of savory snacks are also packing sugar into the daily diet,\" White said, so \"checking ingredient lists to cut back on sugar intake is a must.\"\nThe study was published Oct. 5 in the journal Clinical Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mary elizabeth dallas healthday", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rachel bond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce griffin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "griffin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dana angelo white", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "healthday news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "quinnipiac university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american liver foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nafld", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of surrey", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guildford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lenox hill hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T01:04:31.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "298ca2c928ad9d11a4b174bb79b7099f3d513525", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8BCZyVYZYne_CyyaEhlX9AMk5E9_d68qecUt1UeNJalkqDTeCHIWE.uxmoDtFhUmsTdTu._0xsgyL84FKv1yjug1D4PLZ_sSIsXCRQodWn_461Li3Q1hH3s-", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "site": "webmd.com", "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "site_categories": ["senor_health", "mens_health", "health", "arthritis", "womens_health"], "section_title": "WebMD Health", "title": "California Hepatitis A Outbreak Spreads", "title_full": "California Hepatitis A Outbreak Spreads", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 322, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 196, "comments": 0, "shares": 196}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "298ca2c928ad9d11a4b174bb79b7099f3d513525", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8BCZyVYZYne_CyyaEhlX9AMk5E9_d68qecUt1UeNJalkqDTeCHIWE.uxmoDtFhUmsTdTu._0xsgyL84FKv1yjug1D4PLZ_sSIsXCRQodWn_461Li3Q1hH3s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steven Reinberg", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "California Hepatitis A Outbreak Spreads", "text": "By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter \nFRIDAY, Oct. 6, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- An outbreak of hepatitis A among drug users and the homeless in San Diego continues to spread, public health experts report.\nTo date, 481 cases have been reported, 337 people have been hospitalized and 17 have died, according to Dr. Eric McDonald. He is from the epidemiology and immunization services branch of the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency.\nCases of the viral liver disease are also now being reported in Santa Cruz and Los Angeles counties, where 70 and 12 people have been diagnosed, respectively, the Los Angeles Times reported.\nThe first signs of the outbreak surfaced almost a year ago.\n\"From November 2016 to February 2017, between seven and nine cases would have been expected, yet 19 cases were reported,\" McDonald said during a media briefing Thursday.\nWhat triggered this outbreak remains unknown and will most likely never be identified, he added.\nSan Diego County is fighting the outbreak with an aggressive vaccination program, with some 54,000 at-risk residents vaccinated already, McDonald said.\nIn addition to vaccination, the health department is promoting a program that stresses hygiene and sanitation, including hand washing.\nSpeaking at the media briefing, Dr. Monique Foster, from the division of viral hepatitis at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that \"hepatitis A virus is a vaccine-preventable disease.\"\nIt's typically transmitted from person to person through a fecal/oral route, she said.\nCases of hepatitis A have been dropping since a vaccine was introduced in 1996, Foster noted.\nHowever, outbreaks can occur in high-risk populations, she said. These include people who travel to areas where hepatitis A is endemic, gay and bisexual men, and illicit drug users, Foster said.\nOutbreaks can last for up to two years, she added.\nNo treatment for the disease exists, and those who are older or have liver disease tend to have more serious infections, Foster said.\n\"It can lead to liver failure and death, of course,\" she noted.\nOne of the difficulties in identifying hepatitis A is that it can take nearly a month for symptoms to appear after someone had been infected, Foster explained.\nContinued \"This makes investigating an outbreak difficult,\" she said.\nIn this outbreak, it is particularly difficult to trace the disease because so many of the patients are homeless and wary of the government, Foster said.\nSo far, 13 of the patients were illicit drug users and 10 of the 19 were homeless, McDonald said.\nThe number of cases continued to rise in April, May and June, but had since leveled off, at about 20 new cases a week, he said.\nMost of the patients are men [68 percent] and 32 percent are women, he said.

It highlighted a terrible truth for Americans: We should know what to do if we have to deal with mass violence. \nPredicting such random and horrific events is impossible. But public safety experts and medical officials say we can boost our odds of survival by what we do before, during, and after an attack. Before the Event \nWithin seconds, festivalgoers who saw others being shot in Las Vegas became first responders, experts say. Being ready for such emergencies could help. \n\"Get trained in CPR and first aid ,\" suggests Sheldon Marks, MD, a doctor in Tucson, AZ, who volunteers with the city's Police Department SWAT team and has trained others how to handle active shooter situations. \nThe first-aid class should teach how to apply tourniquets and to dress wounds, he says. \nBefore going to events, have a plan in place with family and friends in case of emergency, Marks says. That should include where you will meet if something happens. \nAlways take basic safety equipment along, such as a flashlight, Marks says. Be sure your phone is fully charged, even though an emergency may take out reception or make the lines too jammed to get through. \n\"Memorize loved ones' phone numbers,\" suggests Natalia Derevyanny, a spokeswoman for the Cook County, IL, Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management. You might have to use someone else\u2019s phone, yours may get lost in the chaos, or the cell signals may be jammed. \n\"Wear appropriate shoes, or have them available,\" Marks says. You may have to escape quickly. \"Flip-flops and high heels are not a good way to escape.\" At the Event \nWhen you arrive at a venue, check out the exits, Derevyanny says. \"There is always more than one way to exit,\" she says. Figure out your Plan B when you arrive. It might be a window, not a door. \nOnce in a public place, pay close attention to gut feelings and that ''hair standing up on your neck'' phenomenon that suggests something is off, says Derevyanny. \"If something seems off, or strange, report it to authorities.\" \nIf something seems off, or strange, report it. Natalia Derevyanny, a spokeswoman for the Cook County, IL, Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management \nFor instance, she says, if you are at a public venue and notice everyone taking photos, that's typical. However, she says, if you suddenly notice someone taking pictures of the heating and cooling system, or something else unusual, that bears reporting. \nIf you're at an outdoor summer concert and someone there has a bulky jacket on, that, too, is suspicious, she says. \"Just be very aware of anything in your workplace or social life that is out of place or very odd,\" she says. \"If it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, it's time to call it in.\" During the Violence \nPublic safety experts have a mantra: Run, hide, fight. Escaping is the first choice, if possible; if not, hiding might be next best. The last resort, of course, is to fight. \n\"Every situation is different,\" Derevyanny says. \"In the case of Las Vegas, everyone needed to run. There was no place to hide.\" \nWhen you run, Marks says, be aware that law enforcement, when on the scene, may be looking for other suspects. ''Run in a way you are not perceived as a threat,\" he says. \nIf you have any object that might look like a weapon, for instance, don't carry it that way. Las Vegas Blood Bank \nAfter the shooting, hundreds of people stood in line for hours to donate blood. \nSpeed is crucial. \"Don't go back for your backpack or purse,\" Marks says. \"People die trying to get their stuff.\" \nAs you run, try to look ahead and plan ahead -- you don\u2019t want to end up in a dead end or in a room with only one entrance and exit. \nHide behind something that not only conceals you but protects you, if possible. A steel door is better than a curtain, but you may have no choice. If you find a safe place, stay there and be quiet. Turn off the ringer on your phone. \nTrying to fight the attacker should be a last resort, the Department of Homeland Security says. But if you do, try to incapacitate him. \u201cAct with physical aggression,\u201d the agency says, and use any item you can as a weapon. \nCall 911 when you\u2019re sure it\u2019s safe. After the Violence \nIf you become a first responder to someone with a gunshot wound, the goal is hemorrhage control, says Corey Slovis, MD, a professor and chairman of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \nMake a tourniquet out of anything around, he says, such as a belt or ripped clothing. ''Tie it as high on the extremity [above the wound] as possible,\" he says. \"It's only tight enough if it hurts.\" \nPut it over a single bone, not two, he says, because that better compresses the blood vessel to stop the bleeding. \nIt's only tight enough if it hurts. Corey Slovis, MD, chairman of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \nMany doctors want more public access to tourniquets, with a goal of saving more gunshot victims, says Slovis, who's also medical director for the Metro Nashville Fire Department and Nashville International Airport. \nIn October, 2015, the White House launched \"Stop the Bleed,\" a national awareness campaign and call to action. It encourages bystanders to become trained and equipped to help in a bleeding emergency before professional help arrives. \nThe campaign advises these steps: Move the person to safety if needed. Apply firm and steady pressure to the bleeding site with both hands. Apply a dressing and press. If bleeding continues, apply a tourniquet. \nWhen it is safe to do so, ask if there is a place for survivors to reunite with family, Derevyanny says. If so, check in there. \nOften, law enforcement officials will want to get information from anyone at the scene of the shootings so they can investigate, she says. WebMD Article Reviewed by Hansa D.

The doctor lost her license to practice medicine in Georgia, but prosecutors decided to drop the charges, a published report said. \nAnd in August, a 31-year-old New York City mother of two died from enhancement injections to her buttocks that she received in a residential apartment building, according to a published report. \n\"It's kind of like the wild west out there. Cosmetic surgery is really unregulated,\" said Dr. Clyde Ishii, president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. \"Consumers have to understand that cosmetic surgery is real surgery, with real complications.\" \nSchierle and his colleagues decided to investigate Instagram posts because \"it is a uniquely visual social media channel, and plastic surgery is a uniquely visual medical specialty,\" he said. Continued \nThey reviewed more than 1.7 million Instagram posts to find popular posts associated with 21 plastic surgery-related hashtags. These included #plasticsurgery, #facelift, #cosmeticsurgery, #breastlift, #boobjob, # rhinoplasty , #brazilianbuttlift, #tummytuck and #liposuction. \nThe researchers collected the nine most popular posts for each hashtag, and checked the source for each post. \nTwo-thirds of the top posts promoted the person's cosmetic surgery practice, as opposed to educating the public about plastic surgery, the researchers found. However, board-certified plastic surgeons were nearly twice as likely to use Instagram to post educational content rather than self-promotion. \nThe problem is that medicine is largely unregulated, and someone with a medical license is considered under the law capable of performing just about any procedure, Schierle said. \nDoctors hoping to make a little extra money on the side can take some training in cosmetic surgery procedures and hang their shingle, Schierle said. \nThese doctors won't be able to get board certification in plastic surgery. But they can say they're board-certified because they have been certified by the board governing their own specialty, he said. \n\"An internist could perform brain surgery in the eyes of the law,\" Schierle said. \"That doesn't mean it's a good idea.\" \nBarbers and hair stylists can legally promote plastic surgery, but they would be breaking the law if they used a knife or needle on someone, Schierle continued. \nIt's likely these places are doing a \"bait and switch,\" seeming to offer plastic surgery services but actually steering incoming clients to other alternatives, Schierle said. For example, they might sell the person a garment that makes them sweat or offer an ostensibly fat-burning massage. \nPeople considering cosmetic surgery need to take it more seriously, and do their homework, Ishii said. \n\"A lot of people view cosmetic surgery as frivolous and harmless,\" Ishii said. \"Because it's treated lightly on social media, they don't give it the respect it's due.\" \nBefore undergoing a procedure, ask your provider if he or she is credentialed to perform that procedure in a hospital, Ishii said. Hospitals have very stringent credentialing standards. Continued \nYou also should ask whether the person is board-certified specifically in plastic surgery, and whether their board is recognized by the American Board of Medical Specialties, Ishii added. \nThe ABMS is the United States' governing body for credentialing medical professionals. Some alternative boards have popped up that will provide doctors with credentials for \"cosmetic surgery,\" but these boards are not recognized by the ABMS, Ishii said. \nA board-certified plastic surgeon has more than six years of surgical training and experience, with at least three years specifically in plastic surgery, the researchers said. \nA practitioner referring to herself or himself as a cosmetic surgeon could belong to any medical specialty, and may have received training that varies from a one-year cosmetic surgery fellowship to a handful of short weekend courses on liposuction, injectables or breast implants. \nThe study was published Aug. 30 in the Aesthetic Surgery Journal .

Marks is director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. \n\"Screening blood donations for the Zika virus is critical to preventing infected donations from entering the U.S. blood supply. Today's approval is the result of a commitment by the manufacturer to work rapidly and collaboratively with the FDA and the blood collection industry to respond to a public health crisis, and ensure the safety of blood in the U.S. and its territories.\" \nZika is spread mainly through mosquitoes carrying the virus. It can also be transmitted through sexual contact or blood transfusions. \nIn August of last year, the FDA advised all states to screen all donated blood and blood products with an experimental screening test accessible under an investigational new drug (IND) application. \nAn IND allows the FDA to authorize use of an experimental drug in emergency situations. The FDA recommended that an experimental Zika screening test be used until an approved test became available. \nSeveral blood collection centers opted to use the cobas Zika test, which is made by Roche Molecular Systems. \nResults from these screenings along with studies conducted by Roche showed the test is an effective way to screen donated blood for the virus. Five different labs found the test accurately identified 99 percent of all infected blood samples. \nZika can cause devastating birth defects in babies whose mothers are infected with the virus while pregnant. The most common of these is microcephaly, a condition in which the baby's head and brain is small and underdeveloped.

It highlighted a terrible truth for Americans: We should know what to do if we have to deal with mass violence. \nPredicting such random and horrific events is impossible. But public safety experts and medical officials say we can boost our odds of survival by what we do before, during, and after an attack. Before the Event \nWithin seconds, festivalgoers who saw others being shot in Las Vegas became first responders, experts say. Being ready for such emergencies could help. \n\"Get trained in CPR and first aid ,\" suggests Sheldon Marks, MD, a doctor in Tucson, AZ, who volunteers with the city's Police Department SWAT team and has trained others how to handle active shooter situations. \nThe first-aid class should teach how to apply tourniquets and to dress wounds, he says. \nBefore going to events, have a plan in place with family and friends in case of emergency, Marks says. That should include where you will meet if something happens. \nAlways take basic safety equipment along, such as a flashlight, Marks says. Be sure your phone is fully charged, even though an emergency may take out reception or make the lines too jammed to get through. \n\"Memorize loved ones' phone numbers,\" suggests Natalia Derevyanny, a spokeswoman for the Cook County, IL, Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management. You might have to use someone else\u2019s phone, yours may get lost in the chaos, or the cell signals may be jammed. \n\"Wear appropriate shoes, or have them available,\" Marks says. You may have to escape quickly. \"Flip-flops and high heels are not a good way to escape.\" At the Event \nWhen you arrive at a venue, check out the exits, Derevyanny says. \"There is always more than one way to exit,\" she says. Figure out your Plan B when you arrive. It might be a window, not a door. \nOnce in a public place, pay close attention to gut feelings and that ''hair standing up on your neck'' phenomenon that suggests something is off, says Derevyanny. \"If something seems off, or strange, report it to authorities.\" \nIf something seems off, or strange, report it. Natalia Derevyanny, a spokeswoman for the Cook County, IL, Department of Homeland Security & Emergency Management \nFor instance, she says, if you are at a public venue and notice everyone taking photos, that's typical. However, she says, if you suddenly notice someone taking pictures of the heating and cooling system, or something else unusual, that bears reporting. \nIf you're at an outdoor summer concert and someone there has a bulky jacket on, that, too, is suspicious, she says. \"Just be very aware of anything in your workplace or social life that is out of place or very odd,\" she says. \"If it makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up, it's time to call it in.\" During the Violence \nPublic safety experts have a mantra: Run, hide, fight. Escaping is the first choice, if possible; if not, hiding might be next best. The last resort, of course, is to fight. \n\"Every situation is different,\" Derevyanny says. \"In the case of Las Vegas, everyone needed to run. There was no place to hide.\" \nWhen you run, Marks says, be aware that law enforcement, when on the scene, may be looking for other suspects. ''Run in a way you are not perceived as a threat,\" he says. \nIf you have any object that might look like a weapon, for instance, don't carry it that way. Las Vegas Blood Bank \nAfter the shooting, hundreds of people stood in line for hours to donate blood. \nSpeed is crucial. \"Don't go back for your backpack or purse,\" Marks says. \"People die trying to get their stuff.\" \nAs you run, try to look ahead and plan ahead -- you don\u2019t want to end up in a dead end or in a room with only one entrance and exit. \nHide behind something that not only conceals you but protects you, if possible. A steel door is better than a curtain, but you may have no choice. If you find a safe place, stay there and be quiet. Turn off the ringer on your phone. \nTrying to fight the attacker should be a last resort, the Department of Homeland Security says. But if you do, try to incapacitate him. \u201cAct with physical aggression,\u201d the agency says, and use any item you can as a weapon. \nCall 911 when you\u2019re sure it\u2019s safe. After the Violence \nIf you become a first responder to someone with a gunshot wound, the goal is hemorrhage control, says Corey Slovis, MD, a professor and chairman of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \nMake a tourniquet out of anything around, he says, such as a belt or ripped clothing. ''Tie it as high on the extremity [above the wound] as possible,\" he says. \"It's only tight enough if it hurts.\" \nPut it over a single bone, not two, he says, because that better compresses the blood vessel to stop the bleeding. \nIt's only tight enough if it hurts. Corey Slovis, MD, chairman of emergency medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \nMany doctors want more public access to tourniquets, with a goal of saving more gunshot victims, says Slovis, who's also medical director for the Metro Nashville Fire Department and Nashville International Airport. \nIn October, 2015, the White House launched \"Stop the Bleed,\" a national awareness campaign and call to action. It encourages bystanders to become trained and equipped to help in a bleeding emergency before professional help arrives. \nThe campaign advises these steps: Move the person to safety if needed. Apply firm and steady pressure to the bleeding site with both hands. Apply a dressing and press. If bleeding continues, apply a tourniquet. \nWhen it is safe to do so, ask if there is a place for survivors to reunite with family, Derevyanny says. If so, check in there. \nOften, law enforcement officials will want to get information from anyone at the scene of the shootings so they can investigate, she says. WebMD Article Reviewed by Hansa D.
