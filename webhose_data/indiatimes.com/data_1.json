These euros are then swapped back into dollars, which widens the cross currency basis.\nThe squeeze comes just as Fed chief Janet Yellen has stoked expectations that U.S. interest rates will be raised again by the end of the year, sending the dollar and U.S. yields sharply higher. Fed funds futures now point to a near-80 percent probability of a rate hike in December.\nTwo- and 10-year Treasury yields jumped 15 and 20 basis points, respectively, in September, their biggest monthly increases of the year. The dollar rose 1 percent last week, its best week of the year.\nThis follows similar bouts of widening in the euro/dollar cross currency basis over the last couple of years: in November 2015 (ahead of the landmark first post-crisis U.S. rate hike); mid-2016 (as the two-year dollar rally reached its peak); September 2016 (jitters over the health of Deutsche Bank ); and December last year (Fed rate hike and year-end demand).\nSeasonal effects are at play too. Funding pressures often bubble up at quarter- and year-end as banks look to secure a supply of dollars to spruce up their balance sheets.\nAll this has pushed out the three-month euro basis to 47 basis points, the highest premium to swap euros into dollars since January. Last week's surge of 10 basis points was the biggest weekly move this year, and one of the biggest since the white heat of the euro crisis in late 2011.\nBack then, the widening in the basis was far more dramatic, to more than 150 basis points, reflecting extreme systemic risk as the very existence of the euro zone was under threat. Similarly, when the global financial system was close to implosion in 2008, the three-month euro basis blew out to more than 300 basis points.\nIn benign market conditions 'cross currency basis' should show virtually no premium at all for one currency over another. But the premium for dollars has widened sporadically over the last few years.\nThis is due to banks having to cover currency mismatches between assets and liabilities on their balance sheets, investor hedging, patterns in corporate bond issuance, and differences in the big central banks' policy stances.\nThe European Central Bank 's negative interest rates and aggressive QE , as the Fed is slowly begun tightening policy, has made it more attractive for U.S. firms to issue debt in euros and swap back into dollars via the cross currency basis market.\nAs the basis widens, like now, it should eventually become more attractive for European firms to bypass the cross currency market and issue debt in dollars directly. Ultimately, the system should self-correct, although at what level is difficult to pinpoint.\nWhile the euro basis is now its widest since January, it has been wider in the last two years, reaching 80 basis points in December last year. So it may have room to widen further.\n(Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Catherine Evans )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mcgeever", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jamie mcgeever l", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie mcgeever", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janet yellen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deutsche bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank for international settlements", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:52:11.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2c0feb05ffe7b106f40e8526954899dcf657487", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI8yyX1eJzTpYnqyMmkCRaS306I58J4R.Or01bHyNUC4zqAlWkvPWmsirS.SyJLEVa4fyvT15.U9JQkjQ_VI4gz0SvmZqrS92BfAYhjzNnU3vLJk4fJXzCtsknFqqlRIjh0lHNKE21osP.", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/-2128680634.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International Business, World & Global Business News | Share Market News - Times of India", "title": "NLC: India's state-owned NLC seeks global, private firms to develop two coal mines", "title_full": "NLC: India's state-owned NLC seeks global, private firms to develop two coal mines - Times of India", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2c0feb05ffe7b106f40e8526954899dcf657487", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI8yyX1eJzTpYnqyMmkCRaS306I58J4R.Or01bHyNUC4zqAlWkvPWmsirS.SyJLEVa4fyvT15.U9JQkjQ_VI4gz0SvmZqrS92BfAYhjzNnU3vLJk4fJXzCtsknFqqlRIjh0lHNKE21osP.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "NLC: India's state-owned NLC seeks global, private firms to develop two coal mines", "text": "* NLC aims for annual output of 20 mln tonnes of coal\n* Reserves of the two blocks estimated at more than 550 mln tonnes\n* NLC to invite bids for Jharkhand mines by end-Oct\nBy Sudarshan Varadhan\nNEW DELHI, Oct 3 ( Reuters ) - Lignite miner and power producer NLC India Ltd has invited domestic and foreign companies to develop its coal blocks in the eastern state of Odisha in a bid to secure cheaper fuel for its power plant, the firm's chairman said on Tuesday.\nThermal power plants in India, home to the fourth biggest reserves of coal in the world, are grappling with fuel shortages following a sudden rise in demand triggered by a decline in hydro and nuclear electricity generation.\nThe company, owned by the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu , has invited bids for mining two blocks to produce 20 million tonnes a year for the life of the mine, which has reserves estimated at more than 550 million tonnes.\nNear the mines, NLC is building a 4,000-megawatt thermal power plant in two phases, and aims to cut fuel costs to make \"power affordable to people\", chairman Sarat Kumar Acharya said.\n\"It will be much more economical to produce coal through this contract, as our administrative cost will be significantly reduced,\" he told Reuters.\n\"The contractor will be responsible for everything from the exploration to excavation of coal.\"\nNLC will float a similar tender by the end of this month to mine coal from its block at Ghatampur in the eastern state of Jharkhand to power a 1,600-MW power plant, Acharya added.\nBoth plants are expected to operate at full capacity in about 5 years.\nMost Indian industries and power producers prefer captive mines as the South Asian nation lacks sufficient railway trains and domestic coal prices are much higher than mining costs.\nForeign companies willing to participate in NLC's tender may have to join hands with domestic firms, Acharya said, adding that the company expected to start production from the mines within two years.\nInstead of a fixed rate of return, payments to Odisha coal mine developers will be linked to output.

zone bond yields broadly higher\n* Strong U.S. economic data pushes up dollar\n* Weaker euro keeps ECB policy outlook in focus\n* Spain in spotlight as Catalonia tensions simmer\n* Euro zone periphery govt bond yields http://tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Writes through)\nBy Dhara Ranasinghe\nLONDON, Oct 3 ( Reuters ) - Germany led a rise in bond yields across the euro zone on Tuesday as strong U.S. data reinforced expectations of another interest rate rise this year by the Federal Reserve .\nA pro-independence protest in Catalonia kept tensions between the wealthy Spanish region and the central government in Madrid in the spotlight, although Spain's bond market was calmer after heavy selling the previous day after by an independence vote on Sunday that was marred by police violence.\nThe overall mood across government bond markets was bearish as investors took their cue from upbeat economic data to sell fixed income and buy risk assets such as stocks.\nThe U.S. Institute for Supply Management index, released on Monday, rose to 60.8 in September, from 58.8 in August, exceeding analyst expectations. The components of the index showed gains across the board.\nThat boosted expectations for another U.S. rate rise this year, lifting the dollar. The euro, in turn, fell to a 1-1/2-month low just below $1.17.\nA weakening in the single currency is seen as a headwind for bond markets since it could encourage the European Central Bank to press ahead with plans to unwind its massive stimulus scheme.\nThe euro, up around 12 percent against the dollar this year, has complicated the ECB's plans for exiting its stimulus scheme because a strong currency puts downward pressure on inflation.\nData on Tuesday showed euro zone producer prices rose a higher-than-expected 2.5 percent in August compared with a year earlier.\nMost bond yields in the bloc were up 2-4 basis points on the day. Germany's benchmark 10-year yield rose 4 bps to 0.49 percent, heading back towards 8-week highs hit last week after a tax plan from the U.S. administration renewed reflation bets.\nTwo-year U.S. Treasury yields hovered near 9-year peaks hit on Monday.\n\"People are still watching what the Fed is doing and in Europe, how the ECB will act,\" said Benjamin Schroeder , senior rates strategist at ING.\nAnalysts said data on ECB bond buying, due out later in the day, would be scrutinised for signs on how close the central bank is to hitting its self-imposed limits for bond purchases.\nA scarcity of eligible debt for quantitative easing is one reason why many economists anticipate ECB tapering in early 2018.\nSpain's 10-year yield was up 2 bps at 1.70 percent , but off highs seen in the wake of Sunday's banned independence referendum in Catalonia.\nThe gap over German Bund yields narrowed to around 121 bps, having been at its widest level in around four months on Monday at around 126 bps.\n\"We don't think tail risks from Catalonia will continue because this is a Spanish issue not a euro zone existential issue,\" said Peter Chatwell , head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho .\n\n\n(Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Alison Williams )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dhara ranasinghe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter chatwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin schroeder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. institute for supply management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. treasury", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mizuho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:52:23.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a2cb32b0f97683abdb83b15f07fc98bff03d3c27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI84dO0COLQ2k3q3zEe2tub16mNlMS3l4fzWdExvtYokZRnT12H9XfLf7y10dYiKjtLVaAqcrsMWnH.K2tGnkdJ1eVlUQGlIugNcUhKjQpdTAC", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/-2128680634.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International Business, World & Global Business News | Share Market News - Times of India", "title": "HSBC: HSBC, Barclays, Cantor Fitzgerald, Walker Crips", "title_full": "HSBC: HSBC, Barclays, Cantor Fitzgerald, Walker Crips - Times of India", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a2cb32b0f97683abdb83b15f07fc98bff03d3c27", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI84dO0COLQ2k3q3zEe2tub16mNlMS3l4fzWdExvtYokZRnT12H9XfLf7y10dYiKjtLVaAqcrsMWnH.K2tGnkdJ1eVlUQGlIugNcUhKjQpdTAC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "HSBC: HSBC, Barclays, Cantor Fitzgerald, Walker Crips", "text": "Oct 3 ( Reuters ) - The following financial services industry appointments were announced on Tuesday.

http://reut.rs/2yhkfCS\n* EM equities - http://reut.rs/2yUXh1t\n* EM markets - http://reut.rs/2yIEztQ\nBy Sujata Rao\nLONDON, Oct 2( Reuters ) - Developing countries have been on a borrowing binge this year with nine months of bumper investment inflows and record bond sales, but a sharp U.S. dollar bounce into year-end could end the party early.\nSigns of an upswing in the dollar's fortunes made the last week of September poor - equities fell 2 percent, bond yields rose about 10 basis points and currencies weakened on average by over 1 percent, their worst week since last November.\nWhile emerging markets are still among the year's best performing assets, the moves last week cast a chill on the sector. They closely emulated those in late-2016 when Donald Trump 's U.S. election win and stimulus plans briefly boosted the dollar, ended a three-quarters emerging market rally.\nLast week's swings were driven by expectations of a December U.S. rate hike. But possibly, a bigger threat is the revival, after many months, of the so-called Trumpflation bet - Trump's plans for stimulus through tax cuts.\nThe measures could be immensely dollar-supportive, especially if they induce U.S. firms to repatriate cash held overseas. Estimates of such holdings are reckoned to be well over $1 trillion.\nThat could see the dollar repeating the 12 percent surge it witnessed in 2005, after a 2004 tax holiday lured home about $300 billion. That's a formidable hurdle for emerging markets, which usually suffer when the dollar strengthens.\n\"The last time they did it (encouraged dollar repatriation), it had a huge impact on the dollar and this time the scale could be much larger,\" Abhishek Kumar , lead portfolio manager for emerging markets at State Street Global Advisors.\nOn top of that, emerging markets look \"frothy in some areas\", Kumar said, citing the fall in corporate dollar bond yields below those on sovereign debt, and successful bond issuance by junk-grade borrowers Tajikistan and Ukraine .\nSuch frontier market, along with Chinese firms, led a borrowing frenzy that saw bond sales of almost $500 billion in the first nine months of 2017, a quarter above year-ago levels.\nYield-hungry bond investors submitted orders of over $4 billion for Tajikistan's $500 million issue, despite its doubtful economic prospects. A $12.5 billion deal from Saudi Arabia - in recession and struggling with huge budget deficits - enjoyed bids around $40 billion .\nBut while such entities benefited from Treasury yields - the reference rate for global borrowing costs - bumping along near multi-year lows, Kumar predicts U.S. tax changes to have \"material\" impact on the U.S. curve.\nHigher U.S. yields, crowding out flows to riskier assets, can drive an exodus from emerging markets, especially when long-dated bond yields rise faster than shorter-maturity debt.\nA taste of such curve steepening, as these yield moves are known, came last week as the Treasury curve steepened the most since August. That forced up yields on the new Saudi bonds by around 15 basis points.\n\"We think we may see a moderation of inflows into emerging markets in the fourth quarter and going into 2018,\" Hung Tran , managing director of the Institute of International Finance ( IIF ) said, though he did not see flows reversing.\n\nDEBT MOUNTAIN\nWhile some argue that with global interest rates still low, a moderate rise will not be an issue, emerging markets are facing the prospect of tighter credit with record-high debt.\nThe IIF estimates total developing world debt at $56 trillion, up $3 trillion in the past year. That is 218 percent of their combined economic output, a five percentage point rise over year-ago levels.\nOn a more positive side, governments have moved to borrowing mostly in domestic currencies, reducing dollar exposure. Only 14 percent of public emerging debt now is foreign currency, the Bank for International Settlements says.\nPaul Greer, senior emerging debt trader at Fidelity International , says this segment should be relatively insulated; he calculates inflation-adjusted bond yields from the eight biggest emerging economies at some 300 basis points above developed markets, the widest in a decade.\nUnsurprisingly, local emerging debt has outperformed its dollar counterpart this year, with 14 percent returns.\nOn dollar bond markets, large amounts of debt fall due in coming years: governments must repay $70-$75 billion in 2018 and 2019, rising to $95 billion in 2020, ICBC Standard Bank estimates.\nEmerging markets meanwhile face around $250 billion in repayments in each of the coming three years. All was borrowed during the cheap-money years after 2009, but refinancing it may prove much costlier.\nGreg Bowes, co-founder of Albright Capital Management , an emerging markets-focused private equity firm, expects many companies will seek debt restructuring.\n\"You've had a dramatic increase in the size of the EM corporate credit market in the last six years,\" Bowes said.\n\"A lot of that debt issuance is approaching maturity and we're at this trough in interest rates, so it will be interesting to see how that unfolds.\"\n(Reporting by Sujata Rao; additional reporting by Claire Milhench Editing by Jeremy Gaunt )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "abhishek kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hung tran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg bowes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy gaunt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul greer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sujata rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bowes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire milhench", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icbc standard bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "institute of international finance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albright capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fidelity international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank for international settlements", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tajikistan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:52:44.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b5e9a220c257abfe87e62c99dc5f43d8dc010d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI86i7qGL1IPGT2350sC6YpZoAtjlEwjhFapLd8ANe_l8MTA89.ZC75gHQXTtaxHHtSxkvmM_9kA69HkmJ7M34iyT0pZkVVEzAPQ--", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/-2128680634.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International Business, World & Global Business News | Share Market News - Times of India", "title": "Gold: Stronger dollar pushes gold to 7-week low", "title_full": "Gold: Stronger dollar pushes gold to 7-week low - Times of India", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1b5e9a220c257abfe87e62c99dc5f43d8dc010d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI86i7qGL1IPGT2350sC6YpZoAtjlEwjhFapLd8ANe_l8MTA89.ZC75gHQXTtaxHHtSxkvmM_9kA69HkmJ7M34iyT0pZkVVEzAPQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gold: Stronger dollar pushes gold to 7-week low", "text": "* Strong U.S. data raises rate hike expectations * World stocks hit record high * ETF holdings fall by most since July (Updates throughout, adds London dateline) By Peter Hobson LONDON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - Gold fell to its lowest in seven weeks on Tuesday after strong U.S. economic data reinforced expectations of another interest rate rise in the United States this year and pushed the dollar and U.S. bond yields higher. The CME 's Fedwatch indicator showed markets were pricing in a 77 percent likelihood of a December rate rise after U.S. manufacturing activity surged. World stocks also rose to new record highs as a positive global growth outlook encouraged investment in riskier assets. A strong dollar makes gold more expensive for holders of other currencies, potentially undermining their desire to buy, while higher bond yields reduce the appeal of non-yielding gold. Higher interest rates meanwhile push bond yields higher and tend to boost the dollar. Spot gold was flat at $1,270.70 an ounce at 1012 GMT. It earlier touched $1,267.76, the lowest since Aug. 15 and down more than 6 percent from a one-year high of $1,357.54 in early September. U.S. gold futures for December delivery were 0.2 percent lower at $1,273.80 an ounce. \"The factors that pushed gold toward $1,360 in early September are now reversing,\" Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said. \"The U.S. dollar and yields have rebounded from their recent lows and it looks like positioning in the gold futures market is somewhat reversing, with some long covering and new shorts.\" The net long position of hedge funds and money managers in COMEX gold rose nine-fold in the two months to mid-September, helping push prices higher, but has since fallen sharply. Menke said he expected a strengthening dollar and normalisation of speculative positioning to push gold to $1,200 an ounce by the end of the year. Prices have also been supported by purchases of physical gold by bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. But ETF holdings tracked by Reuters dropped between Friday and Monday by the most since late July. On the technical side, gold was holding around its 100-day moving average at $1,272. \"This figure will be the key today in restricting any further declines,\" MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin said in a note. \"Should gold continue to trade lower, the next target will be the 200-day moving average and key psychological level around$1,250.\" In other precious metals, silver was up 0.2 percent at $16.58 an ounce but still near its lowest since Aug.9.

It earlier touched $1,267.76, the lowest since Aug. 15 and down more than 6 percent from a one-year high of $1,357.54 in early September.\nU.S. gold futures for December delivery were 0.2 percent lower at $1,273.80 an ounce.\n\"The factors that pushed gold toward $1,360 in early September are now reversing,\" Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said.\n\"The U.S. dollar and yields have rebounded from their recent lows and it looks like positioning in the gold futures market is somewhat reversing, with some long covering and new shorts.\"\nThe net long position of hedge funds and money managers in COMEX gold rose nine-fold in the two months to mid-September, helping push prices higher, but has since fallen sharply.\nMenke said he expected a strengthening dollar and normalisation of speculative positioning to push gold to $1,200 an ounce by the end of the year.\nPrices have also been supported by purchases of physical gold by bullion-backed exchange-traded funds. But ETF holdings tracked by Reuters dropped between Friday and Monday by the most since late July.\nOn the technical side, gold was holding around its 100-day moving average at $1,272.\n\"This figure will be the key today in restricting any further declines,\" MKS PAMP trader Sam Laughlin said in a note. \"Should gold continue to trade lower, the next target will be the 200-day moving average and key psychological level around$1,250.\"\nIn other precious metals, silver was up 0.2 percent at $16.58 an ounce but still near its lowest since Aug.9.\nPlatinum was 0.2 percent higher at $912.70 and palladium was up 1 percent to $918.50 an ounce.

Romania 's central bank will try to address market liquidity to soften a rise in interbank interest rates, but fiscal and monetary policies should work together better to improve financial stability, Finance Minister Ionut Misa said.\nIn late September, Prime Minister Mihai Tudose criticised the central bank for a rise in bank-to-bank lending rates . The prime minister did not mention that higher energy prices and a fuel tax hike had triggered expectations of surging inflation.\nThe central bank holds a meeting on Tuesday and analysts widely expect it to keep its key rate on hold at a record low 1.75 percent. The ask yield on the 3-month interbank rate rose to 1.8 percent on Tuesday, exceeding the central bank's main rate.\n\"It is a market liquidity problem that has several causes, many of them very technical,\" Misa told reporters after a meeting with central bank officials on Tuesday.\n\"The ministry's tax collection has also had an influence. The central bank has experts that will...seek solutions to soften the rises,\" he said.\nThe ruling Social Democrats have wavered over their tax intentions this year, often announcing measures without assessing their impact and then backing out, stirring uncertainty among investors and weighing on assets.\nThe government has already raised public sector wages and pensions and plans further hikes as well as tax cuts for 2018, and the European Commission expects Romania to run the EU 's largest budget deficits this year and next.\nMisa said the ministry expected to get 1.2 billion lei ($307.31 million) worth of dividends from state-owned firms this year, with only 525 million lei collected so far.

But the project has faced delays, partly over a long-running row between developers and those who fear it will destroy the environment.\nForestry authorities in May declared 3.7 hectares of the estate as protected woodland, on a spot developers said was integral to the project.\nGreece's privatisation agency, which is in charge of concluding the deal with Lamda, had appealed the decision. A four-member panel of the country's forestry department ruled on Monday that the plot is not forest.\n\"The agency's appeal...was upheld by a 3-to-2 majority,\" the committee's president Christos Antonellis told Reuters, adding that the decision is expected to be published by Wednesday.\nThe decision is subject to appeal.\nThe privatisation agency's chief Lila Tsitsogiannopoulou said the decision was \"positive\" and that the agency's appeal had strong legal grounds. The Hellenikon project has become a major political issue in Greece which is slowly emerging from a multi-year debt crisis. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras , whose leftist party strongly opposed it before coming to power in 2015, is seen as keen to now implement the deal to help boost economic activity and reduce unemployment, the eurozone's highest.\nBacked by Chinese and Gulf investors, Lamda submitted its detailed development plan for Hellenikon in July. Objections by archaeologists who worry that the investment will hurt Greece's cultural heritage is another hurdle Greece now needs to overcome.\nThe government's top advisory body on the protection of antiquities, the Central Archaeological Council , was scheduled to meet again on Tuesday to discuss the matter.

This is despite last year's narrowing down of its most likely resting place to a 25,000-square kilometer (9,650-square mile) patch of the southern Indian Ocean.\nThe Boeing 777 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew disappeared soon into its flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014.\nA 52-day surface search covered an area of several million square kilometers (square miles) in the Indian Ocean west of Australia, before an underwater search mapped 710,000 square kilometers (274,000 square miles) of seabed at depths of up to 6,000 meters (20,000 feet). They were the largest aviation searches of their kind in history, the bureau said.\nDespite other methods such as studying satellite imagery and investigating ocean drifts after debris from the plane washed ashore on islands in the eastern Indian Ocean and the east coast of Africa, the 1,046-day search was called off by the governments of Malaysia, China and Australia on Jan. 17.\n\"The reasons for the loss of MH370 cannot be established with certainty until the aircraft is found,\" the bureau, which coordinated the search, said in the 440-page report.\n\"It is almost inconceivable and certainly societally unacceptable in the modern aviation era with 10 million passengers boarding commercial aircraft every day, for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board,\" it said.\n\"The ATSB expresses our deepest sympathies to the families of the passengers and crew on board MH370. We share your profound and prolonged grief, and deeply regret that we have not been able to locate the aircraft, nor those 239 souls on board that remain missing.\"\nHowever, the report said the understanding of where the plane may be is \"better now than it has ever been,\" partly as a result of studying debris that washed ashore in 2015 and 2016 which showed the plane was \"not configured for a ditching at the end-of-flight,\" meaning it had run out of fuel.\nThe search team also looked back at satellite imagery which showed objects in the ocean that may have been MH370 debris. The report said this analysis complemented work detailed in a 2016 review and identified an area of less than 25,000 square kilometers (9,650 square miles) - roughly the size of the U.S. state of Vermont - that \"has the highest likelihood of containing MH370.\"\nThe bureau noted the Malaysian government is \"continuing work on their investigation of the facts and circumstances surrounding the loss of MH370.\"\nThe search was extremely difficult because no transmissions were received from the aircraft after its first 38 minutes of flight. Systems designed to automatically transmit the flight's position failed to work after this point, the report said.\nSubsequent analysis of radar and satellite communication data revealed the aircraft had continued to fly for seven hours. Its last positively known position was fixed at the northern tip of Sumatra by surveillance systems operating that night, six hours before it ended its flight in the southern Indian Ocean.\nThe bureau said the search had at least led to some important gains in the field of locating missing aircraft on flights over deep ocean areas, with improvements made to systems for tracking aircraft.\n\"Steps are being taken to advance other aircraft systems including emergency locator transponders and flight recorder locator beacons,\" the report said.\nATSB Chief Commissioner Greg Hood praised the commitment of everyone involved in the search.\n\"This was an unprecedented endeavor and there has been an extraordinary response from the global community,\" he said in a statement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greg hood", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "malaysia airlines", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian transport safety bureau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atsb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:55:45.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7123685b86774b9ec202a64818eb1b2f6f11e06e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdlVDagmwM6ujI67YC5Ef8ygAythEXFOYEiwppIVqUddcL1ddhiqCe4919AbeIN2eKkljkUZZH6ImoDj9q1zSWi81NhxJdHJQ14heDAoW8SaVnJ9SS3ypIq33uEjVVw4Rgo7MdIgabyWNTgysMuLrpfV3r7ezQWIVpQ-", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/rssfeeds/1715249553.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News-The Economic Times", "title": "Soccer: Burden of expectation on Socceroos as they face Syria in playoff -

It is not an equal distribution system but it is a relatively equal one,\" he told Reuters.\n\"It means the smaller clubs can invest in the transfer market and then can compete against the top six and put a good game on, there is a spectacle there and that is what the broadcasting companies pay for. If I am brutal the top clubs have forgotten about that,\" he said.\nThe British revenue, from deals with Sky Sports and BT Sports, is not entirely distributed on equal basis.\nAccording to the league's figures, 706 million pounds was split evenly among the clubs last season while the remaining 815 million was handed out in facility fees which take into account the amount of times a team is shown live on television while merit payments reward a club's final position in the league.\nChampions Chelsea received nearly 151 million pounds while bottom club Sunderland pocketed just over 93 million.\n\nSMALLER CLUBS\nWhile chairmen from the smaller clubs have opted to keep quiet before Wednesday's meeting, Burnley manager Sean Dyche believes it would be mistake to reduce the finances of smaller clubs such as his.\n\"Do I think it should be an even split? Yes , just for the reasons of competition. We know it's an imbalanced competition anyway, if you make it even more imbalanced, and money rules the competitive element of top level football, so if someone is getting even more, and someone gets even less, it's going to distort it,\" he said.\n\"We all love to see the real super powers of world football going head to head, but I still think English and British fans love to see the smaller clubs and middle clubs over a season. I think to keep it as level as you can is a better way of doing it,\" added Dyche , whose team sit sixth in the league and upset Chelsea on the opening day.\n\"It could get so distorted that it doesn't stay a really competitive league. The best thing that happened to football for me was Leicester winning the league. It gave it a real shake up,\" he added, referring to Leicester's shock Premier League title triumph in 2016.\nWilson agrees and notes that the conflict seems strange given that only just over a third of the foreign revenues are proposed to be divided by league position.\n\"I can't understand what difference they think an extra 10-15 million is going to make? Manchester United have just turned over half a billion, what is an extra 10-20 million going to make a tangible difference to how they perform domestically or in Europe?,\" he said.\n\"It is incredibly greedy and wildly unnecessary when you consider why ultimately the television companies are buying the league. It's not just because they want to broadcast the 'Big Six', it is because they are playing against competitive smaller teams.\nWhile the top clubs certainly take centre stage on international broadcasts of the league, Kyle Martino , commentator and analyst on NBC 's broadcasts in the United States , believes the league's international appeal is about much more than the top six.\n\"The big club power is nothing new, it created the Premier League we love today, but it wouldn't be the Premier League we love today without the underdogs,\" he said.\n\"Leicester is one of the greatest sports stories of all time, so for me the underdogs deserve equal share,\" he said.\n\n\n($1 = 0.7548 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Ed Osmond  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simon evans", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed osmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean dyche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian ayre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyle martino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dyche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob wilson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "smaller premier league", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sheffield hallam university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sunderland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burnley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leicester", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:56:15.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ddb1e2c23d2d6ce402a0b8ddd0089203e78c24c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdlVDagmwM6ujA83TslRWinxaW_j39hvRYYFBgS8q.FVCCHJr7N1zEbKF9vBVLK9g5qEzOHBqE29RIxao_H2PtP6nwrxCYg7lFT.F9SiHnpYphPizGzadixzEoNLdeKVZW8-", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/rssfeeds/1715249553.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News-The Economic Times", "title": "Electricity from tears could power biomedical devices - The Economic Times", "title_full": "Electricity from tears could power biomedical devices - The Economic Times", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/photo/6325547.cms", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ddb1e2c23d2d6ce402a0b8ddd0089203e78c24c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdlVDagmwM6ujA83TslRWinxaW_j39hvRYYFBgS8q.FVCCHJr7N1zEbKF9vBVLK9g5qEzOHBqE29RIxao_H2PtP6nwrxCYg7lFT.F9SiHnpYphPizGzadixzEoNLdeKVZW8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Electricity from tears could power biomedical devices - The Economic Times", "text": "London , Oct 3 ( IANS ) In a finding that could lead to a non-toxic way to power biomedical devices, scientists have discovered a way to produce electricity from tears. \n\nThe researchers observed that crystals of lysozyme, which is a model protein that is abundant in tears as well as in the egg whites of birds, saliva and the milk of mammals, can generate electricity when pressed. \n\nThe discovery, detailed in the journal Applied Physics Letters , may have wide reaching applications and could lead to further research in the area of energy harvesting and flexible electronics for biomedical devices. \n\nFuture applications of the discovery may include controlling the release of drugs in the body by using lysozyme as a physiologically mediated pump that scavenges energy from its surroundings. \n\nThe ability to generate electricity by applying pressure -- known as direct piezoelectricity -- is a property of materials such as quartz that can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice versa. \n\nBone, tendon and wood are long known to possess piezoelectricity, the researchers said. \n\n\"The extent of the piezoelectricity in lysozyme crystals is of the same order of magnitude found in quartz.

ANI | Updated: Oct 3, 2017, 14:40 IST AGARTALA: Media representatives of eleven organisations, including working journalists, photo-journalists, television and web journalists, besides owners of media houses in Tripura have called for Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI )-led probe into the murder of television journalist Santana Bhaumik. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) also extended its support for this, questioning the fact that a journalist was murdered in spite of the area where he was being under prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Criminal procedure Code (CrPC). Santanu died while covering a clash between activists of the IPFT and the TUGMP, the tribal wing of the ruling CPI-M at Mundwai on September 20. \"Law and order is the subject of the state government..and will there be intervention of the centre in that depends on the activity of the state government moreover, whether central or the state police will be deployed for a peaceful election that depends on the election commission and not the BJP though the Communists can say this with political intentions.... but inspite of promulgation of 144 CrPC if any incident takes place then for that Manik Sarkar is totally responsible,\" said state BJP president Biplab Kumar Deb at a press conference at the party headquarters here. He added, \"Two or three murders which have taken place for which the state government is totally responsible because you have promulgated the restriction law, IG Law and Order was there, DIG, SP, DSP and the entire force was there. In spite of all this, an incident takes place and in which a journalist dies and a poor driver is missing and there is no trace of him till now. So, this is the situation and for which you cannot make us responsible because you are running the government. I, on the very first day, said that if you cannot run the government, then resign and BJP will show how to run a government. You will run the government and allege that they cannot run the government. Just stop doing politics and run the state like a government. This will be my request to them.\" Deb charged the Communists with applying double standards. He questioned the need for Chief Minister Manik Sarkar to join a protest rally when Karnataka journalist Gauri Lankesh had died, and not protesting when Santanu had died. So far, the state government has agreed to an investigation of the case by a Special Investigation Team (SIT). Those in favour of a CBI investigation, believe that the state police has failed in its duty and could have saved Santanu. Chief Minister Sarkar has visited the house of the victim and granted Rs.10 lakh as ex gratia for the deceased journalist's family. Get latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App .

They lie fifth in the 10-team South American group, just below Peru on goal difference.\n\"Now it's gotten complicated,\" coach Jorge Sampaoli said after they drew their last match at home to Venezuela . \"It's tight.\"\nThe top four teams qualify automatically for next year's tournament in Russia and the fifth-placed side play New Zealand in a two-legged playoff for an additional spot.\nFormer Chile and Seville coach Sampaoli took over four months ago with the sole task of getting what is arguably the world's greatest collection of attacking talent to Russia.\nThe problem, however, has been how to get the best out of it.\nArgentina have so many options in midfield and up front that players such as Sergio Aguero , Gonzalo Higuain and Javier Pastore are not automatic choices.\nHiguain, who played in nine of Argentina's first 13 qualifiers, was dropped from the last two squads and Aguero , who will miss the next two games through injury, has started five of the last six on the bench.\nThe players chosen have struggled to reproduce their club form at international level, with Lionel Messi and Paulo Dybala among those who have been less than influential when wearing the blue and white stripes.\nArgentina lost at home to Ecuador and Paraguay and failed to beat Venezuela, a team with just one win from 16 games, both home and away. They have scored only 16 goals, with only Bolivia managing fewer.\nAnother problem has come off the field where turmoil within the Argentine Football Association has meant three coaches have led the team since the qualifying campaign began two years ago.\nThe constant chopping and changing has prevented the side from finding a settled style of play.\nSampaoli, who took over in June, has the credentials, having led Chile to the Copa America title in 2015.\nBut his selections have also been inconsistent and Argentina have used 48 different players since the 2016 Copa America.\nSampaoli this week recalled Fernando Gago after a two-year absence and called up two players who have never started a competitive international.\nIn a bid to increase the pressure on their opponents the home side have moved the game to Boca Juniors ' tightly-packed Bombonera stadium from their traditional home at River Plate 's Monumental.\n(Reporting by Andrew Downie, editing by Ed Osmond  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew downie", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "soccer-argentina", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fernando gago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulo dybala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jorge sampaoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergio aguero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gonzalo higuain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "higuain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed osmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sampaoli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javier pastore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lionel messi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aguero", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boca juniors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentine football association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecuador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombonera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paraguay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copa america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "river plate", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:04:58.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1bc5e2efa95027ce29e76e28776620aa8f9c5a5f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdlVDagmwM6ujI.BXKaNreJSii8k_tHfvsrlgG9jLnWJdAlGrGtHH3TmAR.A26ons8VTwYY8Rd6rJhQ2JCztS1a9XLzEFHemQLSquODvebDnMM8XHBFsxTcCaP.GCkqhQj0YmOuB5fwPeicCt3RckdbYKWQ1m3vNLAAEowsohJhIMQ--", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/1715249553.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "News-The Economic Times", "title": "uber london: Uber boss to meet London transport chief in bid to keep licence -

Khan said the firm needed to spend less time hiring \"an army of PR experts and an army of lawyers\" and instead address issues raised by TfL.\nKhan, a centre-left politician from Britain's opposition Labour Party, approved Tuesday's meeting between Khosrowshahi and TfL Commissioner Mike Brown, who is in charge of TfL's day-to-day operations.\nUber's licence expired on September 30 but its roughly 40,000 drivers are still be able to take passengers until an appeals process is exhausted, which could take several months.\nBOARD MEETING\nKhosrowshahi was appointed Uber chief executive in August, replacing co-founder and former boss Travis Kalanick and has promised change at the $70-billion dollar firm.\nHe is battling to steer a new course for the app, which has faced regulatory crackdowns, court cases, bans and protests around the world, as well as several boardroom controversies.\nIn a sign of broader problems facing Uber, Khosrowshahi is also expected to call into a contentious board meeting in San Francisco on Tuesday which will look at cutting the influence of Kalanick, sources said.\nThe meeting will consider proposals to strip early investors of supervoting power and secure a multibillion-dollar investment. Kalanick, ousted by investors in June, contends that fellow Uber board members are moving too fast on a dramatic restructuring, sources said.\nTrying to repair relations with the authorities in London, Khosrowshahi last week struck a more conciliatory tone in an open letter to Londoners, marking a new approach for a firm which has deployed a combative style to break into closed markets around the world.\n\"It's ... true that we've got things wrong along the way. On behalf of everyone at Uber globally, I apologise for the mistakes we've made,\" he wrote in the open letter.\nUber's fate in London will be decided by a judge who will rule on the appeal after it is submitted by Oct. 13.\nUber's competitors are already trying to take its business.

As a touring band it is very demanding, both physically as well as emotionally. We work hard to maintain our health and spirit. We have also never really been a commercially minded band and tried to fit any particular fashion or scene. This has helped us just focus on the music and the heart and emotion behind it, which has led to a very long and wonderful career.\nMusic being made freely accessible on digital platforms all the time \u2014 what do you have to say about that?\nIt has destroyed much of the music business and made it too difficult for musicians to make a living playing music.\nYou have seen a lot of things change in the music industry over the years. What do you think is the most significant one?\nThe fact that everyone thinks that music should be free is the most significant one. It's very bad and there is still no solution as of yet. I'm working with partners on a new platform which could really help by allowing fans to directly support the artistes they love and the artistes around the world to support each other.\nWhat amongst your works is your all time favourite? What are your memories attached to that number?\nI remember being in the studio for the Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence album with keyboards all over the control room and sending MIDI information to all of them doing this huge orchestration for the overture! A great memory. That album was very creative and we took a lot of new directions, so it stands out to me.\nAs a band what do you think should be prioritised more \u2014 lyrics or music?\nPersonally, I am more focused on the music. My main concern is that the lyrics should not interfere with the phrasing and musicality of the music. That said, many people (thankfully) care greatly about the words. I think that the ultimate is to bring the two elements together.\nHave you been to India before?\nI have been here twice before. Once almost 30 years ago as a Kurzweil synthesiser specialist and more recently, I was teaching at the Swarnabhoomi Academy of Music.\nAre you familiar with Indian music?\nI'm passionate about the Indian musical culture and I'm always learning about it. It is especially meaningful to me to come and connect with everyone. I just finished a kind of East meets West recording of a new song with Mahesh Raghvan, Mohini Day and BC Manjunath which will be released soon. Also, I am a fan (and a friend) of AR Rahman!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mike portnoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john petrucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan rudess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john myung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike mangini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james labrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahesh raghvan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohini day", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swarnabhoomi academy of music", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurzweil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bombay times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:10:14.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "573869233a27b1ca6002066c5a0aa6fbf0f64877", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCZ3bkEHBojeqo3El7eaH0jaXH4Nns8rWj3WSBj2g9XbkZbjnDdcvkpQ8_IBbllx36cHsbGyayv6X9nbCGBXANdWmt9KJJ2AFZuutkqEUBkXlAK0Eu_8GOUAB.Jgv6YHUROq6B0cBMeGg--", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Times of India", "title": "Acts of heroism saved countless lives at Las Vegas shooting - Times of India", "title_full": "Acts of heroism saved countless lives at Las Vegas shooting - Times of India", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60924522/60924522.jpg?50139", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 322, "comments": 0, "shares": 322}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "573869233a27b1ca6002066c5a0aa6fbf0f64877", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCZ3bkEHBojeqo3El7eaH0jaXH4Nns8rWj3WSBj2g9XbkZbjnDdcvkpQ8_IBbllx36cHsbGyayv6X9nbCGBXANdWmt9KJJ2AFZuutkqEUBkXlAK0Eu_8GOUAB.Jgv6YHUROq6B0cBMeGg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Acts of heroism saved countless lives at Las Vegas shooting - Times of India", "text": "Acts of heroism saved countless lives at Las Vegas shooting AP | Updated: Oct 3, 2017, 16:42 IST Highlights Amid the massacre in Las Vegas, which left 59 people dead and over 500 injured, there were many acts of heroics. 42-year-old US Army veteran Rob Ledbetter, who served as a sniper in Iraq, immediately began tending to the wounded.

A candlelight vigil is pictured on the Las Vegas strip following a mass shooting at the Route 91 Harvest Count... Read More LAS VEGAS: Rob Ledbetter's battlefield instincts kicked in quickly as bullets rained overhead. The 42-year-old US Army veteran who served as a sniper in Iraq immediately began tending to the wounded, one of several heroes to emerge from the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Amid the massacre in Las Vegas, which left 59 people dead and more than 500 injured + , there were acts of compassion and countless heroics that officials say saved scores of lives. There was a man one survivor knows only as Zach who herded people to a safe place. There was a registered nurse from Tennessee who died shielding his wife. Like many people in the crowd of some 22,000 country music fans Sunday night, Ledbetter heard the pop-pop-popping noise and figured it was fireworks. Then he saw people dropping to the ground. When more booms echoed in the night air, he recognized the sound of automatic weapons fire. The gunman, identified as Stephen Craig Paddock + , a 64-year-old retired accountant from Mesquite, Nevada, created his own sniper's perch inside the 32nd floor room at the Mandalay Bay casino hotel, across from the concert grounds. He appeared to fire unhindered for more than 10 minutes, according to radio traffic, and then killed himself before officers stormed in and found 23 firearms. \"The echo, it sounded like it was coming from everywhere and you didn't know which way to run,\" said Ledbetter, who was at the concert with seven people including his brother, who was shot and injured, and his wife. They found cover in a VIP area of the concert. Once out of harm's way, he turned to injured strangers. Thanks to a man who took the flannel shirt off his back, Ledbetter says he put a makeshift tourniquet on a wounded teenage girl, whose face was covered with blood. \"Some random guy, I said, 'I need your shirt,' \"said Ledbetter, who is now a mortgage broker and a resident of Las Vegas. `'He just gave me the flannel off his back.\" Ledbetter said he compressed someone else's shoulder wound, and he fashioned a bandage for a man whose leg was shot through by a bullet. \"There was a guy that looked like he had a through and through on his leg, that we just put a T-shirt around and just did a bandanna tie,\" said Ledbetter, who was outside University Medical Center on Monday, where his brother was being treated for a gunshot that went through his arm and into his chest. He is expected to survive. Ledbetter and others grabbed the injured man, carried him out to Las Vegas Boulevard, put him in the back of a utility truck with five to 10 other people that was headed to the hospital. Ledbetter said he would have helped more people but couldn't clear the barrage of gunfire. \"I'm saving people, or trying to do my best. But it got to the point, I saw people all over, laying where we used to be standing ... just laying there and nobody getting to them and I couldn't get out there. The shots just kept coming in and bouncing. I would have been in harm's way,\" he said. He worries that those unfamiliar with battlefields will suffer what they have survived. \"Everybody there is going to have emotional problems. I know that. There was blood everywhere I went: Excalibur, Luxor, on the Strip, on the street,\" Ledbetter said. \"All these people are going to have PTSD. I feel bad for all of them.\" Another concertgoer, Anna Kupchyan, credits a man she knows only as Zach for saving her life and about nine others when he herded them into an outdoor trailer serving as a restroom. Kupchyan, a 27-year-old law student from Los Angeles, said bullets were raining down on the crowd as she and a horde of others began running in search of a way out of the outdoor venue. The man, Zach, opened a door and ordered people inside and then joined them and shut the door, Kupchyan said. They stayed inside as the shooting continued, everyone paralyzed in fear, she said. \"Then security came and they shouted for us to get out, to run,\" she recalled. Outside the trailer, dead bodies were sprawled on the ground, including a man who had been shot in the head, she said. She and her best friend Leslie Aguilar, a 26-year-old therapist, eventually jumped in a cab that was driving by and befriended two other women survivors who let them stay in their hotel room until the danger subsided. Not all of Sunday night's heroes survived. Sonny Melton, a registered nurse, died in the shooting, according to The Henry County Medical Center in Paris, Tennessee, where he worked. His wife, Dr. Heather Melton, an orthopedic surgeon who was with him when shots were fired, survived. She told WZTV in Nashville, Tennessee, that her husband \"saved my life and lost his.\" She said her husband was the most kind-hearted, loving man she ever met.

Developing economies, led by China and India, accounted for nearly 90% of the 750 million people that went online for the fi rst time between 2012 and 2015. Digitalisation is fuelling the rise of 3D printing , artificial intelligence , the Internet of things , cloud computing , big data and automation . Although the transformational power of digitalisation is clear, effective policies are needed to make sure the gains are spread evenly across as well as within countries, according to Unctad\u2019s Information Economy Report 2017.The study points out that more than half of the world\u2019s population still remains offline, and the pace of growth in access and use is slowing.

All the stakeholders will have to be involved in taking Indian sports to a new level. The government will provide the platform for the young people to take up sports,\" he said.\n\"In this regard, the government has decided to start for the first time the Khelo India National School Games in December 2017 and Khelo India National College Games in January 2018. These will be annual events. This we are doing to tap talent at the school and college levels. Without doing this we will not be able to nurture talent,\" Rathore added.\nHe said the corporate houses will be involved in this endeavour and the Games will be telecast live.\nElaborating the plan of the government, the sports minister said, \"We want to hold these Games in a big way like the Asian Games or Pan American Games. From these Games, 1000 children will be selected and be given Rs 5 lakh for eight years for their training and each year 1000 children more will be added.\n\"These days miracles do not happen in sports. We have to find out young talents and nurture them so that miracles happen.\"\nRathore, who won an individual silver medal in men's double trap shooting event at the 2004 Athens Olympics, asked the India U-17 football team members to play to win in the upcoming tournament.\n\"You, the U-17 players can inspire the nation with what you do on the football field. The game you play now will be etched in memory. You (India) may have qualified automatically as the hosts, but that should not deter you from surprising the other teams by winning matches.\n\"You should play each game as the last match of your life and should never give up. Every moment counts and you are there to win and you will play the games to win. Once you step into the field you should be aggressive and play to win,\" said Rathore while speaking to the Indian players, who listened with rapt attention.\nThe Minister advised the players to motivate themselves by remembering the hardships they had to endure before reaching this stage.\n\"When you enter the field, you should remember the most ridiculous things people may have said about you in the past, all the pains you have suffered in you efforts to reach up to here and all the late night dribbles with the ball that has become a part of your life,\" said Rathore.\n\"You are not playing for Manipur or Bengal or Goa but you are playing for India. I wish you all the very best in the FIFA U-17 World Cup.\"\nAll the 21 players were introduced to the sports minister and captain Amarjit Singh Kiyam received a memento on behalf of the team.\nLater speaking to the reporters, Rathore said Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was handed over to the Local Organising Committee according to schedule and the FIFA was happy with the facilities.\n\"FIFA is the organiser of this tournament and we have handed over the JLN to the LoC much earlier. FIFA is happy with the preparation of the facility,\" he said.\nHe also said that ticket sales of the U-17 World Cup was satisfactory.\n\"The ticket sales in all the six venues was very good. We actually held on the sale of the tickets so that we can reserve some for the children.

Company Summary Charts Valuation & Peer Comparison Community Buzz PEER COMPANIES Investors can subscribe to the Godrej Agrovet IPO given the unique diversification of the agro and allied business, strong parentage and reasonable valuation. The company operates in an industry with lower organised sector penetration , which offers better opportunity for growth. The company intends to raise Rs 1,157 crore through the IPO at the upper price band. Of this, Rs 866 crore will be used to give partial exit to holding company Godrej Industries and V-Sciences Investment, a Temasek entity. The remaining Rs 292 crore will be used to repay short-term loans. Business Overview Godrej Agrovet (GAV) has five business verticals -animal feed, crop protection, palm oil, dairy and poultry, and processed foods. It is the leading compound animal feed company in India . It is also one of the leaders in the segment in Bangladesh through a joint venture. Animal feed mainly comprises of cattle, chicken and aqua feed. This accounts for 53 per cent of the sales and 35 per cent of operating profit (EBIT). GAV, in its crop protection vertical, makes plant growth regulators, organic manures, generic agrochemicals and specialised herbicides. In October 2015, it acquired majority stake in a listed company Astec LifeSciences , a manufacturer of agrochemical active ingredients, formulations and intermediate products. The company sells in 24 countries across Europe, West Asia, Southeast Asia, Latin America and the US. This is 15 per cent of sales and 36 per cent of EBIT. GAV is also largest crude palm oil producer in India, which contributes 10 per cent to sales and 22 per cent to EBIT. Through a pact with nine states, the company has access to one-fifth of the country's land suitable for palm oil cultivation. GA V entered in the dairy segment in 2005. In 2015, it acquired Creamline Dairy, which sells under the 'Jersey' brand in Telangana , Andhra Pradesh , Tamil Nadu , Kar nataka and Maharashtra . This accounts for 20 per cent of sales and 8 per cent of EBIT. The poultry and processed foods business makes uo 2 per cent of sales and not yet profitable. Financials Between FY13 and FY17, sales grew by 15.8 per cent annually to Rs 4,926 crore and net profit rose by 29.8 per cent to Rs 274 crore. EBIT margin was 8.9 per cent in FY17 and return on equity (RoE) was 27.8 per cent. The debt-equity ratio currently stands at 0.7. Valuations It is one of a kind company with no listed peer. At the upper price band, the IPO is priced at 35 times FY17 earnings and 1.8 times sales. This may not look cheap given the conglomerate structure and complexity of operations. However, it appears reasonable given GAV's strong record of growth, dividend , and return ratios of over 20 per cent.

You have been bullish on the auto space. Does the rationale that market over time rewards those with bullish view, still remains the same? \n\nIt remains the same because we were anyway expecting a sharp rise and that is what has been happening but it is not that it is extra bullish. It is also important from a sector perspective but the market as a whole has been providing a very high valuation to this sector expecting the high growth rates. It is something coming through that was expected to happen. Second, you mentioned about Diwali coming earlier, the festival season actually starts with Ganesh Chaturthi and Onam in the south in Kerala and those were much earlier in the quarter. \n\nThere has been two recent listings of insurance companies from two major financial powerhouses. They have not done great post listing. What is your opinion on this space and what is your outlook going forward? \n\nThe market has just come up with the rule on how to value these. If you look at general finance sector and take private sector finance companies or even major private sector banks over the last 5 to 10 years, the market valuations have steadily gone up as the market has figured out how to value these because there is a business model. How do they expand, what are the costs, what is the capital requirements\u2026 these are all testing phases because we just had one or two listings It is a kind of a discovery phase for the market but if you look at over the next 5 to 10 years, this will all be kind of multibaggers in return because the penetration of all these financial products whether it is general insurance , life insurance or even personal loans are very low compared to other emerging markets and of course much lower than the developed countries. \n\nThe scope is huge but the market in terms of valuing has not yet figured out the ground rules and that will happen over the next few quarters. We have some more listings coming in from the government side in terms of the insurance companies GIC and New India. Once these come in, there will be supply and there will be true price realisation. \n\nI understand that you are bullish on housing financial space and this is very basic learning from street that we are seeing a very slow pace of new home sales. What makes you so bullish on housing finance companies looking at this scenario or taking this scenario into consideration that on ground reality is not that great? \n\nBasically, we are taking a more forward looking stance here because we did some analysis and we found that if you take an average salaried person (at Rs 8 lakh per annum salary) and you take the average low cost house of let us say Rs 30 lakh, today\u2019s EMI percentage of 22% of a person salary is only needed to buy such a house. This is at a record multi-decade low. It was as high as 36% a few years ago. So the affordability of housing at the lower end of the spectrum has been phenomenally improving. Because of demonetisation and the real estate slowdown, the sentiment of people have got affected in terms of their buying new houses but as you see, now that the affordability housing is improving, government is giving a huge thrust to low cost housing and for this the projects have to come up in a new specific way to qualify for these subsidies and the benefits so that is something which have started and will continue. \n\nThe second is the stiffer regulation on the RERA which the government has bought in and that also slowed down the element of supply. People also want to only invest in RERA approved realty and states also have to pass the RERA rule. Only a few states have yet passed those RERA rules. \n\nIt is a fact that in the housing sector \u2013 a lot of big name builders have not delivered on the projects and lot of court cases are going on. The court is intervening and trying to get the money back and so it is just a short-term period of uncertainty and people are waiting to see the regulatory direction and all of that but with interest rates trending down, we think banks still have not passed on a substantial portion of the rate cut which RBI has already done. So, over the next one year, we expect almost a 100 bps cut in lending rates by banks. \n\nThis will also give a thrust to housing because housing is one sector where you see the longest term loans. Housing has the lowest rate of interest. It is a very paradoxical thing. The reason for that is that there is a long term continuity to the cash flows to the banks. You will see the price competitive in housing loan sector sharply and that is where all the price play will happen and you will see housing loans become cheaper. \n\nIn our economy, over a 10-15 year period, housing loans have gone as low as 7% and today is still 8.5%. We believe that all these trends over the next 6-12 months are going to lead to a sharp revival in good quality housing and housing finance companies are going to be at the forefront in capturing that demand.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sundaram", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sid bhamre", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sunil subramaniam", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ganesh chaturthi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sundaram mutual fund", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "economic times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "diwali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:27:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86677639b44dc2bcfb32f500e90a306fce4224a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdmFxfjpahdE29adGr.1d_G79Yc73QBpIiKjkG.DIcFfre7yYxHxfGO2LtwDVTXOz6HW9hXz6viSE3gXcIJNcRO8N1LrWfiuGcLK3_2BpTrsuVDW2ssyggFZ5z.FwYmBTNI-", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Economic Times", "title": "Sensex: Top gainers and losers of Tuesday's trade - The Economic Times", "title_full": "Sensex: Top gainers and losers of Tuesday's trade - The Economic Times", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-60924220,width-672,resizemode-4,imglength-17125/markets/stocks/news/top-gainers-and-losers-of-tuesdays-tradebrbr/top-gainers-and-losers-of-tuesdays-trade.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86677639b44dc2bcfb32f500e90a306fce4224a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdmFxfjpahdE29adGr.1d_G79Yc73QBpIiKjkG.DIcFfre7yYxHxfGO2LtwDVTXOz6HW9hXz6viSE3gXcIJNcRO8N1LrWfiuGcLK3_2BpTrsuVDW2ssyggFZ5z.FwYmBTNI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sensex: Top gainers and losers of Tuesday's trade - The Economic Times", "text": "NEW DELHI: The domestic benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty extended gains for a third straight session. \n\nFMCG, autos, metals, pharma and realty sectors contributed most of the gains. \n\nThe Nifty50 index closed 71 points up at 9,859, while Sensex settled 214 points up at 31,497 on Tuesday. \n\nAmong the gainers in the Nifty50 index, GAIL stood at the top, with gains of over 4 per cent.

The Economic Times", "text": "NEW DELHI: The government should set up an authority to \"compel\" ministries to disclose information on their websites and reduce the burden of RTI applications, India's first chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah has said.\nHailing the Right to Information Act (RTI) as a \"great success story\", Habibullah added that there were still challenges in the implementation of the 12-year-old law.\nThe absence of updated information on websites by ministries, both at the central and state level, and the maintenance of autonomy and independence of the Central Information Commission and information commissions in states were some of the challenges, the former CIC told .\nUnder the RTI Act, Habibullah said, it is expected that every ministry and department under the Centre or state government should not only develop a website but also ensure that it contains a host of routine information.\nThe websites are there and a lot of information is there but that \"information is unfortunately out of date\", he said.\nEvery ministry must be \"compelled\" to disclose all this information which can be disclosed legally, he said. The government should set up an authority to supervise ministries in declaring all disclosable information on their own, the 72 -year-old former bureaucrat said.\nHabibullah, who was CIC for nearly five years from 2005, said, \"Unfortunately, the law itself carries no clause for enforcement of section 4 (of the RTI Act) which talks of computerisation of all records. There is no authority to actually enforce it, the information commission can advise but cannot enforce it.\"\nAnother challenge for the RTI, he asserted, was that information commissions were expected to \"stand alone\" and supposed to be not only autonomous in their functioning but also independent in their decision making.\n\"They take no dictates from the government. Unfortunately, that (independence and autonomy) has not happened,\" he said, adding that the performance of the Central Information Commission on this front had been much better than commissions in the states.\nAsked how the government could influence commissions, Habibullah said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had himself mentioned a way out.\nThe prime minister has said the government should treat RTI as an instrument by which it can improve itself, he noted and suggested that every ministry should have a group or a team that vets the type of information that is sought.\nIt will give the government a clear indication of the areas of concern, he said.\n\"The PM put his finger on it. Unfortunately, nothing much has happened so far, (but) since the PM himself is behind it, activists, commissioners, people working within the establishment, should work together in making this a reality,\" he said.\nAsked whether RTI was being misused by some people and was, in certain cases, putting a burden on government departments, Habibullah said there was some truth in that argument.\n\"When I was the CIC, I myself would dismiss any complaints of its misuse, saying it was being misused because of the lack of information you are putting out. If you put out all the information there is no question of misuse,\" he said.\n\"The fact that we (establishment) are not taking the trouble of suo motu disclosing information which is disclosable under the act and unnecessarily applying the Official Secrets Act where it is not really applicable, we have made it more difficult for ourselves,\" he added.

At least 59 people were killed and hundreds wounded Sunday when a gunman opened fire on a concert in Las Vegas in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Earlier Sunday, a man knifed two young women to death outside the main train station in Marseille, France's second- biggest city. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for both attacks via the jihadists ' propaganda outlet Amaq, which said they were carried out by its \"soldiers\".

No way, says Brad Hogg | Cricket", "text": "NEW DELHI: Brad Hogg will be 47 come February but the Australian Chinaman bowler says the thought of announcing retirement from international cricket has not yet crossed his mind. \n\nWhile he is \"not done yet\", Hogg remains realistic about his chances of making another comeback for Australia. \n\nHe is currently commentating in the limited-overs series between India and Australia and if it was not for a surgery on his left knee, he may well have been preparing back home to make another First-Class comeback for Western Australia . \n\n\"I am not worried about my age mate. I am still trying to play First-Class cricket for Western Australia. I don't think I will ever announce my retirement from international cricket because it is a privilege to play for your country and if I am doing well enough I would never say no,\" Hogg said on Tuesday. \n\nThe boom in T20 cricket has pushed a host of cricketers to stretch their careers. Hogg is a prime example of that alongside India's \"ageless\" Ashish Nehra , who, at 38, has earned a recall to the Indian team for the three T20s against Australia beginning October 7. \n\nHogg was 44 when he last played for Australia in 2014 and still thinks he is good enough to bowl at the highest level. He also remains a regular at the Big Bash League and even played the IPL as recently as last year. \n\n\"If I get the opportunity to play again (for Australia), I would take it. Because once you are long time retired (it is difficult to comeback). If it stops now, it stops now, I know I won't get to play again. \n\n\"I am fortunate that at my age I am still wanted. Whether it happens or not, it is another matter but yeah I am not done yet,\" he says. \n\nHogg says the constant curiosity over his age doesn't bother him and he is focused on getting back to full fitness, having undergone a knee surgery three months ago. \n\n\"While I am doing that (recovering), I am using the time to do commentary. I feel at a very fortunate place to be honest and thoroughly enjoying it. The recovery is taking longer than expected but I should be back on the ground soon\" \n\nIs it tough to maintain fitness as one grows older? \"Not at all,\" says Hogg. \n\n\"If you look after yourself, it is not an issue. But as sportsmen, a lot of us have wear and tear. Sometimes it happens early in your career, sometimes it happens late. I am very lucky that it is late in my career. \n\n\"In fact I would not call it (injury layoff) a difficult period. I have been extremely lucky to play the game. I am grateful for that. You rather think about the things you have.\" \n\nWhile commentating, he has also found time to help fellow Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav , who calls the Australian his mentor with both having spent a lot of time together at the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. \n\nYadav has been making rapid strides in international cricket ever since making his Test debut against Australia in March, and Hogg is not at all surprised. \n\n\"Everyone's career graph is different. We all go through different phases and he has got a great foundation. Now he has just to make sure he keeps his head on his shoulders, don't think too far ahead and keep working on his game. \n\n\"He has just got to make sure he is reliable when the captain calls him to bowl. The best cricketers in the world are consistent and reliable, they do the job,\" feels Hogg adding Yadav's accuracy remains one of his biggest strengths. \n\n\"You rather first work on your strengths than focus on your weaknesses.

They are having their internal investigation. That will play out,\" Blewett, a 46-Test right-handed batsman, told Reuters in an interview in Adelaide on Tuesday. \n\n\"It would be a shame if he's not out here. I think everyone wants to play against the strongest possible team. \n\n\"It would be a shame if he doesn't come out because he's a bit of a drawcard, he's a world class all-rounder and will leave a massive hole in their team. \n\n\"But even if he was (to come), I think Australia are going to be too good at home anyway. With or without Ben Stokes I don't see a different result but I think England would love to have him in their side.\" \n\nThe Sun newspaper published footage of what it said was a brawl between the player and two other people, one clutching a bottle. The authenticity of the images could not be verified by Reuters. \n\nMedia reports said Stokes, who suffered a minor fracture of a finger on his right hand, apologised to the ECB for his arrest on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and described his state of mind as 'fragile and devastated'. \n\nBlewett, who was Australia's fielding coach until stepping down in August, has taken on assistant roles with Sheffield Shield side South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers in the 'Big Bash' domestic Twenty20 competition. \n\nAlso coach of South Australia's men's under-19 side, Blewett said he would take a dim view of any player out drinking in the early hours of the morning and days before a match. \n\n\"I wouldn't be over the moon, put it that way, because I did see the footage and it's not great,\" Blewett said, referring to the video posted by The Sun. \n\n\"I'm sure he's got his side to the story which we haven't necessarily heard yet. \n\n\"Yeah, you would be disappointed, I think they were only a couple of days away from the next one-day international so I think any coach would be disappointed with that sort of behaviour.\" \n\nThe Stokes incident has revived the debate as to whether curfews should be enforced during series, but Blewett said he was against such measures. \n\n\"Generally, you'd say players these days are a hell of a lot more professional than what we used to be,\" said the 45-year-old. \n\n\"These things don't pop up all that often these days, but when they do, obviously you need to address it.\" \n\nThe potential absence of Stokes would heap further pressure on England's bowlers and a batting order featuring players like opener James Vince and Dawid Malan who are yet to establish themselves. \n\nBlewett said Australia and the team's formidable pace attack led by Mitchell Starc would provide the toughest of initiations. \n\n\"Two or three of those guys in the squad haven't had a great start to their careers,\" he said. \n\n\"It's not going to get any easier when they come out here. \n\n\"And it's looking like Australia are going to be full strength with their bowling attack so (they) are going to be up against it.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben stokes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "blewett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stokes", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mitchell starc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg blewett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex hales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dawid malan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james vince", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales cricket board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheffield shield", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelaide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:32:02.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37ae25859c831717046eb676cd3c03e68b959443", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdmFxfjpahdE29adGr.1d_G79Yc73QBpIiJrIMeqhO.dn2g46ga9fGD5zckOywaXchltAzWa3rgU8MBakVc2KBslLZHCTzSI0TFPBIwiOD.E3eUhwUsLka_9Dw81ok6KC.6dXYqZF35tPd4WRfwAcwEB", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/2146842.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Stocks-Markets-The Economic Times", "title": "Sensex: Check out the stocks that surged up to 20% on Tuesday", "title_full": "Sensex: Check out the stocks that surged up to 20% on Tuesday -

Britain 's construction companies in September reported the sharpest fall in activity since just after June 2016's Brexit vote, as clients put projects on hold due to uncertainty over the economy.\nAlthough construction makes up just 6 percent of Britain's economy, the survey suggested it was likely to drag on official third-quarter growth figures, just as the Bank of England gets ready to raise interest rates.\nThe IHS Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index ( PMI ) sank to 48.1 in September from August's reading of 51.1, its lowest since July 2016 and far below all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists.\nAnything below 50 is considered a contraction.\nSterling weakened by around a quarter of a cent against the dollar and fell to a day's low against the euro after the data.\n\"The construction sector is entering its own recession,\" Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said. \"The government's shift to a more accommodating stance in Brexit talks has done little to convince builders that clients will sanction delayed projects soon.\"\nIHS Markit said the prospect that the BoE will raise rates next month for the first time in a decade was also a factor behind slower house building.\nBusiness investment overall has grown since the Brexit vote, but many business leaders say the government is not making enough progress in Brexit talks with the European Union .\nConstruction - which has long lead times for projects, and relies heavily on labour from the EU - has been particularly hurt.\nOfficial data last month showed construction orders fell more than 12 percent year-on-year in the three months to June, and the PMI has shown lower orders for the past three months.\nExpectations for the future were at their second-lowest level since 2013, Tuesday's survey also showed.\nHowever, shares in housebuilders have gained in recent days after Britain's ruling Conservative Party announced plans to revive a 10 billion pound ($13.25 billion) house-building subsidy.\nThe manufacturing PMI published on Monday showed a slowdown in growth although it remained solid, and a survey of Britain's huge services industry due on Wednesday will give a clearer idea of third-quarter growth.\n\"Following on from a softer manufacturing survey for September, the weak construction survey fuels concern that an already lacklustre UK economy could be faltering,\" said Howard Archer , chief economist at consultancy EY ITEM Club.\nBritain's economy has suffered its weakest growth so far this year since 2012. Consumer demand has borne the brunt of a rise in inflation to its highest in nearly five years, which is largely due to the pound's tumble after the Brexit vote.\nThe PMI data showed the cost of building supplies rose at its fastest rate in seven months in September.\n($1 = 0.7545 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by David Milliken Editing by Jeremy Gaunt )", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david milliken", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "samuel tombs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy gaunt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard archer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ey item club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conservative party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pmi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ihs markit", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:40:21.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f1eaa61f45d2f9084b72e0c0f2d2ade214095eb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI8_N4yDmfYKPdTONrkbWe99qsUBPSW2sRQ7OB3mak0GXemQPX0TRUswTvnUguFVAk7nxrnHQ.C3uy3K1E8UXXUWE-", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeeds/-2128680634.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "International Business, World & Global Business News | Share Market News - Times of India", "title": "NY coffee C delivery notices - Oct - 03", "title_full": "NY coffee C delivery notices - Oct - 03 - Times of India", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-47529300/47529300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f1eaa61f45d2f9084b72e0c0f2d2ade214095eb2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zCSlHBZp9k4K7_aabSqSqRipBvZ_JHaOI9MaWbc4hEI8_N4yDmfYKPdTONrkbWe99qsUBPSW2sRQ7OB3mak0GXemQPX0TRUswTvnUguFVAk7nxrnHQ.C3uy3K1E8UXXUWE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "NY coffee C delivery notices - Oct - 03", "text": "COFFEE NOTICES ISSUERS BY PORT TOTAL TO DATE: 884 TODAY MONTH ISSUERS AN BR HA HO NO NY VA DAILY AN BR HA HO NO NY VA TOTAL TOTALS TO DATE ADM Investor Services 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 6 BNP Paribas Prime Brokerage , 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 475 16 67 4 5 123 0 690 Inc.

This raised the possibility of the benchmark suddenly disappearing.\nThe FCA wants banks to voluntarily continue submitting quotes for compiling the daily Libor benchmark until the end of 2021 to ensure a smooth migration to the alternative rate.\nThe FPC said the response has been positive from most of the banks involved, but no final agreement has been reached yet.\nIn the meantime the FCA was taking steps to compel banks to continue submitting quotes, if required, the FPC said.\nThe European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve , and central banks in Japan and Switzerland are also working on \"risk free\" alternatives to Libor in their home markets.

The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) must be headquartered in an EU country.\n\"Oncology is a good example. The pipelines are very promising for new cancer options and if there is severe disruption those might be delayed or prove impossible to approve,\" said EMA chief Guido Rasi .\nBased in London since 1995, with a staff of around 890, the EMA acts as a one-stop-shop for approving and monitoring the safety of drugs across Europe.\nNow it is about to be uprooted as a result of Brexit and a staff survey last week found that between 19 percent and 94 percent of employees were likely to leave after the move, depending on which of 19 possible locations is chosen.\nAt stake is not only the smooth-running of the European Union's drug approval process - vital for both patients and companies - but also public safety, if regulators fail to react to a side-effect problem or quality issue in a timely fashion, Rasi said.\nThe EMA deals with more than a million reports of adverse drug reactions every year. It also inspects manufacturers worldwide and in recent years has suspended hundreds of drugs that fall short of testing standards.\nMost recently, the agency's safety role was highlighted when it held a high-profile hearing on links between Sanofi 's epilepsy drug valproate and birth defects.\n\"Europe now is called on to decide not where to relocate an agency but how to protect an activity that is crucial for public health,\" Rasi said in an interview.\n\nNO BACK-UP PLAN\nBecause the work of regulating medicines is delegated by EU member states to the EMA, there is no back-up plan if the agency is relocated from 2019 in a city where it is impossible to operate effectively due to staff losses.\nRasi said that in a worst-case scenario, the agency would simply no longer be able to function. Drug approvals would grind to a halt and Europe might have to import medicines - something that would require new legislation.\nPicking Amsterdam, Barcelona, Vienna, Milan or Copenhagen as the new headquarters would be the best option for retaining staff, according to the survey of its workers. Any of the other 14 sites would spark large staff losses.\nAll of the top five candidate cities favoured by EMA staff are in countries that already host one or more EU agencies. Some of the lower ranking cities are in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia and Romania , where there are none.\nRasi said the scale of the potential staff exodus was \"much worse than anticipated\" but reflected the upheaval facing employees, many of whom have children established in London schools and working spouses in the city.\n\"This has not been reflected upon enough,\" he said.\nThe European Commission on Saturday published its assessment of different locations for the EMA and the smaller European Banking Authority , which will also have to leave London because of Brexit.\nThe Commission did not rank the rival bidding cities, many of which have lined up sweetheart deals to lure the two agencies.\nEU leaders will make the final location decision on Nov. 20, but the need to ensure business continuity could clash with another cherished ambition of spreading the bloc's agencies more evenly across Europe, particularly in eastern member states.\nRelocating the EMA before Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, as current plans dictate, involves a very tight schedule.

The European Central Bank turns almost exclusively to bankers for advice and feedback on financial issues, exposing it to the risk of becoming too close to a sector it is meant to supervise, an activist group said on Tuesday.\nCorporate Europe Observatory (CEO), which monitors lobbying at European institutions, said in a report that 508 of 517 seats available on the ECB's advisory groups are taken by financial sector representatives.\nBanks under ECB supervision hold the majority of seats in the 22 groups, which the ECB uses to gather intelligence on subjects ranging from economic and market developments to financial infrastructure and payments, CEO said.\nClearing house Euroclear was the most represented, followed by Germany 's Deutsche Bank and France's BNP Paribas and Societe Generale -- three top European banks that are directly supervised by the ECB -- while academics were absent, according to CEO's findings.\n\"The makeup of the ECB's advisory groups opens the door to the risk (of) the regulatory process being captured by lobbyists,\" CEO said in its report.\nOf the nine seats not taken by the financial sector, seven have gone to other companies such as German industrial giant Siemens and just two to consumer groups, according to the CEO report.\nThe ECB's interaction with the financial industry is already under scrutiny from the European Union 's watchdog after a previous CEO complaint about the involvement of ECB President Mario Draghi and other top officials in the Group of 30, which includes bankers and fund managers.\nBesides its role as bank supervisor, the ECB has been the single most important driver of European financial markets over the past few years through its 2 trillion euro bond-buying programme, which is now preparing to scale back.\nAn ECB spokesman said the central bank's role was \"naturally focused\" on the financial sector but that its policymakers and officials also held discussions with other stakeholders, such as the general public and academics, in other forums.\nThe ECB publishes the agenda and summary of the groups' meetings, as well as participant lists for all but one of the groups.\nReuters reported in 2015 that three of the traders accused of manipulating euro money market Euribor rates were part of the ECB's Money Market Contact Group .\nCEO said in the report that banks involved in a separate forex manipulation scandal which emerged in 2013 have been heavily represented on the ECB's Foreign Exchange Contact Group , although it did not suggest that any individual members of the group had been involved in forex rigging.\nIt added accounts of meetings showed industry representatives used the contact groups as platforms for lobbying, for instance to voice their opposition to a proposed tax on financial transactions in Europe.

Ireland 's High Court on Tuesday said it would ask the EU 's top court to decide whether to ban the way in which Internet firms such as Facebook transfer users' data to the United States in a case with major implications for companies.\nThis case is the latest to question whether methods used by large tech firms such as Google and Apple to transfer data outside the 28-nation European Union give EU consumers sufficient protection from U.S. surveillance.\nData privacy is under the spotlight after revelations in 2013 by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden of mass U.S. surveillance caused political outrage in Europe.\nIrish High Court Judge Caroline Costello said she had decided to ask the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling in the case.\n\"European Union law guarantees a high level of protection to EU citizens ... they are entitled to an equivalent high level of protection when their data is transferred outside of the European Economic Area ,\" she said.\nThe Irish Data Protection Commissioner 's office initially became involved after Austrian law student and privacy activist Max Schrems made a complaint in Dublin about Facebook's handling of his data in the United States.\nThe judge said the Irish Data Protection Commissioner \"has raised well-founded concerns that there is an absence of an effective remedy in U.S. law compatible with the requirements of Article 47 of the Charter (of Fundamental Rights).\"\nShe said that a newly created U.S. ombudsperson dealing with Europeans' complaints about U.S. surveillance did not eliminate those concerns.\nCostello also said she was not delivering any value judgement on the data protection laws in the EU or United States.\nA Facebook spokeswoman said it was essential the EU court \"considers the extensive evidence demonstrating the robust protections in place under Standard Contractual Clauses and U.S. law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe.\"\nThe company has previously said the case could lead to a breakdown in transatlantic data transfers that could knock EU economic output by up to 1.3 percent.\nA ruling by the European Court of Justice ( ECJ ) against the common legal arrangements used by thousands of firms to transfer personal data outside the EU could cause major headaches for companies that make such transfers daily. These transfers include credit card transactions, hotel bookings or moving employee data between countries.\nSchrems, speaking to reporters outside the court, said he hoped the ECJ would force the EU and the United States to finally deal with the gap between the privacy rights of Facebook users in Europe and those that apply to its servers in California.\n\"I hope we will get a decision that ends this ping-pong and stops kicking the can down the road,\" he said.\nSchrems also said he did not expect the legal arrangements - known as standard contractual clauses - to be banned by the EU court.

The European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) must be headquartered in an EU country.\n\"Oncology is a good example. The pipelines are very promising for new cancer options and if there is severe disruption those might be delayed or prove impossible to approve,\" said EMA chief Guido Rasi .\nBased in London since 1995, with a staff of around 890, the EMA acts as a one-stop-shop for approving and monitoring the safety of drugs across Europe.\nNow it is about to be uprooted as a result of Brexit and a staff survey last week found that between 19 percent and 94 percent of employees were likely to leave after the move, depending on which of 19 possible locations is chosen.\nAt stake is not only the smooth-running of the European Union's drug approval process - vital for both patients and companies - but also public safety, if regulators fail to react to a side-effect problem or quality issue in a timely fashion, Rasi said.\nThe EMA deals with more than a million reports of adverse drug reactions every year. It also inspects manufacturers worldwide and in recent years has suspended hundreds of drugs that fall short of testing standards.\nMost recently, the agency's safety role was highlighted when it held a high-profile hearing on links between Sanofi 's epilepsy drug valproate and birth defects.\n\"Europe now is called on to decide not where to relocate an agency but how to protect an activity that is crucial for public health,\" Rasi said in an interview.\n\nNO BACK-UP PLAN\nBecause the work of regulating medicines is delegated by EU member states to the EMA, there is no back-up plan if the agency is relocated from 2019 in a city where it is impossible to operate effectively due to staff losses.\nRasi said that in a worst-case scenario, the agency would simply no longer be able to function. Drug approvals would grind to a halt and Europe might have to import medicines - something that would require new legislation.\nPicking Amsterdam, Barcelona, Vienna, Milan or Copenhagen as the new headquarters would be the best option for retaining staff, according to the survey of its workers. Any of the other 14 sites would spark large staff losses.\nAll of the top five candidate cities favoured by EMA staff are in countries that already host one or more EU agencies. Some of the lower ranking cities are in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovakia and Romania , where there are none.\nRasi said the scale of the potential staff exodus was \"much worse than anticipated\" but reflected the upheaval facing employees, many of whom have children established in London schools and working spouses in the city.\n\"This has not been reflected upon enough,\" he said.\nThe European Commission on Saturday published its assessment of different locations for the EMA and the smaller European Banking Authority , which will also have to leave London because of Brexit.\nThe Commission did not rank the rival bidding cities, many of which have lined up sweetheart deals to lure the two agencies.\nEU leaders will make the final location decision on Nov. 20, but the need to ensure business continuity could clash with another cherished ambition of spreading the bloc's agencies more evenly across Europe, particularly in eastern member states.\nRelocating the EMA before Britain leaves the EU in March 2019, as current plans dictate, involves a very tight schedule.

While the central bank has said it will stick to tight monetary policy, Erdogan - who has described himself as an \"enemy\" of interest rates - has called for lower rates to boost credit growth and spending.\nCore inflation, which excludes energy, food and other volatile prices, rose to 10.98 percent year-on-year in September, data from the Turkish Statistical Institute showed, the highest level since February 2004.\n\"We still have not been able lower inflation and this is due to interest rates,\" Erdogan said in a speech to deputies from his ruling AK Party in Ankara , after the data was released.\n\"The fall in interest rates is unfortunately not at the level we would like. If we can't achieve this, many troubles await us. We must solve this,\" he said.\nErdogan's belief that inflation is caused by interest rates is at odds with orthodox economics, which views rates as an important tool to keep prices in check.\nErodogan's comments have prompted concern that the central bank is less than independent and faces political pressure from Erdogan. The bank last month left its highest policy rate, known as the late liquidity window, unchanged for the third straight meeting.\nThe rise in inflation comes as Turkey's domestic economy has recovered from the downturn that followed last year's failed coup, helped by a raft of government stimulus measures. The economy expanded at a break-neck pace of 5.1 percent in the second quarter.\n\"The continued deterioration on the inflation front, especially core indicators, shows that monetary policy is not tight enough to contain the inflationary effects from strengthened domestic demand,\" said Gokce Celik , chief economist at QNB Finansbank , in a note to clients.\nThe central bank was likely to forgo \"meaningful additional tightening\" unless the lira currency came under swift pressure, Celik added.\nThe lira was at 3.5865 to the U.S. dollar at 1025 GMT, weaker than Monday's close of 3.5694.\nThe data showed that headline inflation rose 11.20 percent, its third-highest level this year. On a monthly basis, the headline figure rose 0.65 percent, less than 0.76 percent forecast in a Reuters poll.\nWhile food prices declined, education and transport costs surged.\n\"Today's data mean that headline inflation will be slower to fall back than we had expected,\" said Liam Carson of Capital Economics in a note.\n\"While we still expect the central bank to loosen monetary policy over the next year or so, this is likely to begin later than we had previously anticipated.\"\nProducer prices rose 0.24 percent month-on-month for a year-on-year rise of 16.28 percent, the data showed.

Banks from the bloc and other associated countries accounted for around 10 percent of lending to British companies, the BoE's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) said in a summary of its most recent meeting held on Sept. 20. Currently, those banks can operate as branches but they might have to upgrade to fully fledged subsidiaries after Brexit, a process that could take many months. \"The risk of disruption to wholesale UK banking services appeared to be slightly higher than previously thought, given that a number of EEA ( European Economic Area ) firms branching into the UK were not sufficiently focused on addressing this issue,\" the FPC said in a statement. The BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority was \"engaging firms to improve the state of their contingency planning.\" PRA Chief Executive Sam Woods told Reuters last week that he expected 130 licence applications from branches. \"Firms would need to start seeking authorisations in 2018 Q1,\" the FPC said. The FPC also said there was a \"substantial risk\" of disruption to cross-border clearing operations in financial services, such as derivatives used by companies to hedge themselves against potential financial market swings. The EU has published a draft law that would require clearing of euro-denominated transactions in some cases to be shifted from London to cities in the bloc after Brexit, a proposal resisted by Britain. The FPC said clearing houses were examining contingency options \"including the potential to relocate some clearing activity from the UK in order to continue to provide services to EU clients.\" But this option was not available in segments of the market \"where the complexity and cost of any migration was significant\". \"In the event of access restrictions to those markets, EU firms would therefore have to move their activity to another CCP (clearing house), which was likely to be difficult to achieve before the point of EU withdrawal,\" the FPC said. LCH, a unit of the London Stock Exchange and which dominates clearing in euro-denominated swaps, said it could not comment on any contingency plans. Banks have said it would be costly and cumbersome to shift their derivatives positions to LCH 's Paris unit or to another clearer like Eurex in Frankfurt .

His predecessor, John Stumpf , resigned less then a month after he earlier appeared before the same committee to answer questions about the bank's sales practices.\n\"We came to Congress without a good plan and all of you were right to criticize us,\" Sloan said in prepared remarks ahead of the hearing.\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren , who last year accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership\", has repeatedly called on the U.S. Federal Reserve to remove 12 members of Wells Fargo's Board of Directors.\nAmong those is vice chair Elizabeth Duke , a former Federal Reserve Governor who is set to take over as chair of Wells Fargo's board at the start of the year.\nLast week, Maxine Waters , the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee , released a staff report questioning whether Wells Fargo should be allowed to keep its federal bank charter.\nThe problems around auto-insurance and mortgage products emerged publicly this year.\nIn late July, Wells Fargo said hundreds of thousands of customers were due a refund on auto insurance that they did not need.\nIn late August, a homeowner sued Wells Fargo for charging too much for his fixed-rate mortgage. Wells Fargo has already said its 'rate lock' service is under investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau .

Buried. She was set alight and left for dead.\nSomehow Kumawat escaped the pit and lived to tell the tale, first fleeing her Borda village for the safety of a relative's home and then onto Bhilwara city , where she now lives.\nFourteen years later and she remains landless.\nHer plot - little more than an acre (4,046 sq mt) - and her home of almost 50 years are both gone.\n\"They tried to grab my land and sell it without my consent. When I confronted them, they called me a \"dayan\" (witch), blamed me for many bad things in the village and nearly killed me,\" said Kumawat, 95, her voice rising barely above a whisper.\n\"They have known me all their life. How did I suddenly become a dayan?\" she said, her gaunt face etched with sadness.\n\nBLAME THE WOMEN\nKumawat's story is not unusual in Rajasthan, a state better known for stately forts and grand palaces than witch hunting.\nScores of women have been brutally attacked after being branded a witch over the last few decades; several have died.\nThe Mewar region, a former princely state that includes Bhilwara and the popular lake city of Udaipur, is particularly notorious, accounting for most cases in Rajasthan.\nActivists say women have been beaten, knifed, sexually assaulted, stripped naked and paraded, thrown into wells, buried alive, set alight or disfigured with acid. Others are killed.\nIn most cases, the victims were poor, lower-caste, single women who either had no sons or lived alone. Most had land or property coveted by a relative or higher-caste person.\nThe practice of blaming \"witches\" for everything from inadequate monsoon rains and failed businesses to infertility, illness or a sudden death, is widely prevalent across several Indian states, and dates back centuries.\nIn such cases, villagers consult with a shaman or godman, who often blames a witch for some misfortune. Family members are also complicit, and often use this as a way to settle scores, often over land, or to throw a female relative out of the house.\n\"The feudal system, a rigid caste hierarchy and patriarchy encourage the practice, with illiteracy and superstition also to blame,\" said activist Tara Ahluwalia , who has recorded 88 cases of witch hunting in Bhilwara since 1982.\n\"We file reports, but no action is taken,\" said Ahluwalia , who keeps meticulous records of each case in a folder with photographs, hospital statements and related police reports.\n\nLIVING CORPSE\nThe practice of witch hunting is not unique to India. Instances have been recorded elsewhere in Asia and in Africa .\nThousands of elderly Tanzanian women have been strangled, knifed to death and burned alive over the last two decades after being denounced as witches, usually for their land.\nIn India, nearly 2,500 murders related to witchcraft have been recorded since 2000, according to official data.\nVictims are often expelled from their homes and villages. Those who stay are isolated and live in constant fear.\nDespite a 2015 state law banning the practice, there have been no convictions in Rajasthan, such is the reluctance of local officials and police to check the custom, activists say.\n\"We fought for a law for 25 years, but the law is not being implemented. What is the point of the law if it cannot protect these women?\" Ahluwalia told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\"The case is forgotten, and only the victim continues to suffer. Once you are branded a witch, the stigma is for life, and it slowly kills her; she is like a living corpse,\" she said.\n\nREHABILITATION\nAt least half a dozen Indian states have introduced special laws against witchcraft and witch hunting in recent years.\nBut many cases are not reported for fear of reprisal.\nCases that are filed are often dismissed, or are not registered as related to witchcraft, activists say.\nThey are often difficult to investigate and prosecute as they are sometimes in remote areas and people are not willing to give evidence, a senior police official in Bhilwara said.\n\"Any case that is brought to our notice is fully investigated,\" said police superintendent Pradeep Sharma .\n\"Several arrests have been made related to witch hunting; they may get bail, but we follow the procedure. Many of the cases are also false,\" he said.\nThe Rajasthan Prevention of Witch Hunting Act went further than similar state laws, with a prison sentence of up to seven years, a collective fine and rehabilitation and resettlement for victims. If a woman is killed, it can lead to life imprisonment.\nLast month, cases were filed against seven godmen in Bhilwara for abetting the practice of witch hunting.\nAbout a dozen women in Bhilwara have received compensation of at least 50,000 rupees ($770) under the law.\nRecognising trauma and funding rehabilitation are crucial, said Madhu Mehra , of advocacy Partners for Law in Development.\n\"We cannot depend on our legal system to bring many convictions or a big drop in cases,\" she said.\n\"More than special laws with lax implementation, what is needed is a robust system of compensation and victim care.\"\nThe Rajasthan government is now training officials and police - but it is too little and far too late for Kumawat.\n\"My only wish is to die in my home,\" she said.\n\"But I no longer have a home, and I am too scared to go back to my village.\"\n($1 = 64.9619 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran, Editing by Lyndsay Griffiths .

The gunman shot concertgoers from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino, a hotel complex owned by MGM Resorts International, a rival of Wynn Resorts Ltd.\nBut the shooting, which also injured more than 500 people, could spur casino operators to think more like Wynn, who had been dismissed as \"obsessed\" about security before Sunday's massacre, a rival casino executive said.\n\"This could be a turning point,\" the executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity because security measures are private. \"Every management team is going to move this up to the top of the list.\"\nA representative of MGM could not be reached for comment.\nHotels already have extensive security for gambling, including dogs that patrol the casinos to sniff for drugs and bombs, and significant security staff that constantly monitors the actions of people, including undercover security.\nIn an interview with Las Vegas' KTNV in 2016, Wynn Resorts Chief Executive Steve Wynn said, \"Las Vegas is a target city. We have hardened the target at the Wynn.\"\nHe said his company has metal detectors and devices at every entrance of its building for employees and guests that are nonvisible to the public as well as specially trained guards.\n\"There are almost 40 of them at every opening of my building, plain clothes, armed, on the look-out, changing shift and being relieved every two hours so they don't get bored,\" he said.\n\"We have done extraordinary things to make sure that we protect our employees and our guests at the hotel,\" Wynn said.\nHis comments were confirmed on Monday by company spokesman Michael Weaver.\nWhile other casino operators have contemplated heightened security measures, none have gone to the lengths of Wynn, the rival casino executive said.\nA.G. Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said in a telephone interview on Monday that a task force was set up among regulators and law enforcement officials a few years ago to discuss security issues.\n\"We were always worried about something like this happening on the casino floor, but this was outside the casino,\" Burnett said, adding, \"We will continue our efforts in speaking with Las Vegas casinos on bolstering their security.\"\nDavid Shepherd, chief executive of consultancy the Readiness Resource Group and former director of security for the Venetian Resort Hotel and Casino, said, \"You are looking at 40 million tourists coming into Las Vegas. Security has to be effective but not intrusive.\"\n\"We've had one event. Are we are going to change everything after one event?\"\nPolice identified Sunday's gunman as Stephen Paddock, a 64-year-old retiree armed with multiple assault weapons. Police said they recovered a total of 34 weapons belonging to Paddock, including 16 from the hotel room.\nCasino security expert Steven Baker said standard M-16 rifles, for example, can be broken down to fit in a suitcase.\n\"If I can take a suitcase to my room I can have that in there. Nowhere do we have the full out screening of baggage like we do in airports. The logistics of doing that are huge,\" said Baker.\nCasino operators typically refrain from disclosing details of their security policies. Both Las Vegas Sands and Caesars Entertainment Corp said they were constantly reviewing their protocols to ensure the safety of customers and working closely with local police.\nBoyd Gaming Corp, whose casinos in Las Vegas include the Orleans and the Gold Coast, said they were looking at ways to increase security in the wake of the shooting.\n\"We have very robust security measures in place today,\" Boyd spokesman David Strow said on Monday. \"However, in light of this incident we are reviewing our security measures and will heighten them as necessary.\"\nThe 2016 annual reports by the four largest U.S. casino groups - MGM, Wynn, Caesars and Las Vegas Sands - included discussions of major business risks, such as cyber attacks or the effects of terrorist attacks on travel, but there was no discussion in the reports of an attack along the lines of the one that occurred on Sunday. None of the four companies replied to requests for comment on the annual reports.

But the good thing is that for the Indian public in general, the investment options are getting more and more limited. You cannot put money in gold . Real estate is already doing very badly. It is very unusual that you have almost 20% kind of return in the market and FIIs are net sellers. This tells us that the relative attractiveness of equities is still there. Considering the bad news in August, September -- I do not think any successive two months have been that bad at least for last couple of years -- that 5% upside may not materialise but I also do not expect that it could be a significant 5% to 7% kind of decline in the market. So more or less in the same range I would expect. \n\nDefine medium term. \n\nI believe medium term is something like 6 to 9 months and anything above 12 months would be a long term. \n\nYou mean to say for next 6 to 9 months you do not see markets going higher or lower. \n\nI do not expect that market would give you a plus/minus 10% in next 6 months. \n\nBull markets correct, bull markets go up and down but they rarely consolidate for 9 months. \n\nThat is a good point. My sense is that you might see a situation where the data points which we have had in August and September may not improve because I do not expect that there is going to be a significant reversal or revival in earnings in at least the second quarter and also the second quarter GDP number would not also be very great. \n\nIf you look at the rainfall distribution, an estimate by Ministry of Agriculture says that there would be a 3% kind of decline in food production and 4 out of 10 food producing states including UP, Haryana, Punjab are rain deficient. \n\nWe will start to see this impact around November and that is something which makes me believe that we are not going to see a fundamental improvement in data points in next couple of months. It is going to be same kind of things which we have seen in September. You would see a 4-5% kind of correction and then you will again see the market bouncing back. So this is not something which is going to change in next six months at least I believe. \n\nComing to the move on Dr Reddy\u2019s and Aurobindo this afternoon, do you believe that structurally these are the two names that really stand out in the ailing pharma story and are these the names that you are recommending? Dr Reddy\u2019s has of course come off from the day\u2019s high. It is now in the red but it was a newsmaker in the first half of the session? \n\nYes, pharma is definitely looking like a sector where things will not be as bad as they have been. However, in terms of individual stock picks, there has been a lot of bad news and a lot of bad sentiment around Sun Pharma . If I take a 12-18 months kind of a view, this stock would probably be doing better than some of the other names. \n\nOf course, DRL or Aurobindo are not bad choices but I would probably also include Sun Pharma in that list and I believe that if you play these two or three large caps in that space, things will be good because overall if this sector does well, then at some point in time, people would start to get a little more excited about the Sun Pharma stock because in terms of size and business, it is one of the more important companies in the space. I would also include Sun Pharma in that list and pharma sector definitely in the 12-18 month timeframe, looks good.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pankaj sharma", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reddy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sun pharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of agriculture", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haryana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diwali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punjab", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:42:48.034+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "af97450779469c93073d92b26825453c79ea994b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zC1.YsIxbbrrJCtkMaikEF2VRjWGXozy5h2hL6lijF0PEhMOrIOpOGkd8MA42gkbgAAwXi0ajDroe6cg.XSPu56jwtjPm8z2n5OMbwv9kc3nHnJJLB3mHwLfdkW5HqqNfOkh53R7.vYKDwHRBKvXho.", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Times of India", "title": "Amit Shah: Amit Shah announces 'padyatra' in all state capitals against CPM violence | India News - Times of India", "title_full": "Amit Shah: Amit Shah announces 'padyatra' in all state capitals against CPM violence | India News - Times of India", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/msid-60924906/60924906.jpg?348419", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 148, "comments": 0, "shares": 148}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "af97450779469c93073d92b26825453c79ea994b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zC1.YsIxbbrrJCtkMaikEF2VRjWGXozy5h2hL6lijF0PEhMOrIOpOGkd8MA42gkbgAAwXi0ajDroe6cg.XSPu56jwtjPm8z2n5OMbwv9kc3nHnJJLB3mHwLfdkW5HqqNfOkh53R7.vYKDwHRBKvXho.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Amit Shah: Amit Shah announces 'padyatra' in all state capitals against CPM violence | India News - Times of India", "text": "Amit Shah announces 'padyatra' in all state capitals against CPM violence Oct 3, 2017, 16:52 IST PTI on Tuesday announced a two-week 'padyatra' in all state capitals from tomorrow against the CPM 's alleged targeting of his party's workers.

NEW DELHI: Absconding liquor baron Vijay Mallya + , who is wanted in connection to a loan default case to the tune of Rs 9,000 crore, was arrested in London on Tuesday. The fugitive businessman has been arrested in a second money laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the UK's Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. However, he was granted bail shortly after being produced before the Westminster Magistrates' Court for a hearing. Once known as the \"King of Good Times\", Mallya protested his innocence and described the allegations against him as \"fabricated\". \"I deny all allegations that have been made and I will continue to deny them. I have not eluded any court. I've given enough evidence to prove my case,\" he said outside the court earlier in the day. Chief Magistrate Emma Louise Arbuthnot, who has been hearing Mallya 's extradition case at Westminster Magistrates' Court, granted him bail on \"the same bail conditions as before\", which he must abide by. The next hearing in the case will take place on November 20. Mallya owes as much as Rs 9,000 crore to Indian banks. He has been out on bail after Scotland Yard arrested him on April 18 this year, acting on India's formal extradition request for him. The 61-year-old chief of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines fled India last year in March and has been living in Britain since then. The CBI and the ED had recently uncovered that 'Mallya diverted most of Rs 6,000-crore loan to shell companies' + , taken from a consortium of 17 banks led by SBI, to several countries including US, UK, France and Ireland. Both the agencies are now planning to file chargesheets against him and present it as evidence in the Westminster Magistrates' Court, so that his extradition could be expedited. India had given a formal extradition request for Mallya as per the Extradition Treaty between India and the UK through a note verbale on February 8 and had asserted that it has a \"legitimate\" case against him.

The meeting is widely expected to confer a second five-year term to Xi as General Secretary.\nTwo top officials, Gen. Fang Fenghui, head of the Joint Staff Department Central Military Commission (CMC), and Gen. Zhang Yang, head of its Political Work Department have been removed in the latest shake up of the 2.3 million strong PLA, increasing Xi's dominance over the military.\nXi heads the all-powerful CMC the overall high command of the PLA and he is the only civilian in the 11-member body.\nThe \"ousting\" of Fang and Zhang is further proof that Xi is \"cementing his control over the military\", the Hong Kong- based South China Morning Post reported today.\nFang has been replaced by Gen. Li Zuocheng, a decorated veteran of the Sino-Vietnamese war and Admiral Miao Hua, formerly the PLA Navy's political commissar has been appointed as head of the Political Work Department in the place of Gen. Zhang.\nXi promoted Li to full general and Miao to the equivalent naval rank in 2015 and both men are seen as being firmly in his camp, the Post report said.\nHe heads the Presidency and the military, which makes him far more powerful compared to his predecessor, Hu Jintao.\nIn his first term, Xi has carried out a massive anti- graft campaign in the party and the military in which thousands of officials from top to bottom were either punished or purged.\n\"Whatever option will be chosen, the first thing Xi will do is to root out the harmful influence left by the two disgraced CMC vice-chairmen, Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou,\" the Post quoted an official as saying.\nGuo and Xu became the most senior military officers probed for buying and selling military ranks and other forms of corruption in the sweeping anti-graft campaign launched by Xi soon after he became party general secretary in November 2012.\nSince then, at least 13,000 military officers involved in corruption have been punished, the Post quoted a report by the PLA Daily, official organ of the Chinese military as saying.\nGuo, 75, was sentenced to life imprisonment in July last year and Xu died of cancer at the age of 72 in 2015 while in custody and under investigation for graft.\nSince he took over Xi's focus remained on revamping the military. In an unprecedented overhaul, he had announced that PLA would shed three lakh troops, taking their number down to two million.\nHe has also cut the size of the army to a million and vastly increased the role of the navy and the air force to assist China s global push for influence.\nHe had also scrapped the PLA s four former headquarters General Staff, General Political, General Logistics and General Armaments and established 15 functional departments to divide their powers.\nThe PLA s seven military commands were also reshaped into five theatre commands.\nXi will use the party congress to restructure the CMC, the Post quoted officials as saying.\nHe may either trim the size of the 11-member CMC to just the chairman and four vice-chairmen or induct heads of the five theatre commands into the high power body.\nThe current CMC comprises one chairman, two vice- chairmen, and eight regular members: the defence minister, the heads of the four former headquarters, and the commanders of the air force, navy and rocket force.\n\"Rooting out the harmful influence of Guo and Xu is one of the key reasons Xi needs to reform the CMC,\" Beijing-based military expert Li Jie told the Post.\nThe structure of the commission also needs to fit the ongoing military overhaul, with thousands of senior officers being laid off, he said.\nShanghai-based political commentator Chen Daoyin said Xi was intent on reforming the CMC to strengthen his hand against those in the party opposed to his new political thinking.\nXi hoped his political ideas would to be in included in the party constitution at the upcoming congress, like those of his predecessors Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, and become part of the party s political guidelines.\n\"But it seems there are some different voices inside the party against him,\" Chen told Post.\n\"The removal Fang and Zhang and reform the CMC could remind his opponents that Xi has absolute dominance in the army, which helped put the Communist Party in power,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xi jinping",

claimed a bomb attack at a police station in the Syrian capital Damascus a day earlier that killed at least 17 people.\nIn a statement circulated on its social media accounts, the group said three of its fighters armed with guns, grenades and explosives were involved in the attack in the southern neighbourhood of Midan yesterday.\nThe Syrian interior ministry said yesterday that the attack involved two suicide bombers, one of whom managed to penetrate the police station and reach the first floor before his explosives detonated.\nBut a monitor reported a third explosion involved a car bomb outside the police station, and the IS claim also referred to the third attacker blowing himself up separately from the other two.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , a Britain-based monitoring group, said at least 17 people were killed in the attack, among them 13 police officers.\nDamascus has been largely insulated from the worst of the violence during the country's brutal six-year civil war, but several bomb attacks have shaken the city.\nThe Midan police station has itself been targeted before.\nIn December 2016, three police officers were wounded when a seven-year-old girl walked into the police station wearing an explosive belt that was remotely detonated.\nThe regime is currently waging several offensives against IS, including in the Badiya desert region and in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor.\nThe jihadist group is rapidly losing territory across Syria, though it retains a handful of positions, including in the Yarmuk camp in

While the price increase breaks the streak of five consecutive declines in gas price as per the modified Rangarajan formula, it still remains well below the average cost of production for many producers for a sustained period, leading to losses, which has forced the industry to seek a floor price for the modified Rangarajan formula from the government. \n\n\u201cThe recent depreciation in Indian Rupee (INR) against US$, if sustained, would however provide some succour to the gas producers in terms of higher Rupee realisations. The Government has not acceded to the request of the domestic producers for a floor so far; which could be a key bottleneck in achieving a higher share of gas in the energy consumption of the country targeted by the government itself,\u201d said K Ravichandran, Senior Vice-President and Group Head, Corporate Ratings, ICRA. \n\n\u201cThe issue of such low prices for a sustained period making exploration and production unviable, even for benign geologies would have to be addressed on a priority in order to incentivise domestic production and balance the interest of upstream producers with consumers,\u201d he said. \n\nThe government has also raised the ceiling on gas produced from deep water, ultra deepwater, high temperature and high pressure fields to $6.30/mbtu for the second half of FY18, up 13.3% from the first half of the year. \n\nFrom the consumers\u2019 perspective, the increase in domestic gas prices is negative. The upward revision in the domestic gas price and recent depreciation in Indian Rupee would increase the cost of domestic gas-based power generation by about 8%. For the fertiliser sector, nearly 53% of the gas requirement of the fertiliser sector is met through domestic gas while the remaining is met through R-LNG imports. Moreover, the industry is supplied gas at pooled pricing , which takes into account weighted average of domestic and R-LNG prices, ICRA said. \n\nThe recent revision in domestic gas price will lead to an increase of around $0.35 per mbtu in the pooled gas price for the fertiliser sector for H2FY2018. The sector will see prices rises due to this and depreciation in Rupee which could subsequently lead to an increase in subsidy outgo of Rs 1000-1100 crore in H2FY2018 for the government. 0 Comments", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "k ravichandran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rangarajan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "icra", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "mumbai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:17:04.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cdf158c8a9b7a1cffcaaddb2dd8166664d476d09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdmHdRvxU3iMYHCnsEwnX9.0lYaeUqqyNOFrRi3IizrtvhfRXxd7w6ikHoX8OuY3nGEDF7Nuk5rxE.dApHA7i2xs0yeCvCO2vSlRHKxQ7g_8eKOPE1c4deBphMNbvbSPXmuss4CJzA187h5G1T13DRT_DCyJAvHmvgAeDSblHcsTFQ--", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/rssfeedstopstories.cms", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "The Economic Times", "title": "Saubhagya scheme: Power Ministry to meet states on Wednesday for Saubhagya implementation - The Economic Times", "title_full": "Saubhagya scheme: Power Ministry to meet states on Wednesday for Saubhagya implementation - The Economic Times", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-60924480,width-672,resizemode-4,imglength-58786/industry/energy/power/power-ministry-to-meet-states-on-wednesday-for-saubhagya-implementation.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 7}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cdf158c8a9b7a1cffcaaddb2dd8166664d476d09", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdmHdRvxU3iMYHCnsEwnX9.0lYaeUqqyNOFrRi3IizrtvhfRXxd7w6ikHoX8OuY3nGEDF7Nuk5rxE.dApHA7i2xs0yeCvCO2vSlRHKxQ7g_8eKOPE1c4deBphMNbvbSPXmuss4CJzA187h5G1T13DRT_DCyJAvHmvgAeDSblHcsTFQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarita C Singh", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saubhagya scheme: Power Ministry to meet states on Wednesday for Saubhagya implementation - The Economic Times", "text": "NEW DELHI: The Union power ministry will hold a meeting with states on Wednesday to formalise the implementation strategy for the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya). \n\nThe meeting will discuss the present status of household electrification, state-wise existing schemes, states' preparedness and implementation plans, a senior government official said. \n\nUnder the scheme, states have to prepare the detailed project reports (DPRs) and submit to the Union power ministry for approval.
