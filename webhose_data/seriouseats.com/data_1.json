Take sweetened condensed milk. On the surface, it's simply fresh milk cooked to remove about 60% of its water content and sweetened with enough sugar to form a heavy syrup. Yet, along the way, Maillard browning creates this beautiful complexity, giving it a toasty, toffee-like character. \nLet's be clear\u2014there's nothing wrong with the stuff in a can (though Max Falkowitz has proven that not all brands are created equal). But no brand can compare to made-from-scratch sweetened condensed milk, because when you're in charge of the dairy, sugar, and heat, truly magical things will happen\u2014especially if you opt for the mellow sweetness of toasted sugar . \nControlling those variables gives homemade sweetened condensed milk more depth of flavor and body, while also allowing for customization, as ingredients like vanilla bean, cinnamon sticks, whole spices, and fresh herbs can be infused straight into the milk. Just take care to avoid acidic ingredients that can curdle the milk. \nNow, I fully understand the convenience of canned dairy, but in a world where so many of us routinely binge entire seasons of television in one sitting, let's not pretend we don't have the time. A batch of homemade sweetened condensed milk takes 45 minutes from start to finish and requires no more effort than some idle stirring\u2014by the time I finished up Game of Thrones, I could've amassed a lifetime supply. (Besides, multitasking varnishes my guilty pleasures in a sheen of productivity.) \nThe ingredients are simple: 32 ounces milk, 7 ounces sugar, and 6 ounces heavy cream, plus a pinch of salt and whatever aromatics you choose. The cream adds a major dose of lactose for more flavorful browning, but more importantly, it prevents the milk from curdling as it cooks. Thanks to the fat content in the cream, it doesn't matter whether you use whole or skim milk , so feel free to grab whatever you have on hand. \nOnce it comes to a boil, the dairy will deepen from bright white to ivory as the lactose browns, which is why it's important to stir and scrape all the while with a flexible spatula. But so long as you've got some entertainment at hand (be it GoT or a magazine), the time will fly. At the end of 45 minutes it will be foamy and thick (if not, feel free to turn up the heat; heavier gauges of cookware and weak burner outputs can slow things down). \nIf you've got a digital scale, the recipe is even easier because you can use it to monitor the reduction\u2014when the pot weighs 26 ounces less than when you started, it's done! That means sixty percent of the dairy's water content will have boiled away, reducing the mixture to exactly two cups or 19 ounces\u2014further proof that a pint isn't a pound the world around. \nShould you accidentally reduce the mixture too far, top it off with enough milk to reach 2-cups or 19-ounces and hit the whole thing with an immersion blender to emulsify (of course, you'll need to first remove any added flavorings). Transfer the sweetened condensed milk to a heat-safe jar; mild aromatics like vanilla can be kept in the jar to continue steeping, but remove spices and herbs to prevent the bitterness associated with over-extraction. \nCover and refrigerate until cool and thick, and store up to a month in the fridge. Generally speaking, you'll want to bring homemade sweetened condensed milk to room temperature before use, as most recipes are based on \"room temperature\" canned goods so the massive drop in temperature can adversely thicken or curdle batters and doughs. Aside from the issue of temperature, the homemade version can be used interchangeably for store bought. \nMy cookbook includes variations for incorporating ingredients like fresh ginger, dried lavender, whole spices for masala chai, herbs, and even goat's milk. Whether plain or flavored, I use sweetened condensed milk in everything from my pumpkin and Key lime pies to marbled brownies and tres leches cake (plus a killer soft serve, too). You can incorporate homemade sweetened condensed milk into your own favorite recipes as well, or use it as a simple sauce for other desserts and a sweetener for coffee or tea. That is, if you can refrain from just eating it with a spoon.

In baked goods, their simple sweetness can seem one-dimensional, and their subtle flavor is easily overwhelmed\u2014when loaded down with heavy spices, pears have a tendency to fall flat. It helps to choose firm, tart varieties that can stand up to some time in the oven (I'm fond of Bosc and Seckel), but even more important is to choose ingredients and techniques that work for, rather than against, the pears. \nWhere apples are crisp and bright, more than capable of holding their own against an array of bold spices and a lengthy cooking time, pears are buttery, mild, and tender, necessitating a different approach. In classic French cuisine, pears are often poached with vanilla beans in wine, and for good reason. The wine's fruit-forward acidity perks up the mellow pears, while fragrant vanilla beans amplify their floral aroma and the gentle cooking method keeps their delicate texture intact. \nThe short cooking time of a galette works in much the same way, softening the pears but not obliterating them. Of course, there's not much room for added liquids, so I reach for apple cider vinegar instead of wine. It gives the pears a boost in both fruitiness and acidity, but in a concentrated form that's ideal for a low-moisture dessert like this. Plus, unlike wine, apple cider vinegar has a flavor profile that feels inherently right for fall. \nBesides the vanilla bean, I also season the pears with a touch of cardamom and Chinese five-spice powder. Those spices may not be a classic pear-ing (sorry/not sorry), but they've won me over with their ability to amplify and enhance the character of this mellow fruit. \nCardamom contains essential oils similar to those found in herbs like mint and fruits like lemon, a combination that adds a sense of freshness to the pears, which can often seem dull after baking. Meanwhile, Chinese five-spice powder adds a subtle but familiar warmth (cinnamon, cloves) and floral sweetness (fennel, star anise, Sichuan peppercorn) that creates complexity without getting all jazz-hands about it. \nFor thickening, I toss in a small amount of tapioca flour, which I like in fruit pies and tarts because it requires less cooking to gel\u2014meaning the fruit won't overcook by the time the juices have thickened. Plus, the resulting gel is clear with tapioca, instead of cloudy, as it can be with cornstarch. \nIt's all wrapped up in my Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough , a recipe that provides some much-needed richness to the otherwise lean filling, as well as a crispy counterpoint to the tender fruit. The whole thing's baked at 400\u00b0F (200\u00b0C) until bubbling-hot and golden brown, which takes only about 35 minutes. \nBecause it's so thin, the galette cools quickly, so you needn't wait more than five minutes before digging in. \nServed fresh from the oven, a warm pear galette is near perfect, whether served on its own or with a nip of brandy. But, if you're feeling fancy, it can be dressed up with a dollop of fruity whipped cream ( cranberry , perhaps?), or even some crumbled blue cheese and a scattering of toasted pecans.

Because it's made with nothing more than bourbon, sugar, and bitters (plus an orange or cherry garnish, of course), whatever spirit you use will come through in force, so make it a good one. While it's trendy nowadays to make the drink with spicy rye, bourbon is traditional and provides a slightly sweeter backdrop. If you've got company coming, Old Fashioneds are great to make in big batches\u2014check out this recipe , which is designed expressly for that purpose. Boulevardier [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nThe Boulevardier is like an autumnal cousin to the Negroni , replacing the gin with whiskey (either bourbon or rye) to complement the sweet vermouth and Campari. That substitution brings a huge change, turning a usually lean, bright cocktail richer and more complex. A Negroni may be good any time of year, but a Boulevardier will seem especially apt as the temperature drops if you want an elegant, dependable drink to warm you from the inside. Mint Julep [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nEven if Derby Day seems far away, there's no reason to wait to enjoy a frosty, refreshing mint julep, especially if summer tends to linger where you live. Using a mix or an artificially flavored syrup will put you on the fast track to ruining your julep; if you want to make it right, you have to use fresh mint\u2014gently muddled, not smashed to death, to avoid releasing the herb's bitter flavors. For something a little different, try our chocolate variation , made with a good-quality cr\u00e8me de cacao instead of simple syrup. Hot Caramel-Popcorn Bourbon Apple Cider [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nWhen it's numbingly cold out, you can't go wrong pouring a nip of warmth-giving bourbon into a mug of hot apple cider. In this recipe, we make that classic pairing even better by steeping the bourbon with caramel popcorn, giving the drink a nutty, toasty flavor. Because all popcorn needs butter, we float a pat on top of the finished cocktail. Bittersweet Amaro- and Whiskey-Spiked Coffee [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nThis rich spiked coffee walks the line between sweet and savory by pairing bourbon and cr\u00e8me de cacao with caramelly, bittersweet Averna and herbal Gran Classico\u2014and, of course, hot coffee. If you find the drink a little too sweet as is, just add more coffee for extra bitterness. Plain, unsweetened whipped cream is a fine garnish; for a more unusual touch, try flavoring it with a little extra Gran Classico. Improved Iced Coffee [Photograph: Lizz Schumer] \nNot in the mood for a hot eye-opener? This elaborate chilled beverage starts with iced coffee instead, mixing it with bourbon, Luxardo Maraschino liqueur, cream, Demerara syrup, absinthe, and orange bitters. The maraschino may seem to dominate the drink at first, but the bourbon will become more assertive as you sip. Sparkling Bourbon Pear Cocktail [Photograph: Autumn Giles] \nThis festive batched cocktail gets a pronounced\u2014but not overwhelming\u2014fall flavor from a roasted-pear pur\u00e9e. The simple, sweet blend of caramelized pears and lemon juice is mixed with bourbon and maple syrup to form the cocktail's base. To serve, pour the mixer into a glass, top off with sparkling wine, and sprinkle with ground clove. Gold Rush [Photograph: Jennifer Hess] \nThe Gold Rush is similar to the Bee's Knees\u2014a mix of gin, lemon, and honey\u2014but with high-proof bourbon in place of gin, resulting in a drink that tastes like a more complex version of a whiskey sour. While other varieties will work, I find that intense buckwheat honey stands up best to the bourbon. Triple Crown (Whiskey Sour Cocktail With Amaro) [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nAnother elevated take on the whiskey sour, this one gets its flavor from citrusy Montenegro Amaro and grapefruit-scented pamplemousse liqueur. The sweetness of the pamplemousse nicely complements the vanilla in the bourbon, while the amaro provides just enough bitterness for balance. Blushing Betty [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nColder weather means we're approaching peak citrus season, and this cocktail makes the most of it by showcasing bittersweet pink-grapefruit juice. We let the juice shine by keeping the rest of the drink simple, adding just bourbon and simple syrup. A grapefruit-wedge garnish isn't strictly necessary, but I think it's a pretty addition. Moto Guzzi [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nThis strong, dark sipper requires just two ingredients: Booker's Bourbon and Punt e Mes vermouth. Booker's is bottled at 120-plus proof, so it's capable of standing up to the bitter vermouth in a 1:1 ratio. You can also use a lower-proof (and cheaper) bourbon, like Jim Beam Black, but you might need to use a 2:1 ratio to keep the bitterness in check. 5-Spice Bourbon Punch [Photograph: Elana Lepkowski] \nBourbon cocktails don't have to be intensely strong\u2014on a milder fall day, you might prefer this refreshing punch, made with bourbon, lime juice, club soda, and a syrup infused with five-spice blend: Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, cinnamon, cloves, and fennel. Making the syrup with whole spices rather than store-bought five-spice powder both gives it a better flavor and makes it easier to strain. Turkey and Sage Cocktail [Photograph: Autumn Giles] \nThis cocktail drinks like Thanksgiving in a glass, thanks to pumpkin, sage, and turkey\u2014or, rather, Wild Turkey 101 bourbon. It's not just the pun that led us in that direction: Wild Turkey's caramel and vanilla notes make it a natural match for pumpkin, and its high proof helps it stand up to the woodsy sage. Pomegranate Bourbon Cocktail [Photograph: Kelly Car\u00e1mbula] \nThis drink incorporates pomegranate in two different forms: tart molasses and fresh juice. Mixing in fresh-squeezed orange juice adds some necessary sweetness to an otherwise tart cocktail. There are enough strong flavors mingling here that you can use any decent bourbon\u2014don't feel the need to break out the top-shelf liquor. Maple Bourbon Eggnog [Photograph: J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt] \nWho says eggnog is suitable only for Christmastime, especially when it's this tasty? The eggnog itself is a fairly standard formula, but it gets extra depth from maple syrup. What really sets this apart, though, is the crispy bacon-strip garnish, which plays well with the sweet maple\u2014sprinkle on bacon bits, too, if you want to get crazy with it.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "bourbon drink recipes", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T21:19:28.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c521c956ac2dce4f5a6aad5545011cca3dc9221b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_d7wUKysSRLSNyHlgFk.Lq9DBIEaKvygZ1HGClDqva2c_gipm1RwHgUdADAl4Uex_si18qVGfzGUEE6IGXcM9VoxOV_g7gUOE-", "site_full": "www.seriouseats.com", "site": "seriouseats.com", "site_section": "http://www.seriouseats.com/", "site_categories": ["social"], "section_title": "Serious Eats", "title": "Staff Picks: Our Favorite Fictional Foods", "title_full": "Staff Picks: Our Favorite Fictional Foods", "published": "2017-10-11T10:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 2765, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 225, "comments": 0, "shares": 225}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c521c956ac2dce4f5a6aad5545011cca3dc9221b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_d7wUKysSRLSNyHlgFk.Lq9DBIEaKvygZ1HGClDqva2c_gipm1RwHgUdADAl4Uex_si18qVGfzGUEE6IGXcM9VoxOV_g7gUOE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Serious Eats Team", "published": "2017-10-11T10:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Staff Picks: Our Favorite Fictional Foods", "text": "\nThe Serious Eats staff wax nostalgic about our favorite food memories from books and movies.

In the heat of the moment, all I could think of was malted milk powder , what I call the \"umami bomb\" of dessert. As handy as malted milk powder can be when it comes to layering a toasty/malty flavor into desserts, the secret workhorse of my kitchen is undoubtedly coconut oil. \nLike any oil, it's a pure fat, but what sets coconut oil apart is that it's solid but creamy at room temperature (well, when \"room temperature\" falls between 70\u00b0F and 74\u00b0F). That means it behaves more like butter or shortening in baked goods, creaming up light and fluffy when beaten with sugar. \nCoconut oil melts quickly on the tongue due to a melting point well below body temperature, so it doesn't feel greasy like shortening or cold butter. Refined coconut oils like LouAna or Nutiva are absolutely neutral, with no taste or aroma whatsoever, while virgin coconut oil can have flavor that ranges from mild to intense depending on the brand ( Coco Vita is my favorite when it comes to coconuttiness). \nThese properties allow coconut oil to wear a number of hats in the kitchen, functioning like shortening in snickerdoodles , like fry oil with doughnuts , like butter in scones , like liquid oil in banana bread . While this is by no means a complete list of desserts where coconut oil comes in handy, these 11 recipes go a long way in demonstrating the scope of its utility. Lemon Blueberry Scones \nThanks to its neutral flavor, refined coconut oil makes a fantastic replacement for butter in recipes, as in this recipe for lemon blueberry scones . By taming down the toasty, brown butter flavor scones usually develop as they bake, coconut oil puts the spotlight on the the bright flavor of fresh fruit while producing a scone that's even more rich and tender. \nCoconut oil has a slightly lower melting point than butter, so when using it as a replacement in your favorite recipes, it may help to refrigerate the dough after shaping it into a wheel. Once it firms up, slice and bake as directed. Rolled Sugar Cookies \nAs in fresh fruit scones, coconut oil limits browning in rolled sugar cookies . Not only does this keep the cookies pale\u2014snowflakes stay snowy white\u2014but coconut oil enriches the cookies and extends their shelf life beyond those made from butter alone. \nOf course, sugar cookies should taste like butter, so I use a roughly 50/50 blend for the best of both worlds. Trading a bit of butter for coconut oil is a great way to help your favorite cookies last a little longer, which is especially useful for shipping holiday care packages. Homemade Wheat Thins \nRefined coconut oil is an essential ingredient in Homemade Wheat Thins , where its neutral flavor lets the taste of whole grains and barley malt really shine\u2014these distinctive little crackers brown too deeply when made with butter, giving them a dark and nutty sort of character. Banana Bread \nOil's a common ingredient in quick breads, but switching from liquid oils such as canola to solid coconut oil gives my banana bread a lingering richness that's hard to beat. To use coconut oil as a replacement for liquid oil in other quick breads, all you have to do is melt it down. As the coconut oil cools, you may notice the batter is thicker than usual, but this won't cause any ill effects (in fact, it will encourage the quick bread to crown in the oven, a rather beautiful touch). Homemade Donettes \nIf you never make doughnuts because you're turned off by that notorious fried food smell, frying with refined coconut oil's gonna rock your world. Compared to most liquid fry oils, refined coconut oil contains fewer volatile organic compounds, giving it a cleaner aroma and flavor. When I fried up these DIY Donettes in our tiny office last year, no one even realized I was in the kitchen. \nAside from giving you the ability to stealth-fry at home, refined coconut oil returns to its solid state at room temperature, which gives fried foods a lighter, crisper texture once they cool, so fried foods taste less greasy, whether you're making fish and chips or cannoli. While the same could be said of any solid fat, alternatives like lard and palm oil can be difficult to source in bulk for many folks, whereas refined coconut oil can be purchased by the gallon from warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's, or online (by the gallon, Nutiva coconut oil is just 14 cents per ounce). Sour Cream Pound Cake \nDue to its size and density, pound cake takes ages to bake, so adding a bit of refined coconut oil can help keep it from drying out after a long stint in the oven; better yet, the added fat from coconut oil improves the shelf life of the finished product as well. Coconut oil's a key player in my own sour cream pound cake , but it's a trick you can make use of in your own favorite recipes. Next time you make a pound cake, try replacing 25% of the butter with coconut oil for an extra dose of richness. Digestive Biscuits \nCopycat recipes are a great place to make use of refined coconut oil, where its richness and neutral flavor help baked goods better mimic their store bought counterparts. Beyond that, refined coconut oil is a great tool for developing vegan variations of your favorite commercial snacks, such as chocolate digestive biscuits . Even my Homemade Oreos can be veganized on the fly with an equal weight of coconut oil in place of butter. Coconut Layer Cake \nI love refined coconut oil for its neutrality for the most part, but the flavor and aroma of virgin coconut oil can be used to strategic effect. My Coconut Layer Cake and Creamy Coconut Frosting are based on my Vanilla Butter Cake and Swiss Buttercream , with virgin coconut oil standing in for a portion of the butter (among other tweaks). Aside from lending its signature flavor, coconut oil improves the shelf life of the frosted cake with its added richness. Ginger Lemon Cremes \nAs in my lemon blueberry scones, coconut oil's neutral flavor keeps the lemon flavor of my ginger lemon creme filling bright and fresh. Since coconut oil is solid at room temperature and free from water, it also keeps the powdered sugar filling thick and sturdy so it doesn't go squishing out with every bite. If you'd like to take advantage of that fact with your own favorite sandwich cookies, try using refined coconut oil instead of butter in the filling (or virgin coconut oil if you'd like to add a hint of flavor). Cookie Butter \nSince refined coconut oil melts at a relatively low temperature, about 75\u00b0F, it's the perfect foundation for making creamy, spreadable speculoos cookie butter at home. Blended with a thick paste made from dissolved cookie crumbs, it makes a fun alternative to peanut butter in no-bake applications. Cookies 'n Cream Cookies \nIn this recipe, coconut oil stands in for 50% of the butter in what amounts to a basic sugar cookie dough. That cuts back on the toasty brown butter notes that cookies develop as they bake, giving the finished product a clean vanilla flavor that contrasts beautifully with the bold, bitter flavor of crumbled Oreos (whether store bought or homemade) for a cookies and cream-themed cookie .

Why? Because it's the most comprehensive homemade-pasta primer on the internet (that I've seen, at least). Within, you'll find exhaustive research on pasta-making techniques, clear photos to illustrate the process, and definitive recipes that work, no matter how meltdown-prone you are in the kitchen. \nIf you have a little pasta-making experience, it's true that, as Niki says, all you really need is flour, eggs, and a rolling pin. (Though any type of rolling pin will do in a pinch, a dowel-shaped one is ideal for rolling pasta dough by hand start to finish, as well as thin cracker and pizza doughs.) Still, let's just say that most home cooks will benefit a great deal from some additional basic tools. We have a fair few that we rely on to create nonna -style fresh pasta with a minimum of stress. A KitchenAid Stand Mixer and Pasta Attachments [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nIf you're looking for a good arm workout, you can certainly make Italian-style fresh pasta with a rolling pin alone. But it's a long and laborious process, so, if you prefer not to sweat through your apron, we highly suggest procuring a stand mixer and pasta-rolling attachments . With a little bit of practice, you can use these two pieces of equipment to make smooth sheets of dough, rolled to your desired thickness, and then slice them into delicate, even ribbons, all in a matter of minutes. \nFor a full rundown of how the rolling situation works, see the step-by-step photos here . Essentially, once you've flattened out the dough sufficiently by hand\u2014you can use a regular old rolling pin for that step\u2014you'll pass your dough through, starting at the widest setting (usually 0 or 1), until it's thin enough to cut. If you're making, say, fettuccine, you'll roll it to about a 6, or the third-thinnest setting. After that, just attach the fettuccine cutter, feed in a 12- to 14-inch section of dough, and voil\u00e0 : your very own fresh pasta. \nWe know stand mixers are pricey, though. If they're outside your budget, a manual pasta machine is an excellent alternative. Sure, it does take a little more effort\u2014and you might need a buddy to feed the dough in as you crank\u2014but the results will ultimately be just as attractive and delicious.

Mom prefers white cake, and my brother is partial to yellow, but when I factor in the habits of my friends and extended family, as well as all the requests for special occasion cakes that I had to field in my restaurant days, carrot has always been number one. \nMaybe it's all the cozy autumnal spices and crunchy pecans, or perhaps the tangy layer of cream cheese buttercream\u2014whatever the reason, carrot cake always seems to be a welcome guest at birthday parties and special occasions of all kinds. For that reason, I make mine in three stately layers to ensure that it's grand enough for any celebration and that there's always enough to go around. \nUnlike many other recipes, mine makes use of brown butter instead of oil, a simple swap that layers in some toasty toffee flavors while keeping the cake as moist and rich as those made with oil. To play off the nutty flavors of brown butter and toasted pecans, I also cut the all-purpose flour with a bit of whole wheat. \nIt adds a comforting, graham cracker-like vibe that pairs nicely with spices and carrots alike. Even better, the bran in whole wheat flour gives it a high capacity for moisture absorption that keeps the cake fluffy and tender despite the high volume of carrots\u2014like most vegetables, carrots are mostly water, which is why so many carrot cakes can seem dense and wet. It has such a nice effect that I used to make carrot cake with 100% whole wheat flour, but over time I started scaling back so its hearty flavor wouldn't overpower the earthy sweetness of the carrots. \nSpeaking of which, the volume of shredded carrots will vary considerably depending on the grater style and the degree to which those shreds will compact in a measuring cup, so this recipe benefits from the precision of a kitchen scale even more so than typical cakes. Shredding carrots is a bit of a pain, but it's a chore that can be done up to a week in advance; just transfer the shredded carrots to an airtight container and refrigerate until needed. It's a great way to break up the recipe into bite-size chunks that can be knocked out in the days leading up to a special occasion, so the cake can be baked and assembled with minimal fuss. $49.95 on Amazon \nDue to the density of the ingredients involved, carrot cake benefits from a foundation of whipped eggs and sugar to help lighten things up. I start by combining the sugar (both brown and white), spices, eggs, and vanilla in a mixing bowl, and then whip it on a stand mixer until the mixture is thick and pale. On a Kitchen-Aid Pro , my stand mixer of choice, this takes about eight minutes, but it's more important to pay attention to the visual cues. Just check out the before and after pics that make up the first two images of this collage\u2014when the foamed eggs are ready, they'll be thick, foamy, and pale. \nKeep mixing as you drizzle in the warm brown butter (including all the brown bits at the bottom), then add the all-purpose and whole wheat flours all at once. Once incorporated, shut off the mixer to gently fold in the shredded carrots and toasted pecans by hand. \nThe batter will seem super chunky, more carrots and pecans than cake, but that'll all change in the oven. At this stage, what's important is to make sure the batter is well mixed from the bottom up before it's portioned out into layers (more info on my cake pan recommendations here ). After baking, the cakes will be golden brown and firm to the touch (though your fingers will leave a light impression in the puffy crust). \nAs with my other cakes, I prefer to cool carrot cake in the pan, then level with a serrated knife for neatly stacked layers that can then be filled and frosted with cream cheese buttercream . $11.99 on Amazon \nUnlike the quick and easy cream cheese frosting I developed as a low-effort topping for my single-layer blackberry cake , the cream cheese frosting in my cookbook is a full-fledged buttercream, giving it the sort of stability and structure required for a special occasion layer cake (namely, the ability to hold fine detail for piping decorative borders and a firmer set to aid in transportation). Due to its butter content, this style of cream cheese frosting behaves much like a Swiss buttercream , and can be used the same way for crumb coating and decoration. Serious Eats Watch More Videos Replay \nSince I'm almost always making carrot cake for a special occasion, I finish it with an extra special touch: carrot roses. Not the sort made from marzipan or frosting, but actual carrots. Plain supermarket carrots will do just fine, but the roses will be all the more colorful if the carrots are, too. \nThe process is super simple. Peel the carrots to remove the rough outer skin, then use firm pressure with the vegetable peeler to carve out as many thick strips of carrot as you can manage. \nI lightly poach the carrot strips in simple syrup to make them pliable and glossy, then drain them and twist them round and round to make a sort of abstract rose. (As a bonus, the leftover simple syrup takes on nothing more than a mild earthiness from the carrots, so it can be saved for use in cocktails and such.) \nWhile they may not look like much individually, when the carrot roses join forces on the top of a cake, they become much more than the sum of their parts. \nIt's a special touch for a celebratory cake, but certainly not a requirement. With loads of brown butter, pecans, and spices, plus an ample dose of cream cheese buttercream, this carrot cake will make any occasion special\u2014with or without a bouquet of roses.

Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt] \nAuthor's Note: I recently built myself a new bookshelf in the kitchen, and in the process of reorganizing my ever-expanding book collection, I ended up blowing the dust off of more than a few majorly dog-eared pages. Old friends that carried me through college, my early days of faking it in fancy restaurants, my time as a test cook and writer, and some newer volumes as well. So, every weekday through the end of October, I'll be writing a short post featuring a food book that I really like. All of these books had a major influence either on my career or on my day-to-day cooking. They aren't necessarily the best or most essential cookbooks out there, but they are all worthy reads. \nBecause I skipped an installment earlier this week, today's review includes a pair of books. \nThis short review ends with the word \"toilet.\" I tell you this only because I myself found it unusual for a review about a food science book to end up in the john. I promise it makes sense. \nThere are plenty of good books on food science for home cooks these days. I've talked about several of them in this series of book recommendations , and hey, I may have even written a decent one myself . But I get it. Thumbing through Harold McGee's at the bookstore can make the subject seem a little daunting. There's just so much to know, and how the heck is this going to help me cook better, anyway? \nIf you're on the fence about the usefulness of food science, or about how fun and interesting it can be, Robert Wolke's pair of books, What Einstein Told His Cook and What Einstein Told His Cook 2: The Sequel , is a good first stop to dip your toes into the precisely measured water.

To read a measuring cup accurately, place it on a flat, stable surface, like a table or countertop. Add the liquid until it reaches just under the gradation line you're aiming for. Then get down at eye level with the mark, and you'll notice the liquid isn't straight\u2014it sort of walks up the walls on the edges. Carefully add more liquid until the bottom of the meniscus is level with the gradation on the cup. You can see photos illustrating correct and incorrect measuring here . \nTo gauge accuracy in our tests, we relied on an old standard: water. Because a milliliter of water weighs exactly a gram, we were able to compare the weight of the water in the cups to the markings on the sides and see if they correlated. I reached out to the Weights and Measures Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and was informed that one cup of room-temperature water is approximately 236 grams. \nWe filled each cup with water, creeping up to the gradations with an eyedropper, until the bottom of the concave meniscus was at the measuring line. We tested each cup twice, first at its half volume, then at its maximum volume. To rule out human error, we measured each volume level three times and averaged those readings. After each attempt, we dumped the water onto an accurate scale and noted the weight. (We used a calibrated jeweler's scale with a resolution of 0.01 gram for the 1-cup measures, and an accurate kitchen scale with a resolution of 0.1 gram for the 2- and 4-cup measures, due to limitations in the jeweler's scale's max capacity.) Then we compared our averages to the NIST standard to determine the accuracy of each cup. \nAfter our trials, we cross-checked our initial measurements by reversing the process: weighing out a known volume first, then pouring that into the measuring cup to ensure that the water lined up with the appropriate gradation. \nWant to know why some recipes fail even when you follow them closely? As these tests demonstrated, it's often saboteurs like inaccurate measuring cups. A 4-cup measurer we tested yielded more than 40 milliliters extra when filled to half volume\u2014that's well over an ounce. Putting that much more liquid in a pan sauce you're reducing might add only extra time. But if you're baking or cooking with rice, that kind of inaccuracy can make a real difference. Durability [top] \nThe risk of shattering a glass measuring cup is a concern; if you drop one on the floor, it will likely break. But short of that, the glass is quite durable, and accidentally chipping it against a pot or pan is improbable. Because the durability of the glass itself isn't worth testing (it is breakable, after all), our evaluation focused on the resilience of the markings. \nAll of the gradations on the cups we tested were made with paint applied in some form to the outside of the measuring cup. We fitted a reciprocating saw, which moves back and forth 3,000 times per minute, with a heavy-duty synthetic scouring pad that is normally used to clean grill grates. After lubricating the pad with water, we used the saw to scrub the markings for 30 seconds, then checked for wear. The good news is that all the glass and most of the plastic measuring cups survived, though one lost its markings almost entirely, earning a disqualification. Staining [top] \nLingering food stains, the evidence of past recipes, aren't just unsightly\u2014they can also make a measuring cup hard to read. We heated oily and acidic tomato sauce to a simmer, then ladled it into each measuring cup and let the cups sit for 12 hours. The glass cups didn't stain at all, and neither did the plastic ones. But the flexible silicone ones, which we had found to be relatively accurate, did: A hazy pink tint was left on the walls of the cup, making it harder to read the gradations. While we can see using these for controlled dispensing of hot or thick ingredients, they'd never be our primary measuring cups. Ease of Use [top] \nWe tested how easy it was to warm honey and remove it from the measuring cups. Similar to those of a saucier , the rounded corners on most cups can accommodate a flexible spatula and make scooping out honey simpler. Since our testing took place in a 75\u00b0F (24\u00b0C) kitchen, we didn't experience the same difficulty with honey that America's Test Kitchen did (subscription required): They reported that colder temps in a kitchen are retained better by the thicker glass, making it harder for sticky ingredients to level out and pour from a glass cup compared to a plastic one. Though our testing conditions were different, we can see this becoming an issue in colder months. The only cups that gave us trouble were the winning OXOs, which have angled gradations that made it harder to scrape the honey out. \nWe also filled the measuring cups to half volume with water and heated them to a boil in the microwave, in order to determine whether the handles stayed comfortably cool. This test also led to a couple of disqualifications: One innovative glass beaker design had a sliding plastic collar with gradations on it that moved up and down, mimicking a scale's tare function. But it softened and deformed in the microwave before hardening again. Another measuring cup, about eight and a quarter inches tall, wouldn't even fit in the microwave. Fortunately, all of the handles were cool enough to grab out of the microwave, though the flexible silicone tended to get the warmest, up to around 115\u00b0F (46\u00b0C). How We Chose Our Winners \nAfter running the measuring cups through all the above tests, and eliminating any that performed poorly, we narrowed down our picks to the following two sets. The Best Glass Liquid Measuring Cup Set: Anchor Hocking 3-Piece Glass Measuring Cups [top] [Photograph: Emily Dryden] \nThe Anchor Hocking 3-Piece Glass Measuring Cup set was the most accurate set we tested. The 1-cup measure missed the target 236 grams by a scant 1.24 milliliters, which is extremely accurate by kitchen standards. Other 1-cup measures we tested were slightly less accurate, with one averaging 3.5 milliliters under what it should have been. \nThe 1-, 2-, and 4-cup glass measures have a classic shape for easy nesting, and the largest cup has a narrower footprint and taller walls than other, shallower glass versions, so it takes up less space on cabinet shelves. The handles kept to a cool 89\u00b0F (32\u00b0C) during the water-boiling tests; there are no restrictions on using these cups in the microwave. \nThe red gradations along the side of the cup are prominent, making it easy to read their location in relation to the bottom of the meniscus. When we poured measured amounts of water back into each of the cups, the meniscus was closer to the gradation than it was in other cups, which proved that the cups were accurate in addition to being easy to read. The 2-cup marking on the 2-cup measure was slightly crooked, though not enough to cause trouble when cooking. Interestingly, when filled to half volumes, some of the cups slipped in accuracy: When we added 472 milliliters of water (2 cups) back into the 4-cup measure, the bottom of the meniscus was above the gradation. \nWhile this set is heavier than plastic cups, that weight keeps the cups still on the countertop, which is handy when you're ladling hot stock or pasta water. The Best Plastic Liquid Measuring Cup Set: OXO Good Grips 4-Piece Angled Measuring Cups [top] [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nThere's a lot to like about the OXO Good Grips Angled Measuring Cup set . The cups nest neatly and are lightweight. The set's 1-, 2-, and 4-cup measures come with a smaller 1/4-cup version, which is handy for drizzling in oils or extracts. The three larger cups have comfy rubber-coated handles for excellent control while pouring, and they stay cool right out of the microwave. \nThat said, heating is this Tritan plastic's weakness\u2014literally. Boiling water is no problem, but oils, which have a boiling point well beyond 212\u00b0F, can melt the plastic. OXO told us that heating oils, fats, and ingredients like chocolate can also chemically react with the plastic and degrade the cup. \nWhile the plastic is clear, the liquid forms a less pronounced meniscus compared to in a glass cup, which, for some, can make it hard to read the bottom. When we filled the 2-cup measure with 472 milliliters of water, the meniscus was in line with the gradation, but during testing, we averaged over 10 milliliters over the mark\u2014which, we believe, was due to the thinner meniscus and the less readable, short-dash-style gradation line. This demonstrates that the cup, while accurate, needs to be used with a slightly more attentive eye. \nThe most notable feature on these cups is the angled gradations, which are handy as a quick reference, as they save you from having to crouch down to measure. However, that method isn't as accurate as checking the side of the cup. The gradations sit on a ledge that makes it more challenging to get out sticky ingredients, like honey.

Japanese-style black sesame paste, on the other hand, is made from toasted black sesame seeds, with their hulls intact. Those two factors give Japanese black sesame paste its super-nutty flavor and deep black color, with just a hint of bitterness\u2014something that's lovely and mellow, rather than sharp. \nThat level of intensity is able to survive dilution with milk and cream, meaning that prized flavor and color are evident in every bite. \nIn Japan, black sesame desserts are often served with kuromitsu , which means \"black honey,\" though it's really a type of light molasses. It has a maltiness and mild acidity that underscore toasted black sesame in a delightful way. To cash in on that classic pairing without having to source yet another specialty ingredient, I reached for turbinado sugar instead: Its all-natural molasses flavor is perfect for the job, though Demerara or light brown sugar would work nicely, too. \nWith those ingredients in place, I make the ice cream base in much the same way as the custard for my Oreo ice cream , with the eggs, sugar, milk, and cream all mixed together from the start and gently warmed over medium-low heat. \nOnce the mixture is warm to the touch, I bump the heat up to medium and keep cooking and stirring until it's steaming-hot, but well short of bubbling. If you need to be certain the eggs are cooked through, aim for about 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C), but hitting that specific temperature isn't important to the success of the recipe. \nOff heat, add the black sesame paste, whisk until smooth, and strain to remove any bits of chalazae or chunky sesame pieces\u2014the fineness of the paste will vary from brand to brand. On that note, if you do find yourself with a coarser black sesame paste, feel free to hit the ice cream base with an immersion blender to smooth it out, though I found this step unnecessary with ultra-smooth brands like Kuki . \nRefrigerate the ice cream base until it's no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C) before churning. (This can take about four hours, so use an ice bath to speed this process along if you're in a hurry.) As with any ice cream churned in a canister, it's vital that that canister be as cold as possible, so adjust the dial if your freezer is usually warmer than 1\u00b0F (-18\u00b0C); otherwise, your ice creams won't be as creamy as they should. I love my Cuisinart ice cream machine , but any stand-alone machine should produce equally excellent results. \nWhen the ice cream is thick and light, you can enjoy it like Japanese soft-serve, or transfer it to a chilled ice cream container, empty yogurt tub, or loaf pan. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly against the surface of the ice cream (to prevent freezer burn), then cover with a lid or sheet of foil and freeze until it's firm enough to scoop. \nI'm crazy about black sesame ice cream by itself\u2014it's bittersweet, rich, and complex enough to stand all on its own. \nIf you'd like to dress it up, though, I've found that black sesame ice cream is amazing with a spoonful of raspberry pur\u00e9e. \nIt's something of a peanut butter and jelly vibe, with the toasted black sesame perfectly complemented by the bright acidity of fresh fruit. \nAnd if you have any extra black sesame when you're done, be sure to try Daniel's roasted carrots with black sesame dressing \u2014it's a recipe he invented to polish off all my leftover black sesame paste.

Cook over medium-low heat until warm to the touch, then increase to medium and cook, stirring constantly with a flexible spatula, until mixture is steaming-hot but not bubbling, about 8 minutes or to 155\u00b0F (68\u00b0C) on a digital thermometer. Off heat, whisk in black sesame paste and strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large stainless steel bowl. For a more homogeneous color, process about 30 seconds with an immersion blender; this is strictly an aesthetic consideration. 2. \nFill a sink compartment or extra-large bowl with a few inches of ice water and place bowl of custard inside, stirring from time to time, until cool, about 30 minutes. Cover and refrigerate until no warmer than 40\u00b0F (4\u00b0C), about 4 hours, or hold up to 1 week. 3. \nChurn in an ice cream machine according to the manufacturer\u2019s directions. Meanwhile, place a 1-quart container and flexible spatula in the freezer. When ice cream is fluffy and thick, shut off the machine and scrape ice cream into chilled container, using chilled spatula. Enjoy as soft-serve or cover with plastic pressed directly against surface of ice cream, then close lid and freeze until hard, about 4 hours. Special Equipment 3-quart stainless steel saucier , balloon whisk , flexible spatula , digital thermometer (optional), fine-mesh sieve , immersion blender (optional), ice cream machine Notes \nThe flavor and color of this ice cream hinge on high-quality Japanese-style black sesame paste, which is made from roasted, un-hulled black sesame seeds. The jet-black paste is rich, intensely nutty, and pleasantly bitter, like dark chocolate. Look for it in squeezable pouches at your local Japanese market, or shop for Kuki black sesame paste online . American brands of black sesame paste (often labeled \"black tahini\") are made from raw, un-roasted black sesame seeds, for a flavor that's too mild and astringent for ice cream.

What did they find when they arrived? Not just fish weighing hundreds of pounds (absolutely monstrous by today's standards), but that the Vikings, led by the murderous Erik the Red, had already been there back in the 10th century, on a voyage similarly fueled by dried cod. Cod was once so plentiful that the pilgrims named a cape after it (though they were far better plunderers than they were fishermen). And, Kurlansky explains, cod went on to feed both the Caribbean slave trade and the Union Army. \nIt was also cod that fueled first the growth of Iceland's modern economy during World War II, and later the Cod Wars between Iceland and the UK that began in 1958 and presaged the decline of the ocean's cod supply. Iceland came out ahead in each of these wars, devastating the UK fishery. The agreements reached formed the basis for the 200-nautical-mile economic exclusivity zone\u2014granting countries ownership of ocean waters up to 200 miles off their coast\u2014that is now the United Nations standard. These days, thanks to overfishing, Iceland's fisheries rely far more on haddock than cod. \nIn the end, Cod is a story about the pitfalls of human ingenuity and our over-proficiency as predators. Technology-fueled economic growth that results in conflict over who gets to scrape the bottom of what was once thought to be a bottomless barrel is a pretty on-the-nose allegory for any number of problems we're currently facing in the world. \nCod is a short, easy, fascinating read. If you like it, I'd also recommend Salt: A World History (similar to cod, with salt as the protagonist) and The Big Oyster (the history of New York City through the lens of the economy of oysters).

The weights were tested multiple times on the centers of the scales as well as each corner, to ensure that accuracy wasn't dependent on where the weight was placed on the platform. The majority of the scales were consistently accurate; only four displayed inaccuracies of between one and three grams. \nWe also wanted to test whether that fine-tuned accuracy degraded when the scale was loaded with heavier stuff\u2014for example, if you were whipping up a batch of Kenji's pizza dough and wanted to weigh sugar into the bowl you'd already scaled the flour into. To test this, we set a 750-gram calibration weight on each scale, then added the lighter calibration weights on top of that. We found that some scales displayed greater inaccuracies with this test; the worst performer was off by seven grams. \nAlthough most kitchen scales aren't designed to weigh minuscule quantities of ingredients, such as a teaspoon of salt or baking powder ( Stella has written about this in depth ), we decided to run a test to see if any of the scales could handle it, the assumption being that if a scale could accurately weigh a small amount, it would likely be more adept at measuring a pound of sugar. To test how accurate the scales were with very small amounts, we attempted to weigh a penny, which weighs 2.5 grams, on each one. Some scales read the penny as two grams, others three, while a couple of scales didn't register the weight of the penny at all. \nFinally, we tested each scale's accuracy at measuring small amounts incrementally. We weighed 40 grams of salt, one pinch at a time, to see if the scales could accurately measure it. While most performed well, a few were off by as much as 20 grams, and one scale could not even complete the test, repeatedly timing out before all the salt was measured. \nOur top picks not only performed well on all these tests, but were also capable of accurately weighing as little as two grams, which is far more accurate than you need for most tasks. Ease of Use [top] \nTime to Turn On \nWe timed how many seconds it took for each scale to turn on. One scale took almost five seconds to fire up, while others were instantaneous. Our winners fell in the middle, with the OXO taking three and a half seconds and the Escali two seconds. Most of the scales took about two and a half seconds to activate. \nTime to Auto Shutoff \nIt makes sense for a scale to shut itself off to conserve battery life after a period of inactivity, but it can be exasperating when it's programmed to do it too soon. A scale turning itself off while you're mid-recipe, just because you stepped away to get another bag of flour or stick of butter, is enough to make you throw it against the wall. Even worse is one that has no memory function and resets to zero after shutting down on its own. \nIt was important for us to pick a winner with both a reasonable wait time before the auto shutoff and the ability to remember the weight of whatever is on the scale when it's turned back on. Some of the scales' auto shutoff would kick in, annoyingly, after just one minute, while our top pick lasted the longest, at six minutes. \nInterface: Buttons and Display Options \nFor a tool you want to reach for over and over again, a user-friendly interface and intuitive design were imperative. Most of the scales were very similar in the design of their buttons and display. The on/off switch typically doubled as the tare button when held down for a moment versus quickly tapped, and the second button switched between metric and customary units. \nA few scales took a more inventive approach with button placement, much to our testers' confusion. The button most often used is the tare function, but one scale had it placed so close to the on/off button that we often ended up accidentally turning off the scale. Though switching between metric and customary should be a similarly simple and accessible function, some scales required the use of a toggle switch beneath the unit, or even hidden inside it. \nVisibility \nIt was important for us to find scales with displays that were easy to read, so we looked for either high contrast or backlit displays with clear fonts. But large, easy-to-read lettering and a vibrant backlit display are useless if you can't see the display under a large bowl. Often, wide bowls or pots make it impossible to read a scale, so we measured the distance from the center of each scale's weighing platform to the center of its display. Scales with more distance between the two ranked higher in our testing. \nSeveral scales measured as little as three inches between the platform center and the display. This short distance, coupled with a low-profile design, made it extremely difficult to read the display with even a small mixing bowl on top. Our best performer had a pull-out display that extended the distance to a full eight inches, allowing the tester to easily weigh ingredients into wide mixing bowls and large pots without ever struggling to read the results. \nCleanup \nTo test how easy each scale was to clean, we buried it in flour, then took note of how readily it wiped clean with a towel. Unless you're cooking in a dust bowl, your scale will never encounter this volume of dirt, but it gave us a good understanding of which models had an inordinate number of nooks and crannies for grime to build up in. Some scales had removable plates, allowing you to wipe away any flour that snuck underneath. \nStability \nIt was important to pick a stable scale, too\u2014one that didn't annoyingly tip or slide around the counter every time you pressed a button. Many of the lightweight scales easily fell over and bounced around on the counter whenever we tried to press tare or change units; this was especially noticeable in ultra-slim models. It resulted in the reading fluctuating by between five and 10 grams every time, and the scale often not returning to the correct weight when it finally came to rest. The Escali Primo managed to successfully incorporate a lightweight design without suffering from this defect. How We Chose Our Winners [top] \nThe primary function of a scale is to consistently and accurately weigh ingredients, so inaccurate scales were immediately out of the running. Our winning scales were the most accurate, and also easy to clean and easy to use. They came in on top through all of our testing. \nWe preferred simple designs and displays, which minimize confusion. When you're working at the fast pace often required in a kitchen, trying to find the tare button on your scale is a frustrating waste of time. Our winners had the longest delays before auto shutoff as well, and stable designs that prevented the scales from moving at the mere press of a button. All the Bells and Whistles: OXO Stainless Steel Scale With Pull-Out Display [top] \nWhat We Liked \nTypically, when any product is advertised as having extra attachments or bonus features, they're cheap gimmicks that don't add much real value. With our winning scale, every extra feature has been developed with the cook in mind. The OXO offers the best display, with a backlit option and high-contrast indicators, and it was the only model we tested that has battery-life and maximum-weight indicators, saving you from the frustration of a dead scale mid-recipe or the risk of damaging the scale through accidental overloading. It also features a pull-out display that allows clear viewing even when wider receptacles are sitting on it. \nWith its removable stainless steel platform, the OXO was the easiest scale to clean of the bunch. One could weigh raw meat directly on the scale, then remove the platform to hand-wash for guaranteed sanitation. In the flour test, we were able to remove the platform to wipe out every last speck of flour. \nThe OXO scale had the longest delay before auto shutoff, at 30 minutes, though it goes into automatic sleep mode after six minutes. While in sleep mode, the scale retains memory of what you last weighed until the 30-minute auto-shutoff point. This was the only scale with memory, which proved to be incredibly useful when we were interrupted during cooking. \nWhat We Didn't Like \nAt two pounds, the OXO is one of the heavier scales we tested, a weight that can be cumbersome. The scale also had one of the slower start-up times (three seconds long), as well as a slight lag while we dosed out a series of ingredients. As we used the scale repeatedly throughout the day, this became bothersome. Our biggest gripe with the scale is that it displays ounces in fractions rather than decimals; luckily, OXO has informed us that the newer, 2018 model has eliminated fractions and uses a decimal-only display. For the Minimalist: Escali Primo Digital Scale [top] \nWhat We Liked \nWe loved the simple, lightweight design of the Escali Primo . At only 11 ounces, it's a snap to grab and always have by your side. Though light, it managed to be stable thanks to its skidproof rubber feet and square base. The basic display and interface are effortless to read and use. The scale features only two buttons: one to change units, and another doubling as the on/off button and tare function. Providing accurate measurement in both metric and customary units, it has all the basics. \nThe Escali Primo had the second-longest delay before auto shutoff, at four and a half minutes. There were a couple of scales with similar designs and similar performance at lower prices, but they had only one-minute delays before auto shutoff, a flaw we could not get past. \nWhat We Didn't Like \nWith only three and a half inches between the center of the platform and the display, weighing in larger bowls or vessels can become problematic with this scale, despite the platform's slight elevation. The buttons on the scale are not very sensitive and require the user to press down hard.

The book is an easy, fun, and hilarious read, even for folks who don't have children. I imagine growing up in the Amster-Burton household to be like living in a Douglas Adams novel\u2014a new lighthearted, hilarious adventure every day. But the lessons Amster-Burton hides behind his substantial wit have been profoundly useful for me as a new parent trying to raise a kid with healthy eating habits (and I mean healthy in all senses of the word). \nHis strategy is a sort of loose variant of baby-led weaning . Its core tenets include feeding babies and toddlers the same food that you're making for yourself; being adventurous and experimental with different cuisines, techniques, and flavors; and ensuring that mealtimes are fun by getting the kids actively involved with eating (and preparing, when they're old enough). \"Food is fun, and you get to enjoy it three times a day, plus snacks,\" he writes. \nAt the youngest stage, when your kids are first old enough to start tasting solid food (a doughnut crumb that accidentally fell on his daughter's head at three months, in Matthew's case), things are pretty easy. Alicia sits down at the table for three meals a day with me, and they're easily the best part of her (and my) day. \nYesterday, Alicia stole a sweet potato quesadilla from Adri's plate and got it into her mouth before Adri even had time to react or explain to her that she could have her own quesadilla (there's no reasoning with eight-month-olds). Thus far, Alicia is not a picky eater. Far from it. She'll eat anything and everything she can get her hands on. Sure, she likes the obvious things\u2014 toast and runny eggs (quail eggs, to be precise) or the occasional chocolate chip cookie (she's still not coordinated enough to do a good milk dunk)\u2014but she also jumps into whole pan-seared fish with olives and tomatoes and pappardelle with duck rag\u00f9 with equal gusto. She eats blackberries and raspberries by the tiny fistful (full disclosure: she can fit only a single berry in her fist), is in love with avocado, and has yet to meet a fig she doesn't like. (She'd better appreciate that she was born a few months before what might have been the best fig season I've ever experienced.) She's taken eight flights so far, has sucked down Dungeness crab in Seattle, and seemed to get a kick out of her first taste of grilled jackfruit from the side of the road in Maui. Curry udon with enough added hot sauce to make even my tongue tingle a little too fiercely? All I got was a quick cough after the first taste, followed by a big smile and more noodles down the hatch. \nThese experiences very closely mirror Matthew's experiences in the book, which means that I'm fully expecting the other shoe to drop within the next year or so as Alicia starts to realize that having opinions is fun and no, I don't want those curry noodles that I loved yesterday. \n\"Once upon a time, we placed a plate of green beans in front of Iris at snacktime, and she Hoovered so many into her mouth that she couldn't chew them and gagged,\" Matthew writes. \"Now Iris is perfectly toothy and capable of eating a bowl of green beans but has no interest in doing so.\" I'm dreading the day Alicia does this, though not quite as much after reading Hungry Monkey . More than anything, the book is reassuring and empowering. I know that if Alicia doesn't like green beans, we can go on an adventure to the supermarket or the farmers market or the garden to help her find something she does like. And if she goes a day or a week without touching a green vegetable? Well, the worst that's really going to happen is that a judgy children's-nutrition blog might make you feel guilty for a moment or two. \nThis approach to nutrition has been great not just for Alicia, but for us adults as well. As a recipe tester, it's really easy to fall into the trap of eating only what I'm testing. Sometimes this is okay, but other times it means four straight days of Buffalo chicken wings , lunch and dinner. Cooking for a family, and specifically cooking to stimulate exploration of new flavors and textures, has led to mealtimes that are both healthier and more exciting. What we've found, as Matthew did, is that encouraging Alicia to explore by providing a variety of colors and flavors in each meal takes care of balancing our diets with very little thought or planning required. \nMatthew is a comedy writer for a living, but he's clearly no slouch in the kitchen, either, and the book has over 50 recipes to prove it. These are recipes that will sound appealing to anyone, even those unencumbered by stubby-toothed spawn. Irish oatmeal with candied bacon (Iris is a bacon snob who insists on smoky Nueske's). A simple and traditional pad thai. Chard and escarole saut\u00e9ed with garlic and lemon, or lobster rolls (one of Alicia's favorite foods). Each recipe comes with notes on what \"little fingers\" can do to help, whether that's measuring and stirring the marinade ingredients for a Sichuan noodle dish or slicing up the bananas for banana-Nutella panini. \nBy the end of the book, Iris is five years old and seems poised to follow in her dad's food-obsessed footsteps. Over the years since I first read it, and through the magic of Twitter, I've become friends with Matthew and have even appeared on an episode of Spilled Milk , the wonderfully funny food podcast he hosts with Molly Wizenberg . Still, it wasn't until just a few months ago that I finally met Iris. \nShe'd become a minor celebrity in my mind, and, as with most characters in books or films, was frozen in time, forever a four-year-old learning how to eat Sichuan noodles or begging her parents for more garam masala. This, of course, is a weird thing to think. Real people grow up and get older, and by the time I met Iris in real life, she was a young teenager. Alicia, Adri, and I had met up with Matthew and his family at Windy City Pie , a Seattle restaurant that serves what I believe to be the best Chicago-style pizza anywhere, including Chicago. Iris apparently still likes pizza. \n\"Oh, I know all about you as a toddler!\" I said to her, only to realize, by her awkward smile, that this was probably not the first time she'd heard that phrase, and that it probably doesn't get less creepy the more frequently she hears it. \n\"Er, so, is your dad cool?\" I offered, immediately kicking myself. When are dads ever cool to teenagers? \n\"Yeah, he's cool,\" she said, as she continued to explain that they were headed to a Magic: The Gathering expo later that week. Dear god, I hope that when my Alicia is 13 years old, she'll still think it's cool when I dress up for the new Star Wars premiere (where maybe we'll finally get that Salacious B. Crumb backstory fans have been clamoring for). I may even let her control the head section of the full-sized Jabba the Hutt costume we make together. Maybe. \nMatthew may be sick of winning the dad-of-the-year award for the past 13 years running, but, with the help of Hungry Monkey in my hands, I'll hopefully be able to snag a few regional titles. I'll start with the best-dad-in-the-house award and work my way up. \nYou can buy Hungry Monkey: A Food-Loving Father's Quest to Raise an Adventurous Eater here . I'd also strongly recommend his other books, particularly Pretty Good Number One and Child Octopus , about his family's eating adventures in Japan and Hong Kong.

Sure, dinner was an elaborate affair, but we actually started eating hours before sitting down at the table, and the appetizers were as important as the turkey and mashed potatoes. We blamed the snacking on the fact that dinner always took longer than expected, but we probably could have finished cooking earlier if we weren't so busy stuffing ourselves with deviled eggs, cheese, dips, and more. I wouldn't have had it any other way, though\u2014those extended Thanksgivings were some of the best days of my childhood. If you're on board to spending all of Turkey Day eating, check out 15 of our favorite Thanksgiving snacks and appetizers, like chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, roasted pumpkin seeds, and cheesy butternut squash dip. Chicken Liver P\u00e2t\u00e9 With Bourbon and Cranberry Gel\u00e9e [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nIf you're looking to pull out all the stops on Thanksgiving, you can't do much better than this creamy chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. To make the appetizer especially seasonal we add bourbon and apple cider to the p\u00e2t\u00e9 and top it with a tart cranberry gel\u00e9e. Despite the dish looking and sounding fancy, there isn't much more to it than a saut\u00e9 pan, a food processor, and a mesh strainer. Silky-Smooth Vegetarian P\u00e2t\u00e9 With Roasted Cauliflower and Pecans [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nVegetarians don't need to be left out of the fun\u2014this recipe uses roasted cauliflower and pecans to make a satisfying meat-free p\u00e2t\u00e9. If you want to keep the dish vegan you can swap out the butter for oil and omit the cream, but the result won't be quite as rich. Easy Pork Rillettes (Slow-Cooked Pork Spread) [Photograph: J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt] \nPork rillettes feel festive in a similar way to p\u00e2t\u00e9, but are easier to make for a crowd\u2014all you have to do is slow-roast pork shoulder until it starts to fall apart, then whip it up in a stand mixer. For something even more elegant, try making our salmon rillettes instead. Whipped Salt Cod Spread (Brandade de Morue) [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nWe're not done with the whipped meat spreads just yet\u2014brandade is a cousin of rillettes that's made by whipping up salt cod with olive oil and half-and-half. You can add potatoes if you want to make it milder, but I'm partial to the more aggressive all-fish version. Either way, the brandade is best if you brown it under the broiler before serving. Hoisin-Glazed Cocktail Meatballs [Photograph: Emily and Matt Clifton] \nOur take on this retro party snack uses a mixture of beef and pork, which we bind with panko and egg and glaze with a sauce made of hoisin, ketchup, vinegar, honey, soy sauce, and sesame oil. The meatballs can be made with dark meat turkey instead of beef and pork if you want something extra Thanksgiving-appropriate. Black Olive Tapenade With Garlic, Capers, and Anchovies [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nWhile I prefer an old-school tapenade made with equal parts olives, capers, and fish, when most people think of tapenade their mind goes straight to olives. Our recipe for a modern tapenade uses mostly black olives, with just enough capers and anchovies to give the dip a briny bite. 9 In-Your-Face Deviled Egg Variations [Photograph: J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt] \nIf you've been bringing the same deviled eggs to Thanksgiving dinner every year, it might be time to try something new. We have nine recipes to dress up the classic, ranging from a carbonara-inspired version made with pancetta, parmesan crisps, and black pepper to a spicy Buffalo twist. Basic Roasted Pumpkin Seeds [Photograph: J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt] \nDon't let the seeds go to waste next time you buy a pumpkin to make pie \u2014roasting them makes for a tasty snack. You won't go wrong seasoning them with just salt and pepper, but there are lots of other options \u2014how about ginger and orange zest, brown butter and sage, or even anchovy bread crumbs? Smoky Candied Almonds [Photograph: Daniel Gritzer] \nMaking the best spiced nuts is about more than a dusting of spices\u2014we typically (but not always) prefer to coat the nuts in an egg-white glaze to give them a crisp shell. For these barbecue-inspired almonds, we make the glaze with brown sugar and flavor it with smoked paprika, Old Bay, and cayenne. Stuffing Fritters [Photograph: Joshua Bousel] \nI love stuffing so much that I don't want to have to wait for dinner to be served to start eating it. This recipe brings my favorite side dish into the appetizer course by mixing a flour and cornmeal batter with stuffing ingredients like onions, apple, and celery and frying until golden brown. Stuffing-Flavored Potato Chips [Photograph: J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt] \nAnother one for stuffing lovers, this recipe flavors homemade potato chips with celery leaves, sage, rosemary, and marjoram. To give the chips a meaty flavor that brings them firmly into stuffing territory we use powdered chicken bouillon and MSG\u2014I know MSG makes some people nervous, but it adds a savoriness that the chips really need. Homemade Cheez-Its [Photograph: Vicky Wasik] \nCheez-Its might seem like an odd Thanksgiving snack, but our homemade ones are delicious enough that guests will request them every year. Using cream instead of butter gives the crackers a deep, nutty flavor, and depending on what kind of cheese you use, you can go with a more classic Cheez-It experience or mix things up. Baked Brie en Cro\u00fbte With Apple and Pear Compote [Photograph: Emily and Matt Clifton] \nBaked brie en cro\u00fbte was a staple of my childhood Thanksgivings, but we would get ours from the freezer section. To make the dish at home, wrap a wheel of brie up in puff pastry with apple-pear compote and bake until the crust is crispy. Go with a triple cream here, which will melt the best. Updated Cheese Ball Trio [Photograph: Morgan Eisenberg] \nForget about the waxy, pre-shredded cheddar\u2014this recipe treats cheese balls right. Each one starts with cream cheese, which is paired with another cheese, mix-ins, and a crust. My favorite of the three is also the simplest: It's made with just goat cheese, lemon zest, black pepper, and fresh herbs. Warm Butternut Squash and Cheddar Dip [Photograph: Morgan Eisenberg] \nSquash isn't the most common ingredient in dips, but maybe it should be. This festive appetizer pairs butternut squash with melty cheddar and rich cream cheese, plus onion, garlic, and plenty of sage. We also add in sour cream, which cuts through the sweetness of the roasted squash and caramelized onions.
