But with the aid of increasingly ingenious computer software, mapmakers can effectively ensure that the majority party wields control in a state legislature or U.S. House delegation wildly out of proportion to its support from voters statewide.\nOverwhelmingly it is the Republican Party that has benefited from partisan gerrymandering (so called to distinguish it from racial gerrymandering, which manipulates district lines to dilute racial minorities\u2019 political power in violation of the Voting Rights Act). The Brennan Center for Justice, for example, has estimated that \"aggressive gerrymanders\" have given Republicans 17 more seats in Congress than they would have won had districts been drawn in a nonpartisan way.\nPolicing partisan gerrymandering may prove more challenging than policing racial gerrymandering. But Democrats also have resorted to the practice when they\u2019ve had the opportunity. For example, Maryland\u2019s former Democratic Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has acknowledged that Democrats redrew a congressional district long represented by a Republican with an eye toward replacing him with one of their own.\nThe case before the court concerns Wisconsin Assembly districts drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature after the 2010 census . In the first election conducted using the new lines, Republicans won 60 out of 99 seats in the Assembly with just 48.6% of the statewide vote. In the next election, they won 63 of the 99 seats with just 52% of the vote.\nA divided three-judge federal court found that the map \"systematically dilutes the voting strength of Democratic voters statewide.\" The Supreme Court should reach the same conclusion.\nIn 1986 the Supreme Court said that partisan gerrymandering could violate the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause if it intentionally and effectively discriminated against an identifiable political group. But the court in that case didn't find such a violation. and it has never agreed on a clear standard for invalidating partisan gerrymanders.\nIf that is to change, the justices must decide on such a standard and how lower courts will apply it. The lower court in the Wisconsin case held that the Constitution is violated if new districts are \"intended to place a severe impediment on the effectiveness of the votes of individual citizens on the basis of their political affiliation,\" \"has that effect\" and \"cannot be justified on other, legitimate legislative grounds.\"\nThe lower court grounded its ruling in both the 14th Amendment\u2019s equal protection clause and the 1st Amendment. The latter rationale might have special appeal to Justice Anthony M. Kennedy , who is expected to be the swing vote in the case and who suggested in 2004 that gerrymandering might penalize citizens \u201cbecause of their participation in the electoral process, their voting history, their association with a political party or their expression of political views.\"\nSome of the justices will probably ask why the court should get involved in this issue at all. In 2004, the late Justice Antonin Scalia and three colleagues argued that the court should overturn its 1986 ruling and admit that no \"manageable standards\u201d for deciding political gerrymandering claims have emerged. In other words, leave the drawing of district lines to the politicians.\nThat\u2019s also what critics said in the 1960s when the Supreme Court issued the landmark rulings that ultimately established the principle that districts must be drawn on the basis of one person, one vote. In one of those rulings, a dissenting justice warned that the court was trespassing on an \u201cessentially political process\u201d and that lower courts faced with questions about redistricting would have to deal with a \u201cmathematical quagmire.\u201d\nBut the courts have managed to enforce both the one-persion, one-vote rule and the more complex requirements of the Voting Rights Act that prohibit district lines that dilute the votes of racial minorities. Admittedly, policing partisan gerrymandering may prove more challenging than policing racial gerrymandering. As Scalia noted in 2004, party affiliation, unlike race, \u201cis not an immutable characteristic.\u201d But party loyalties do exist and persist over time in geographical areas. Otherwise gerrymandering wouldn\u2019t be such a popular \u2014 and effective \u2014 practice.\nWhen the states don\u2019t rein in that practice on their own \u2014 as California, for example, has done by entrusting redistricting to a commission \u2014 the courts must be able to step in.\n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "scalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony m. kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elbridge gerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonin scalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin o\u2019malley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brennan center for justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "legislature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:08:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "187bc32c8c464a0b8b66182f5002e74d4316287a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFnzyx_Xr1f325nEd4oc.EbTOn_ULNVxvjear4x2KutRP2oEXV0uiMvYHsMA8jW30TlfsSQHgTGwTbd_ZT67Mw8D6z0djIZja5dg--", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.latimes.com/latimes/sports/basketball/nba/\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "L.A.

Last week\u2019s immigration arrests targeted sanctuary cities only. The late, unlamented Graham-Cassidy attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have decimated health insurance coverage in the preponderantly Democratic-controlled states that accepted the Medicaid expansion, and that did the best job of informing potential beneficiaries of their eligibility.\nNow comes the Republicans \u2019 so-called tax reform package, which also takes dead aim at Democratic states. By eliminating the deduction taxpayers can take on their federal forms for their state and local tax (SALT) payments, the GOP proposal socks it to those Americans who reside in states that have enacted progressive taxes to fund such basics as \u2014 see above \u2014 increasing the accessibility of healthcare.\nNot coincidentally, the state where all of these targeted policies would have their greatest impact is California, the GOP\u2019s Great Satan. Fully 167 of the roughly 500 immigrant arrests last week took place in Los Angeles . (Forty percent of those arrested had no criminal convictions.) Graham-Cassidy\u2019s Medicaid reductions would have plunged millions of Californians back into the uninsured pool. The elimination of the SALT deduction would all but guarantee that middle- and upper-middle-class Californians will pay more taxes.\nPresident Trump and the Republican Congress sure have it in for blue America. All of which poses a conundrum for the 14 Republican House members from California. Up to now, they\u2019ve been remarkably indifferent to the GOP war on the state they profess to represent. None of them, to my knowledge, has spoken in favor of the ordinances passed by the state\u2019s major cities to forbid their police departments from detaining individuals for lack of documentation, or the bill the legislature just passed to extend that policy statewide. None has condemned the arrests of noncriminal undocumented immigrants. All 14 voted for the Affordable Care Act repeal that came before the House, notwithstanding the tens of thousands of their constituents who\u2019d have lost their coverage had that bill made it into law.\nThe proposal to eliminate the SALT deduction from federal taxes, however, would hit a constituency that these legislators aren\u2019t eager to offend: their own voters. In election season, these Republican members of Congress aren\u2019t usually seeking to turn out the votes of working-class Medicaid recipients or the relatives of the undocumented. But without sufficient support from the upper-middle class, the already enfeebled California Republicans would go the way of the Whigs.\nIn three of the otherwise red Orange County congressional districts that Hillary Clinton carried in November, for instance, the SALT deduction gets a workout . Forty-five percent of the taxpayers in Mimi Walters \u2019 district take a SALT deduction (average amount: $8,794); 38% in Dana Rohrabacher\u2019s ($8,264); 46% in Daryl Issa\u2019s ($10,024). The elimination of the SALT deduction is one of the main reasons why hardly any of the GOP\u2019s proposed multi-trillion dollar tax cut will trickle down even to the upper-middle class, much less to those less affluent. According to the Tax Policy Center , fully 80% of the cuts will accrue to the wealthiest 1%.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising, then, if some California Republicans, in league with GOP members of Congress from such other high tax states as New York , seek to keep the SALT deduction on the books.\nThe resultant bill would still be a horror, of course: It would still direct most of its \u201crelief\u201d to those who need it least. The share of the nation\u2019s income going to the richest 1% last year \u2014 24% \u2014 was the highest ever on record. And yet the GOP proposes not only to cut their income tax but also eliminate both the estate and alternative minimum tax, which affect only the top sliver of the 1%.\nThe GOP argues that by showering more wealth on the very wealthy, they\u2019ll invest more in job creation \u2014 the libraries bulging with evidence to the contrary notwithstanding. But the only significant investments that clearly flow from such tax giveaways are those in the Republican lawmakers\u2019 own careers \u2014 the contributions to their campaigns from the Kochs and the Mercers and their ilk.\nCalifornia\u2019s Republicans may argue for some changes to their tax bill, then \u2014 but nothing, we can be sure, that will diminish the pelf of the plutocrats they so dedicatedly serve.\nHarold Meyerson is executive editor of the American Prospect.

In the war against \u201cthe establishment\u201d we have made being an outsider the most important qualification for a politician. The problem? Once elected, outsiders by definition become insiders. This isn\u2019t just a semantic point. The Constitution requires politicians to work through the system if they\u2019re going to get anything done.\nLook at all the senators who rode the tea party wave into power: Ted Cruz , Rand Paul , Marco Rubio , Ron Johnson, Pat Toomey , Mike Lee . To one extent or another, they are now swamp-things, not swamp-drainers.\nFor example, Rubio was hailed as \u201cThe First Senator from the Tea Party\u201d by the New York Times. But once he became a senator he became \u2026 a senator . And there\u2019s just something about being a senator that makes the lock-and-load crowd want to flip the safeties on their muskets.\nObviously, policy choices matter. Rubio embraced immigration reform and it killed him with the talk-radio crowd. But there\u2019s a larger dynamic at work. Merely talking like a half-way responsible politician \u2014 \u201cwe don\u2019t have the votes,\u201d \u201cwe have to pay for it\u201d \u2014 isn\u2019t what the angriest populists want to hear.\nMAGA populism is less of an agenda, and more of a mood. Cruz\u2019s case is also instructive. Over the last decade, no politician more deftly hitched his political wagon to populist passions. He wore the animosity of his colleagues, including the GOP leadership, like a badge of honor. He was the leader of the insurrectionists. He had only one problem: He talked like a creature of the establishment \u2014 largely because the Princeton and Harvard trained former Supreme Court clerk and career politician was one. He knew the lyrics to every populist fight song, but he couldn\u2019t carry the tune.\nUntil recently there was an \u201coutsider\u201d glass ceiling. The most strident populists \u2014 Ron Paul , Herman Cain , Michele Bachmann \u2014 could not get through the presidential primaries, because the math wasn\u2019t on their side. At least half of the GOP doesn\u2019t want fire-breathers, so the winning candidate had to get a large slice of the traditional Republican vote and combine it with other constituencies. That\u2019s how Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, the Bushes, John McCain and Mitt Romney did it.\nBut Donald Trump not only jumped into the fray at the height of populist fervor, the field was also divided 17 ways. No one spoke less like a politician. No one who understood how governing works would have promised the things Trump promised \u2014 health coverage for all, for less money, eliminate the debt, bring all those jobs back, etc. \u2014 because they\u2019d either know or care that such things are literally impossible.\nPresident Trump has learned this simple fact the hard way. Yet for the first eight months of his presidency his core supporters have stuck with him. The establishment remains the villain and Trump the hero for his willingness to say or tweet things that make all the right people angry. For his most ardent supporters, the fault for his legislative failures lies entirely with the swamp, the establishment or the \u201cDeep State.\u201d\nBut Judge Roy Moore\u2019s victory last week in a run-off against Alabama Sen. Luther Strange may signal that the base is not Trump\u2019s army to command. Trump endorsed Strange and \u2014 contrary to the president\u2019s tweets otherwise \u2014 that endorsement didn\u2019t help at all. The most important factor was Moore\u2019s demonization of the establishment, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The voters valued sticking their thumbs in the establishment\u2019s eye more than giving Trump a win.\nWhat\u2019s both funny and sad is that there is remarkably little intellectual or ideological substance to the current populist fever. The \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d crowd\u2019s initial preferred candidate was Rep. Mo Brooks \u2014 endorsed by radio hosts Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham and others. He got crushed. Meanwhile, Moore opposed Obamacare repeal and, until recently, couldn\u2019t say what DACA was. In other words, MAGA populism is less of an agenda, and more of a mood.\nA lot of people are simply mad as hell and don\u2019t want to take it anymore. Republican politicians can\u2019t ignore the anger. Ideally they\u2019d channel it toward productive ends, as they did in the past. But further stoking the anger for political gain is not just ill-advised, it\u2019s pointless, because eventually politicians have to govern.\njgoldberg@latimescolumnists.com\nCAPTION Over 160,000 acres have been destroyed in northern California fires.\nOver 160,000 acres have been destroyed in northern California fires.\nCAPTION Over 160,000 acres have been destroyed in northern California fires.\nOver 160,000 acres have been destroyed in northern California fires.\nCAPTION The death toll from the Northern California fires has reached 17.

(Oct. 3, 2017) \nL.A. decriminalized sidewalk vending to protect immigrants from deportation. (Oct. 3, 2017) Emily Alpert Reyes in Februaryand said it would soon move to legalize and regulate the bustling business that thrums along walkways in MacArthur Park, the Fashion District and other stretches of the city.\nIn the meantime, vendors could still get administrative citations with fines, but they would not face criminal convictions. \nBut activists complain that L.A. left some loopholes that continue to put vendors at risk of criminal charges. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fear and confusion about why the city was so enthusiastic about decriminalization in February \u2014 but still hasn\u2019t finalized this,\u201d said Doug Smith, a staff attorney with the nonprofit law firm Public Counsel. \nLos Angeles stripped out criminal penalties for violating a key section of the Municipal Code that outlawed sidewalk vending, but it did not touch other code sections that target vending in parks and peddling foodfrom a pushcart. Both are typicallycharged as infractions, but repeated violations for vending in the parks can also be punished as a misdemeanor. \nThe L.A. Street Vendor Campaign and other advocates have also warned that street vendors charged for \u201cpeddling\u201d can end up facing misdemeanors if they miss a court hearing. And they say that under the Trump administration, merely having criminal penaltieson the books could put immigrant vendors in peril. \nMeanwhile, lawmakers have yet to approve regulations to let vendors do business legally. A little more than a month after the City Council vote, Maria Medrano was ticketed for an infraction, for allegedly selling hot dogs from a pushcart downtown. In a recent interview, Medrano said she was saddened that little seemed to have changed. \n\u201cAll we are asking for, that we are fighting for, is a permit,\u201d Medrano said in Spanish. \nIn reaction to the concerns raised by activists,Councilman Gil Cedillo said hewants to remove any possible criminal penalties for those sections of the Municipal Code, reducing them to administrative citations. He and Councilman Jose Huizar introduced a proposal Wednesday asking city officials to report back on decriminalizing \u201cpeddling.\u201d \nCedillo is also exploring whether the city should impose a moratorium on enforcing either of the two codes until vending regulations are in place. His spokesman Fredy Ceja said they had not taken action earlier because they had expected L.A. to move quickly to legalize vending. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been clear that we don\u2019t want to criminalize people who are selling paletas ,\u201d Cedillo said, using the Spanish word for popsicles. Being ejected from the country \u201cis too high a price for someone trying to make an honest living.\u201d \nBut tackling some of those code sections could prove complicated. \nDennis Gleason, policy director for Councilman Joe Buscaino , pointed out that the same code that penalizes pushcart vendors includes other kinds of sellers \u2014 including people hawking food from trailers attached to vehicles. That could be an issue in congested areas, he said. \n\u201cIf sidewalk vendors are still getting infractions under that code section, we want to address that,\u201d Gleason said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s trailers, that wasn\u2019t really the council direction.\u201d \nCouncilman Mitch O\u2019Farrell, who heads a council committee that oversees parks, \u201cis exploring what it would look like to remove the misdemeanor sections\u201d for park vending, his spokesman Tony Arranaga said. But Arranaga added that parks \u201care governed differently than city sidewalks\u201d under the city charter. \nThe Los Angeles Police Department said that from January to September, it had issued 31 citations under the municipal code section that targets peddling from a trailer, wagon or pushcart \u2014 all of them infractions \u2014 and none for vending in the park. The City Attorney\u2019s Office said it has only filed two misdemeanor charges under those two sections in the past five years. Prosecutors have routinely rejected such charges for inadequate evidence or in the \u201cinterest of justice.\u201d \nBut immigrant advocates say that even categorizing it as a crime could put immigrants in jeopardy. Michael Kaufman, a staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California, stressed that President Trump has instructed immigration officials to target not only convicted criminals for deportation, but also people who have committed \"acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense.\" \n\u201cAs long as these ordinances remain on the books, ICE can say you engaged in criminal conduct,\u201d Kaufman said. As long as these ordinances remain on the books, ICE can say you engaged in criminal conduct. \u2014 Michael Kaufman, staff attorney with the ACLU of Southern California \nLAPD First Assistant Chief Michel Moore said that officers are supposed to try to guide vendors to voluntarily relocate if complaints arise from the community, instead of immediately issuing a citation: \u201c99.9% of the time I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any enforcement being taken,\u201d Moore said. \nHowever, \u201cif we have a problematic vendor or someone raising community concern, it is possible they may rely upon an existing ordinance such as this,\u201d Moore said. \nDespite the broad agreement among lawmakers that vending should be legalized, the council has wrestled with how to regulate it, facing concerns about blocked sidewalks, trash and negative effects on brick-and-mortar shops. Council members have been especially divided on whether some neighborhoods should be able to ban vending in their borders. \nIn the meantime, Guillermina Lopez, a tamale vendor who has repeatedly gone to city hearings to argue for legalization, said she was frustrated that she was continuing to get costly tickets. The South L.A. resident said she had stopped selling her homemade tamales and was scrambling to find other work before her rent was due. \n\u201cWe\u2019re frustrated,\u201d Lopez said in Spanish. \u201cWe thought everything was moving forward well in our favor.\u201d CAPTION \nBody camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1. \nBody camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1.

These entities pass their earnings through to their owners, who then pay taxes on this income at their individual rates.\nTherefore, the proposal not only reduces the corporate tax rate to 20%, but reduces the top tax rate on all other business owners from 39.6% to 25%.\nWealthy business owners would pay a maximum 25% rate on their business income while some of their employees may pay at 35% on their earned income.

At several intersections, the streets carve central squares and circles and at the center of those stand monuments to the venerated heroes of the Confederacy, monuments that some people would like to sweep into the trash heap of history.\nLike many American cities and towns, Richmond is confounded by what to do with these relics of another age and a commission has been set up to sort it out. This having been the capital of the Confederate States of America, what they do here may have more significance than in any other locale. Several days ago, I was on a bus with 17 other Project Pilgrimage participants from the West Coast, rolling along Monument Avenue for a rendezvous with some participants in the debate. We met up with a city councilman, Chuck Richardson, and a professor of history from the University of Richmond, Dr. Julian Hayter, who is a member of the monuments commission. Both are African Americans\nThe first monument we encountered was dedicated to Arthur Ashe, the black tennis champion and civil rights activist \u2014 obviously not one of the Confederate heroes. After a lot of effort and antagonism, Richardson succeeded in getting this statue put up as something of a rebuttal to the bronze images further along the avenue. And rebuttal would be the right term because the other statues were very much intended as an unambiguous statement in the segregationist era in which they were erected: The Southern cause was just and righteous, and this city will not apologize or relent.\nA few blocks after Ashe stands a big equestrian statue of Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson defiantly facing north. Beyond Jackson is an elaborate memorial to Confederate President Jefferson Davis. On the memorial\u2019s stone steps sat five protesters who do not at all like the idea of removing the monuments. Flanked on his right by two wary white men and on his left by two equally suspicious white women, a lone black man greeted our group with a smile. He stood up, introduced himself as retired Army Sgt. Maj. James S. Haynes, Jr., and gave us a lengthy explanation of why he believes money spent on removing the monuments would be a waste since the city has \u201cmany fish to fry besides dead men on dead horses.\u201d\nThe councilman, Richardson, sat nearby, fuming as Haynes spoke. Finally, he could not take any more and went on a tirade about the Confederate president\u2019s white supremacist beliefs. One of the women shot back at him, telling Richardson to \u201cget off the Democrats\u2019 plantation!\u201d She declared that it was the Democrats who were for slavery, which, while partially accurate in a historical context, ignores the reality that segregationist Democrats jumped to the Republican side in the 1960s and \u201870s.\nOne of the black students in the pilgrimage group got into a discussion with one of the white men. The man argued that, in assessing old Jeff Davis, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to look at it from a 19th-century perspective.\u201d The student stayed polite, but, walking beside me afterward, he wished he had reminded the man how that \u201cperspective\u201d would not have been healthy for a black man alive back in Davis\u2019 day. Coming up behind, Richardson shook off his anger and said with a grin, \u201cBut you gotta love the artwork, I tell you.\u201d\nDavid Horsey I was shuffling along a path beside the James River in the hot Southern sun, tied loosely by a rope to 17 other people while an actor dressed as an 18th century slave overseer paced beside us screaming demeaning, racist epithets. The thought crossed my mind that this was the height of white privilege:...\nI was shuffling along a path beside the James River in the hot Southern sun, tied loosely by a rope to 17 other people while an actor dressed as an 18th century slave overseer paced beside us screaming demeaning, racist epithets. The thought crossed my mind that this was the height of white privilege:...\n(David Horsey) That artistry is undeniable and reaches epic proportions in the towering figure of Gen. Robert E. Lee astride his horse, Traveler, standing proudly atop a massive pedestal. Hayter noted that the huge traffic circle on which Lee stands is state property and that, in 1977 after a black majority took over the Richmond City Council, the Virginia Assembly quickly passed a law prohibiting the statue\u2019s removal.\nThat same year, the Assembly approved a law that blocked the black-run city from expanding into the white-controlled outlying areas. Now, Richmond is ringed by white suburbs with good schools, while only 17 of the city\u2019s 44 predominantly black public schools have accreditation. That sort of politically engineered disparity is just one of the myriad examples of how the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow still haunts the South. Those who want the monuments taken down say the statues are symbols and celebrations of that dark legacy, not mere tributes to ancestors.\nHayter is in complete agreement with that view of what the monuments represent, but he notes that, when Baltimore and New Orleans took down their Confederate statues, it did not really change anything for the black residents of those cities. Hayter is open to the idea of doing something different in Richmond. Perhaps, signs and structures can be placed around or beneath the statues of Lee, Davis, Jackson and J.E.B. Stuart, the final rebel hero represented on the avenue, that will alter the message and teach a very different story.\nRemarkably, by state mandate, Virginia\u2019s schoolchildren are still being told that the Civil War was not a result of slavery, but was a dispute over state\u2019s rights and preservation of Southern heritage \u2014 a noble Lost Cause that their white ancestors defended with blood and courage. Could the monuments be transformed into places that counter those erroneous lessons? There is a very different and far more accurate narrative to be told. As the founding documents of the Confederacy state very clearly, the Civil War was all about slavery and the Southerners who fought and died so bravely sacrificed for an unworthy cause.\nThere are 75 million descendants of Confederate veterans alive today, Hayter said, and a great many of them are not eager to admit their ancestors were on the wrong side.

Combining gravitas with infinite suppleness, he has illuminated other roles in the Shakespeare canon as well as characters in Eugene O\u2019Neill, Christopher Marlowe and August Wilson. (L.A. audiences will remember his towering performance as the haunted traveler searching with his daughter for his vanished wife in Wilson\u2019s \u201cJoe Turner\u2019s Come and Gone\u201d at the Mark Taper Forum in 2013.)\nOne part he\u2019s never until now scaled is Hamlet, the Mt. Everest for actors of his intelligence, technical majesty and ambition. At 53, Thompson might be considered too old to play the Danish prince, a 30-year-old student on leave from university after the suspicious death of his father and the overhasty marriage of his mother.\nDirector Carey Perloff wisely thought otherwise. She opens her final season as artistic director of the American Conservatory Theater with a production of \u201cHamlet,\u201d in which Thompson shatteringly portrays the melancholy Dane in a boyishly affectionate performance that heightens the plight of a character forced by treacherous circumstances to relinquish his youthful ideals.\nTo judge by appearances, Thompson\u2019s Hamlet is firmly ensconced in his middle years. But the actor brings the ardency and intensity of a much younger man. The innocence of the character is oftentimes intellectualized away. Not here, where the character\u2019s philosophizing is born out of a poet\u2019s broken heart. Hamlet must mature quickly, but maturity has never seemed like such a bad bargain.\nThe sweetness of Thompson\u2019s Hamlet is as unmistakable as is his sadness. When he tells Ophelia (an emotionally unsteady Rivka Borek) to \u201cget thee to a nunnery,\u201d he\u2019s clearly and mournfully specifying a safe haven, not a brothel. He loves this woman so deeply that when he begins to catch on that she\u2019s a pawn in a spy operation, his fury seems to scald him even more than it does her.\nThe production, using a freshly abridged version of the play that occasionally seems rushed and blurry, quickly dispatches the \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d speech. Thompson turns the moment into a feverish spike of consciousness rather than the culmination of the character\u2019s thinking. The rash fluctuations in mood \u2014 suicidal one minute, manically ebullient the next \u2014 hint at a protracted adolescence. The references in the original text to \u201cyoung Hamlet\u201d may have been cut, but the character is still working out how to become an adult.\nMost actors show off Hamlet\u2019s topnotch brain in the famous speeches. Thompson reveals the character\u2019s formidable intelligence in the silences that swell up when words seem utterly inadequate. His Hamlet notices more than he lets on. Sometimes he turns away, not wanting to see what he can\u2019t yet accept. When Hamlet observes his old school chums Rosencrantz (Teddy Spencer) and Guildenstern (Vincent J. Randazzo) scheming on the sidelines, the look of disappointment that washes over his face is as expressive as a soliloquy.\n\u201cHamlet\u201d is the quintessential play about the trauma of growing up. Assimilating to adult reality in the corrupt world of Elsinore is a deadening process. Long before the poison-daubed sword slashes Hamlet in the final scene, the rotten state of Denmark has seeped into his bloodstream with the pernicious stealth of a deadly toxin.\nMost actors show off Hamlet\u2019s topnotch brain in the famous speeches. Thompson reveals the character\u2019s formidable intelligence in the silences. Shakespeare repeatedly reminds us of Hamlet\u2019s noble nature \u2014 his emotional, intellectual and moral superiority \u2014 so that we feel its loss more acutely. Thompson imbues even the character\u2019s most lunatic moments with an anguished vulnerability. When Hamlet confronts Gertrude (Domenique Lozano) in her bedroom, he recoils from his violent outburst and becomes childlike, a terrified boy entreating his mother to end the nightmare that has engulfed them.\nThompson\u2019s voice, that magnificent instrument, finds the tragedy\u2019s tone of hushed urgency. Unlike Oscar Isaac and Andrew Scott , two superb Hamlets from earlier this year, Thompson doesn\u2019t need to slow down the language to psychologically inhabit it. His experience with the classic repertoire has instilled in him a faith in poetry. He trusts that the words will lead him to the emotion rather than the other way around. The briskness of his delivery is a source of momentum for the production.\nI wish that I could report that the rest of the ensemble was up to Thompson\u2019s level. But the supporting cast, which includes a few apprentices from A.C.T.\u2019s MFA acting program, is secondary to the star, astral bodies spinning around a magnificent sun.\nThe strongest performances \u2014 Dan Hiatt\u2019s fusspot Polonius, Lozano\u2019s regally detached Gertrude \u2014 combine color with clarity. Perloff\u2019s production reminds us that \u201cHamlet\u201d was written after Shakespeare had completed a series of successful comedies. Humor, which runs through the play, makes no apologies in a production that can get broad.\nThompson\u2019s older-than-usual Hamlet caused one noticeable casting hiccup. Anthony Fusco\u2019s Horatio, Hamlet\u2019s BFF, has the worn look of a tenured professor. (I kept confusing him with Polonius.) The relationship with Hamlet doesn\u2019t quite make sense \u2014 the intellectual kinship is too fatigued. The party days of these ex-frat boys are long behind them.\nAge isn\u2019t an issue for the ageless Teagle F. Bougere, who plays Laertes, but he seems to exist in a separate theatrical universe from Thompson\u2019s Hamlet. As Claudius, Steven Anthony Jones accentuates the ceremonial bombast of a ruthless political operator. His portrayal doesn\u2019t so much personalize the figure of Hamlet\u2019s murderous, satyr-like uncle-turned-stepfather as incarnate the spreading rot creeping through the kingdom.\nThe castle, where all the nefarious activity takes place, is conjured with haunting simplicity by scenic designer David Israel Reynoso, who also did the modern costumes. James F. Ingalls\u2019 lighting charges the landscape with visual poetry. Jake Rodriguez\u2019s sound and David Coulter\u2019s compositions create a tense acoustical backdrop.\nPerloff\u2019s production is beautifully contained, though the blocking of the action is as unsettled as the text. Like so many American productions of \u201cHamlet,\u201d this one could use another few weeks of rehearsal.\nBut the storytelling moves at a nice clip, the language is respected and rigorously probed, and at the center of it all is one of the finest actors working in the American theater today.\nThompson sloughs off the years to play this role. His face and body are unchanged, but his spirit is lighter, more buoyant and, crushingly, more tender. His Hamlet makes us feel the tragedy of a society that equates the realization of manhood with death. He is too good for this world yet inescapably part of it. The silence that ultimately overtakes him penetrates the soul.\nCAPTION L.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei\nL.A. Times photo shoot with Ai Weiwei\nCAPTION L.A.

No such weapon is necessary for self-defense, and no one should be able to amass dozens of firearms, as the Vegas shooter did, without alarms going off. \nFor all the talk of Muslim travel bans to protect Americans on our own soil, a far bigger threat is domestic terrorism \u2014 and, by extension, the NRA. But so far in Washington, the official response to such tragedies hasn\u2019t been to make it harder for weapons to fall into the wrong hands. A package of bills is pending, one of which would make it easier to purchase silencers, and another that would expand the right of gun owners with concealed carry permits to take their weapons into states with more restrictive gun laws.

So sure, he said, restricting large magazines and automatic weapons are public policy no-brainers.\nBut the majority of gun violence, Feuer said, is from suicide, domestic abuse and gang violence. \n\u201cOur focus should be not on what might have had an impact on any one case,\u201d Feuer said, \u201cbut on what will have an impact in reducing violence generally.\u201d \nFeuer \u2014 who is strategizing with a bipartisan group of prosecutors nationally \u2014 said one helpful reform would be to make it illegal in every state for someone subject to a temporary restraining order to purchase a gun. \nThe city attorney also thinks there\u2019s room for more careful restrictions on gun purchases by people with mental health issues. Colleen Shalby \nIn my conversation with Garcia, she told me \u2014 and then repeated for emphasis \u2014 that she was heartbroken by what her home state of Texas has done about guns at school. Last year, Texas made it legal to carry concealed weapons on college campuses, and that right has now been expanded to include community colleges. \nShe does not agree with the argument that, in a nation with an estimated 300 million guns and far more gun violence than any other country, having more guns on campus makes everyone safer. \n\u201cPeople are going to say, well, if you have a gun you can defend yourself,\u201d said Garcia, who had nightmares for years and whose upper body is still twisted from the damage caused by the bullet that tore into her. \u201cHow are you going to defend yourself if a whole bunch of people are packing guns? Can you imagine the crossfire?\u201d \nJust as someone came to her aid half a century ago, Garcia said, lots of brave people came to the aid of those who were cut down in Las Vegas. She sees hope in that, and prays there\u2019s a national reconciliation on curbing senseless violence. \nOne commentator said Monday that mass shootings are the price of freedom. \nIt\u2019s true that we can\u2019t protect everyone at all times in a country that values civil liberties. \nBut mass shootings and daily bloodshed are not the price of freedom. \nThey are the price of gun lust, the multimillion-dollar clout of the gun lobby, the mind-twisting glorification of violence and, most of all, the unconscionable failure of lawmakers to keep us as safe as we can possibly be.

But now is the time, the justices were told. \n\u201cPoliticians are never going to fix gerrymandering. You are the only institution in the United States that can solve this problem,\u201d Paul M. Smith, an attorney for the Wisconsin Democrats who brought the current case, told the justices. \u201cAnd this is really the last opportunity\u201d to act before the next round of redistricting following the census of 2020. \nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy , who likely holds the deciding vote on the issue, appeared to agree. He told a Wisconsin state lawyer that he thought extreme partisan gerrymanders could by challenged on 1st Amendment grounds because they deny voters in the disfavored party a right to have their views represented. \nThat won\u2019t work, the state attorney replied. \u201cLet\u2019s assume that it does,\u201d Kennedy said. \nIf Kennedy holds to the position that he appeared to favor, the court will have five votes for a ruling later this term that would limit gerrymanders. That would have the potential to undermine Republican control of the House of Representatives as well as several state legislatures. Although Democrats also have practiced gerrymanders, they\u2019ve had fewer opportunities in the current decade because they control fewer state legislatures. \nKennedy asked questions only of the lawyers defending the map drawn by Wisconsin\u2019s Republicans . At one point, he asked one of them to imagine that a state passed a law saying its election maps would always \u201cfavor party X or party Y.\u201d \n\u201cIs that constitutional?\u201d he asked. \nThe lawyer ducked an answer. Kennedy tried again and still got no answer. \u201cWell, it\u2019s a little hard to say at this point,\u201d said the lawyer, Erin Murphy. Certainly, the Republicans had not proclaimed they were drawing maps to favor their party, she added. \nKennedy was undeterred: \u201cI\u2019d like an answer to the question.\u201d \n\u201cYes, it would be unconstitutional,\u201d she relented. \nKennedy said nothing further in the hourlong argument, but it was clear that he believed the Constitution would prevent one party from writing a law that kept it in power for a decade. The only remaining question was whether he believed Wisconsin\u2019s Republicans had done essentially that when they went behind closed doors in 2011 and used computerized maps to ensure their hold on the state Legislature. \nIn 2010, Republicans nationwide scored big wins at the polls and took full control in at least half a dozen closely divided states. They used that power to draw election maps that strongly favored their party\u2019s candidates. \nPennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina, for example, have 61 representatives among them in the U.S. House, of which 44 are Republicans and only 17 Democrats even though voters in those states are closely divided between the two parties. \nIn Wisconsin, the election map ensured the GOP would have a supermajority of at least 60 seats in the 99-member state Assembly, even in cases like the 2012 election, when Republican candidates won just 48% of the vote. Last year a three-judge court struck down the map, leading to the current case, Gill vs. Whitford. \nGerrymandering has been part of American politics for over 200 years. The word comes from the name of an early 19th century governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, whose party drew a legislative map with a district that resembled a salamander. \nIn recent years, as computer technology has enabled parties to draw lines more precisely to maximize their advantage, discontent with the practice has increased. Several states, including California, have taken the power to draw legislative boundaries away from lawmakers and handed it to independent commissions. And legal advocates have repeatedly challenged the practice of partisan gerrymandering in court. \nDemocrats have taken the lead in opposing the practice because Republicans used gerrymanders so effectively after the 2010 election. Ironically, however, a ruling in Democrats\u2019 favor could help the GOP in the next round of redistricting. Democrats tend to do better in presidential election years, and stand to score big wins in the closely divided states. If so, gerrymandering would give them a chance to redraw election maps in their favor after the 2020 census. \nThe last time the issue was before the court, in 2004, the justices declined to plunge into it. But Kennedy suggested at the time that he might be willing to consider the issue in a different case. \nIn Tuesday\u2019s argument, the other eight justices sounded split along the usual ideological lines. The conservatives, led by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. , said the court should not get in the business of deciding partisan battles. \n\u201cWe will have to decide in every case whether the Democrats win or the Republicans win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of this country.\u201d Roberts dismissed the statistical measures of gerrymandering devised by lower-court judges as a \u201csociological gobbledygook.\u201d \nJustice Samuel A. Alito Jr. agreed. \u201cIs this the time for us to jump into this?\u201d he asked, suggesting the answer was no. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch said he did not see anything in the Constitution that authorized the court to intervene. \nThe four liberal justices were more certain that the court needed to act. \nWhat about the \u201cprecious right to vote,\u201d asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg . \u201cIf they can stack the Legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote?\u201d \nJustice Stephen G. Breyer said he did not need any \u201cgobbledygook\u201d to rule against the Wisconsin plan. \n\u201cIf Party A wins a majority of votes, Party A controls the Legislature. That seems fair. And if Party A loses a majority of the votes, it still controls the legislature. That doesn\u2019t seem fair,\u201d he said. \nJustice Elena Kagan noted that computers allow party officials to try out hundreds of maps to get the most advantage. It has \u201cbecome extremely sophisticated\u201d and can \u201centrench a party in power,\u201d she said. \nSmith used his closing argument to focus the justices on 2020 and beyond. If partisan gerrymandering is upheld, \u201cyou\u2019re are going see people slicing and dicing a very polarized electorate to the point where one-party control will be guaranteed,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to become the norm.\u201d \nTwitter: DavidGSavage \nALSO ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony m. kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph lombardo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house of representatives", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ktla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clark county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:32:01.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8896a889bfba78bcd37a078cddb9150f2cad18c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn1T8G79Me5er3CjRuOYM2nYycYO6lvL.NzrD.CbIwrxtKpgMUuTNgpFHb2zKLI6vSqSkKiAgAf5T8FRwVC.wBGgmb.BUzBgqtg--", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/Latimes/hotlist/\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "Essential California: Understanding the carnage in Las Vegas", "title_full": "Essential California: Understanding the carnage in Las Vegas", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d378de/turbine/la-me-ln-essential-california-20171003", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e8896a889bfba78bcd37a078cddb9150f2cad18c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn1T8G79Me5er3CjRuOYM2nYycYO6lvL.NzrD.CbIwrxtKpgMUuTNgpFHb2zKLI6vSqSkKiAgAf5T8FRwVC.wBGgmb.BUzBgqtg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Benjamin Oreskes , Shelby Grad", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Essential California: Understanding the carnage in Las Vegas", "text": "Good morning, and welcome to the Essential California newsletter .

We had a routine. We had breakfast at Clifton\u2019s Cafeteria, which was buffet style and something my mom could afford at that time for her and six children. After breakfast we hit a movie at the Million Dollar Theatre. Believe it or not, back then, after watching the movie, sometimes the actors would make an appearance. Talk about a wow moment for us. Then came the last part of the weekend trip. Before leaving, we hit the bakery downstairs from Clifton\u2019s. On this one occasion the craziest thing happened: A lady who was in her 50s or 60s wearing a light brown (very dirty) trench coat gallantly walked in. She yelled something out to catch everyone\u2019s eye and attention and without any regard of the children present she swung her coat wide open to show us her entire naked body.

They are scheduled to meet with officials involved in the relief effort, first responders and hurricane-affected islanders. \nPuerto Rico is struggling to recover from the devastating Category 4 hurricane that raked the island on Sept. 20, knocking out the power grid, snatching away cellphone service, isolating dozens of rural communities and leaving hundreds of thousands scrambling for food, water, medicine, cash and gasoline. \nOn the eve of his visit, Trump defended federal efforts as robust. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing what\u2019s been done in a very short period of time on Puerto Rico,\u201d the president declared Monday in the Oval Office. As he left Tuesday morning, he said Puerto Rico was in a \"much tougher situation\" than hurricane-hit Texas and Florida, but said the administration's performance was being widely lauded. \nOver the weekend, Trump had stirred debate by railing against San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz\u2019s \u201cpoor leadership\u201d and implying that Puerto Ricans were not doing enough to help themselves. He indirectly slammed the mayor in a tweet decrying \u201cpolitically motivated ingrates\u201d who criticized the scope and scale of the initial relief effort. \nIt was not immediately clear whether the presidential visit to the island would include an encounter with Cruz, who has made no direct response to Trump\u2019s attacks. White House Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the mayor had been invited to Tuesday\u2019s events, and Cruz said Monday she would willingly meet with the president or anyone who could help. \nFederally directed aid to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has dramatically picked up in recent days. But critics point to initial slowness in waiving the Jones Act, which restricts foreign-flagged shipping in U.S. waters, coupled with a delay in appointing an on-the-ground military commander to coordinate relief and a lag in dispatching a Navy hospital vessel, the Comfort. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency says more than 12,000 federal workers and officials are now in Puerto Rico, including military troops. The administration has cited signs of recovery including the reopening of businesses, notably more than half the gas stations, and restoration of running water for about half the island\u2019s residents.

She is also, less usually, a \"weapons analyst\" of such high standing that a helicopter comes for her when meteors, more supernatural than scientific, strike simultaneously around the world.\nAs luck and the script would have it, one of these shooting stars lands a short drive from Amy's house, and while Amy is off on her helicopter ride, Kevin and Reese go investigate. Despite his niece's intelligent counsel, Kevin lays a hand on the meteor and is blown comically through the air. When his head clears, or perhaps it hasn\u2019t, he is visited by Yvette (Kimberly H\u00e9bert Gregory), a \"warrior for God.\"\n\"In every generation, since the dawn of man, there are 36 righteous souls in the world,\" Yvette tells Kevin, \"and they protect humanity by merely existing. Now, there is only one.\" Namely, Kevin. This does sound uncomfortably close to \"Into every generation a slayer is born,\" but in other respects we have been down this road to Damascus, with unlikely candidates tasked with or taking on good works or (probably) world-saving missions. (See, for example, \"Joan of Arcadia,\" but also \"My Name Is Earl\" and \"Wonderfalls.\") There is some nondenominational, vaguely Judeo-Christian arrangement that, as far as I can tell, requires Kevin to go out and find other potentially righteous souls and activate them with a hug. Yup.\n\"Should I just register as a sex offender now?\" he reasonably inquires.\nJoAnna Garcia Swisher, center, plays Amy, the scientist sister of Jason Ritter's Kevin in ABC's inspirational comedy-drama \"Kevin (Probably) Saves the World.\" JoAnna Garcia Swisher, center, plays Amy, the scientist sister of Jason Ritter's Kevin in ABC's inspirational comedy-drama \"Kevin (Probably) Saves the World.\" Michele Fazekas and Tara Butters were writers and producers on the series \"Reaper,\" about a big-box store worker with a sideline in sending escaped demons back to hell, of which \"Kevin,\" premiering Tuesday, is a kind of heavenly inversion. They are also veterans of \"Resurrection,\" also on ABC , in which dead people mysteriously return to take up their old lives. So this quasi-religious ballpark is one whose layout they know.\nYvette tells Kevin he'll need to \"build up your spiritual powers through acts of kindness and selflessness,\" and obviously the good he'll be forced to do will make him a better, more empathetic, more engaged, less negative, cheerier, self-actualizing person. But, all in all, he is not a bad guy to begin with, just a little rumpled and sad and self-involved.\nRitter is a likable, able comic actor who shines in big parts and little ones, though I am not quite sure that he has been perfectly cast here; or rather, I don't buy his back story \u2014 the part where he is supposed to have led a life in pursuit of power and money and sex \u2014 though I am willing to go forward with him as a mentally disheveled person in a reluctant relationship with a mystical being and earthly life at large. There is the old, old comedy of talking to the person or thing that no one else can see \u2014 the ghosts in \"Topper,\" the rabbit in \"Harvey,\" among the classic examples; the invisible friends in \"Imaginary Mary,\" also on ABC, and \"Moone Boy\" among more recent ones (We are given a sliver of license to think it\u2019s all in Kevin\u2019s head, even as the show repeatedly demonstrates otherwise.). It's pretty reliable stuff.\nThe title\u2019s parenthetical \"Probably\" \u2014 the series was at one point called \"The Gospel of Kevin,\" which may have been regarded as potentially alienating to some viewers \u2014 seems meant to give the series an air of snappy ironic knowingness: We know this is sappy stuff, potentially, but it can be funny, too!

Some 25,000 of them, in fact. Admire it after dark, from land or sea. \nWhat : The Bay Bridge, opened in 1936 and largely renewed after years of still-ongoing seismic retrofitting and replacements , now offers LED light displays nightly. Artist Leo Villareal, who conceived the twinkling spectacle, calls it The Bay Lights . The work was first displayed from 2013 to 2015, then returned as a permanent feature in January 2016. About 25,000 programmed white lights are involved \u2014 but you can't see them from the bridge itself. \nInstead, you can see them from across the water \u2014 perhaps the Ferry Building, or almost anywhere along the Embarcadero (including the long boardwalk of Pier 7). Or you could admire them from aboard a ferry. \nYou can ride from the Ferry Building to Oakland's Jack London Square (via Alameda) in 30 to 35 minutes \nAs you watch the lights dance on the vertical cables toward the west end of the bridge, remember that the Bay Bridge is really more a sequence of bridges, connecting San Francisco to Oakland by way of Yerba Buena Island, with about a quarter-million cars crossing daily. Better yet, remember that the beloved 19th century San Francisco eccentric Emperor Norton called for just such a bridge back in 1872. Some people want to name the span for him. (Its formal name now is the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.) \nWhere: The Bay Bridge, which runs about 4.5 miles between San Francisco and Oakland, is 412 miles northeast of downtown L.A. \nHow much : It's free to look at the bridge, of course. To look from an Oakland-San Francisco ferry is a $6.80 fare per adult each way.

(Michael Hiltzik) \nPrice didn\u2019t stop there in his campaign to destroy the Affordable Care Act. Under his supervision, Health and Human Services has cut the open enrollment period for plans sold through the federal exchanges, HealthC are.gov , from three months to six weeks; instead of running from Nov. 1 through the end of January for plans effective in 2018, it will run only until Dec. 15. Last-minute enrollees \u2014 who are legion \u2014 will discover too late that their deadline has passed. The only means of avoiding that is to run a vigorous marketing and outreach program \u2014 but Price cut the budget for that by 90%, claiming through department flacks that previous experience suggested that outreach had \u201cdiminishing returns,\u201d an assertion contradicted by hard evidence . Health and Human Services also says it will shut down HealthCare.gov for 12 hours every Sunday but one during open enrollment \u2014 making it inaccessible for a good portion of the weekends when applicants would normally be signing up. \nJust before leaving office, Price ordered the health agency\u2019s 10 regional directors not to participate in state-based open enrollment events, an unprecedented withdrawal of federal support. \nAdministration sabotage of the individual insurance market is tied to more than half of the average 36% premium increases sought by insurers in 20 states analyzed by Charles Gaba of ACASignups.net . Gaba reckons that nine percentage points of the increase are due to actual medical inflation and 2% from the reinstatement of an Obamacare tax on insurers that had been suspended for two years. But five percentage points are accounted for by the administration\u2019s signals that it won\u2019t aggressively enforce the individual mandate, which requires everyone to carry health coverage; and another 17 points from uncertainty over the cost-sharing reimbursement payments. \nMost of this could not have been done by Price alone, at least not without the tacit connivance of President Trump. The campaign to kill the Affordable Care Act marketplaces by neglect and interference won\u2019t end with the end of Price\u2019s tenure as health secretary. There would be no improvement without a firm, proactive effort by his successor, and the chances of that happening look to be nil. \nKeep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

And Caribbean tourism officials have been reminding travelers that the region encompasses more than a million square miles with more than 100 islands, many untouched. \nSix ports are closed, another six are severely damaged and cruise companies are visiting alternate destinations. \nClosed ports include those in Turks & Caicos, Puerto Rico, St. Croix, Guadeloupe and Anguila. \nSeverely damaged ports, which may take much longer to open, include those in Dominican Republic, St. Maarten, St. Thomas and St. John in the U.S. Virgin Islands, and British Virgin Island ports in Tortola, St. Barts and Barbuba. \nAmong those where cruise ships are stopping: Jamaica, Grand Cayman, Belize, Cuba, Honduras' Roat\u00e1n, Mexico's Cozumel and Costa Maya, and islands of the Southern Caribbean: Aruba, Curacao and Bonaire. \nTo check the accessibility of various islands, see Caribbean Travel Update , a site that features Caribbean destinations. It has set up \"open for business\" columns to show destinations that have not been affected or are mostly up and running. \nIt also lists updates on those destinations that are still at various levels of recovery. \nALSO", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jose", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "stacey mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "florida keys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carnival cruise lines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal caribbean international", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "port of key west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "costa maya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grand cayman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aruba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. croix", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida keys overseas highway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anguila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barbuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tortola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guadeloupe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lower keys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. barts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "key west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. john in the u.s. virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belize", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "curacao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british virgin island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. maarten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cozumel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominican republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamaica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bonaire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:42:29.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c108723b6364935351d54865c3d73ea63ef71145", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hbDtIUmOWuAsLFOEt64RJ4wrn_s8MU.7fslm2u20z1F61JEVMRPzZBfjf5UQDL5D0lldLY3hXU1.r5.Yp.YeY.qg--", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/features/home/rss2.0.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "Massive blaze guts industrial building in Anaheim", "title_full": "Massive blaze guts industrial building in Anaheim", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d393ab/turbine/la-me-ln-anaheim-fire-business-20171003", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 18, "comments": 0, "shares": 18}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c108723b6364935351d54865c3d73ea63ef71145", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hbDtIUmOWuAsLFOEt64RJ4wrn_s8MU.7fslm2u20z1F61JEVMRPzZBfjf5UQDL5D0lldLY3hXU1.r5.Yp.YeY.qg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joseph Serna", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Massive blaze guts industrial building in Anaheim", "text": "A massive blaze that engulfed an industrial building in Anaheim early Tuesday took dozens of firefighters more than two hours to extinguish, authorities said.\nThe fire broke out in an industrial park in the 1500 block of South Anaheim Boulevard about 12:45 a.m. and swallowed a building in smoke and flames, said Anaheim fire spokesman Daron Wyatt.\nVideo from the scene captured by Anaheim Fire and Rescue showed crews setting up to attack the fire as a tower of thick, black smoke piled upward.

He also said the reason he re-entered the game in the second half is that he believes that kind of injury is helped by immediately getting back on it.\nWhat\u2019s important to remember is that in the long run, Ball will be fine.\nHere are five takeaways from the Lakers\u2019 113-107 loss to the Denver Nuggets .\n1. Ball looked more comfortable running the Lakers\u2019 offense in this game vs. the Lakers preseason opener. His performances are all about the eye test, not about numbers. You can\u2019t quantify leadership or magnetism. Ball has both. \u201cI\u2019ve said the whole time, he\u2019s naturally a leader,\u201d Lakers Coach Luke Walton said. \u201cThe way he plays the game of basketball, everywhere he goes, if he went to the rec center, people would follow him. Because he makes people better. That\u2019s what great leaders do.\u201d\n2. Luol Deng had a productive night. In 10 minutes and 28 seconds, Deng scored nine points and six rebounds. Deng missed the Lakers\u2019 first preseason game with hip flexor tightness.\nTania Ganguli Sometimes Andrew Bogut might mix up his sentence structure or use the wrong pronoun when he speaks Croatian.

The two big men, Andrew Bogut and Brook Lopez , weren\u2019t able to play on Monday, but they are closer. Bogut isn\u2019t ready yet, especially after coming off an injury last year. Lopez has experienced back spasms and was shooting in warmups Monday.\n4. When asked to single out a player who has been impressive in training camp, Walton picked Tyler Ennis . Ennis had a baby in August, and Walton worried that the baby\u2019s schedule would make it difficult for him to work. Ennis had seven points and three rebounds. Monday\u2019s game was also the first time his daughter was able to attend a game.\n5. Julius Randle had a double double with 12 points and 11 rebounds. Walton felt that Randle\u2019s improvement from the first preseason game to the second marked the biggest change of any player. He was especially impressed with how Randle communicated defensively.\nFollow Tania Ganguli on Twitter @taniaganguli", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ball", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julius randle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lopez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke walton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luol deng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brook lopez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bogut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ennis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew bogut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyler ennis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tania ganguli", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "denver nuggets sports lakers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "the lakers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lakers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver nuggets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:53:42.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ce87cc72c424b6a570e70feeb4843cc9c40c93dc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFnzpyTA_go468W_hSZ1dI7crP_c1LIPRBOMWd_tsCtc_MNGTwDoFh4.8XmO.7ImLaUlcKXFq.YlgM", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.latimes.com/latimes/sports/college/usc/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "L.A.

The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 84.07 points to 22,641.67, and the Nasdaq composite rose 15 points to 6,531.71. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks rose 2.49 to 1,511.97.

Investors may also get clues about who the next chairman of the Federal Reserve will be, and most companies will start reporting their third-quarter results.\nIn the meantime, some economic reports may look abnormally weak because of the hurricanes that have recently struck the United States, such as this week's upcoming report on hiring. But investors are expecting to see temporarily weaker numbers, which would limit the effect, Chiavarone said.\nGeneral Motors and Ford Motor were among the market's top performers after each reported strong U.S. sales growth for last month.

But starting more than a year before the November 2018 midterms leaves plenty of time to train local organizers who will interact with voters repeatedly in the coming months, Steyer said. He\u2019s hoping to reach a half a million California voters and inspire people who haven't been engaged in politics to go to the polls. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to try to work through local groups and empower local groups to be stronger and to do their jobs in a bigger more effective way,\u201d Steyer said. \nKarla Zombro, who works with the Million Voters Project, one of the voter outreach groups, said \u201cthere\u2019s just no substitute\u201d for talking with an actual member of the community, rather than someone bused in to knock on doors. Organizers will check in periodically, invite voters to public meetings and keep them informed about what's going on in Congress and local government. \n\u201cWe\u2019re building a relationship with folks,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone\u2019s knocking on your door who probably lives down the street.\u201d Joe Fox \nLabor unions are a major force in California and often do a lot of the door-knocking that residents are used to seeing. But Art Pulaski, head of the California Labor Federation, said the effort \"brings us to something that is much more in-depth and long-term than we\u2019ve ever done before.\u201d \nThe California Labor Federation is nonpartisan, but Pulaski said he sees the partnership as going after \u201cpeople who are sinfully bad on issues that affect working people.\u201d \nSteyer said that he feels as if California is under attack from President Trump 's policies and that he wants voters to know Republicans in California's delegation stand with Trump. \n\u201cThey have voted against the interests of their constituents repeatedly, and I think it\u2019s important for people to know that. And they\u2019re supporting someone who\u2019s targeting California in very specific ways,\u201d Steyer said. \nSteyer funded other efforts with local organizers in a half dozen swing states in 2016, and will do so again in 2018, his staff said. He has long been regarded as a potential candidate for statewide office. He has been coy about potential plans to run for governor next year, and recently wouldn\u2019t rule out challenging Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) in 2018 if she doesn\u2019t retire. \nA similar voter effort is being organized by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a conservative advocacy super PAC. Its volunteers have been knocking on the doors of swing voters in four of the vulnerable GOP districts since June , and the group plans to spend $1 million in each district.

Now Officer John Kline and his wife Dawn were on their third annual visit to the Route 91 country concert series Sunday night when the gunfire began.\n\"I walked to the front of the lounges and all I could describe it as was a war zone,\" John Kline said. \"There were people covered in blood.\" \nHe said he saw a man shot in the neck and women with a grapefruit-size stomach wound. \n\"It was an exit wound. She had been shot in the back as she ran,\" Kline said. \"I had no firearm with me, It is one thing to deal with it as a police officer but it is very different with your wife at a concert.\" \nIt all began with a few pops. \n\"We thought we heard what sounded like fireworks...we were leaving because it was the last song and I presume people were getting a little rowdy,\" Kline said. \n\u201cI've been shooting and around shootings in my 15 years and to me it sounded too echo-ey to be gunshots and I assumed it was firecrackers.\u201d \nIt turned out it was gunfire coming from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino tower nearby. A gunman opened fire on the concert, killing nearly 60 people in the worst mass shooting in modern American history. \nThe crowd panicked and as Kline and his wife approached the VIP lounges, \"we actually heard shots whiz past and strike either a metal banister or the VIP trailers,\" Kline said. \"This was real\u2026. I told my wife to get down low\u2026. There were only two exits and running wasn't going to work. The shooting after an initial tap tap tap turned to automatic gunfire,\" he said. \nA security guard was screaming at people to leave the venue, Kline said. Knowing they could be running into a second shooter, instead they hid by the VIP lounges. He said he told his wife to hide under the apron if an attacker came as he went back out front to assess the situation. That is when he took a look outside and saw carnage like he had never seen before. \nKline said he told his wife not to panic and not to look where many people had been shot and some were dead. They then walked a few blocks and called their children to let them know they were safe. \n\"In my 15 years I've seen some stuff and done some stuff but it's a whole different ballgame when it's your family involved,\" he said. \nJoel Twycross was another off-duty law enforcement officer listening to Jason Aldean close out the three-day country music festival. Twycross has worked for the LAPD for nine years, and is now an officer in the department's West Traffic division. \nHe and a friend were grabbing drinks toward the back of the venue when he heard the first pop. Twycross initially thought it was an issue with the speaker, he said. \nThen he heard it again. \"That sounds like gunshots,\" he thought. \nSuddenly, people began running and screaming. Bullets sprayed a table in front of Twycross and his friend. They hit the ground, then took off running. \nAs Twycross ran out of the venue, he said, he saw people pointing toward the glimmering Mandalay Bay. He could see a muzzle flash at one of the windows. \n\"We train to respond to these active shooters \u2014 not to be involved in one at a random place,\" he said. \"You don't show up to Vegas for a country music festival thinking this will happen.\" \nThe officer described a frantic scene: people hiding behind metal bleachers, Las Vegas police officers shielding people with their own bodies. Twycross tried to help keep people calm and moving quickly, he said. At one point, he said, he grabbed a girl frozen in panic and told her to run. \n\"Let's go,\" he told her. \"We need to move.\" \nThe officer saw people around them hit the ground. \n\"You couldn't tell if they were dropping because they were shot or dropping because they were ducking,\" he said. \nTwycross ultimately made it to the Tropicana, and then the MGM Grand -- far enough away from the shooter that he felt safe. \nTwycross described the experience as being \"stuck in the middle\" of a flight-or-fight response. He reverted back to his training, he said: You hear gunfire, you get down and you stay covered. But he was also without a weapon, as none were allowed inside. \nTwycross said his captain had already asked him to talk about the shooting with other LAPD officers at roll-call meetings. His advice? \n\"Be mindful. Be ready. Be prepared,\" he said. \"Don't ever think it can't happen to you.\" CAPTION \nBody camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1. \nBody camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1.

Jim Puzzanghera \u2019s former chief executive trekked to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to offer contrition and explanation for the credit reporting company\u2019s massive data breach. He was met with bipartisan incredulity and calls for tougher cybersecurity laws to protect Americans\u2019 sensitive information.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the guards at Fort Knox forgot to lock the doors and failed to notice the thieves were emptying the vaults,\u201d Rep. Greg Walden (R-Ore.) told Richard Smith, who stepped down last week in the wake of the hack that exposed the Social Security numbers and birthdates of as many as 145.5 million Americans. \n\u201cHow does this happen when so much is at stake?\u201d Walden asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can pass a law that fixes stupid.\u201d \nFor three hours, Republicans and Democrats on a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee blasted Equifax for allowing its trove of consumer data to be hacked and then bungling the rollout of measures to help consumers deal with the breach. \n\u201cIt seems to me that you\u2019ve accomplished something that no one else has been able to accomplish \u2026 you have brought Republicans and Democrats together in outrage, distress and frustration over what\u2019s happened,\u201d said California Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-Atherton). \nThere\u2019s more to come for Smith, who is scheduled to testify at congressional hearings on the breach again on Wednesday and Thursday. \nOn Tuesday, he was contrite in his testimony, which lessened the hostility in lawmakers\u2019 pointed questioning. \n\u201cI\u2019m here today to say to each and every person affected by this breach: I am truly and deeply sorry for what happened,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEquifax is committed to make it whole for you.\u201d \nHe blamed the breach on \u201chuman error and technology errors.\u201d \nEquifax failed to apply a software patch for a consumer dispute website in March, and the company\u2019s systems did not detect the vulnerability until July 29, Smith said. \nLawmakers were dumbfounded by the company\u2019s failure to patch the software and then, once the problem was discovered, to delay notifying the public for nearly six weeks. \nSmith said Equifax employees worked \u201caround the clock\u201d to prepare for an onslaught of consumer inquiries. The company had to set up up a new website and ramp up staffing at call centers. \nRep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) told Smith that the company\u2019s response should have been like a fire alarm on the wall, ready at a moment\u2019s notice to be pulled. \nSmith acknowledged that \u201ca crisis never occurs if everything has gone right.\u201d \nThroughout the hearing, Smith was lectured on the ramifications of the breach. \n\u201cYou can\u2019t change your Social Security number and I can\u2019t change my mother\u2019s maiden name,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.). \u201cThis data is out there forever.\u201d \nRep. Ryan Costello (R-Pa.) warned that the hack \u201cis going to be potentially so destructive to hundreds of millions of Americans.\u201d \n\u201cThe anger is going to be multiplied thousands of times when something actually happens,\u201d he said. \nSome members of Congress do want to strengthen cybersecurity laws in the aftermath of the Equifax data breach and there appears to be growing bipartisan support for action. \nOn Monday, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) reintroduced legislation they tried unsuccessfully to pass in 2015 that would require tough data security practices and additional consumer protections in the event of breaches. \n\u201cEquifax deserves to be shamed in this hearing, but we should also ask what Congress has done or has failed to do to stop data breaches from occurring and what Equifax plans to do,\u201d Schackowsy said. Several lawmakers at Tuesday\u2019s hearing said they backed her bill. \nRep. Joe Barton (R-Texas) said he thought financial penalties were needed to force companies to take security of sensitive consumer information more seriously. \n\u201cYou\u2019re really only required to notify people and say, \u2018So sorry, so sad,\u2019\u201d Barton said. \u201cIt seems to me you might pay more attention to security if you had to pay everybody who got hacked a couple thousand bucks or something.\u201d \nEquifax has been criticized for the delay in notifying the public and then initially making consumers give up their right to sue if they wanted free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. \nEquifax later backtracked on that requirement. Smith said a mandatory arbitration clause was mistakenly cut-and-pasted into the terms of the tools offered to customers to deal with the breach. \nIn response to criticism, Equifax said last week that it would stop charging customers to freeze access to their credit records so that no data would be released to scammers. Smith called for such free credit freezes to be the industry standard and that the nation should consider replacing Social Security numbers \u201cas the touchstone for identity verification.\u201d \nBut when asked at the hearing, Smith said Equifax would not pay for credit freezes for affected consumers at the other two leading credit rating companies, Experian and TransUnion. \nSmith also was pressed on the sale of stock by three Equifax executives. \nOn Aug. 1, the executives sold thousands of shares of Equifax stock for about $146 a share. The company\u2019s stock sharply declined after Equifax announced the data breach Sept. 7. \nSmith said he was notified of \u201csuspicious activity\u201d in Equifax\u2019s network on July 31. But such activity is common and it wasn\u2019t until Aug. 11 that an investigation indicated hackers might have been able to access Social Security numbers and other sensitive personal information. \nLawmakers pressed Smith on whether the executives who sold the stock knew of the scope of the breach when they made the sales. \n\u201cThey\u2019re honorable men. They\u2019re men of integrity,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI have no indication they had any knowledge of the breach at the time of the sale.\u201d \nEquifax\u2019s board of directors has formed a special committee and is \u201cconducting a thorough review of the trading at issue,\u201d Theodore M. Hester, an attorney retained by Equifax, said in a letter Friday to Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

Oct. 3, 2017, 7:39 a.m. CIF expected to revise rule on sit-out periods for transfers Eric Sondheimer \nThe California Interscholastic Federation's governing body, the Federated Council, is expected to vote this week to revise its sit-out period rule for transfers who do not change residences. \nCurrently, there are specific days for when those athletes become eligible. It was Oct. 1 for fall sports and will be Jan. 1 for winter sports. \nUnder a proposal that would take effect in 2018-19, the sit-out period will be 50% of the total number days in that particular season of sport. The rule would help prevent athletes in certain sports from sitting out more than others. \nUnder the new rule, the sit-out period would still be pretty much the same in lots of sports. In football, players would become eligible on Sept. 25 based on the season starting Aug. 10, 17 or 24. In basketball, Dec. 23 would be the day to become eligible after practice begins Nov. 12. In baseball and softball, it would be April 2. \nThe Southern Section Council is meeting on Tuesday to vote whether to support the proposal.

(Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times) \nAs the shots rang out and bodies began to drop around her, Carmen Alegria, a 41-year-old social worker from Shafter, was certain her time was up. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to die here,\u201d she thought to herself. \u201cWe\u2019re going to die.\u201d \nJust minutes earlier, she and best friend Angelica Soto, of Lost Hills, had made their way closer to the stage to be closer to one of Soto\u2019s favorite country singers, Jason Aldean. \nThen what sounded like firecrackers went off. Soto fell to the ground in pain, shot in her left shoulder. Alegria took off the Route 91 Harvest festival shirt she\u2019d bought the day before and pressed it to Soto\u2019s wound. \nSeconds later, Alegria was shot in her left knee. She was bleeding badly. The spray of bullets continued. She was terrified. \n\u201cThe bullets kept flying. They didn\u2019t stop,\u201d Alegria said. \u201cI thought for sure I\u2019d get shot again. It was continuous. I felt like it never stopped.\u201d \nBut the women \u2014 who call themselves sisters \u2014 pulled each other up, held hands and ran east, taking cover behind vendor carts until they made it to a dirt lot where they hunkered behind vehicles with other concertgoers. \n\u201cAre you guys OK? \u201ca female concertgoer said. \u201cI\u2019m a nurse.\u201d \nThe nurse checked Soto and told her it was just a flesh wound. She\u2019d be OK. Alegria\u2019s knee \u2014 gushing blood \u2014 was much worse, the nurse said. A man nearby took off his shirt, creating a makeshift tourniquet on her knee. \nThe shots continued. \n\u201cWe have to get out of here,\u201d Soto told Alegria. \nBy this time, the pain had set in on Alegria\u2019s knee. She'd later discover that the gunshot had broken her tibia and fractured her femur. She\u2019d later require surgery but is expected to fully recover. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can run,\u201d Alegria responded. \nSoto grabbed her hand. \n\u201cCome on, girl. I\u2019ll drag you if I have to,\u201d Soto told her. \nAlegria hobbled as fast as she could to a nearby street. Carmen Algeria was shot in the leg and is awaiting surgery. (Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times) \nAbout the same time, a man who looked to be in his early 20s pulled up in a gray pick-up truck. \n\u201cWho\u2019s hurt? Who\u2019s hurt?\u201d the man yelled out. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been shot,\u201d Alegria and Soto responded. \nTwo men lifted them onto the bed of the truck. \n\u201cOh my God. We\u2019re safe,\u201d Alegria thought to herself. \nThen more gunshots rang out. \nThe women scooted themselves closer to the truck\u2019s main cab and hid their heads under an attached toolbox. \nSoto recited the Rosary in Spanish. Alegria did the same in English. The women held on to each other. \nThey thought they were on their way straight to the hospital. Not so. The truck\u2019s driver stopped several more times, picking up people along the way. Men grabbed the injured \u2014 many of them women \u2014 lifting them into the bed of the truck with its tailgate down. \n\u201cBodies were literally being tossed on top of us,\u201d Alegria said. Each crushed her leg, delivering a piercing pain. \nShe counted eight people in the truck bed. Many were shot in the arm. A woman with a gunshot injury to her right eye lay limp on a man. There was a lot of blood. The spray of bullets continued. The truck sped toward Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center \u2014 and the sound of gunfire finally began to fade.

The staff already was reduced because of hurricane warnings, and officials did not say how many people subsequently left the country. \nTillerson said last week that 21 Americans were suffering symptoms, but the official who briefed reporters Tuesday said another American who fell ill in January was reexamined and added to the group. \nWashington and Havana reestablished full diplomatic ties just two years ago after half a century of hostilities. Speculation on the cause of the attacks has focused on a rogue operation by Cuban operatives or the work of a third nation. \nPresident Raul Castro has reportedly expressed alarm at the series of incidents, and Cuba's foreign minister toldTillerson in a meeting last last week that his country was not involved in the attacks and was trying to find the culprits. \nThe State Department official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said the 15 Cuban diplomats had seven days to leave. The State Department presented Cuban authorities with a list of names Tuesday. \nCuba \"must take more action\" in response to the attacks, the official said without specifying what actions he had in mind. \n\"Until the government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,\" Tillerson said.

At worst, you were complicit,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said during the hearing. \u201cEither way, you should be fired.\u201d\nJames Rufus Koren One year ago today, Wells Fargo & Co. made the stunning admission in a settlement with regulators that it created perhaps 2 million accounts for customers without their permission.\nThe disclosure ignited a scandal that led in a matter of weeks to the ouster of its chairman and chief executive,...\nOne year ago today, Wells Fargo & Co. made the stunning admission in a settlement with regulators that it created perhaps 2 million accounts for customers without their permission.\nThe disclosure ignited a scandal that led in a matter of weeks to the ouster of its chairman and chief executive,...\n(James Rufus Koren) Sloan, 57, replaced former CEO John Stumpf after he was ousted last October following two brutal Capitol Hill hearings held just weeks after the scandal broke.\nSince then, though, there has been a steady stream of new disclosures about wrongdoing in other business units.\nAmong them are allegations Wells Fargo improperly changed the terms of mortgage loans for bankrupt borrowers , signed up customers for unauthorized life insurance policies and overcharged small businesses for credit- and debit-card processing services.\nSen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the committee\u2019s ranking Democrat, seized on the bank\u2019s disclosure in July that it would pay $80 million in refunds to hundreds of thousands of vehicle-loan customers who were billed for auto insurance even though they had their own policies in place. Some even had their cars repossessed.\n\u201cThe board chose to limit the scope of the review to the community bank,\u201d he said at the hearing. \u201cIt should have known or should have wanted to know that other problems\u201d existed in other divisions.\nHowever, Sloan got some support Tuesday from Wells Fargo\u2019s single largest shareholder.\nIn an interview with CNBC, Berkshire Hathaway Chief Executive Warren Buffett said Sloan \u201chad my faith.\u201d He said the disclosures of other problems were only to be expected after Wells Fargo began a deeper investigation.\n\u201cYou turn over rocks and sometimes you find something,\u201d said Buffett, whose company owns 9.4% of Wells\u2019 outstanding shares. \u201cIt's very seldom there is just one thing going wrong at a big institution if something like that is going on.\u201d\nAs part of a $185-million settlement with regulators, Wells Fargo admitted in September 2016 that it created as many as 2.1 million checking, savings, credit card and other accounts without customer permission. A recent expanded audit showed that the estimated number of unauthorized accounts could be as high as 3.5 million.\nSloan, in his prepared remarks, said the bank has determined 190,000 customers incurred fees and charges and they are being reimbursed $6.1 million. The bank also has agreed to settle several class-action lawsuits over the matter for $142 million.\nSloan offered a mea culpa of sorts when asked by Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) if it was fair that he got a promotion and board members still were paid after the accounts scandal.\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken responsibility for mistakes made at the company,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cI\u2019m taking action in my role as CEO to make Wells Fargo a better bank than it was a year ago.\u201d\nIn his opening remarks, Sloan listed a number of reforms the bank has undertaken, including the elimination of product sales goals for retail bankers and the adoption of a new employee incentive program based on customer service performance.\nAlthough the two-hour committee hearing was tough, it was not nearly as contentious as the one last year that resulted in Stumpf\u2019s ouster.\nDuring that five-hour hearing, Stumpf faced aggressive questioning from a bipartisan group of senators who criticized his leadership and called for his resignation.\nCommittee members questioned the bank\u2019s commitment to not require customers to settle their disputes with the bank over unauthorized accounts through forced arbitration. The bank, like many financial institutions, requires customers to give up their right to sue when they sign up for personal accounts and other services.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) cited a current court case in which he said attorneys for the bank took the position that customers who had accounts opened without their permission were required to enter into arbitration.\n\u201cIf that is true, that directly contradicts your testimony,\u201d Van Hollen said.\nSloan said he was unaware of the bank\u2019s position in the case but promised he would look into it.\nArbitration has become a big issue on Capitol Hill after the Wells Fargo scandal. Critics have said the wrongdoing at the bank might have been disclosed earlier had customers not been forced into settling their disputes privately.\nThe class-action lawsuits against Wells Fargo were filed nonetheless \u2014 and settled by the bank \u2014 despite the arbitration clause, amid the heightened media scrutiny prompted by the scandal.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a regulation in July that would make it easier for customers to bring class-action lawsuits against banks and other financial institutions, but the GOP-controlled House voted to kill the regulation before it could take effect.\nA California bill that would prevent banks from using arbitration clauses to protect themselves from lawsuits over sham accounts is awaiting Gov. Jerry Brown \u2019s signature.\nThe union-backed Committee for Better Banks released a statement shortly after the hearing began, calling for legislation to prevent \u201cpredatory practices\u201d at banks.\n\u201cFar from moving past the scandal, Wells Fargo\u2019s list of misdeeds has grown exponentially,\u201d said Erin Mahoney, organizing coordinator for the group, an offshoot of the Communications Workers of America labor union. \u201cThe bank clearly has not learned its lesson.\u201d\nThe bank\u2019s pressure-cooker sales culture was first described in a 2013 Los Angeles Times investigation , which Warren referred to during her questioning. She noted that Sloan was interviewed for the report.\nWarren read back his Quote: to him \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any overbearing sales culture\u201d \u2014 and asked if he launched an investigation into the issue either after The Times interview or after the story laying out evidence of the scandal was published.\nSloan said The Times did not provide him with documentation, to which Warren responded, \u201cSo I take that as a no.\u201d\nSloan later said an internal bank review found problems in the Community Banking division, and the matter was elevated to the bank\u2019s senior leadership team the same year the article was published.\nStill, like Warren, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) also expressed doubt that Sloan was the right person to lead a turnaround at the beleaguered bank, noting he was unable to answer several questions posed by senators.\n\u201cI think anyone with an open mind would question whether we would see a culture change,\u201d she said.\nSloan told senators that the bank\u2019s consumer business has slowed since the accounts scandal became public, though employee turnover at Wells Fargo is down to its lowest point in 4&frac12; years.\nThe bank reported last year it fired 5,300 employees for violations of the company\u2019s sales practices. The bank has since rehired 1,780 employees \u201cwho left the bank during those years,\u201d according to a transcript of Sloan\u2019s prepared remarks.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not growing as fast as we were prior to last September, but we\u2019re on a good trajectory,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s because we have taken responsibility.\u201d\nShares of Wells Fargo rose 11 cents, or 0.2%, to $55.58 on Tuesday.\nsamantha.masunaga@latimes.com\nTwitter: @smasunaga", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "timothy sloan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john stumpf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sloan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sherrod brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael crapo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph lombardo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wells fargo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "housing and urban affairs committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ktla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clark county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:32:53.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b5db2be5b170f31a77b7f0fb6cf06005cb7f44b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4I_gXSAL.X_450jjsIJmx0xCU5kRywlzeWEiwuJgNd6eqgCED9fuzGx7xz3JElzmJ.qnzteqhYCMX8whZZTfpAO6E7zhlPPhQ--", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/local/columnone/rss2.0.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "'Thoughts and prayers' \u2014 and pantsfuls of NRA money: Why America can't control guns", "title_full": "'Thoughts and prayers' \u2014 and pantsfuls of NRA money: Why America can't control guns", "published": "2017-10-03T18:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d3aeb8/turbine/la-fi-hiltzik-nra-money-20171003", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2993, "comments": 0, "shares": 2993}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b5db2be5b170f31a77b7f0fb6cf06005cb7f44b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4I_gXSAL.X_450jjsIJmx0xCU5kRywlzeWEiwuJgNd6eqgCED9fuzGx7xz3JElzmJ.qnzteqhYCMX8whZZTfpAO6E7zhlPPhQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Hiltzik", "published": "2017-10-03T18:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Thoughts and prayers' \u2014 and pantsfuls of NRA money: Why America can't control guns", "text": "BUSINESS Michael Hiltzik \nThe gun rights organization spent a stupendous $54.4 million in the 2016 election cycle, almost all of it in \u201cindependent expenditures,\u201d meaning spending for or against a candidate but not a direct contribution to a campaign.

The organisms that cause those diseases can\u2019t tolerate changes in temperature or drying out over time, he said. \n\u201cUnless this guy smeared his semen on the flute and handed it to the kids right away, there\u2019s really not a risk of transferring anything,\u201d Schultz said. \nThe Health Care Agency suggested that concerned families consult their primary medical providers about an individual risk assessment. \nFountain Valley School District Supt. Mark Johnson said in an announcement last week that fifth-graders at Courreges Elementary received the potentially contaminated flutes in June through an independent contractor\u2019s music enrichment program called Flutes Across the World. \nCourreges is believed to be the only Fountain Valley school affected, Johnson said. \nFlutes Across the World came to Newport-Mesa through the district\u2019s partnership with the Segerstrom Center for the Arts, according to Newport-Mesa spokeswoman Annette Franco. \nThat partnership is on hold for the time being, she added. \nFlutes Across the World\u2019s website was down Monday. In an archived version of the site , the organization described itself as a nonprofit based in Ojai. \n\u201cWe understand that this is a deeply upsetting and difficult situation for our parents and that it may be frustrating to not have more details,\u201d Franco said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe are giving our impacted parents as much information as possible, without compromising the open and active investigation. \n\u201cPlease know that our priority and focus is to work closely with the impacted parents and to fully cooperate with law enforcement. We are waiting for direction from the law enforcement agencies on next steps, if any.\u201d \nFranco said a Sonora parent meeting was held Sunday and that another is scheduled for Monday. \nNewport-Mesa trustee Martha Fluor said federal authorities told the district that the suspect took the flutes home overnight and then returned them to students. \n\u201cWe take our students and their safety very seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s our utmost concern.\u201d \nThe U.S. Postal Inspection Service is leading the investigation with support from the California Department of Justice, according to the California attorney general\u2019s press office. \n\u201cAs part of the investigation, we are working with local law enforcement and school districts to collect instruments for the California Department of Justice to process,\u201d the press office said in a statement. \nIt isn\u2019t clear why the Postal Inspection Service launched the investigation. When asked for details, the agency said it doesn\u2019t comment about ongoing investigations. \nIn a statement Monday, the service said: \u201cProtecting children from crimes of sexual abuse and exploitation is a priority of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. We remain steadfast in our efforts to investigate, apprehend and assist in the prosecution of those who seek to exploit children.\u201d \nMembers of the Fountain Valley school board declined to comment directly to the Daily Pilot. A school administrator, speaking on behalf of the board, said Monday that the district had no information to add since Friday\u2019s announcement from Johnson.

Then it repeats itself.\" \nNoting that gun violence had been addressed previously on the show, he continued, \"I\u2019m not sure what else I can say. I also know nothing I say will make any difference at all. But to Congress, I would just like to say, are there no steps we can take as a nation to prevent gun violence? Or is this just how it is and how it\u2019s going to continue to be?\" \nHe challenged politicians to \"just be honest\" about their intentions, if those intentions were not to talk further about gun violence and not to take action. \n\"If it's going to be 'thoughts and prayers' from here on out,\" Meyers said, \"the least you can do is be honest about that.\" \nMeyers then gave a nod to the first responders in Las Vegas, drawing a round of applause from the studio audience.

Let's see how that's going", "text": "Amazon.com Inc. \u2019s takeover of Whole Foods Market began five weeks ago with a lot of fanfare about lower prices.\nAnd while the grocery chain has strategically marked down select items like avocados and almond milk, overall prices have dropped very slightly \u2014 about 1% \u2014 since Amazon took ownership, according to an analysis by research firm Gordon Haskett.\nThe firm tracked prices on 110 items over five weeks at a Whole Foods location in Princeton, N.J., and found that, on average, prices are down 1.2% since Amazon finalized its $13.7-billion purchase of the grocer. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns the Washington Post.)\nAnd although Amazon offered discounts on a number of items right away, some of those prices have crept back up, according to the data. The price of frozen foods, for example, was 7% higher on Sept. 26 than on Aug. 28, when Amazon officially took over. Snack items rose 5.3% in that period, and dairy and yogurt were up 2%. (Among categories where prices are lower: beverages, down about 2.8%; bread and bakery, down 6.8%; and produce, down 0.5%.)\nWhole Foods \u2014 nicknamed by some as \u201cwhole paycheck\u201d \u2014 has struggled for years to shed its reputation for overpricing. The company\u2019s prices have historically been about 15% higher than at the average grocery store, according to Morgan Stanley.\nAmazon seized on that long-standing customer complaint by announcing that its first move would be to cut prices. From the beginning, the company said customers would see a series of discounted staples at local stores: extra-large brown eggs for $3.19 instead of $3.49, organic apples for $1.99 a pound instead of $2.99 and Haas avocados for $1.49 apiece instead of $2.\nIt was no mistake, analysts said, that many of the markdowns were on everyday items that families tend to buy on a regular basis. The average shopper, they said, is more likely to notice a lower price on a carton of eggs than on a tin of anchovies.\n\u201cThe whole game is that you want the 100 most recognizable things \u2014 milk, apples, bananas \u2014 to be cheaper,\u201d said Jan Rogers Kniffen, an industry consultant and former department store executive. \u201cIf you can do that, you can build a perception that the whole store is competitively priced.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a model, he said, that Wal-Mart Stores Inc. , which is Amazon\u2019s biggest competitor in the grocery space, has fine-tuned over the years. And there are signs that the publicity surrounding the markdowns was enough for some customers to give Whole Foods another chance. Data from location-based app Foursquare found a 25% increase in shoppers in the days after the Amazon takeover.\n\u201cThe bottom line is, the lower prices got people into their stores,\u201d said Phil Lempert, a California-based food industry analyst known as the \u201csupermarket guru.\u201d \u201cPeople who hadn\u2019t been there in years were suddenly thinking, \u2018Maybe I should give it a try.\u2019 This was a clear sign to shoppers \u2014 and the industry \u2014 that Amazon is serious about fixing things up.\u201d\nThe Whole Foods deal already has been lucrative for Amazon. Since the takeover, Whole Foods has generated $1.6 million in sales through Amazon.com and its services, including Amazon Fresh and Prime Now, according to e-commerce analytics firm One Click Retail. (During the first week, Whole Foods products were so popular on Amazon that 93% of them sold out, according to One Click Retail.) Among the most popular purchases: turkey deli meat, coconut water and frozen vegetables.\nBut the data from Gordon Haskett also show that while some prices are lower, others have gone up. Of the 110 items the firm tracked, prices decreased for 17 items and increased for 16 items. The vast majority of prices \u2014 on 70% of the items \u2014 remained the same.\nThe items that were discounted, such as breads baked in house and selections from Whole Foods\u2019 private label brand 365, often have higher profit margins and more wiggle room for markdowns, Lempert said. Items such as frozen foods \u2014 a category where prices have climbed since Amazon took over \u2014 are harder to discount, he said, because they must be kept cold both in store and during transit.\n\u201cFrozen foods, which is a declining category anyway, uses the most energy of any department in the store,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier for Amazon to say, \u2018We\u2019ll charge less for bananas.\u2019 \u201d\nBut, industry analysts said, the grocery business is a notoriously difficult one with slim profit margins. Lowering prices in one area often means having to make up for those discounts elsewhere.\n\u201cLike all grocery stores, if prices are lowered someplace, prices are raised someplace else,\u201d said David J. Livingston, a supermarket analyst for DJL Research. \u201cJust like when a grocer claims to have lowered 5,000 prices. What they don\u2019t tell you is they raised prices on 45,000 items to pay for it.\u201d\nCAPTION Body camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1.\nBody camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1.\nCAPTION Body camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1.\nBody camera footage from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department taken during the shooting on Oct. 1.\nCAPTION The gunman who attacked the Las Vegas music festival had cameras set up outside his room.

Get his latest from the field and follow all our prep sports coverage and analysis here. Oct. 3, 2017, 9:00 a.m. Memories of LaVar, LaMelo Ball and the Ball brothers Eric Sondheimer \nIt's the end of an era now that LaVar Ball has decided to home-school his 16-year-old son, LaMelo, bringing to a close a run at Chino HIlls that was unlike any other I've witnessed in more than 40 years of covering high school sports. \nThe Chino Hills phenomena really took off when Lonzo Ball was a senior, brother LiAngelo was a junior and LaMelo started playing for Chino Hills during the summer as a 13-year-old freshman. Coach Steve Baik wasted no time and inserted him into the starting lineup. The results were stunning. The Ball brothers were unstoppable. They ran up and down the court nonstop. They shot from anywhere. They entertained like the Harlem Globetrotters. \nThat season, Chino Hills went 35-0. The Huskies blew out Mater Dei, 102-54. It was a social media circus. Anyone with a camera was showing up to games. The lines outside were long. The gyms were sold out. LaVar was talking and boasting and predicting, but the season was about winning a championship. Nothing else mattered. \nThen came last season. Lonzo was at UCLA. LaVar was putting together plans for Big Baller and dreams of his son playing for the Lakers. LiAngelo and LaMelo were at Chino Hills under a new coach, Stephen Gilling, who quickly got out of favor with LaVar. Chino Hills finished 30-3, but it was pretty disastrous from the perspective that people were upset on all sides. \nLaMelo scored 92 points in a game. But Chino Hills' embarrassing final play in the playoffs during regulation of an overtime loss against Mater Dei before a sold-out crowd at Galen Center revealed the dysfunction behind the scenes. \nThere was a timeout. Chino Hills supposedly set up a final play in a tie game. All LaMelo did was dribble out front until time almost ran out and fired up a wild shot that had no chance of going. It was stunning. It's a memory that will never go away for fans who were there. \nThen came the NBA draft, more hype, shoe talk and more shoe talk, a Facebook Live series, fancy cars, controversial statements and more. \nI've tried to never forget that LaMelo is only 16 and a junior in high school. He's a good player and will get a lot better. I'm disappointed he won't be playing high school basketball the next two years. He'll miss out on learning situations on and off the court that only come from playing with teammates and attending a regular high school. But I also believe he'll be fine. \nI support Chino Hills in that the new coach, Dennis Latimore, must do things his way. When a coach and parent have conflicts, they need to discuss and try to find a solution, but in the end, the coach is the coach. What he says goes. LaVar was never going to be satisfied with Latimore. \nThe Ball boys are great kids who have been raised by a father and mother who are clearly good parents. LaVar knows what he's doing. You can disagree with his antics, but he has been consistent. He wants his boys to be entertainers and basketball players. All three are doing just that. \nHigh school basketball in Southern California will move on. There are many elite players still left, but the Chino Hills years were something else. They'll never be duplicated. They were so fun to watch.

A typical comment on Twitter was: \u201cTrump said the Las Vegas shooter was a sick demented man[;] why not call him what he is a TERRORIST because that what he did he caused Terror.\u201d\nBut this isn\u2019t the standard definition of terrorism. That term is usually used to refer to mass violence committed to achieve a political or ideological end.\nThat tracks with legal definitions of terrorism cited by Vox . It\u2019s also notable that the FBI , on its website, has a page devoted to terrorism that refers to Islamic State fighters and \u201chomegrown violent extremists who may aspire to attack the United States from within.\u201d The obvious implication is that \u201cterrorism\u201d requires a political objective.\nSo far, no political or ideological motive has been identified for Stephen Paddock , who fired into a country music concert Sunday night in Las Vegas, killing at least 59 people and injuring 527 others.\nI suspect that the insistence on calling this abominable act terrorism can be explained by two factors. One is just linguistic slippage \u2014 for some people, \u201cterrorism\u201d has come to be a synonym for \u201cmass killing.\u201d That seems to be the case with the tweeter Quote: d above. The shooter caused terror; ergo, he\u2019s a terrorist.\nBut for others, especially those denouncing Trump for not using the word, this seems to be an extension of a pre-existing claim that Trump in particular and conservatives in general hype Islamic terrorism while ignoring or minimizing violence by right-wing terrorists who happen to be white (and who do fit the traditional definition of a terrorist as someone who commits violence for political ends; Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma City bomber, certainly was a terrorist).\nThere was an echo of the argument in an article by Bradley Burston in the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Quote: :\n\u201cThis is the man who, as a candidate, demanded, again and again and again, that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton condemn terrorism by Muslims. \u2018When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM,\u2019 he tweeted after the November, 2015 ISIS attacks in Paris. \u2018He can\u2019t say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved!\n\u201cNow we know for sure [Burston continues]. When it comes to terrorism by white American gun owners, Trump can\u2019t say it. And won\u2019t. He had his chance at a news conference on Monday morning. \u2018A gunman opened fire,\u2019 Trump began. A gunman, not a terrorist. It was an act of pure evil.\u2019 Evil \u2014 not terrorism. Of course not.\u201d\nMy problem with this argument is that the people Trump calls radical Islamic terrorists are animated by an ideology; we don\u2019t know that that\u2019s true of Paddock.\nBurston has an answer for that, however. He notes that Nevada state law defines \u201cacts of terrorism\u201d as \u201cany act that involves the use or attempted use of sabotage, coercion or violence which is intended to ... cause great bodily harm or death to the general population.\u201d (Andrew McCarthy, a columnist for the National Review, makes the same point about the broad Nevada statute here .)\nBut that definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d isn\u2019t what most people mean by the term. Certainly it\u2019s not the sort of politically motivated carnage that the Obama administration described as \u201cviolent extremism\u201d (angering conservatives who objected to having \u201cIslamic extremism\u201d lumped in with right-wing militia movements).\nIf it develops that Paddock was indeed motivated by a right-wing ideology, and Trump refuses to call the mayhem he committed terrorism, the president will deserve condemnation. Until then, the criticism seems unfair.\nTo read the article in Spanish, click here\n the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook\nALSO\nCharles McNulty: If we can\u2019t gather for a concert without fear for our lives, we are doomed\nEditorial: The slaughter in Las Vegas is all too familiar, yet Americans refuse to stop it\nAs initial shock fades, the Las Vegas massacre revives debate on gun control\nPrivacy Policy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "muslims", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "timothy mcveigh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bradley burston", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "haaretz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ktla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:00:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "170f9df0e75df952c95f1244067f39f32ab5d77b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn5LmwH8BXiBvfI11HVmI2GhrNEmg9UDw9j2LM5DnJwAwJvU.0oDFKRRZ7LOZy3lBoKiUjESkeA49XdbmuBZUmIbjfZYc.iwS.2uZWRadRFOXWtAN3rtzFXB8FK7EkU3TNQ--", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/features/home/rss2.0.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "The audience, under fire: Why survival of culture depends on protection from guns", "title_full": "The audience, under fire: Why survival of culture depends on protection from guns", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d3a2c6/turbine/la-et-cm-las-vegas-shooting-mcnulty-notebook-20171003", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1231, "comments": 0, "shares": 1231}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "170f9df0e75df952c95f1244067f39f32ab5d77b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn5LmwH8BXiBvfI11HVmI2GhrNEmg9UDw9j2LM5DnJwAwJvU.0oDFKRRZ7LOZy3lBoKiUjESkeA49XdbmuBZUmIbjfZYc.iwS.2uZWRadRFOXWtAN3rtzFXB8FK7EkU3TNQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Charles McNulty", "published": "2017-10-03T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The audience, under fire: Why survival of culture depends on protection from guns", "text": "ENTERTAINMENT ARTS & CULTURE hostage crisis of 2002 realized a fear spawned in the paranoid aftermath of 9/11. The growing list of attacks at nightclubs, concert venues and movie theaters since then has only made me more aware that at any instant a madman \u2014 and invariably it is a man \u2014 could turn a glorious communal ritual into a bloodbath.\nBut nothing could prevent me from going to the theater. I refuse to let terrorists \u2014 my definition includes domestic, foreign and the lone-wolf variety \u2014 dictate the terms of my life. And not because I\u2019m particularly courageous. I just can\u2019t accept a society that makes cultural attendance too fearful a prospect. \nSeeing a play, or listening to a concert or strolling through a gallery is as necessary to me as going to the market each week to buy groceries. We feed our minds and spirits as well our bodies. My way is theater. Yours might be movies, sports or church. It makes no difference. With gun regulation as irresponsibly lax as it is, we are all just a maniac away from being on the next casualty list.

The attack on that Las Vegas audience was an attack on civilization. If we can\u2019t gather for a concert without fear for our lives, we are doomed. Musicians give form to an inner reality that joins perfect strangers. That harmonious experience was brutally shattered by the cacophony of weapons no civilian should be able to possess. \nThe 2nd Amendment fanatics will feebly argue that good guys with guns are the antidote to bad guys with guns. That the right to keep and bear arms is inscribed in the Constitution (leaving out, of course, the \u201cwell regulated Militia\u201d part that no longer makes sense in modern day America). The NRA will do all it can to ensure that buying a Russian AK-47 assault rifle with bayonet is easier than obtaining a driver\u2019s license. \nBut lawmakers must act. The 2nd Amendment can\u2019t continue to supersede the 1st Amendment, which guarantees \u201cthe right of the people peaceably to assemble.\u201d The right, in other words, to be an American in a functioning democracy.

He made an oddly jovial reference to the cost of the recovery effort, telling assembled officials: \u201cI hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you threw our budget a little out of whack!\u201d\nThe president, who has previously drawn attention to the island\u2019s crippling debt and faltering infrastructure, then added: \u201cBut that\u2019s fine.\u201d\nTrump also referred favorably to the official death count on the island \u2014 16, but expected to rise \u2014 by comparing it to the fatality toll when Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans in 2005, killing an estimated 1,800 people.\n\u201c Sixteen people certified versus in the thousands,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can be very proud.\u201d\nPuerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello later announced that the number of deaths connected to the storm had risen from 16 to 34. Nineteen of the 34 were a direct result of the storm, the rest indirectly connected to the hurricane.\nSome residents welcomed Trump\u2019s visit as a sign that more aid was on the way, but were disturbed by earlier comments seen as disparaging of Puerto Ricans and their local leaders.\n\u201cHe needs to see the devastation. He needs to put his own thoughts and politics aside,\u201d said Divinia Marin, 55, whose home flooded during the storm.\nEarlier in the day, Rossello had pointed to nascent signs of recovery, but said he would seek to convey the enormous scope of the disaster to the visiting president.\n\u201cWe need more help,\u201d the governor told reporters in San Juan as Trump was en route. \u201cIt\u2019s 3.4 million U.S. citizens who we need to get that water, that food \u2014 we still need to do a lot more.\u201d\nAt Calvary Chapel church, Trump handed out supplies, drawing some smiles when he lobbed packaged paper towels into a cellphone camera-wielding crowd. \u201cThe job that\u2019s been done here is really nothing short of a miracle,\u201d he said.\nSome who hadn\u2019t gotten close to the president, though, worried whether he had gotten a message of urgent need.\nEfrain Rivera, 43, employed by the public works department in the hard-hit coastal city of Yabucoa, said he knew of half a dozen elderly people whose deaths he considered an indirect result of the storm.\n\u201cWe have received very little aid,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working to recover ourselves. We need medicine, oxygen to take care of people.\u201d\nWrapping up his nearly eight-hour visit with an aerial tour, the president flew by helicopter to a Navy ship offshore, the Kearsarge, where he shook hands with service members and met with the governor of the neighboring U.S. Virgin Islands, Kenneth Mapp, before boarding Air Force One for the return flight.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bLeaving Washington earlier Tuesday, Trump hailed his administration\u2019s recovery efforts in the territory, shrugging off criticism that the initial federal response was less robust than similar efforts when hurricanes struck Texas and Florida.\n\"It's now acknowledged what a great job we've done,\" Trump told reporters at the White House as he and First Lady Melania Trump prepared to depart for San Juan.\n\"In Texas and in Florida, we get an A-plus,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd I'll tell you what \u2014 I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico.\u201d\nCarolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrive in Puerto Rico. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump arrive in Puerto Rico. (Carolyn Cole / Los Angeles Times) During his visit, the president made a seeming attempt to back away from days of Twitter attacks on San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz \u2014 though upon arriving, he seemed to take a dig at her by praising Rossello, who has been careful to couple appeals for more aid with praise for the administration.\n\"Right from the beginning this governor did not play politics,\" Trump said in the hangar meeting, to applause.\nOver the weekend, Trump derided the mayor\u2019s \u201cpoor leadership\u201d and implied that Puerto Ricans were not doing enough to help themselves. He also indirectly slammed the mayor in a tweet decrying \u201cpolitically motivated ingrates\u201d who criticized the scope and scale of the initial relief effort.\nEmbarking on his trip, Trump said the mayor had \"come back a long way,\u201d though without detailing what in Cruz\u2019s stance had changed.\nThe mayor, who has made no direct response to Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks, was among those who shook hands with the president on his arrival, but she was not invited to speak during his initial talks.\nCruz said she met with Trump, along with the mayors of Ponce and Guaynabo, but said she wished he had seen more of the island\u2019s devastation. She said FEMA was slow to respond and the agency expected those applying for assistance to use the internet, although many lack electricity.\n\u201cThey need to adapt to the reality of the situation,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about life and death. It\u2019s an American value to come to the aid of those in need.\u201d\nShe urged Puerto Ricans to contact members of Congress to urge them to support an aid package for the island.\n\u201cThis has to do with people who are hungry, who need dialysis \u2026 there is a moral imperative to help Puerto Rico.\u201d\nFederally directed aid to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands has dramatically picked up in recent days. But critics point to initial slowness in waiving the Jones Act, which restricts foreign-flagged shipping in U.S. waters, coupled with a delay in appointing an on-the-ground military commander to coordinate relief and a lag in dispatching a Navy hospital vessel, the Comfort.\nOn a San Juan street corner, a half dozen cab drivers awaiting fares debated the significance of Trump\u2019s visit.\n\u201cHe needs to see the mountain areas\u201d where roads are still blocked and towns cut off, said Frankie Perez, 52. The others agreed. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to the bad areas,\u201d said Giovanni Maisonet, 39.\nBut Perez, whose own home was left darkened and sweltering by the power cutoff, was impressed that Trump come at all, especially given the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed at least 59 people.\n\u201cWe\u2019re struggling,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m for the military here -- they\u2019re doing a lot of good. But we need light. We\u2019re part of the US.\u201d\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.

He was a post office letter carrier in the 1970s, and after graduating from Cal State Northridge with a degree in business administration in 1977, he became an agent for the Internal Revenue Service, a job he held from 1978 to 1984. He then was employed as an auditor for the Defense Contract Audit Agency for a little over a year, federal personnel records showed.\nInspection of the weapons found at the scene of the shooting showed that at least 14 of the firearms had been legally modified with \u201cbump stock\u201d accessories that allow a shooter to fire rounds at a rapid pace, according to Jill A. Snyder, the special agent in charge of the San Francisco division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.\nPaddock owned at least 47 guns purchased in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas, and he brought at least 23 weapons, mostly rifles, to his hotel room, officials said.\nLombardo said authorities were hoping to talk soon with Paddock's girlfriend, Marilou Danley, who has been in the Philippines.\nA federal law enforcement official said investigators had discovered significant recent bank transfers to an account in the Philippines belonging to Danley. The Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Department said the FBI had filed a subpoena for financial records to trace Paddock\u2019s money.\nPaddock had a history of berating his girlfriend publicly, according to baristas at the Starbucks inside the Virgin River Casino in Mesquite, where the couple were frequent customers.\n\u201cIt happened a lot,\u201d Esperanza Mendoza, supervisor of the Starbucks, said Tuesday.\nPaddock\u2019s abuse would come when Danley asked to use his casino card to make the purchase, Mendoza said. The card enables gamblers to use credits earned on electronic gambling machines to pay for souvenirs or food at the casino.\n\u201cHe would glare down at her and say \u2014 with a mean attitude \u2014 \u2018You don\u2019t need my casino card for this. I\u2019m paying for your drink, just like I\u2019m paying for you.\u2019 Then she would softly say, \u2018OK\u2019 and step back behind him. He was so rude to her in front of us.\u201d\nIn addition to raiding the couple\u2019s home in Mesquite, police also raided their home in a retirement community in the rolling foothills outside Reno. Investigators recovered five handguns, two shotguns and ammunition there.\nNeighbor Susan Page, a retired financial analyst, rarely saw the couple. She said Paddock left the house for good sometime near the middle of August. She last saw Danley a week later, she said. Danley was packing up her car, piling things on the roof.\nCAPTION The girlfriend of the gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas has broken her silence.

General admission tickets are $150, while attending the VIP reception costs $1,000.Shapiro runs a website called the Daily Wire and previously worked at Breitbart News, although he's since become an outspoken critic of Stephen K. Bannon and President Trump. He was a frequent target of anti-Semitic harassment during last year's campaign.Shapiro also has provoked a backlash with his criticisms of the Black Lives Matter movement and discussion of gender identity . Hundreds of police, some in riot gear, provided security while he spoke on UC Berkeley's campus last month.The fundraiser is not Shapiro's only event in Sacramento on Tuesday. He also was invited by state Sen.

Mattis said today that maintaining the Iran nuclear deal is in the U.N. national security interest, staking out a position before President Trump decides whether to continue to certify Iran's compliance. \nThe White House faces a Oct. 15 deadline to recertifiy to Congress whether Iran is complying with the landmark 2015 accord, which blocked Iran's nuclear development program in exchange for easing international sanctions. \nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, has repeatedly determined that Iran has met its obligations under the accord. \nMattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that he supports upholding the agreement as long as the U.S. government can ensure that Iran is abiding by its obligations. \n\"The point I would make is that if we can confirm that Iran is living by the agreement, if we can determine that this is in our best interest, then clearly we should stay with it,\" he said. \"I believe at this point in time, absent indications to the contrary, it is something that the president should consider staying with.\" \nSen. Angus King (I-Maine) asked Mattis specifically whether he believed it was in the U.S. national security interest to remain with the deal. \n\"Yes, senator, I do,\" Mattis replied. \nTrump has recertified the deal twice since taking office in January, but has indicated that he might not this time. If the White House does not certify the deal, it opens the door for Congress to reimpose nuclear-related sanctions that were lifted once the deal was signed by the six world powers who negotiated it. \nTrump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal, making it a major part of his 2016 presidential campaign. Last month, he called the agreement \"an embarrassment to the United States\" during his debut speech to the United Nations General Assembly. \nHis main criticism is that the nuclear deal does not address Tehran's continued development of ballistic missiles, or its support for Hezbollah and other groups deemed \u201cterrorist organizations\u201d by the U.S. government and foreign allies. \nThe 2015 accord sought only to block Iran from building a nuclear weapon. The U.S. maintains separate economic sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program and its support for terrorist groups. \nBy most accounts, Iran has lived up to its end of the bargain. \nU.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said at the U.N. last month that Iran remains in \u201ctechnical compliance\u201d with the deal. A week later, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also said Tehran is in compliance. \n\u201cThe briefings I have received indicate that Iran is adhering to its JCPOA obligations,\u201d Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Sept. 26, using an acronym for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. \nDunford also warned that pulling out of the agreement, without hard evidence of Iran violating its commitments, would undercut the U.S. ability to negotiate other diplomatic deals \u2013 namely with nuclear-armed North Korea. \n\u201cIt makes sense to me that our holding up agreements that we have signed, unless there\u2019s a material breach, would have an impact on others\u2019 willingness to sign agreements,\u201d Dunford said. \nMattis, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, made the same argument at his Senate confirmation hearings in January. \n\u201cWhen America gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies,\" he said then.

Makeup looks were created by Val Garland, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 newly minted global makeup director, while St\u00e9phane Lancien, the brand\u2019s global hair director, crafted the coifs.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited and nervous,\u201d said Fonda backstage before the show, which she was to close wearing Balmain. \u201cI\u2019ve walked a runway once for charity, but I\u2019ve never done it [for] real. So I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to fall down,\u201d she added.\nFonda said it was an unexpected honor when L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris approached her to be the face of its Age Perfect skin-care line years ago. \u201cIt was a big surprise for someone who never particularly was thought of as a fashionable person,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m the oldest living skin-care brand ambassador ever in history,\u201d Fonda mused.\nHer schedule has been chockablock, having recently wrapped \u201cBook Club\u201d with Diane Keaton , Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen, in which she plays \u201cthe role of a very sexy woman, who was worried that her friends have given up on relationships and sensuality.\u201d\nFonda also stars in a just-released flick with Robert Redford, called \u201cOur Souls at Night.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s gotten very, very good reviews,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I\u2019m excited about that, and we start a fifth season of \u2018Grace and Frankie\u2019 in February.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just funny because I\u2019m really, really busy, and then there\u2019s this sudden little\u2026window of time to do this extraordinary thing out of the blue that\u2019s never happened before,\u201d continued Fonda, referring to the catwalk event. \u201cAnd I thought: Fine, let\u2019s do it. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s huge. When they first told me months ago, we want to do a fashion and beauty show on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, I was like \u2018yeah right, that\u2019s never going to happen,\u2019\u201d said Kroes backstage. \u201cThey did make it happen, and I still can\u2019t believe it. They\u2019re blocking off a whole street.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the very first time there has been such a show open to all on the most beautiful avenue in the world,\u201d explained L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris global brand president Pierre-Emmanuel Angeloglou. \u201cFor us it\u2019s very important because it corresponds to our mission as a brand, to bring the best in beauty to all, to make it accessible.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of nervous about it to be honest. It\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s the show of the season in a way,\u201d said Kebede beforehand, admitting she was excited to be walking with Fonda in particular. \u201cIt\u2019s a twist on the catwalk in a way, showing the importance of hair and makeup on runways, and this is an interesting way to [do] it.\u201d\nThe Ethiopian model and businesswoman, one of 17 L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris ambassadors taking part, said she appreciated the brand\u2019s inclusive approach, which extended to the diversity of models \u2014 professional or otherwise \u2014 walking the show.\nMarie-Ange Casta Marie-Ange Casta \u201cThey\u2019ve really understood that women come in all kinds of ways, and all kinds of shapes, and all kinds of colors and all kinds of genders. It\u2019s embracing that and saying that as a woman you\u2019re just beautiful,\u201d she said.\nJudging by their reception, it was a close tie between Fonda and Harlow when it came to the popularity stakes if the cheering was anything to go by.\nThe democratic approach was tangible on the runway, with models waving to fans and greeting each other as they shimmied down the 200-foot-long stage, while two giant screens broadcast their progress for members of the crowd who were too far away from the catwalk to see it clearly.\nSimultaneously, the event was transmitted online, including from L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris\u2019 social media platforms.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that they\u2019re making it democratic,\u201d said Haider Ackermann, among the designers involved in the project, with five looks from his fall 2016 collection showing. \u201cIt\u2019s very strange to be on the other side of things,\u201d he said of his front-row seat, however. \u201cI\u2019m more comfortable when I\u2019m backstage.\u201d\nOther front-row guests included Naomi Campbell, who slipped in at the last minute, and Balmain\u2019s Olivier Rousteing.\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy to be here and to enjoy the L\u2019Or\u00e9al family,\u201d said the designer, who on Thursday night feted Balmain\u2019s capsule lipstick line done in conjunction with L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris.\nAlso sitting by the runway were actresses Aymeline Valade and Marie-Ange Casta, and dance duo Laurent and Larry Bourgeois (aka Les Twins).\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to give the public the opportunity to participate in this kind of occasion. It doesn\u2019t happen often enough, and I\u2019m happy for them,\u201d said Casta. \u201cOrdinary people can never normally see this kind of thing, except on social media or the Internet, so it\u2019s great to allow them to participate in real life, it adds meaning to fashion.\u201d\n\u201cThe idea of the makeup for the show comes from the idea of irreverent [Parisian] chic,\u201d explained Garland, saying they came up with eight variations, including \u201cboho,\u201d \u201carty\u201d and \u201ccasual.\u201d That said, each woman modeling was to have her own iteration of the look.\nGarland used L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris from the past, like a colored lip gloss; present, including lipsticks from the tie-in with Balmain, and future. She couldn\u2019t divulge much about the latter, but teased: \u201cLet\u2019s say shine \u2014 shine in all its futurism. Shine covers liquid, covers metallic.\u201d\nHelen Mirren Helen Mirren A challenge was some of the quick makeovers needing to be done. \u201cWe\u2019ve got models that open the show, [then] appear a bit later in the show, so within 15 minutes we have to change looks,\u201d said Garland.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge, because we have five minutes to change,\u201d Lancien agreed. \u201cFor example, Doetzen opens the show, [with a] very cool look, very trendy, like Isabel Marant, and she finishes with Balmain, and Balmain is very glamorous, with a lot of makeup, beautiful shiny hair.\u201d\nFor Ungaro, Giambattista Valli and David Koma, Lancien created a French twist with a Bowie -esque front. \u201cI love the mix,\u201d he said. \u201cThe inspiration for this was the beautiful movie with Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie, \u2018The Hunger.\u2019\u201d\nFor Olivier Theyskens and Pallas, Lancien said he created something \u201cpure and graphic, with a lot of gel in the roots, and we keep the tips completely free. But to be more artistic, to give something interesting, we decided to paint the hair blue or pink with Colorista [hair color]\u2026just one strip on one side only to be more conceptual for these designers.\u201d\nSome 60 makeup artists and hairstylists worked behind the scenes on the looks, and then the runway event was followed by hair and makeup master classes led by Garland and Lancien.\nAlso nearby were four hair and makeup booths, where fans could check out products and get touch-ups.\nOther brands and designers involved in the project were AMI Alexandre Mattiussi, C\u00e9dric Charlier, Courr\u00e8ges, De Fursac, Ellery, Mulberry, Wanda Nylon and Pierre Hardy.\nAlex Wynne also contributed to this article.\nALSO\nBalmain, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris celebrate lipstick capsule collection\nOmega's Paris cocktail party marks debut of second-generation brand ambassadors Kaia and Presley Gerber\nGivenchy heads in a new direction \u2014 we're just not quite sure (yet) what it is", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jane fonda", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "helen mirren", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "catherine deneuve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "val garland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mary steenburgen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia rykiel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st\u00e9phane lancien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pallas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabel marant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l\u2019or\u00e9al paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert redford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lancien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de fursac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandre mattiussi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c\u00e9dric charlier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olivier theyskens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doutzen kroes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winnie harlow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candice bergen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kroes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david bowie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pierre-emmanuel angeloglou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marie-ange casta marie-ange casta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wanda nylon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex wynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chopard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fonda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane keaton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pierre hardy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "l\u2019or\u00e9al paris", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "liya kebede", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kebede", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "balmain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:32:44.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f233b2e79a274dbce767ff9b0723cbd2b7c17e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hbRPmlFzFb1afmmAJ39qNKt8u.2OTa8sUZPEEkhq_77A8qM8rW83MLzO1UUuf1F.WoEckyGUvSsyk-", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/features/home/rss2.0.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "Chuck Low, Robert De Niro's landlord who landed gruesome role in 'Goodfellas,' dies at 89", "title_full": "Chuck Low, Robert De Niro's landlord who landed gruesome role in 'Goodfellas,' dies at 89", "published": "2017-10-03T21:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d3d524/turbine/la-me-chuck-low-20171003", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 93, "comments": 0, "shares": 93}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f233b2e79a274dbce767ff9b0723cbd2b7c17e4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hbRPmlFzFb1afmmAJ39qNKt8u.2OTa8sUZPEEkhq_77A8qM8rW83MLzO1UUuf1F.WoEckyGUvSsyk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Associated Press", "published": "2017-10-03T21:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chuck Low, Robert De Niro's landlord who landed gruesome role in 'Goodfellas,' dies at 89", "text": "A real estate developer whose friendship with Robert De Niro led him to an acting career that included a notable appearance in \"Goodfellas\" has died.

The Los Angeles Times\u2019 editorial points the finger at National Rifle Assn. \u2019s enormous influence. (\u201c The slaughter in Las Vegas is all too familiar, yet Americans refuse to stop it ,\u201d editorial, Oct. 2)\nI have a simple proposal to counter that influence: Those who oppose the NRA\u2019s lobbying should offer to match that group\u2019s contribution to any politician\u2019s campaign on the condition that the candidate support gun-control legislation. I am confident that many millionaires and billionaires would donate to the cause.\nMost of the politicians who depend on campaign contributions from the gun lobby should have the courage and conviction to do what is best for the country. No other civilized country in the world loses so many of its citizens to senseless shootings.\nIf money talks in democracy, then two can play this game. Simply expressing outrage over inaction in Congress is not going to make any difference.\nVijay Jeste, Redondo Beach\n..\nTo the editor: If only the guy on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel had used a silencer, nobody would have heard him. He could have shot many more people and perhaps made his escape undetected. He might have been a free man today. Instead, he\u2019s dead.\nTo paraphrase Barry Goldwater, \u201cCollateral damage in defense of the 2nd Amendment is no vice.\u201d \u2014 Bruce Strathdee, Palm Desert We need public access to silencers. And low-yield nuclear weapons, especially for those moments when you\u2019re more than just irritated.\nIf all those concertgoers had each carried their own submachine gun, they could have laid down withering return fire that would have taken out every window of the Mandalay Bay hotel. To paraphrase Barry Goldwater, \u201cCollateral damage in defense of the 2nd Amendment is no vice.\u201d\nAs a country I think we\u2019ve already traveled most of the way to the loony bin. Now, somebody has to make it to 60, so stay low.\nBruce Strathdee, Palm Desert\n..\nTo the editor: Hillary Clinton called out the NRA for opposing restrictions on silencers. MSNBC host Rachel Maddow pointed out that fully automatic assault rifles are legal. Liberal politicians quickly called for stricter gun controls.\nSilencers are irrelevant to this tragedy. It has been illegal to manufacture fully automatic assault rifles since 1986. I doubt the Las Vegas shooter went to the considerable expense and hassle to obtain legal assault rifles. Gun control laws would not reduce the illegal weapons trade and have certainly not reduced gun violence in the major cities where they are in place.\nLet\u2019s have a discussion about sensible solutions and not knee-jerk, ineffective grandstanding. The detestable killer owned numerous legally acquired weapons. He brought an arsenal into a hotel undetected. I would not be surprised to learn that he suffered from mental health issues.\nConnect the dots and take appropriate action.\nHal Bookbinder, Oak Park\nPlease fill in your full name, mailing address, city of residence, phone number and e-mail address below.

(Pavel Golovkin / Associated Press) \nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Tuesday that he hopes the new U.S. ambassador, Jon Huntsman, will cooperate with the Kremlin to improve relations between Washington and Moscow, but emphasized that cooperation should be based on \"principles of equality, respect for national interests, and non-interference in internal affairs.\u201d \nPutin told the new ambassador that bilateral relations with the United States \u201cat their current level cannot be viewed as satisfactory.\u201d \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed the deteriorating relationship on \u201cthe damage caused by Washington's actions.\u201d \nPutin \u201chas stressed more than once that, unfortunately, it is impossible to put such intentions into practice acting on one's own, without a partner,\" Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. \"There have been certain problems with reciprocity so far.\u201d \nHuntsman presented his credentials to Putin in a formal ceremony at the Kremlin. \nThe former Utah governor arrived in Russia at a time when U.S.-Russia relations are at their lowest point since the Cold War. \nU.S. investigations into accusations that the Kremlin tried to influence the 2016 presidential elections in favor of President Trump have increased tensions between the two countries. The Kremlin denies the accusations, calling the investigation part of a growing \u201cRussophobia\u201d initiated by the Obama administration. \nBut the deterioration in relations has clouded efforts by Russia and the U.S. to find compromises and solutions to global issues such as North Korea, Ukraine and Syria. \nIn the past several months, Washington and Moscow have engaged in a diplomatic row that has resulted in a tit-for-tat series of demands that each side reduce in-country diplomatic staff and facilities. In January, before leaving office, President Obama expelled 35 Russian intelligence officers and seized two Russian diplomatic compounds. The Kremlin retaliated in July by demanding that the U.S. reduce its diplomatic mission in Russia by more than 750 and seized an embassy warehouse and weekend cottage compound. The following month, the U.S. ordered the closure of the Russian consulate in San Francisco. \nHuntsman's appointment as ambassador to Russia was confirmed by Congress last week.

Josh Newman defends against Howard Jarvis group lawsuit Patrick McGreevy State Sen. Josh Newman (Rich Pedroncelli / Associated Press) \nA court filing on behalf of state Sen. Josh Newman said that the California Legislature acted properly in adopting new rules for a recall campaign against him, and it charged a lawsuit challenging the rules is politically motivated. \nRepublican activists said they launched the recall because Newman, a Democrat from Fullerton, voted to raise gas taxes. \nThe Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. filed a lawsuit alleging it was improper for the Legislature to retroactively require a recall campaign against Newman to go through additional steps, including a financial analysis of the election and a period during which people can remove their signatures from petitions. \n\"These newly enacted provisions may have upset HJTA's plan for a quick election, but they were nevertheless within the specific authority conferred on the Legislature to regulate recall elections,\" said the filing by Newman\u2019s attorneys Monday in the state Court of Appeal. \nNewman\u2019s filing said the recall was launched \u201cnot because of anything he did in particular, but because his election in November 2016 was by the narrowest margin in the state, and was therefore considered the best prospect for 'breaking' the current (Democratic) supermajority in the California State Legislature.\u201d \nThe taxpayer group now gets a chance to file its arguments in the case against the Legislature\u2019s rule change, which the court put on hold pending a final decision.

So open enrollment in California this season \u2014 which begins Nov. 1 and runs through Jan. 31 \u2014 comes with an unprecedented edge of unease.\nDave Jones, California\u2019s health insurance commissioner, does not attempt to sugarcoat the effect that so much heated rhetoric has had on the task of getting insurance companies to offer affordable rates to consumers, especially in the private health insurance market now dominated by the Covered California health insurance exchange. \n\u201cThis has been the most unstable and challenged health insurance market in my tenure as a public servant,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe degree of uncertainty and instability that the Trump administration has injected into the market this year cannot be understated.\u201d \nThat turmoil has most directly affected the 1.4 million Californians who buy exchange plans and about 1 million more estimated to purchase individual coverage plans off-exchange. \nIt is this group, plus 3.8 million California adults enrolled in Medi-Cal since it was expanded in 2014, whose coverage has been the subject of political debate for several years. \nWhile attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have failed, there are still several steps the president could take to undermine the controversial program. \nAlready the new administration has said it would not enforce the penalties assessed for those who don\u2019t buy health insurance. And Trump\u2019s decision to target out-of-pocket cost-reducing payments to insurance companies also introduced a fair bit of volatility. \nThere has also been talk that the federal government will not support outreach efforts to some types of potential policyholders, especially those in Latino communities. Enrollment there is often seen as critical to bringing in enough healthy people to offset the costs incurred by older and sicker Americans who are much more likely to sign up for coverage. \nOn Aug. 1, Peter Lee, Covered California\u2019s director, said the average increase for exchange plan premiums in 2018 will be 12.5%. He attributed about 3% of that bump to insurance company uncertainty about whether or not the new administration will undermine existing Affordable Care Act programs. \nIn some cases, Lee said, policyholders will be able to limit their premium hikes to less than 4% by moving into a different plan within their home market. In Los Angeles, seven carriers are offering plans. Premium increases in the region range from 10% in Orange County to 13% in Los Angeles. \nOf course, the individual healthcare market is only a small fraction \u2014 about 9% in California \u2014 of the overall health insurance pie. The largest segment, representing 45% of all Californians in 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, get their coverage from an employer. Those plans generally hold enrollment in the fall. \nAn additional 38% is enrolled in a government program such as Medicare and Medi-Cal. \nIt\u2019s a little harder to peg just how much premiums for employer-sponsored plans will increase in 2018. \nEvery year the National Business Group on Health surveys large employers nationwide to get a sense of how much costs will increase in the coming year. This time around, the nonprofit announced that costs were up about 5%, a number that should roughly translate to the premium increase that employees of large companies will see in 2018, according to Brian Marcotte, the business group\u2019s president and chief executive. \nA separate survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust found that premiums for employer plans rose 3% this year, to an average $18,764. That cost is usually divided between employers and workers. \nMarcotte said employers are continuing strategies that have gradually come to the fore over the last few years to contain healthcare costs as much as possible. Most companies, he said, are building in income-based premiums for employees. Gone are the days when the premium list was the same for everyone on the payroll. \n\u201cThat means if you make more, you end up paying a higher monthly premium,\u201d Marcotte said. \nAnd there has also been a big increase in the number of employers offering \u201cself-directed health plans\u201d that combine high deductibles with special health savings accounts that the employer funds to help defray costs. The average contribution, Marcotte said, is $650 per year for an individual and $1,000 per family. Average deductibles for these plans, he added, are $1,500 per individual and $3,250 per year for family coverage. \n\u201cToday we have 90% of large employers offering self-directed plans with attached health savings accounts and 40% are offering these as their only option in 2018,\u201d Marcotte said.

We've saved a lot of lives.\u201d\nThe revelation of an actual budget comes as a surprise, given that it wasn\u2019t mentioned by Trump, other administration officials or top congressional Republicans when they unveiled their outline last week for blockbuster tax cuts for businesses and individuals. In fact, there wasn\u2019t even an estimate of the cuts\u2019 cost \u2014 that detail (among many others) was left to Congress.\nOne nonpartisan group, the Tax Policy Center, offered its own estimate of the cost: $2.4 trillion over the coming decade, and $3.2 trillion in the decade after that. Backers of the outline said the center\u2019s work had no credibility because it used guesswork to fill in important blanks and it ignored the economic growth the cuts would unleash. Maybe so, but the point, again, is that top Republicans are promoting a Brobdingnagian tax cut without any apparent concern for how much revenue it would sacrifice.\nLet\u2019s be honest, the federal government does a terrible job preparing fiscally for disasters. If one is constrained by a budget, one would worry about that sort of thing. But the federal government is free to operate in the red \u2014 as it has every year since the late 1990s, when it briefly ran budget surpluses. (Even those surpluses may not have been real, if you factor in the money borrowed from a fund for future Social Security benefits.) And the only people who complain about deficits are those who are out of power (currently Democrats) or who aren\u2019t being helped by the spending (e.g., compare how Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas felt about budget-busting disaster aid after Hurricane Sandy hit the Northeast with his support for aid after Hurricane Harvey hit his own state).\nLet\u2019s be honest, the federal government does a terrible job preparing fiscally for disasters. Rather than approaching catastrophes the way an insurance company would, it basically waits for them to happen, then opens its checkbook. The annual budget for the Federal Emergency Management Agency is a joke. The national flood insurance program is based on actuarial fantasies.\nBut once you\u2019ve made that your approach, it\u2019s churlish to bring up budgets when disasters happen. And it\u2019s particularly galling to do so while your administration is trying to push a gigantic tax cut through Congress.\nConsidering the source, the \u201cyou\u2019ve thrown our budget a little out of whack\u201d line was probably just a throwaway attempt at humor, a little teasing by the Troller in Chief. And in fairness, Trump has occasionally shown interest in shrinking the deficit \u2014 witness his support for slowing the growth in Medicaid spending. I\u2019d add in the cuts his administration proposed to the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency and an array of domestic programs, but those were offset by a huge proposed increase in defense spending.\nStill, Puerto Rico was so hammered by Hurricane Maria that many of its residents may go weeks or months without clean water and electricity. These U.S. citizens didn\u2019t throw the federal budget out of whack any more than the residents of Houston did. That\u2019s the storms\u2019 fault. Trump\u2019s job now is to help get them all back on their feet. And if he\u2019s bothered by the cost, he should come up with a better financial approach to catastrophic events than the one we\u2019ve been using for decades.\nCAPTION The Senate moved closer to a rare bipartisan deal to fix parts of Obamacare.\nRoy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, has resigned following allegations of sexual harassment.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from the World Series.\nA Hawaii federal judge has blocked major parts of the Trump\u2019s newest travel ban.\nThe Senate moved closer to a rare bipartisan deal to fix parts of Obamacare.\nRoy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, has resigned following allegations of sexual harassment.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from the World Series.\nA Hawaii federal judge has blocked major parts of the Trump\u2019s newest travel ban.\nCAPTION The Senate moved closer to a rare bipartisan deal to fix parts of Obamacare.\nRoy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, has resigned following allegations of sexual harassment.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from the World Series.\nA Hawaii federal judge has blocked major parts of the Trump\u2019s newest travel ban.\nThe Senate moved closer to a rare bipartisan deal to fix parts of Obamacare.\nRoy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, has resigned following allegations of sexual harassment.\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are one win away from the World Series.\nA Hawaii federal judge has blocked major parts of the Trump\u2019s newest travel ban.\nCAPTION The Northern California fires have raised questions about utility companies and their equipment.

(Eric Risberg / AP) The judge overseeing the Waymo-Uber trial over allegations of the theft of trade secrets agreed to postpone the start until Dec. 4 \u2014 but not before telling lawyers from both companies he doesn't trust any of them. \n\"Despite the excellent quality of the lawyers here, I cannot trust what they say,\" U.S. District Judge William Alsup said Tuesday at the hearing in San Francisco. \nCourt documents are filled with \"a lot of half-truth, a lot of honest argument that is not quite accurate and overstatements. It's hard to get anywhere,\" the judge said. \nThe high-stakes trial was scheduled to begin Oct. 10 before Waymo asked for a delay. Advertisement \nGoogle has said that engineer Anthony Levandowski stole 14,000 internal documents as he left the company to found his own self-driving truck company, known as Otto. Six months after he left what is now Waymo, the self-driving arm of Google, Uber bought Otto in August 2016 for $680 million and named Levandowski head of its self-driving car project. \nWaymo says Uber is using trade secrets contained in some of those documents in Uber's own autonomous driving systems. \nUber denies those claims and has testified that Levandowski did not pass along any data from Google. \nAt Tuesday's hearing, Alsup said Waymo \"still has a very strong case against Levandowski\" but implied that proving a trade secrets violation remains an uphill climb. \"This is not the home run they were expecting to find,\" he said. Advertisement \nUnder its contract with Levandowski, Google cannot sue him in civil court on the theft allegations, and instead must turn to arbitration. Thus far, the company has chosen not to go that route. \nWaymo had asked the court for a continuance to review a \"mountain\" of documents related to the case only recently released under a separate court order. The documents are drawn from a report drafted by risk management firm Stroz Friedberg, which Uber hired to conduct due diligence on Levandowski and Otto before Uber acquired the company. \nThe report, parts of which became public Tuesday, states that Levandowski continued to possess downloaded Google data even after he left the company. Waymo lawyers say the report shows that Uber executives knew Levandowski had the material before the Otto acquisition. \nIf Levandowski were on trial, the evidence would appear to be damning. However, Waymo is suing Uber, not Levandowski. It must prove that Uber possessed Waymo trade secrets, or used them in its own self-driving technology, or both. \nIn reluctantly agreeing to the continuance, Alsup made clear the new schedule was set in stone and would not be changed. \nWhen Arturo Gonzalez, Uber's lead lawyer, told the judge he had a conflict with jury selection in another trial, Alsup told him, \"Too bad.\" \nThe stakes in the case are high, at least for the businesses involved. Until recently, self-driving cars were considered a science-fiction dream. But the technology has developed faster than anyone expected, and fully autonomous vehicles already are being tested on public highways. Commercial versions are expected to hit the market early next decade. As the industry grows, annual revenue is expected to total tens and perhaps hundreds of billions of dollars. \nThe Waymo-Uber case centers on lidar, a technology that bounces laser beams off objects to determine their appearance in fine detail. Lidar works with optical cameras, radar, ultrasound and other sensors to give the self-driving car a \"map\" of the world around it. Car companies see lidar as an essential component in autonomous vehicles. One exception is Tesla, whose chief executive, Elon Musk, has said lidar is unnecessary. \nThe technology is expensive. Companies that can improve lidar performance while bringing costs down are most likely to grab a major chunk of the emerging market.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "levandowski", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "arturo gonzalez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waymo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tesla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alsop", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elon musk", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:11:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "057a5c83a664edd4f8715a585d7d26439d4bc91c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn1T8G79Me5erVYSe50Gjg1Yk.8mXg1b0U3vJW1gD7Lzg15dmIH7dkCrJuEriXav6WgVrhrzUv0N204DWNQ8qcrYDcu0yp9i9Wxm9NWGMbk3zx3Yxff7J4B3gsyJIwBZqgFyOJag3.ptt_PyQJc6S4ug-", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/rss2.0.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "Shock in Reno: Oh my god, it's my next door neighbor'", "title_full": "Shock in Reno: Oh my god, it's my next door neighbor'", "published": "2017-10-03T23:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d3faae/turbine/la-las-vegas-shooting-live-updates-shock-in-reno-oh-my-god-it-s-my-1507064326", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 125, "comments": 0, "shares": 125}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "057a5c83a664edd4f8715a585d7d26439d4bc91c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn1T8G79Me5erVYSe50Gjg1Yk.8mXg1b0U3vJW1gD7Lzg15dmIH7dkCrJuEriXav6WgVrhrzUv0N204DWNQ8qcrYDcu0yp9i9Wxm9NWGMbk3zx3Yxff7J4B3gsyJIwBZqgFyOJag3.ptt_PyQJc6S4ug-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Mather", "published": "2017-10-03T23:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Shock in Reno: Oh my god, it's my next door neighbor'", "text": "Las Vegas shooting updates: Portraits of the victims emerge Oct. 3, 2017, 5:15 p.m. \nAt least 59 people were killed and more than 500 others injured after a gunman opened fire Sunday night at a country music festival across the street from the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip, authorities said. \nWhat you need to know: The mystery of Stephen Paddock -- gambler, real estate investor, mass killer Who were the victims ?

(Kate Mather / Los Angeles Times) \nIt was a quiet Tuesday morning in the manicured retirement community nestled in the rolling foothills on the outskirts of Reno where Stephen Paddock and Marilou Danley lived \u2014 a scene vastly different than it was 24 hours ago. \nNeighbors recounted the armored vehicles parked on the street, the men in tactical gear, the bomb squad robot rolling up the street, and the questions they were asked by FBI agents about a reclusive couple no one seems to know much about. \nSusan Page, a retired financial analyst, learned the Las Vegas shooter lived in the neighborhood after she was called by a television network Monday. She didn't even know Paddock's name, she said \u2014 the reporter only asked who lived at the address. \n\"Oh my God,\" she said she thought. \"It's my next-door neighbor.\" \nPublic records showed Paddock bought the house in 2013, a tidy, tan-and-brown home in a neighborhood with wide, clean streets, crisp air and sweeping mountain views. A faded welcome mat sat outside the front door, not far from a porch swing. The only out-of-place things about the home were dark tire tracks in the driveway and a small light knocked over along the walkway. \nLike others who live along Del Webb Parkway, Page said she barely spoke to the couple. In the 2 1/2 months since she moved in, she said, she saw them maybe half a dozen times in the driveway. \nPage said Paddock left the house for good sometime in mid-August. She last saw Danley a week later, she said. Danley was packing up her car, piling things on the roof. Maybe she's going camping, Page remembered thinking. \nShe never saw her neighbors again. \nBrent Webb, a retired high school administrator, is acknowledged in the neighborhood for knowing just about everybody, thanks to his walks with his dog, Barney. Webb said in the five years that he's lived just a few houses down from Paddock, he only saw the man once, driving out of his driveway. \nHe said he saw Danley just a few more times, picking weeds in the garden. She'd say hello and ask about the dog, Webb said, but that was the extent of their conversation. \n\"They gave no indication they'd be involved in anything like this,\" he said. \"'Course, nobody knew them.\" \nAnother neighbor, Roy Miller, said he knew something was amiss when he walked out Monday morning, getting ready to run some errands.

On Tuesday, he indicated that he had ordered 15 Cuban diplomats to leave their embassy in Washington within one week to keep the two missions the same size.\n\"This order will ensure equity in our respective diplomatic operations,\" Tillerson said in a statement. He said he was acting due to Cuba\u2019s \u201cfailure to take appropriate steps to protect our diplomats\u201d in accordance with international law.\nTillerson and other officials insisted the expulsions did not reduce U.S. diplomatic relations with Havana, which were only restored in 2015 after more than half a century, and U.S. officials took pains not to accuse Cuba of causing the illnesses.\nCuban officials were angered, calling the expulsions unfair and unwarranted.\nIn Havana, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said Cuba \"strongly protests and condemns this unfounded and unacceptable decision.\"\nCuba \u201chas never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any sort against diplomatic officials or their relatives, without any exception.\" Rodriguez said in a statement. \"Neither has it ever allowed nor will it ever allow its territory to be used by third parties with that purpose.\"\n\u201cWe think this decision is hasty and will affect bilateral relations,\u201d said Josefina Vidal, head of American affairs for the Cuban Foreign Ministry and a key diplomat in restoring ties between the two countries.\nShe said Cuba had rigorously participated in finding the causes of the ailments, and the expulsions seemed to prejudge the investigation.\nSome U.S. officials have speculated that the attacks are the work of a rogue Cuban operatives seeking to wreck relations with the U.S., or that of a third nation.\nU.S. officials initially suspected that sophisticated acoustic devices were used to aim damaging sound waves at Americans. But no such devices were found and the U.S. Embassy in Havana no longer considers that a likely cause.\nTillerson said last week that 21 U.S. Embassy personnel had been affected, but a senior State Department official said Tuesday that another American who fell ill in January was reexamined and added to the group.\nThe State Department official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said the 15 Cuban diplomats had seven days to leave. U.S. officials presented Cuban authorities with a list of names Tuesday, he said.\nCuba \"must take more action\" in response to the attacks, the official said without specifying what action was required.\nHeather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said the 15 were chosen because their functions related generally to the functions of the American diplomats who had to leave Cuba. None were publicly identified.\nU.S. officials refused to say how many Americans are left at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, but it\u2019s believed to be fewer than 30.\nSeveral Republican lawmakers had sharply criticized Tillerson last week for not expelling Cuban diplomats, blaming the government in Havana for the unusual ailments.\nState Department officials first disclosed what they called incidents this summer, but the announcement on Friday described them for the first time as \u201cspecific attacks\u201d that targeted U.S. officials.\nThey began last year and continued as recently as August, according to U.S. officials.\nSince restoring relations, Washington and Havana have cooperated on several regional issues, enjoyed increased trade and a tourism boom. President Trump has tightened some regulations but has largely left the rapprochement intact.\nSeveral experts and organizations that work with Cuba said expelling diplomats would be counterproductive.\n\u201cThe more we escalate tensions with Cuba, the harder it will be to solve this mystery,\u201d said Daniel Erikson, who specialized in Latin America in the Obama White House and now is managing director of Blue Star Strategies, a consulting firm. \u201cThey should be taking steps to investigate,\u201d not walk away, he said.\nCAPTION Los Angeles Times reporters Andy McCullough and Dylan Hernandez talk sweep and what is next for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.\nLos Angeles Times reporters Andy McCullough and Dylan Hernandez talk sweep and what is next for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.\nCAPTION Los Angeles Times reporters Andy McCullough and Dylan Hernandez talk sweep and what is next for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.\nLos Angeles Times reporters Andy McCullough and Dylan Hernandez talk sweep and what is next for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NLCS.\nCAPTION The Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks 3-1 in Game 3 of the National League division series on Monday to advance to the National League Championship Series.\nThe Dodgers beat the Diamondbacks 3-1 in Game 3 of the National League division series on Monday to advance to the National League Championship Series.\nCAPTION Firefighters responded Monday morning to a brush fire that broke out in Anaheim Hills, prompting some mandatory evacations.\nFirefighters responded Monday morning to a brush fire that broke out in Anaheim Hills, prompting some mandatory evacations.\nCAPTION Film impresario Harvey Weinstein has been forced out of his company.

Of major automakers, only Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai reported sales declines.\nIndustry analysts predicted that positive sales would continue through the end of the year, fueled by customers whose cars were destroyed by Harvey and Hurricane Irma in Florida. But sales aren't expected to be strong enough to match last year's record of more than 17.5 million.\nChristopher Hopson, manager of light-vehicle forecasting for IHS Markit, said September had a perfect mix of hurricane replacement demand, high incentives, rising fleet sales and strong sales of outgoing 2017 models.\nGM reported on Tuesday that sales rose 11.9% from a year ago, while Ford sales rose 8.7%. Toyota posted a 14.9% increase, while Nissan sales were up 9.5% and Honda sales rose 6.8%. Volkswagen said its sales rose 33.2% over numbers that were depressed a year ago by its diesel emissions cheating scandal.\nFiat Chrysler sales fell 10% and Hyundai, which relies on cars for much of its results rather than SUVs and trucks, saw sales fall 14.4%. Both blamed reductions in sales to big fleet buyers such as rental car companies.\nIndustry analysts had predicted a small sales rise for the month. But automakers, aided by hurricane sales, powered past the forecasts. For the first nine months of the year, overall industry sales were down 1.8%.\nFord gained 5,000 to 6,000 sales in September from replacement of flooded cars in the Houston area, where it offered employee pricing. But it lost about 1,000 vehicle sales in Florida due to closed dealerships, Vice President of Sales and Marketing Mark LaNeve said on a conference call. He said he expects industry sales to get a boost through the rest of the year from cars being replaced due to hurricane damage.\nStrong pickup truck and SUV sales propelled the September increase. Ford's F-Series pickup sales rose 21% from a year ago, while SUV sales were up 8.8%. Inventory levels dropped to a 72-day supply, and LaNeve said Ford may even increase production to raise that a little. Automakers have been trimming production, especially of cars, for much of the year.\nEven car sales, which have been battered during the past few years as buyers switched to SUVs and trucks, showed a bit of life. Toyota's midsize Camry posted a 13% sales gain as all-new 2018 models reached showrooms.\nPrivacy Policy", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:33:43.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "841bf427198b4890bdc311a1698cc4e981023047", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hb9q0ZxW2ul5eilXUrc9O5Ls.zKz8eYmW0bwZy5rt7hLwplaq482iXVLCaJlWbo3FESYwTuImllT4P6uj_3xtwXBAlh4O8SQKopIbAmE2Ieq8hnOmgAFFyn__aFubwaaZT", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/rss2.0.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "Matchups finalized for Rolling Hills Prep State Preview Classic", "title_full": "Matchups finalized for Rolling Hills Prep State Preview Classic", "published": "2017-10-04T00:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56fd643a/turbine/la-l-a-times-logo-20160331/600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "841bf427198b4890bdc311a1698cc4e981023047", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hb9q0ZxW2ul5eilXUrc9O5Ls.zKz8eYmW0bwZy5rt7hLwplaq482iXVLCaJlWbo3FESYwTuImllT4P6uj_3xtwXBAlh4O8SQKopIbAmE2Ieq8hnOmgAFFyn__aFubwaaZT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Eric Sondheimer", "published": "2017-10-04T00:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Matchups finalized for Rolling Hills Prep State Preview Classic", "text": "Varsity Times Insider: The latest sports news from Southern California's high school teams Oct. 3, 2017, 2:26 p.m. \nEric Sondheimer has been covering high school sports for the Los Angeles Times since 1997 and in Southern California since 1976.

A special education teacher. An off-duty police officer. 'The best dad.' How a Las Vegas concert went from melody to mayhem Gun Control Oct. 3, 2017, 2:36 p.m. Republicans are unwilling to consider new gun safety laws as Democrats plead with Trump to intervene Lisa Mascaro \nRepublican leaders in Congress showed no interest Tuesday in pursuing gun control legislation, leaving Democrats to urge President Trump to intervene in the aftermath of the shooting in Las Vegas. \nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said only Trump could change the stalemate in Congress, which has been unable to approve new gun safety bills, despite majority public support after the nation's repeated mass shootings. \n\"A small powerful lobby that represents a vast minority \u2014 a very small minority \u2014 of Americans seems to have a stranglehold on the Republican Party,\" Schumer said, referring to gun rights advocates, including the National Rifle Assn. \n\"Let's see if he has the courage, the willpower to say, 'I\u2019m going to break with that small group' and do something that makes common sense and Americans \u2014 in overwhelming numbers, Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2014 want.\" \nIt is unclear whether Democrats will find a willing negotiator in Trump. The White House has not raised concerns over gun laws since the Las Vegas shooting, which authorities say is the nation's deadliest, despite Trump's interest in stricter gun measures before becoming president. \nMore certain Tuesday was that Republicans, who control Congress as the majority in the House and Senate, remain opposed to new legislation to clamp down on the purchase or ownership of firearms or related devices like those believed to be used by the Las Vegas shooter. \nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned Tuesday that it was \"inappropriate to politicize\" the issue while Americans were mourning lives lost and the investigation was continuing. \n\"It\u2019s premature to be discussing legislative solutions, if there are any,\" McConnell said. \nHouse Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said the shooting was a reminder of the importance of mental health services. He defended legislation passed by Congress earlier this year to roll back an Obama-era requirement for gun background checks for those who have a mental health conditions for which they receive Social Security disability benefits. \n\"Protecting people's rights was very important,\" Ryan said. \"And that \u2014 that's what that issue was all about.\" \nCongress this year has been considering legislation that would loosen gun ownership restrictions, particularly a measure that would eliminate a $200 transfer fee on silencers. Supporters say silencers help protect the hearing of hunters and others using firearms, but opponents warn that easier access could worsen the impact of a mass shooting. \nThe silencer legislation is part of a broader bill, the Sportsman's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, or SHARE, backed by the NRA, that also would to allow gun owners to carry registered firearms across state lines and in national parks. \nThe bill has not been scheduled for a vote, and Ryan did not indicate Tuesday it would be shelved, as Democrats have urged Republicans to do after the Las Vegas shooting. \n\"That bill's not scheduled now. I don't know when it's going to be scheduled,\" Ryan told reporters. \nLater, on Fox News, Ryan noted: \"It's a big bill. It deals with wetlands; it deals with other sportsman's issues. It's not on our schedule because quite frankly, we're focused on tax reform and getting our budget moving right now.\" Latest updates ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lisa mascaro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles e. schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national rifle assn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heritage", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:43:18.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e8b74d75c0369a22eb07be2ca189bf03595c903b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn6YmZ6tvdzcemq4hqMQLPOaIDoWMz5fNnpoVxqyAgImksMc7jJJXOTcCw_PdySuedFqxlVVzbrVzXabB5acDF4U-", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.latimes.com/latimes/sports/tennis/\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "L.A.

Those were the kinds of free-for-all situations that led to repeated defensive holding penalties against UCLA on Saturday at the Rose Bowl during its 27-23 victory over Colorado .\n\u201cIt\u2019s extremely hard,\u201d UCLA safety Adarius Pickett said of shadowing receivers who are making freelance moves. \u201cYou\u2019re covering one route and the receiver breaks that route, and he either takes off down the field or he comes back to the quarterback.\u201d\nThe Bruins also struggled to stop Buffaloes quarterback Steven Montez when he eluded the edge pass rushers on a couple of long runs. UCLA used receiver Damian Alloway , a shifty and speedy runner, at quarterback Tuesday to practice containment.\nTight end Caleb Wilson, out for the season because of a foot injury, may not be as easy to simulate. Mora said his team wouldn\u2019t drastically alter its offense without its second-leading receiver.\n\u201cSomeone else is just going to have to do a heck of a job where Caleb was doing things,\u201d Mora said, \u201cand there\u2019s several candidates.\u201d\nAustin Roberts and Jordan Wilson are the only remaining tight ends with game experience, but Mora said true freshmen Jimmy Jaggers and Moses Robinson-Carr also might be able to contribute. Roberts was excused from practice Tuesday to attend an NCAA Football Oversight Committee meeting in Indianapolis, Mora said, but was expected back when the Bruins resume practice Thursday.\nAs if the Bruins didn\u2019t have enough going on this week, there was an important item added to their agenda: Classes started for the fall quarter.\nWelcome back?\nMora said he was hopeful that the Bruins would get defensive end Jaelan Phillips , right tackle Sunny Odogwu , linebacker Lokeni Toailoa and left guard Najee Toran back from their injuries for the game against Arizona.\nPhillips hasn\u2019t played since Sept. 16 because of an ankle injury, and Odogwu missed the first five games with various injuries. Toailoa sat out the Colorado game with an undisclosed injury, and Toran left in the third quarter with what appeared to be a leg injury.\nLinebacker DeChaun Holiday has a chance to make his season debut against Arizona, Mora said. He was sidelined since spring practice because of a shoulder injury. Mora said he expected Holiday to be able to participate some in practice Thursday as he tries to round his way back into playing shape.\nLinebacker Breland Brandt is considered doubtful to play against the Wildcats because he\u2019s experiencing symptoms from a recent concussion, Mora said, though he was expected to begin the return-to-play protocol Wednesday.\nReigning champs\nIf you spot a UCLA player wearing a boxing-style championship belt, it\u2019s because they were a knockout on special teams.\nThe Bruins have awarded the belt each week to the best player on special teams, with the winners including Pickett, Mossi Johnson and Quentin Lake , all defensive backs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s staying in the DB family,\u201d said Pickett, who wore the belt after blocking a field goal against Texas A&M in the season opener. \u201cHopefully I can get it back soon.\u201d\nQuick hits\nUCLA awarded its final scholarship to punter Stefan Flintoft , whose average of 40.9 yards per punt ranks fifth in the Pac-12 Conference. \u2026 The Bruins held a scrimmage for their scout-team players as a reward for the drudgery of constantly simulating other teams.\nCAPTION Los Angeles Times sports

Fleming Oct 03, 2017 | 02:55 PM Ford CEO Jim Hackett told investors the car company must invest more in electrification and connectivity, and begin focusing more in SUVs and trucks, to stay viable. (Rena Laverty / EPA) \nFord Motor Co. \u2019s new CEO said his company needs to be smarter, run leaner and move more quickly into the future to remain profitable. \nJim Hackett , who took the car company\u2019s top job in May, told investors in Detroit that Ford must build more SUVs and trucks, move more quickly toward electrification and increase connectivity among its vehicles. Outlining a campaign to increase revenue while controlling expenses, Hackett said Ford had to become a more disciplined company. \n\"We can't compete for the future unless we get fit today,\" Hackett said. \"Our priority is to reset revenue and attack costs.\" \nThat will mean reducing the number of options available per vehicle and increasing the number of parts that are shared between vehicles. \nA current Ford Focus, for example, can be had in 360 different combinations of engines, transmissions, colors, trim lines and so on. The future model will be ordered in only 26 combinations, Hackett's presentation said. Advertisement \nIn dollar values, the new plan will call for the implementation of a \"cost attack plan\" that will save $4 billion in engineering costs over the next five years, and an additional $10 billion in savings in material cost efficiencies. \n\"We will do this by increasing common parts, reducing order combinations and building fewer prototypes,\" Hackett told investors. \nThe CEO said Ford vehicles in the U.S. will be smarter by becoming 100% connected to each other by 2019, and 90% connected globally by 2020. \nHe also declared that Ford will focus increasingly on trucks and SUVs and less so on passenger cars and will back that up with the reallocation of $7 billion in expenditures. Advertisement \n\"We are shifting funds from cars to SUVs and trucks and bringing the Ranger, Bronco and EcoSport to North America,\" he said, while giving a particular shout-out to the new model Navigator. \nThe new Ranger will be available in 2018 and the new Bronco two years later. \nAnalysts were guardedly positive. \n\"It's clear that Jim Hackett and team are preparing for the future, balancing short-term vision such as product balance with longer-term goals such as electric vehicles and autonomous driving,\" said Kelley Blue Book's Akshay Anand. \"Regardless, Ford's biggest challenge may be delivering shareholder value and gains in a time where many other stocks have been booming.\" \nFord stock closed at $12.34 Tuesday, up 2%.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim hackett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "akshay anand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelley blue book", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hackett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new ford", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "business autos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bronco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford focus", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:08:47.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "88097b44f8128e0655ca09803fe8f9cc1c343744", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4I_gXSAL.X_450jjsIJmx17zPKpUuVpGb9djd9BEE8.99Oqn.50U_a6yA6hDZdSlY6em2sYnmYVHJq0i8ah.x8-", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/features/home/rss2.0.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "United Farm Workers union settles an employee lawsuit", "title_full": "United Farm Workers union settles an employee lawsuit", "published": "2017-10-04T01:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56fd643a/turbine/la-l-a-times-logo-20160331/600", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 87, "comments": 0, "shares": 87}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 19}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "88097b44f8128e0655ca09803fe8f9cc1c343744", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4I_gXSAL.X_450jjsIJmx17zPKpUuVpGb9djd9BEE8.99Oqn.50U_a6yA6hDZdSlY6em2sYnmYVHJq0i8ah.x8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Geoffrey Mohan", "published": "2017-10-04T01:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "United Farm Workers union settles an employee lawsuit", "text": "The United Farm Workers union has settled a long-running lawsuit with its former field organizers, agreeing to pay $1.3 million in back wages, penalties and attorney fees.\nAna Toledo, a Salinas, Calif., attorney for former UFW organizer Francisco Cerritos, said a tentative agreement, worked out last week, will be submitted to a judge Oct. 11 and finalized after a Dec. 1 hearing.\nThe union had faced $1.8 million in costs related to the 2014 case \u2014 nearly half the amount the union collects in dues from 9,830 members, according to U.S. Department of Labor records.\n\u201cThe high costs and risks of a lengthy appeal led the union to conclude that settling the case for an amount less than what the judge ordered is in the best interest of its members,\u201d UFW spokesman Armando Elenes said Tuesday.\nElenes added that he hoped the bulk of the settlement would go to \u201cthe union\u2019s hard-working staff,\u201d not attorneys.\nPlaintiff Francisco Cerritos was fired from the UFW in 2013, shortly after organizing a UFW employee union, La Union Es Para Todos (The Union is for Everyone). UFW cited several disciplinary actions in the firing.\nCerritos filed the suit a year later, saying he was misclassified as exempt from certain wage and hourly rules and was owed back wages, according to court records.\nThe suit alleged that the UFW regularly required Cerritos and 23 other organizers to work more than eight hours a day and 40 hours per week, did not provide meal periods after five hours of work and regularly issued pay stubs that did not specify the hours worked.\nMonterey County Superior Court Judge Thomas W. Wills, who ruled in Cerritos\u2019 favor in March, had ordered the union to pay $885,000 in back pay and $235,000 in penalties, plus legal expenses.\nElenes said those expenses amounted to more than $800,000.\nLast month, Wills ordered the garnishment of UFW dues from unionized workers at four companies, including fruit and produce giants Dole and D\u2019Arrigo Brothers, to begin paying the costs.\nAttorneys were prepared to ask for garnishments from half a dozen other companies that have bargaining agreements with the UFW, Toledo said.\nThe union appealed the decision. Any appeal would be withdrawn if the judge accepts the settlement.\nThe UFW reported nearly $4.2 million in assets last year, with $882,119 in cash, $1.4 million in investments and about $1.1 million in other assets, including a property in Salinas valued at about $776,000, according to Labor Department records.\nThe union reported 5,580 members working under collective bargaining agreements, with an additional 3,975 contract, seasonal and retired members who have limited or no voting rights, according to Labor Department records. Most members pay 2.46% to 3% of their gross wages in dues, those records indicate.\ngeoffrey.mohan@latimes.com\nFollow me: @LATgeoffmohan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dole", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "o.j. simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toledo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united farm workers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "business ufw", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ufw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labor department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d\u2019arrigo brothers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ktla", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salinas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:19:08.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a00eb5d6e401fb7b3979aa79864fc12c0dcf951", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn7hcj2MLP4hbRPmlFzFb1afmmAJ39qNKt3HputOFCN2MiKnht.YoW_qeiBPTMM09VF18PvQhJUCDoZbfgx.ZcdQ-", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/rss2.0.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "Digby Diehl dies at 76; former L.A.

Visitors had discovered they could trick the clock into thinking the countdown had expired by simply moving their computer\u2019s clock forward. \nSnap has been at the forefront of augmented reality tools, building 3D animations such as the wildly popular dancing hot dog . The animations lay over videos, or snaps, much like the company\u2019s famous filters, which turn users\u2019 faces into animals. \nSnap has been rolling out the technology to brands and advertisers, including Bud Light and Warner Bros . \nDespite that, the company\u2019s global advertising revenue this year is not expected to be as high as previously thought, according to research firm eMarketer . \nCiting competition from the Facebook-owned Instagram and the experimental nature of Snapchat, eMarketer cut its forecast to $774.1 million from $935.5 million. \nStill, eMarketer expects Snap\u2019s ad revenue to surpass Twitter\u2019s by next year, doubling to $1.4 billion. \nSpiegel also revealed on Tuesday that the company had sold more than 150,000 of its Spectacles camera sunglasses, about 50,000 more than he had expected. \nHe said hardware will remain part of Snap\u2019s long-term strategy. The company let go of a dozen employees from the hardware team last month and replaced the head of the division with a deputy. \n\u201cOur view is hardware is going to be an important vehicle for delivering our customer experience, maybe in a decade,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if we believe it\u2019s going to be important in a decade, we don\u2019t want to be starting a decade from now. We want to build the experience. We want to build the expertise.\u201d \nFollow me @dhpierson on Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "evan spiegel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walter isaacson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff koons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spiegel", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vanity fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warner bros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emarketer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spiegel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook-owned instagram", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beverly hills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eiffel tower", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snapchat", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:30:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "916adbf0e63c43567fc8cc8994b1769376e39d81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4I_gXSAL.X_450jjsIJmx3CvYcNr48srZoOJSju3Q9khLvQKZ3tPbsRZVInKKi4DlfyO.EIXfsickxChHR8qWIX8z70Jore8Vm3VfuY8G.C2PahnL4uFcmnqSFEv_8gsVBM2W7_a5ed", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/features/home/rss2.0.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "Chart-topping developer snaps up Holmby Hills estate for $12 million", "title_full": "Chart-topping developer snaps up Holmby Hills estate for $12 million", "published": "2017-10-04T01:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d40d97/turbine/la-fi-hotprop-gala-asher-holmby-hills-20171003", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11, "comments": 0, "shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "916adbf0e63c43567fc8cc8994b1769376e39d81", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4I_gXSAL.X_450jjsIJmx3CvYcNr48srZoOJSju3Q9khLvQKZ3tPbsRZVInKKi4DlfyO.EIXfsickxChHR8qWIX8z70Jore8Vm3VfuY8G.C2PahnL4uFcmnqSFEv_8gsVBM2W7_a5ed", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Neal J.

Hoping to be back out on the road very soon.\" \nThe \"Runaway Train\" tour began in August, and Seger's upcoming album, \"I Knew You When,\" is scheduled for release on Nov. 17, the date the tour was originally scheduled to end with a show in Chicago. \nThe postponed concerts have yet to be rescheduled, but tickets already sold will be honored on the new dates. \nHere's the full list of postponed shows: Sept. 30 \u2013 Columbus, Ohio ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob seger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "libby hill root", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "seger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don bartletti", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "los angeles times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "inglewood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ca", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:39:58.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0646a26589d9417714df6efe4d851ae971aa5976", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4f2q6Z..w2IiZufX0hVRJLf9PHpfIqmPexIWyn6WXgjJ_QLHlY9FMwCmxqKpDCy63wob65ZlPVTDIdyqGLD7MlUzwkdOkAjRCznA096uDsPy5OmOK.yx3gbkI0tIrD7AZj0Y8L_f1EGjaR52BWaThPC7B2NzhiYsCfXzmtUuPX2", "site_full": "www.latimes.com", "site": "latimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.latimes.com/rss2.0.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "latimes.com - Los Angeles Times", "title": "For many Angelenos, it's the fifth election day this year and another could be on the way", "title_full": "For many Angelenos, it's the fifth election day this year and another could be on the way", "published": "2017-10-04T01:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-59d4116c/turbine/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-for-many-angelenos-it-s-the-fifth-1507068589", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 609, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0646a26589d9417714df6efe4d851ae971aa5976", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8tFV.2eEwFn4f2q6Z..w2IiZufX0hVRJLf9PHpfIqmPexIWyn6WXgjJ_QLHlY9FMwCmxqKpDCy63wob65ZlPVTDIdyqGLD7MlUzwkdOkAjRCznA096uDsPy5OmOK.yx3gbkI0tIrD7AZj0Y8L_f1EGjaR52BWaThPC7B2NzhiYsCfXzmtUuPX2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Christine Mai-Duc", "published": "2017-10-04T01:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "For many Angelenos, it's the fifth election day this year and another could be on the way", "text": "Oct. 3, 2017, 6:14 p.m. \nThis is Essential Politics, our in-the-moment look at California political and government news. \nSign up for our free newsletter for analysis and more, and subscribe to the California Politics Podcast .

Mayor Eric Garcetti won reelection. Then came a hotly contested L.A. City Council runoff and two separate elections to fill the congressional seat vacated by Xavier Becerra , who moved on to become state attorney general. (Jimmy Gomez, California's newest congressman, won that race, leaving his Assembly seat open and setting things in motion for Tuesdays' election.) \nIf none of the 13 candidates on the ballot gets more than 50% of the vote Tuesday, voters can expect to be seeing mail about a sixth one soon. \nThe uncharacteristically busy schedule of elections this year and dismal turnout have led to concerns about voter fatigue . \n\u201cIt\u2019s like a never-ending cycle since November,\u201d said Amanda Santos, a stay-at-home mom from Montecito Heights, after casting a ballot in June's congressional race.

The Sparks had just 28. \n\u201cIt\u2019s rebounding and fouling,\u201d said Parker, averaging 14 points and eight rebounds in the series. \u201cIt would have almost been better for them to shoot a better percentage from the free-throw line, because when they missed, it was another offensive rebounding opportunity. \n\u201cWe weren\u2019t necessarily in our best flow offensively, even with taking the ball out of bounds. We have to do a better job of controlling the glass and making things difficult for them.\u201d \nWednesday\u2019s winner likely will be decided by who flexes its strength best, according to the Sparks\u2019 Nneka Ogwumike. \n\u201cAt this point, playing each other 12 times in the past two years, we know each other inside and out, so you really have to rely on those plays that you don\u2019t necessarily see on the stat sheet,\u201d Ogwumike said. \n\u201cIt speaks to the rivalry \u2026 which I think is pretty spectacular,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks to the evolution of the game, the evolution of this competition that we have between each other.

I\u2019m pretty sure everybody would take that. So that\u2019s the mentality we have to have going in. It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d\nVictory would allow the Sparks to repeat as champions a second time, after Lisa Leslie led them to titles in the 2001-2002 seasons. Minnesota, with past Finals MVPs Maya Moore, Sylvia Fowles and Seimone Augustus on its roster, has won WNBA titles in 2011, 2013 and 2015.\nThe competition between the teams is being hailed as some of the best in league history.\nThe Sparks won Game 3 because guards Odyssey Sims and Chelsea Gray outscored Minnesota\u2019s starting backcourt by a combined 30-0, but the Lynx responded by limiting Parker to three-of-eight shooting in Game 4.\nThere was champagne near the locker room before Game 4 at Staples Center, but Minnesota surged to a lead that reached 19 points.\nFowles overcame being temporarily blinded in her right eye by a collision to help the Lynx get 16 offensive rebounds, combining with Rebekkah Brunson for 27 of Minnesota\u2019s 48 total rebounds. The Sparks had just 28.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rebounding and fouling,\u201d said Parker, averaging 14 points and eight rebounds in the series. \u201cIt would have almost been better for them to shoot a better percentage from the free-throw line, because when they missed, it was another offensive rebounding opportunity.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t necessarily in our best flow offensively, even with taking the ball out of bounds. We have to do a better job of controlling the glass and making things difficult for them.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s winner likely will be decided by who flexes its strength best, according to the Sparks\u2019 Nneka Ogwumike.\n\u201cAt this point, playing each other 12 times in the past two years, we know each other inside and out, so you really have to rely on those plays that you don\u2019t necessarily see on the stat sheet,\u201d Ogwumike said.\n\u201cIt speaks to the rivalry \u2026 which I think is pretty spectacular,\u201d she said. \u201cThat speaks to the evolution of the game, the evolution of this competition that we have between each other. I would hope that everybody enjoys watching it as much as we love playing it.\u201d\nCAPTION The Times' Gary Klein and Lindsey Thiry break down the Rams' 35-30 victory over the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium.

Addae raced in and upended Parker with a below-the-waist hit that contorted Parker\u2019s body and sent him flying out of bounds.\nNew York Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr. , whom the Chargers will have to contend with Sunday in MetLife Stadium , lashed out at Cleveland defensive back Briean Boddy-Calhoun for his helmet-to-knee tackle in an Aug. 21 preseason game.\nThe hit took Beckham\u2019s legs out from underneath him, causing the star to fall hard to the ground and sprain his left ankle.\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about stuff that happens at 20-25 mph,\u201d Chargers free safety Tre Boston said. \u201cThe speed guys are running at, they\u2019re in your face, and they\u2019re coming at different angles \u2026 we already can\u2019t hit from the shoulders up, and now you\u2019re talking about eliminating the lower body?\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing a lot of guys get hit in the legs now \u2026 and guys with ACLs, knee problems, ankle injuries. Guys are crying about it, but hey, don\u2019t talk to us about it, talk to the league.\u201d\nSean M. Haffey / Getty Images Tre Boston tackles LeGarrette Blount of the Philadelphia Eagles during the second half Oct. 1. Tre Boston tackles LeGarrette Blount of the Philadelphia Eagles during the second half Oct. 1. (Sean M. Haffey / Getty Images) Chargers cornerback Casey Hayward , a Pro Bowl selection last season, said when he played receiver in high school, he preferred to get hit higher.\n\u201cIf you ask the offensive guys, they\u2019d rather get hit higher, in general,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather people stay away from the knees. Ask the offensive guys, and see what you come back with.\u201d\nWhat say you, Travis Benjamin , the Chargers\u2019 fastest wide receiver and one who has caught 11 passes for 180 yards in four games?\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of tough,\u201d Benjamin said after a long pause. \u201cGod forbid, I take a low hit and have to have surgery, but you don\u2019t want to get hit high because of concussions. So as a receiver, I\u2019d rather get hit low. The head thing scares you.\u201d\nFormer NFL tight end Tony Gonzalez felt much differently after watching safety D.J. Swearinger , then with the Houston Texans , end the career of former New York Jets tight end Dustin Keller with what Gonzalez called a \u201cridiculous\u201d hit to the knee in a 2013 preseason game.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not part of football, hitting a defenseless player in his knee,\u201d Gonzalez said at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s something we dread as players. That\u2019s my nightmare. Hit me in the head instead.\u201d\nStaying put\nAn NFL spokesman affirmed the league\u2019s commitment to the Chargers in Los Angeles despite the region\u2019s apparent indifference to the club.\nOpposing fans have overwhelmed Chargers fans in three StubHub Center \u201chome\u201d games, and with commissioner Roger Goodell in attendance Sunday, the Chargers were booed loudly by Eagles fans. Sunday\u2019s game, a 26-24 Chargers loss, also drew a dismal 3.2 television rating in Los Angeles.\n\u201cAs far as chatter that the NFL is looking for ways to return the club [to San Diego], there have been no discussions from the league or the club about this,\u201d NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email to the San Diego Union-Tribune. \u201cThose reports are false. ...\n\u201cWe all recognize, and the club has made it clear, that building a fan base will take time and won\u2019t happen overnight. But we know the Chargers are working hard in the community. The league and the commissioner are here to help play a role, and last weekend was a good example.\u201d\nEtc.\nReserve offensive lineman Max Tuerk was waived Tuesday after missing the first four games because of a performance-enhancing drug suspension. The former USC standout was a 2016 third-round pick who was inactive for all 16 games last season. \u2026 Defensive end Whitney Richardson was waived off the practice squad. \u2026 Among the changes coach Anthony Lynn is considering this week is an expanded role for third-string running back Austin Ekeler , an undrafted rookie whose first NFL carry resulted in a 35-yard touchdown run Sunday and who has caught five passes for 47 yards. \u201cEvery time he\u2019s in the game,\u201d Lynn said, \u201che\u2019s moved the chains.\u201d Guard Dan Feeney and tackle Michael Schofield also are expected to get more playing time. \u2026 Hayward, tight end Hunter Henry and receiver Mike Williams were among the players who spent much of Tuesday at a WSS store in Los Angeles distributing new shoes and backpacks to 450 students from Carson-area grade schools. \u2026 The Chargers signed running back LeShun Daniels , who rushed for 1,058 yards and 10 touchdowns at Iowa last season, to the practice squad.\nCAPTION In his second season with the Dodgers, Dieter Ruehle is putting a hip spin on baseball stadium organ music.\nIn his second season with the Dodgers, Dieter Ruehle is putting a hip spin on baseball stadium organ music.\nCAPTION In his second season with the Dodgers, Dieter Ruehle is putting a hip spin on baseball stadium organ music.\nIn his second season with the Dodgers, Dieter Ruehle is putting a hip spin on baseball stadium organ music.\nCAPTION Bill Plaschke previews game one of the NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nBill Plaschke previews game one of the NLDS between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nCAPTION The 0-4 Chargers will face the 0-4 Giants Sunday at MetLife Stadium.
