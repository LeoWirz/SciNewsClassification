Photo Courtesy of Ethelyn Gavin \nWhen Ethelyn Gavin was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, what was at first a manageable condition soon took a turn for the worse. As Gavin\u2019s weight escalated, her hemoglobin A1C level \u2014 a measure of average blood sugar level over two to three months \u2014 became progressively worse, and Gavin\u2019s doctor prescribed oral medication. Over time, she began to experience potentially serious diabetes complications involving other body systems, including her kidney function and increasing fatigue. \n\u201cDiabetes is a tricky disease because you really don\u2019t feel a lot of what is happening inside your body until your other vital organs start to break down,\u201d says Gavin, a former operations manager at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. \u201cIt\u2019s like a time bomb.\u201d \nGavin had experienced a history of yo-yo dieting, which refers to losing weight in the short term but having difficulty keeping that weight off. These fluctuations exacerbated her type 2 diabetes and put her at risk for even more complications , and yet she found staying motivated to stick with any one program to be incredibly difficult. \n\u201cAfter I retired, it really got out of control,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cMy weight escalated dramatically.\u201d \nFinally, Gavin got to the place where she could no longer manage her blood sugar with oral medication alone, and her physician had to ask her: Was she ready to start injecting insulin ? \n\u201cFor me, that was the point of no return,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cThat was the decision point.\u201d Something had to change. Joining a Weight Management Program to Regain Control \nTo help manage her weight and diabetes , Gavin began attending the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Weight Management Program, which she says was a \u201clast-ditch effort\u201d to stave off having to add insulin injections to her treatment plan. \nThe program doesn\u2019t focus only on dieting and exercise, like traditional wellness programs do, she explains \u2014 instead, it allows patients to meet with healthcare providers, like an endocrinologist and a registered dietitian, in a shared medical environment. It also includes group sessions with peers who have similar diagnoses and are also trying to manage their blood sugar and weight. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have such a feeling of isolation,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re all in it together.\u201d Plus, there\u2019s a clinical benefit: Sometimes, Gavin explains, another patient may bring up an issue that she would have forgotten to mention to her doctor. \u201cThere have been quite a few \u2018aha\u2019 moments for me, moments that I realized for myself that there were things I didn\u2019t even understand or recognize.\u201d \nIn addition, every month the doctors and dietitians introduce participants to a new educational topic about their diet or disease management , says Abed Alwahab, MD , an endocrinologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who has treated Gavin. For example, doctors might lead the five or six patients in the program through a cooking class to help them learn healthy recipes . \nAnother one of the benefits of these shared medical appointments? As Gavin lost weight, her endocrinologist was able to immediately adjust her medication , she says. Her doctors could monitor her closely and manage her lab work, watching for changes in kidney function . She could also bring about changes to her diet immediately based on feedback from these doctors and lab tests. \nFor instance, through counseling, Gavin discovered that she was a grazer, meaning that she would constantly eat but not necessarily sit down to meals \u2014 something she worked to change to improve her blood sugar management . Gavin also now aims to move more and has worked her way up to about 5,000 steps a day, often just by making simple changes like parking her car further away from the store, walking the perimeter of a grocery store before walking up and down the aisles, and taking the stairs instead of the elevator. \n\u201cShe is one of the many successful stories that we have,\u201d says Dr. Alwahab, calling Gavin a \u201crole model for others.\u201d The Benefits of Shared Doctors\u2019 Appointments for Diabetes \nStudies support the idea that shared medical appointments can lead to better results for people with chronic diseases like diabetes. \nIn a review published in January 2015 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine , for example, researchers analyzed 25 articles involving 17 studies that compared shared medical appointments with traditional care, and found that among those people with diabetes, the shared appointment model led to better improvements in A1C scores and blood pressure readings. \nAlso, patients who do shared medical appointments are more likely to report higher satisfaction rates with their care when compared with patients who receive traditionally structured care, according to a study published in July 2014 in the journal Annals of Family Medicine . \nThe multidisciplinary-team approach can be successful in part by making sure that doctors have access to all relevant information about their care, says Nuha El Sayed, MD , staff physician at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston, who has not treated Gavin. \u201cHaving a team of different disciplines creates a wealth of opportunity to know our patients better and to serve them better,\u201d she says. \nDr. El Sayed notes that while shared medical appointments are most common in larger academic settings, like at the Cleveland Clinic or the Harvard-affiliated Joslin Diabetes Center, some smaller clinics also form miniature multidisciplinary teams, in which providers wear multiple hats. \nIf you haven\u2019t tried the model, consider asking your physician about options in your hometown, El Sayed recommends. And if shared medical appointments aren\u2019t feasible, you can still reap many of the benefits by encouraging communication among your endocrinologist, dietitian, general physician, and mental health professional, she explains. It\u2019s all about advocating for your health. Reversing Diabetes and Continuing to Control Blood Sugar \nFor Gavin, the decision to take part in the Cleveland Clinic\u2019s multidisciplinary care option, through the Weight Management Program, was a turning point. \nThanks to the approach, Gavin has halved the amount of medication she needs to take to control her diabetes, and she says she is no longer at risk of needing injections of insulin so long as she continues successfully managing her health as she has. \n\u201cI\u2019ve actually returned to prediabetes status,\u201d she says, noting that her blood sugar control has vastly improved. The American Diabetes Association notes that an A1C of 6.5 percent and above signals diabetes, while an A1C between 5.7 and 6.4 indicates prediabetes. \n\u201cMy life has changed,\u201d Gavin says. \u201cMy outlook on life has changed. I have hope for the future, because of the changes in my health that resulted from participation in the program.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nuha el sayed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin laube", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gavin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abed alwahab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethelyn gavin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el sayed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alwahab", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "annals of family medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland clinic\u2019s weight management program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weight management program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joslin diabetes center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american diabetes association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of general internal medicine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:01:07.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "032e44348267013a196987cd7c434741f78ee875", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2LubsPjVrNR2Fb4ZFzA3HqARTEDka1ISxBrwvXEESZTS9XsMA5Io27zDikSA2k4XMNb.PCYd_OAfZB4qZOmTW656hq3QaJzOvwIf9xdTH0PbM70abB7Ofz2VOLqDZ8poVL2KuI9XHowc-", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "What You Need to Know About Psoriatic Arthritis and Your Weight | Everyday Health", "title_full": "What You Need to Know About Psoriatic Arthritis and Your Weight | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-03T13:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.184, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Psoriatic-Arthritis-and-Your-Weight-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "032e44348267013a196987cd7c434741f78ee875", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2LubsPjVrNR2Fb4ZFzA3HqARTEDka1ISxBrwvXEESZTS9XsMA5Io27zDikSA2k4XMNb.PCYd_OAfZB4qZOmTW656hq3QaJzOvwIf9xdTH0PbM70abB7Ofz2VOLqDZ8poVL2KuI9XHowc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stacey Colino", "published": "2017-10-03T13:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "What You Need to Know About Psoriatic Arthritis and Your Weight | Everyday Health", "text": "Everyday Health Psoriatic Arthritis What You Need to Know About Psoriatic Arthritis and Your Weight Being overweight can increase your risk of developing psoriatic arthritis and make it harder to manage the condition.

Please enter a valid email address Submit The connection between weight and psoriatic arthritis differs from person to person. iStock.com \nExcess weight has been linked to many health concerns, including psoriatic disease. \u201cPeople with psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis are more likely to be overweight,\u201d says Eric Ruderman, MD , clinical practice director of rheumatology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. But exactly how weight and psoriatic arthritis are connected is complicated and not the same for everyone. Weight's Inflammatory Effect as a Risk Factor \nBeing overweight or obese can be a risk factor for developing psoriatic arthritis , especially if you already have psoriasis . Research published in May 2012 in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases found that, as compared with people with psoriasis who had a normal body mass index (BMI) of less than 25, individuals with a BMI classified as obese (30 to 34.9) had a 22 percent increased risk of developing psoriatic arthritis. People with a BMI of 35 or higher had a 48 percent increased risk. \nThe inflammatory effects of excess weight may explain, in part, the increased risk for psoriatic disease. \u201cObesity has adverse metabolic effects that drive inflammation, leading to accelerated joint damage,\u201d says Elliot Rosenstein, MD , co-medical director of the Institute for Rheumatic and Autoimmune Diseases at Atlantic Health System\u2019s Overlook Medical Center in Summit, New Jersey. Fat tissue releases proteins known as cytokines that trigger inflammation. This inflammation can cause swollen joints and tendons associated with psoriatic arthritis, and when it occurs in the skin, it leads to the red, itchy plaques of psoriasis. How Weight Worsens Symptoms, Affects Treatment \nThe effects of weight gain can be felt in people who already have psoriatic arthritis, as extra pounds exacerbate the condition\u2019s symptoms. \n\u201cExcessive weight causes excessive strain and wear and tear through the weight-bearing joints, thereby aggravating symptoms,\u201d such as joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, says Dr. Rosenstein. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , adults who are overweight or obese are diagnosed with arthritis more often than adults with a lower BMI. Nearly 23 percent of overweight and 31 percent of obese U.S. adults report doctor-diagnosed arthritis, as compared with approximately 16 percent of adults who are at or under normal weight. \nBeing overweight makes it more difficult to manage the effects of psoriatic arthritis. According to a study published in May 2015 in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases , obese people with psoriatic arthritis were 47 percent less likely than their normal-weight peers to achieve \u201cminimal disease activity.\u201d The study defined disease activity as a combination of skin flare-ups, enthesitis (inflammation where tendons or ligaments insert into the bone), tender and swollen joints, pain levels, and general functionality for at least a year . Similarly, people who were overweight (with a BMI between 25 and 30) were 34 percent less likely to have minimal disease activity. \nAnother weight-related concern is the impact on your treatment\u2019s effectiveness. That\u2019s because excess weight can affect how drugs are processed in the body. As Dr. Ruderman points out, \u201cbeing overweight may negatively impact the effects of medication, especially biologics,\u201d which target specific parts of the immune system associated with psoriatic disease. Reaping the Benefits of Losing Excess Weight \nThe good news: Losing excess weight can help relieve the symptoms and change the course of psoriatic arthritis. In a study published in June 2014 in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases , researchers found that overweight or obese people with psoriatic arthritis who lost at least 5 percent of their body weight had a higher rate of achieving minimal disease activity after starting treatment. The type of diet used to achieve that weight loss didn\u2019t make a difference \u2014 reducing total food and calorie intake was the key. \nExercise can help not only with weight loss but with preserving muscle mass and functionality as well. Physical activity can also boost emotional health, which is important because depression and anxiety are common among people with psoriatic arthritis. \nWorking out may be seem daunting when you have psoriatic arthritis. \u201cIf your joints hurt, sometimes it\u2019s a challenge to exercise more,\u201d Ruderman says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to focus on things you can do that don\u2019t use joints that are bothering you. If your lower body hurts, work your upper body,\u201d for example. \nSwimming is a good all-around choice because it\u2019s nonimpact, and the water\u2019s natural buoyancy provides a cushion for painful or swollen joints. Other options include yoga, tai chi, or using an elliptical machine or stationary bicycle. Ultimately, \u201cit\u2019s about activity and movement as much as, or more than, exercise,\u201d Ruderman says.

Shutterstock \nAmy Kelly knows how living with psoriasis can take a toll on a person\u2019s activities and social life. \u201cIt affected me so much that I wouldn\u2019t go out with my friends,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I looked in the mirror, it was all I could see.\u201d \nKelly was diagnosed with psoriasis when she was 12 years old. \u201cIt started off on my scalp, and gradually spread all over my body,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s not one place on my body I don\u2019t have it now.\u201d \nKelly, 25, who\u2019s from Dublin, Ireland, had a tough time managing her symptoms. She tried various topicals, drugs, and light therapy . She also found techniques to care for her skin and make her psoriasis less obvious. \n\u201cWhen it\u2019s on your face, you can\u2019t cover it [with clothes], and makeup makes it look so much worse if you don\u2019t have the right products,\u201d she says. After testing different products and methods, Kelly made a YouTube tutorial to help others with psoriasis. \nHere are six tips for using skincare and makeup products to safely cover flares without irritating your skin: \n1. Pamper your skin before applying makeup. Just putting concealer over a psoriasis plaque can make it stand out even more. Kelly says that some of her early attempts at covering her psoriasis made it look like chickenpox. But she\u2019s found ways to keep her skin as calm as possible, making it easier to conceal signs of psoriasis around her eyes and mouth. Kelly uses a cleanser, exfoliant, mask, and moisturizer on her skin before applying any makeup. When it comes to products, she cautions that what works for one person might irritate someone else\u2019s skin. Try first testing out products on a small area of skin not affected by psoriasis. \n2. Keep your skin hydrated. Keeping your skin moisturized can minimize flaking and redness. Kelly uses hydrating cleansers, exfoliators, and foundations. \u201cUse makeup products for dry skin so they're not powdery, as [makeup] will only stick to the psoriasis if they're not for dry skin,\u201d she says. \n3. Blending is key. When using foundation and concealer, don\u2019t just cover up specific spots. Blending in products over the entire face will make your makeup look more natural. Kelly recommends using a brush over your face. Look for products that match your skin tone. \n4. Use cream or gel-based products. These products often have hydrating ingredients, which can minimize flaking and peeling. Powder-based foundations, highlighters, and blushes can stick in the uneven cracks of a psoriasis plaque, making them stand out even more than if you had no makeup on. Liquid and cream-based makeups also usually last longer. \n5. Don\u2019t overdo it. \u201cI can really only wear makeup once a week. Wearing it every day would be too much for my skin, and it would be quite red,\u201d says Kelly. If you\u2019re having a bad flare, applying makeup can make it worse. When her skin is too irritated, \u201cI end up with makeup stuck to the psoriasis, and it looks so much worse,\u201d she says. Makeup is most effective when your psoriasis treatment is working, and your skin is calm. \n6. Makeup isn\u2019t a cure-all. A makeup regimen may help conceal psoriasis, but it can\u2019t make the condition disappear. Some flares might be too severe to cover up, or makeup will be too irritating to your skin. The key is to treat your skin properly, so work closely with your dermatologist to manage the psoriasis. Kelly also stresses the importance of having a healthy attitude. \u201cDon't let it take over your life or your mind,\u201d she says. \u201cI let it do this to me for so long, and it's not worth it. Now I've completely changed my ways of thinking, and that's helped so much.\u201d \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shutterstock  amy kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:01:31.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dd65f88bb69366ad76f60962472e94156d8bf77f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2uNGv.aA1RUi51ZE_8DAYTtqBSFa088voUsWBpYouiUvCO6uBrbeGAMyMBiaLLf4mQp.7AyjvrS5WlfGmpzLrP3kN9rPiT1TWfDX.hTQtYxjmH8ldKHBh5pG9HGlJabZOE._AUWhKChw-", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Exercise and Diabetes: How to Organize Workouts for Better Blood Sugar Control | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Exercise and Diabetes: How to Organize Workouts for Better Blood Sugar Control | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-03T19:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.131, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Diabetes-Exercise-Secret-How-to-Organize-Your-Workouts-for-Better-Results-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dd65f88bb69366ad76f60962472e94156d8bf77f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2uNGv.aA1RUi51ZE_8DAYTtqBSFa088voUsWBpYouiUvCO6uBrbeGAMyMBiaLLf4mQp.7AyjvrS5WlfGmpzLrP3kN9rPiT1TWfDX.hTQtYxjmH8ldKHBh5pG9HGlJabZOE._AUWhKChw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephanie Bucklin", "published": "2017-10-03T19:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Exercise and Diabetes: How to Organize Workouts for Better Blood Sugar Control | Everyday Health", "text": "Sign Up for Our Living with Diabetes Newsletter Thanks for signing up! \nSign up for more FREE Everyday Health newsletters .

Anna Bizon/Getty Images \nIf you have diabetes, you probably already know that you need to take precautions during exercise to help protect your feet and maintain stable blood sugar levels. But did you know that the type of workout you pick \u2014 along with how you organize that workout \u2014 could actually affect your blood sugar levels as well? The Benefits of Physical Fitness for Type 2 Diabetes \n\u201cExercise is a key diabetes self-management strategy, primarily because it can help reduce insulin resistance and lowers blood sugar levels,\u201d says Lynn Grieger, RDN, CDE , a health, food, and fitness coach in Prescott, Arizona, and a medical reviewer for Everyday Health. \nAnd the way that exercise affects your blood sugar depends on whether that exercise is aerobic or anaerobic, says Christine Mueller, RD , a nutrition specialist at the Adult Diabetes Education Program at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Aerobic exercise uses large muscle groups in a repeated fashion for a sustained period of time, according to the Cleveland Clinic , while anaerobic exercise is intense physical activity of short duration. Examples of aerobic exercise include walking or jogging, and weight lifting falls under anaerobic exercise, Mueller explains. \n\u201cThe reason is that we store glucose \u2014 what we use for energy \u2014 in our muscles and in our liver,\u201d Mueller says. \u201cAnd when we start doing a more intense exercise, like anaerobic exercise, the body says that it needs the energy right now, and dumps all the stored glucose in the blood.\u201d That temporarily leads to a higher blood sugar. Meanwhile, low-intensity aerobic activities don\u2019t require the same immediate output of energy, and tend to actually lower blood sugar as your body slowly uses up the glucose in your blood. \nNumerous studies have shed further light on the potential ways aerobic and anaerobic exercise may cause blood sugar levels to swing. For example, according to a small study published in November 2012 in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism , a 10-second sprint can temporarily increase glucose levels in the blood of both people without diabetes as well as those with type 1 diabetes, who saw the greatest effect. \nMeanwhile, an article published in October 2013 in the journal Diabetes Care found that while exercises like walking and cycling can help lower blood glucose levels \u2014 regardless of the type of exercise or duration of movement \u2014 engaging in a 10-second sprint before or after a moderate activity may prevent low blood sugar levels in those with type 1 diabetes, because the body releases glucose-raising hormones in response to intense activity. \nThe American Diabetes Association also notes that the effect of physical activity on your blood sugar will vary, depending on a number of factors, including length of activity. What We Still Don\u2019t Know About \nGrieger says much of the current research has been done on individuals with type 1 diabetes \u2014 and we can\u2019t necessarily expect that the results will apply to people with type 2 diabetes. That\u2019s because, while both groups need to keep an eye on their blood sugar, type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease where the pancreas stops producing enough or any insulin, necessitating insulin injections, while type 2 diabetes is a condition marked by insulin resistance, where the body continues to produce insulin for many years, but that insulin isn\u2019t working effectively, Grieger explains. \nAnother caveat? Many people call running or swimming aerobic exercise, but if they\u2019re working out at a high intensity, that can actually make these exercises anaerobic, she says \u2014 meaning there isn\u2019t such a clear dividing line between activities. \n\u201cWhat we do know is that the fuel for anaerobic exercise is glucose, and the fuel for aerobic exercise is more fat and less glucose used for fuel,\u201d she explains. And, some people with diabetes \u2014 especially people whose bodies no longer produce insulin \u2014 may find that anaerobic exercise increases blood sugar levels, because the liver is stimulated to release more glucose, she says. \nBut overall, exercise in general \u2014 aerobic or anaerobic \u2014 tends to make your body more sensitive to insulin , Mueller adds, which is more good news for your blood sugar control. How to Structure Your Workouts to Improve Blood Sugar Control \nSo what\u2019s the best way to structure your workouts to keep blood sugar levels within a safe range? Try following these tips: \nAim for a mix of aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Overall, Grieger notes, combining both aerobic and anaerobic exercise in your workout may give you the best blood sugar control. Try a fitness trail with exercise equipment or stations where you do push-ups, lunges, and other strength-training exercises, she says. Or try a boot camp class, or an interval-style workout that includes 20 seconds of hard work, followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated 4 to 8 times, she says. Add additional reps as needed, increasing the rest period as you go. \nTailor your workout to your goals. Often, body builders do strength exercises first, followed by aerobic exercise, because their focus is on building strength, Grieger says. Runners, by contrast, often do the opposite, since they\u2019re focused on endurance. \nYou can tailor your workout to your goals, she says, though Grieger recommends that people with type 2 diabetes focus especially on aerobic exercise first, because of its cardiovascular benefits. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , adults with type 2 diabetes are about two times as likely to die of heart disease as those people without diabetes. \nMueller notes that if you do strength-training or anaerobic exercise first, followed by lower-intensity aerobic exercise, you may find that you\u2019re able to help normalize your blood sugar levels and prevent them from spiking too high, since the spike from the anaerobic activity would be counteracted by the aerobic activity that follows. \nKeep track of your blood sugar, no matter what workout you\u2019re doing. Make sure your blood sugar doesn\u2019t dip below 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) before a workout, according to the Mayo Clinic . \n\u201cWhen blood sugar levels fall, there isn\u2019t enough energy for the body to continue functioning optimally,\u201d Grieger explains. \u201cPeople with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can experience mental confusion, headaches, dizziness, shaking, and clumsiness, and feel very tired. If blood sugar levels continue to fall, a person with diabetes can even pass out.\u201d \nAnd make sure that you pay attention to how your body reacts to different types of exercise. \u201cThe best way for people with diabetes to discover how exercise order affects their blood sugar levels is to test their blood sugar before starting exercise and after finishing exercise, and to note if there are differences,\u201d Grieger says. \nFinally, make sure that you don\u2019t exercise if your blood sugar is already very high, such as more than 250 mg/dL, according to the Mayo Clinic. Then, you\u2019re putting yourself at risk of high blood sugar levels that could lead to a dangerous state called diabetic ketoacidosis , where your body won\u2019t have enough insulin available or may not use it correctly in order to use sugar for energy, and will go into \u201cstarvation mode,\u201d and start using fat for energy instead, which produces ketones, she explains. \nMost important, be sure to have fun. \u201cOften, people get so caught up in the \u2018rules\u2019 around exercise that they don\u2019t exercise at all,\u201d Grieger says. \u201cIt\u2019s important to begin doing something and gradually make exercise a fun part of your day rather than to not do anything at all.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lynn grieger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ann arbor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grieger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna bizon/getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prescott", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "better blood sugar control | everyday health sign up", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adult diabetes education program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of clinical endocrinology & metabolism", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diabetes care", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayo clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american diabetes association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T06:06:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "804058519cfcb99efbd592aa1f6fda77b307a16a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2uNGv.aA1RUi51ZE_8DAYTmQUztiwn2vLw4p3q72Rrh2.Ktb5LyjJLks9Cbx.bwfdb83RZ6AfU6nNqPrhMx2YXY0L.t._n.q2tSShDbAJXR04iuOqA.ZDce6LfvtDyyfI1Lf8PF103MMbgh4jk_joZQ--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Weight Gain After Quitting Smoking: How One Woman With Diabetes Is Coping | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Weight Gain After Quitting Smoking: How One Woman With Diabetes Is Coping | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-04T12:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.254, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/The-Unexpected-Reason-Quitting-Smoking-Complicated-My-Diabetes-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "804058519cfcb99efbd592aa1f6fda77b307a16a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2uNGv.aA1RUi51ZE_8DAYTmQUztiwn2vLw4p3q72Rrh2.Ktb5LyjJLks9Cbx.bwfdb83RZ6AfU6nNqPrhMx2YXY0L.t._n.q2tSShDbAJXR04iuOqA.ZDce6LfvtDyyfI1Lf8PF103MMbgh4jk_joZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gianetta Palmer", "published": "2017-10-04T12:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Weight Gain After Quitting Smoking: How One Woman With Diabetes Is Coping | Everyday Health", "text": "Sign Up for Our Living with Diabetes Newsletter Thanks for signing up! \nSign up for more FREE Everyday Health newsletters . Oops! Please enter a valid email address Submit Quitting smoking not only leads to physical changes \u2014 it may alter your perspective, too. Getty Images \n\u201cDo you smoke?\u201d asked the medical assistant in the pulmonologist's office who was taking down my medical history. \n\u201cYes,\u201d I replied, watching as she checked the \u201cyes\u201d box on the paper on her clipboard. \nShe made a \u201ctsk tsk\u201d noise between her teeth \u2014 almost like the sound I use to call my cats \u2014 and said, \u201cYou know, smoking isn\u2019t good for you since you have diabetes.\u201d \nI knew. \n\u201cThe doctor will be in with you shortly,\u201d replied the medical assistant, as she walked out of the office. Why I Started Smoking in the First Place \nMy endocrinologist sent me to see a pulmonologist because I had a case of bronchitis that left me perpetually wheezing whenever I walked a mere few steps. \nI had started smoking when I was around 20 years old, when in between classes at community college several of my friends played cards together over cigarettes. I smoked just to fit in. My dad smoked, too, and we even raised tobacco on the family farm growing up in southern Ohio. I smoked at least a pack, sometimes more, every day: Lighting up was the first thing I did in the morning and the last thing I did at night. \nI liked to smoke \u2014 specifically the social aspect of it. But now, I could barely breathe, and it was interfering with my job \u2014 I was out of the office and sick more often, and the constant hacking and coughing left those people around me wanting to be elsewhere. \nThe aforementioned appointment with the endocrinologist was the ultimate reality check. A Renewed Motivation to Try to Quit Smoking \n\u201cHow long have you been smoking?\u201d the doctor asked. \n\u201cAlmost 20 years,\u201d I replied. \n\u201cHow long have you had type 2 diabetes ?\u201d she countered. \n\u201cAbout 10 years.\u201d \nAgain, I thought I heard that same \u201ctsk tsk\u201d noise, as the doctor proceeded to put me through a battery of tests. They involved checking how long I could hold my breath and how fast I could blow out my breath, as well as a walk around the office to see how winded I would become. \nI sat in a chair, catching my breath while the results were calculated, and soon the doctor returned to the room. \n\u201cYou HAVE to stop smoking,\u201d she practically yelled. \u201cOtherwise, in a couple of years, you\u2019re going to be carrying around an oxygen tank.\u201d \nI think she saw the alarm on my face, but she continued with something like: \u201cDiabetes and smoking have one common denominator. Over time, both cause constriction of the nerves, thus cutting off blood flow, which in turn leads to nerve damage. You have to stop smoking.\u201d \nAnd I did. \nI ended up at the ER several months later, unable to breathe because of another bout of bronchitis. The doctor there echoed what my previous doctor said and went one step further by writing me a prescription for Chantix (varenicline) . \u201cI\u2019ve heard good things about this drug,\u201d he said. \u201cGive it a shot.\u201d \nI smoked my last cigarette at age 40, on Thanksgiving night 2006, and went into work the next day. My coworkers at the U.S. Postal Service cheered me on, and those who smoked stayed away from me so I wouldn\u2019t be tempted by the smell. \nI stepped on the large scale behind the office to record my weight because I knew a side effect of quitting was weight gain . It wasn\u2019t easy, but I was determined this time, and the days flew by, as weeks turned into months. I did feel better and I could certainly breathe better, but I noticed my clothes were getting tight. After Quitting Smoking, Gaining Breath \u2014 and Weight \nOn the first anniversary of quitting smoking, I commented to my mother that I needed to go shopping because my pants no longer fit. On the second anniversary, I held my breath when I stepped on the scale at the doctor\u2019s office, because I had gone up another two shirt and pant sizes. The same medical assistant from two years prior wrote the number down on my chart, smiled and walked out the door. \nThe doctor entered the room and looked over my charts \u2014 I\u2019d had the same tests run as before and she began to speak. \u201cFirst of all, your numbers look really good \u2014 your breathing is definitely better, but my assistant said you were very winded during the walk around the office. Why is that?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cI\u2019ve gained some weight,\u201d I said. \n\u201cAccording to my records, you\u2019ve gained 83 pounds. Are you watching what you\u2019re eating?\u201d the doctor asked. \nAll I could think of was 83 pounds. Had I really gained that much weight? \u201cI\u2019m trying to watch my diet, but I think I might be eating too much.\u201d I left the office armed with a slew of new pamphlets on low-calorie eating plans and headed home. Finding Solutions to Weight Gain After Kicking the Habit \nI was unhappy. I felt that the weight gain had all but negated any benefits of quitting smoking . As my weight increased, so did my need for insulin . Honestly, the only part of \u201cwatching what I was eating\u201d I was actually doing was watching the food as I shoveled it into my mouth. I was out of control. If I wanted doughnuts, I ate them and compensated by increasing my insulin dosage at mealtime. I wasn\u2019t always successful, and my A1C went up. \nWhile I know smoking increases the risk of diabetes complications and other life-threatening comorbidities, like heart disease , I can\u2019t help but feel that by replacing one bad habit (smoking) with another (overeating), I haven\u2019t done my body any good. After all, weight gain only increases insulin resistance , the hallmark of diabetes, and, like smoking, makes the diabetes harder to control. \nNow 10 years have passed, and I am still smoke-free. I have gained nearly 100 pounds total in my journey, but gradually, over time, I have lost 30 of them by following Weight Watchers and portion control. It\u2019s a slow process, but I\u2019m making progress. Looking Ahead to More Benefits of Quitting Smoking \nEvery day poses a challenge to balance what I eat, get the appropriate amount of exercise, and hope my glucose levels stay where they belong. I\u2019m no longer winded when I take the walk around the medical complex, and I no longer have a desire to smoke. In fact, I can\u2019t even stand the smell of a cigarette now. \nOne of the things I did at my five-year anniversary was take a trip overseas with my mother with the money saved from not having to buy a carton of cigarettes every week. I\u2019ve saved thousands of dollars. \nI\u2019m still bummed about the extra weight, but I try and let it go. I\u2019m doing the best I can, and, as my doctor likes to joke, \u201cYou may be a few pounds overweight, but at least you don\u2019t smoke.\u201d \nShe\u2019s right. I can lose the weight, and I will, because since I quit smoking, I\u2019ve probably added 10 or more years to my life. \nAnd I definitely want to be around to take many more trips.

Sign Up for Our Cancer Care and Prevention Newsletter Thanks for signing up! \nSign up for more FREE Everyday Health newsletters . Oops! Please enter a valid email address Submit Once lung cancer is suspected, an array of tests can pinpoint how advanced it is. Johnny Greig/iStock.com \nEarly screening for high-risk individuals \u2014 such as longtime smokers \u2014 nagging coughs, and random X-rays are often the beginning of the \"maybe it\u2019s lung cancer\" journey. But what happens after that? \nMore testing. These additional tests are designed to help your doctor pinpoint the type of lung cancer you have, such as small cell or non\u2013small cell; its stage, or how large it is and whether and to what other areas it may have spread; and its molecular profile, all of which dictate treatment. \nHere\u2019s what you can expect: \nPET Scan Short for positron emission tomography, PET scans track cancer cells that may be lurking and growing in other areas beyond the original location. For the test, a small amount of radioactive sugar is injected into a vein. The sugar then collects in tissues and organs that are very active and rely on sugar to provide energy, such as very active organs (the heart and brain), and fast growing tissues, such as tumors. \nNext, you get a full-body scan in a large machine that picks up the radioactive sugar in spots where cancer cells might be. This information shows up via 3D images your doctor can see. \u201cPET scans are one of the ways we stage the disease, because they\u2019re good at finding cancer that\u2019s spread to bone, the liver, and the adrenal glands, which are areas lung cancer tends to go,\u201d says Gaetane Michaud, MD , associate professor of pulmonary medicine and cardiothoracic surgery at NYU Langone Health\u2019s Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City. \nThough PET scans can\u2019t see every cancer cell, and often miss small tumors, they help see if there are large tumors that have already developed in other parts of the body. \nBrain MRI You may get an MRI, or magnetic resonance imaging, of your brain because that organ is one place lung cancer may spread. The brain takes up sugar at a speed similar to tumors, so your brain always \u201clights up\u201d on a PET scan, limiting how useful PET scans are at detecting spread to the brain, says Dr. Michaud. An MRI uses magnetic fields , rather than X-rays, to produce detailed pictures of the body. For the test, you receive an injection of a contrast medium that helps improve the images obtained in the scanner. \nBiopsies Imaging may tell you the size of the cancer, and where it may have spread. But it\u2019s not good enough for final diagnosis and staging. For that, you\u2019ll need a biopsy, in which your doctor will take a sample of the cancerous tissue from your lung or other organs to which the cancer may have spread. \nThe aim of a biopsy, says Michaud, is to obtain a large enough tissue sample from the most-affected area. That gives doctors the best chance to make the most accurate diagnosis and staging as possible, she says. Even if you have had a biopsy of the tumor in the lung, if the PET scan or MRI shows there is a suspicious mass elsewhere in the body, you may also need this to be biopsied to see if it is cancer that has spread, or just a benign lesion. \nCancer that has spread outside the lung is treated much differently from cancer located only in the lung, so these additional biopsies are necessary to dictate the treatment that will be recommended. \nThere are several types of biopsies: \nNeedle Biopsy or Needle Aspiration This involves getting a tissue sample via a needle inserted into the body through the skin, which is numbed with a local anesthetic. The placement of the needle is guided by imaging tests, such as ultrasound, CT (computerized tomography), or MRI. The doctor removes a small bit of tissue, which is sent to a lab for analysis. The whole test takes up to an hour. \nEndobronchial Ultrasound (EBUS) In this test, an ultrasound probe on the tip of a scope is sent down through the windpipe into the main branches of the lungs. \u201cThe ultrasound allows us to see structures around these branches, such as lymph nodes, where cancer may have spread,\u201d says Michaud. EBUS allows your doctor to get deeper into portions of the lung that aren\u2019t accessible via a needle biopsy. \nAn EBUS can also be used to obtain a tissue sample from the lungs or lymph nodes, which can then be sent to a lab. These can tell your doctor whether a tumor in your lung has spread to the lymph nodes \u2014 this is also information that will affect the type of therapy the doctors recommend. \nElectromagnetic Navigation This, says Michaud, is \u201clike a GPS for your lung. We input the results of a CT scan [of the lungs] into a computer program and tell it what area we need to reach, and the computer gives us a pathway out to that area, just like the GPS in your car.\u201d Once at the precise spot, a tissue sample is taken. The advantage of using electromagnetic navigation is that it allows doctors to reach a precise spot and avoid some of the risks of biopsy through the skin, such as a collapsed lung. Waiting for Results \nHow long it takes to find out the results of tests varies widely, both by where you get tested \u2014 some institutions do their own lab testing; others have to send out samples \u2014 and what type of test you have, says Michaud. The results for imaging tests may be read within hours at some centers or take between three to five days at others. Other tests, such as biopsies, can take longer.

Please select a newsletter Breakfast fans are less likely to be obese, have diabetes, or heart disease. Thinkstock \nMiddle-aged adults who routinely skip breakfast are more likely to have clogged heart arteries than those who enjoy a big morning meal, a new study finds. \nThe findings are the latest to link breakfast to better heart health . \nThey suggest that people who eat breakfast -- especially a hearty one -- are less likely to harbor plaques in their arteries. \nPlaques are deposits of fat, calcium and other substances that can build up in arteries, causing them to harden and narrow -- a condition called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis can lead to heart attacks, strokes and other complications. \nThe new study does not prove that skipping breakfast directly harms people's arteries. \n\"It's not that you skip breakfast, you get plaques,\" said senior researcher Jose Penalvo, of Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy in Boston. \nBut, he said, there are several reasons that forgoing the morning meal could contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis. \nFor many people, skipping breakfast is part of a \"cluster\" of bad habits, said Penalvo. These people tend to eat out a lot, and opt for nutritionally dubious convenience foods, for instance. \nOn top of that, Penalvo said, skipping breakfast may have negative effects on appetite-regulating hormones, blood sugar and insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar). \nPrior studies have shown that breakfast fans are less likely to be obese or have diabetes or heart disease . \nBut the current study actually used objective tests, Penalvo said. The researchers used ultrasound to screen middle-aged adults for \"subclinical\" atherosclerosis -- early plaque buildup that is not causing any symptoms. \nRELATED: Surprising Physical Signs of Heart Disease \nThe study included more than 4,000 adults ages 40 to 54 from Spain. Three percent were chronic breakfast-skippers, while 27 percent regularly had a big breakfast. That meant they ate more than 20 percent of their daily calories at their morning meal. \nMost people -- 70 percent -- ate a relatively low-calorie breakfast. \nIt turned out that those three groups also differed in their odds of subclinical atherosclerosis. \nNearly 75 percent of breakfast-skippers showed such plaque buildup . That compared with 57 percent of people who ate a big breakfast, and 64 percent of those who favored a light one. \nBreakfast fans were healthier in many ways, the study found. They generally ate more fruits and vegetables, seafood and lean meat, for instance. They were also less likely to be obese or have high blood pressure, diabetes or unhealthy cholesterol levels. \nBut even with all those factors weighed, breakfast-skipping, itself, was still tied to a higher risk of atherosclerosis. \nKim Larson is a registered dietitian and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \nShe said the findings are important, in part, because many adults -- around 30 percent -- routinely skip breakfast. \nAnd some people, she noted, purposely cut out breakfast when they're trying to lose weight. \nThat's a bad idea, Larson explained, because of the effects on appetite and eating habits the rest of the day. \n\"People who skip breakfast generally make up for it later in the day,\" said Larson, who wasn't involved in the study. In the end, she said, they typically down more calories over the course of the day, versus people who eat breakfast. \nThe current study did not dig into the nutritional quality of people's breakfast choices. But when it comes to preventing disease, Larson said, \"quality matters.\" \nA bagel and coffee is \"better than nothing,\" she noted. However, Larson recommended that breakfast include a healthy mix of protein, carbohydrates and fat. \nShe acknowledged that time is an obstacle. Many people are rushed in the morning and end up eating a muffin in the car. \nBut breakfast does not need to be extravagant to be healthy, Larson said. Some of her suggestions: oatmeal with nuts and fruit; whole-grain toast with nut butter; granola mixed with yogurt and fruit; and apple slices with peanut butter. \nPenalvo encouraged people to look at it this way: Eating a healthy breakfast is actually an enjoyable way to potentially curb your heart disease risk. \n\"This is a really positive message,\" he said. \nOf course, breakfast is not a stand-alone solution. Penalvo said it should be part of a generally healthy diet and other good habits such as regular exercise. \nThe findings were published Oct. 2 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology .

Please select a newsletter For some women, nerve damage can be long-lasting. Barry Diomede/Alamy \nA chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat early-stage breast cancer may leave patients with unpleasant side effects, and should be monitored carefully, according to a study published in August 2017 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . \nThe drug, Taxotere (docetaxel) , is part of a class of drugs known as taxanes, which also include Taxol (paclitaxel ). \nWhile these medications have been known to increase the risk of neuropathy (damage to the nerves), the new research has found that these symptoms may last for years. \nScientists reviewed data on 1,512 people with early-stage breast cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy. This type of treatment is used to prevent recurrence after primary treatments such as surgery or radiation. The study found that more than 40 percent reported numbness and tingling in their hands and feet after two years of a regimen involving docetaxel. \nOne out of 10 patients characterized their neuropathy symptoms as severe. \"For those who rated the severity as 'very much,' the quality of life score was almost 20 points lower compared with those with no bother,\" says the study\u2019s senior author, Patricia Ganz, MD , the director of cancer prevention and control research at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California in Los Angeles. \n\"We are hoping that oncologists will take note of the risk for long-term neuropathy, especially in older and heavier women,\" says Dr. Ganz. \"Older and heavier women are more likely to have a risk for diabetes, which can also cause neuropathy,\" says Ganz. \nParticipants in the recent study received one of three therapies with Taxotere \u2014 Taxotere with Adriamycin (doxorubicin) at the same time; Taxotere with Adriamycin and Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide) at the same time (ACT), or Adriamycin and Cytoxan taken at the same time followed by the Taxotere (AC\u2192T). \nThose in the last group received the highest doses of the taxane. The first group, who took just Adriamycin and Taxotere, had slightly worse results in terms of survival compared with the other two. The ACT group, taking the three treatments at once, had a survival rate almost equal to those in the last group, who took the follow-up Taxotere, but it also had significantly less neuropathy. \n\"We hope that oncologists might consider the alternative treatment with ACT if there is concern for persistent neuropathy,\" says Ganz. \nGanz suggests that oncologists weigh the risk of persistent neuropathy against the treatment choice to give a taxane-based drug or not, as well as the dose to be given. Other taxanes, such as Taxol (paclitaxel), which is often given weekly instead of every three weeks, may be a better alternative for some patients. \nAlternatives to a taxane include taking just AC (Adriamycin and Cytoxan) or FEC. FEC is Adrucil (5-fluorouracil or 5-FU) , Ellence (epirubicin) , and Cytoxan. \"These are the regimens that were commonly used before the taxanes were introduced,\" says Ganz. Patients Need to Be Better Informed \nGanz said that breast cancer patients may not anticipate having these kinds of side effects from chemotherapy. \n\"Our current research shows that oncologists spend a lot of time informing patients about the acute effects of chemotherapy (nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hair loss, mouth sores, low blood counts) and very serious or rare late effects such as leukemia or heart injury,\" says Ganz. \"However, they rarely discuss the persistent or lingering effects of the chemotherapy treatment and how long they last and whether they are likely to go away.\" \nFalls, disability, and cognitive difficulties may also increase among these patients because of the toxicity to their nerves. \nCharles Loprinzi, MD , a professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, agrees that chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a major long-term problem for a substantial population of patients. \nDr. Loprinzi says that guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology may have to be updated to reflect these study results. \"The guidelines may need more information about how you educate patients about the degree of the problem,\" he says. \"Some patients do not want to stop early; they want to tough it out, and they say it's not that bad and they can put up with it. I suspect that they don't really understand how bad it can be for a long time.\" What Can Be Done When Neuropathy Symptoms Appear \nLoprinzi says that when his patients get significant neuropathy or get it at a faster rate than expected, he often stops any taxane-based treatment. \nAlthough there is no highly effective treatment for this nerve damage, there are multiple medications that can offer some relief. Loprinzi says that duloxetine is \"the best drug we have at this time to treat established neuropathy.\" He notes, however, that it doesn't resolve the problem completely and has some side effects itself. \nThere are some pilot studies indicating that cryotherapy (using ice or other very cold substances) may also be helpful, according to Loprinzi. Further research results should be available in 2018.

Getty Images \nAmericans may be more willing to talk about mental health issues these days, but misperceptions and stigmas persist, a new survey finds. \nThe survey, of more than 3,000 U.S. adults, found that 70 percent said they feel people are more open to discussing mental health compared with a decade ago. \nMost respondents also said they'd want to help a family member or friend struggling with depression or other mental health conditions. \nOn the other hand, age-old misperceptions were still common. Many people, for example, thought that mental health disorders were at least partially driven by \"personal failings.\" \n\"That's certainly disappointing,\" said Dr. Don Mordecai, director of mental health and addiction medicine services at Kaiser Permanente, in Oakland, Calif., which commissioned the poll. \n\"These are true brain conditions,\" Mordecai said, \"and we have to get away from the blaming.\" \nIn reality, he explained, mental health disorders are rooted in factors like genetics, traumatic experiences and imbalances in brain chemicals. \nRELATED: Mental Health Myths Abound in the U.S. \nDr. Jeffrey Borenstein, a psychiatrist who was not involved in the survey, agreed. \n\"Psychiatric conditions are not moral weaknesses or character flaws,\" said Borenstein, president of the New York City-based Brain & Behavior Research Foundation. \nBorenstein said he was surprised by how many survey respondents mistakenly believed that character was involved. Over 60 percent thought that personal weaknesses were at least partly responsible for depression , for example. \n\"We clearly have a long way to go in educating the public,\" Borenstein said. \"These conditions are equal to any other medical condition. In this case, the organ affected is the brain.\" \nThe poll, conducted online in August, included a nationally representative sample of just over 3,000 U.S. adults. \nWhen asked about the national climate around mental health, 70 percent said they thought Americans were now more open to discussing it. \nPeople also appeared willing to talk about their own struggles. Nearly 40 percent said they'd faced a mental health \"issue\" at some point, and nearly all of those people -- 92 percent -- had sought some kind of help. \nIn another positive finding, 70 percent of respondents said they would be comfortable offering support if someone they knew had a mental health condition. \nBut the poll also uncovered inconsistencies. \nThree-quarters of respondents felt at least somewhat informed about mental health conditions, while a similar percentage said the disorders should be treated no differently from physical health problems. \nYet they also thought personal character was a factor in many mental health conditions. Fully 80 percent thought that was true of people with alcohol or drug addiction . \nAnd a significant number thought \"most people\" with mental health disorders can get better on their own. That included one-quarter of millennials, Mordecai pointed out -- which is concerning. \n\"You wouldn't walk around with a broken leg, thinking, 'I'll just heal this myself,'\" he said. \nIn another concerning finding, more than half of respondents said they thought a family member or friend was silently struggling with a mental health condition -- out of \"fear of stigma\" or shame. \nIn those cases, Borenstein said, people can try to be proactive -- telling their friend that they are concerned and ready to offer help if it's wanted, for example. \nMordecai pointed to one of the bright spots in the survey: \"If you're dealing with a mental health issue, these results show that there are people around you who stand willing to help,\" he said. \nRecognizing when you have symptoms, and speaking up about it, are the first steps toward treatment and recovery, Mordecai said. \n\"We have effective treatments,\" he stressed -- from \"talk therapy\" to medications. \nBorenstein agreed. \"These are conditions that no one should be ashamed of,\" he said. \"It's very important that people seek help, or encourage others to seek help when they need it.\" Last Updated:10/4/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

Martin Shields/Alamy; Getty Images \nFor some time, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been linked to lymphoma. Research has long shown that people with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk for lymphomas (cancer of the lymph nodes) compared with the general population, though scientists have debated whether certain medications may be partly to blame. RA Medication Benefits May Outweigh Risks \nBut a new study shows that the risk of lymphoma in people with RA is dependent on the disease itself and not on the RA treatment, suggesting the benefits of the RA medications outweigh the risks, researchers said. \nFor the study, published in August 2017 in the journal Annals of Rheumatic Diseases , scientists analyzed data from 12 European rheumatology registers from nine countries, which recorded medication usage and lymphoma occurrence across registered RA patients. Among 124,997 of those with RA, 533 people had lymphomas, the research showed. \nThe team compared these figures to data from a European cancer register-based project called HAEMACARE, which covers approximately 30 percent of the European population. RA Treatment Type May Not Affect Lymphoma Risk \nThe researchers found that the distribution of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (BNHL), and T-cell NHL in people with RA was roughly the same as the general population. B-cells and T-cells are types of immune system lymphocytes (subtypes of white blood cells) that fight infections. These findings were true regardless of whether the RA patients took first-line medications such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (anti-TNF) which are a common type of drug for RA treatment, also known as TNF inhibitors or TNF blockers. \n\"It is very important to note that the treatment of RA does not alter the subtype distribution of lymphomas and that there is no increased risk in TNF inhibitor-treated patients,\" says a corresponding author of the study, Anne Regierer, MD , of the German Rheumatism Research Center Berlin in Germany. \"This means [that] RA itself is responsible for the higher lymphoma risk and not the treatment.\" Health Risks That People With RA Face \nRheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease in which the immune system attacks the lining of the joints. \nPeople with RA have an increased risk of various other health issues. For instance, they often also have cardiovascular disease or other heart-related issues , such as heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease, as well as an increased risk of infections ( tuberculosis , in particular). \nLeft untreated, RA could lead to various inflammation-related complications that affect other parts of the body , such as the eyes, lungs, and blood vessels. Inflammation May Be the Common Denominator \nResearch also shows that the overall incidence of lymphomas in RA patients is nearly double that of the general population, Dr. Regierer and her colleagues report in their study. In particular, people with RA are especially susceptible to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the most common type of aggressive B-cell lymphomas. \nThe link between RA and lymphomas likely has to do with chronic inflammation , rather than TNF inhibitors, Regierer says. \n\"It can be speculated that chronic inflammation \u2026 can interfere with the maturing B-cells and hence contribute to the malignant transformation and finally lead to lymphoma,\" she explains. \"This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that the most common subtype of lymphoma in RA patients are diffuse large B-cell NHL, a lymphoma subtype arising from rather mature B-cells.\" \nYet, small studies have suggested that certain RA medications may also alter people's risk of getting certain lymphoma subtypes. RA Medications Vindicated? \nBiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, or bDMARDs, are usually the first-line treatment for people with aggressive RA. These drugs, which include TNF inhibitors, suppress the body's overactive immune system or inflammatory processes, ultimately slowing or altering the progression of RA. \nWhile often effective, these medications may cause various side effects , such as liver damage, lung damage, and increased risk of infections. \nRecent research hints that certain lymphoma subtypes in RA patients may also be associated with certain therapies, such as hepatosplenic T-cell lymphomas with TNFi. Evolving Data On TNF Inhibitors \nPast research suggested a link between TNF inhibitors and lymphoma, but the new study found that TNF inhibitor usage doesn't affect the lymphoma subtype distribution among RA patients \u2014 that is, the drugs don't reduce the risk for some subtypes while increasing the risk for others. \"This is important because lymphoma is a very heterogeneous group of diseases with totally different survival rates,\" Regierer says, adding that certain subtypes such as HL have a five-year overall survival rate of almost 80 percent, compared with certain T-cell NHL that have a survival rate of less than 40 percent. Bottom Line: Control Inflammation \nThe research ultimately highlights the need for RA patients to get their inflammation under control. Regierer says: \"The chronic activation of the immune system needs to be controlled in order to lower morbidity and also mortality in RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases.\" Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "martin shields/alamy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexa meara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hodgkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne regierer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regierer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "common denominator  research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nhl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "annals of rheumatic diseases", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german rheumatism research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bnhl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "haemacare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T03:47:18.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "33cbce093702866217b2b20a96ff0f8fcf6da7ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2VECmAHwbmo0fRhHnCIGPAhekjixeM1N4YnIR8dQTUgQ8lKKGcnvcuq548JiKuJAFwBnwksXpvBkVVj3sp8NP5OTfZuaMl.I56llYCY._ICykuu8AXBJYDcPHosiuArJ_byrwbQTDHI61vUZC5VDa6fGFi30OIpMzD3fpu.__259.d7aFthS5BLYO5pq5fo41JcGs30bi9vY7mobjxS6XsbOqQSpuFV69PEEUdsg8gEOnWLu9sql0tjtdWLK0ZhSz2DT4W16VnBM-", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-04T19:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.152, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Breast-Cancers-Decline-May-Have-Saved-322000-Lives-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "33cbce093702866217b2b20a96ff0f8fcf6da7ea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2VECmAHwbmo0fRhHnCIGPAhekjixeM1N4YnIR8dQTUgQ8lKKGcnvcuq548JiKuJAFwBnwksXpvBkVVj3sp8NP5OTfZuaMl.I56llYCY._ICykuu8AXBJYDcPHosiuArJ_byrwbQTDHI61vUZC5VDa6fGFi30OIpMzD3fpu.__259.d7aFthS5BLYO5pq5fo41JcGs30bi9vY7mobjxS6XsbOqQSpuFV69PEEUdsg8gEOnWLu9sql0tjtdWLK0ZhSz2DT4W16VnBM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-04T19:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives | Everyday Health", "text": "Breast Cancer's Decline May Have Saved 322,000 Lives But advances in care may not have helped black women as much as whites, report finds. Sign Up for Our Cancer Care and Prevention Newsletter Thanks for signing up! \nSign up for more FREE Everyday Health newsletters . Oops! Please enter a valid email address Submit Excluding skin cancers, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women. Getty Images \nNew research finds the number of American women who've lost their lives to breast cancer has fallen precipitously in the past 25 years, with more than 322,000 lives saved in that time. \nOverall, advances in care have led to a 39 percent drop in breast cancer deaths of between 1989 and 2015, according to new research from the American Cancer Society (ACS). \nOne specialist who works with breast cancer patients daily was heartened by the news. \n\"Early screening and better treatments are finally starting to pay off with better outcomes,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \nHowever, the ACS was quick to point out that not every segment of Americans benefited equally. Despite some closure of the racial \"gap\" in breast cancer survival, black women are still more likely to die of the disease than their white peers, the study found. \nEven though the rate of breast cancer diagnosis was slightly lower among black women than whites between 2010 and 2014, over about the same time period, black breast cancer patients were still 42 percent more likely to die of the disease than their white peers. \nAccording to breast cancer specialist Dr. Cynara Coomer, that's probably due to a combination of factors. Black patients are more prone to be affected by aggressive, tough-to-treat breast tumors, she noted. But they also often lack access to the targeted treatments that can best fight these tumors. \nRELATED: Breast Cancer Radiation 'Less Scary' Than Thought \nSo, when it comes to surviving breast cancer , \"there remains a disparity between black women and white women across the country,\" said Coomer, who directs the Florina Rusi-Marke Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. \nThe vast majority of breast cancers are diagnosed among women aged 50 and older, the ACS found, and older women account for most deaths from the disease as well. \nStill, race seemed to play a role here, as well. The median age of diagnosis for women overall in the United States is 62, but the disease tends to strike black women at a younger age, the report showed. \nThe median age for breast cancer deaths is 68, but black patients died younger -- at 62, on average. \nAll of this means that, overall, breast cancer kills more black women than white women in the United States. \nThere was reason to hope, however, because this health disparity may be stabilizing in some parts of the country, the ACS said. For example, breast cancer death rates among black women ranged from 22 percent in Nevada to 66 percent in Louisiana, the report found. \nBut in seven states the researchers saw no significant difference in death rates between black and white patients -- showing that the racial gap can be closed. \nWhile genetics and differences in overall health play a big role in the survival gap between blacks and whites, so do \"social and structural factors,\" said Carol DeSantis, of the ACS's surveillance and health services research branch. \n\"Increasing access to health care to low-income populations\" might shrink this racial gap even further across the country, she explained. \nCoomer agreed, saying that black women with aggressive tumors, in particular, \"would be better served with health care teams or centers that provide comprehensive breast treatment .\" \nAccording to Bernik, progress is being made. \n\"The fact that we are finally seeing a close in the gap between our excellent outcomes between black and white women is also encouraging,\" she said, \"especially since black women are more likely to be diagnosed with the more aggressive triple-negative breast cancers.\" \nExcluding skin cancers, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among American women, trailing only lung cancer. It's estimated that 252,710 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017 and 40,610 will die from the disease. \nThe research was published Oct. 3 in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Breast Cancer Facts & Figures .

People who engage in just an hour of exercise per week have a lower risk of developing depression. Getty Images \nCareer couch potatoes, take heart: Just one hour a week of any kind of exercise may lower your long-term risk for depression, new research suggests. \nThe finding comes from a fresh analysis of a Norwegian survey that tracked exercise habits, along with depression and anxiety risk, among nearly 34,000 adults. \nAfter a closer look at the data, a team of British, Australian and Norwegian analysts determined that people who engage in just an hour of exercise per week -- regardless of intensity level -- face a 44 percent lower risk for developing depression over the course of a decade than those who never exercise at all. \n\"The key finding from this study is that doing even a small amount of regular exercise seems to protect adults against future depression,\" said study author Samuel Harvey. \n\"This was not a case of more is better; the vast majority of the mental health benefits of exercise was realized when individuals moved from doing no regular activity to 1 or 2 hours per week,\" Harvey explained. \n\"Also, the mental health benefits were there regardless of the intensity of the physical activity,\" he added. \"There is great evidence that there are many physical health benefits to more regular exercise, but the mental health benefits leveled out after 2 hours.\" \nRELATED: 7 Common Myths About Depression \nHarvey is an associate professor with the School of Psychiatry at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, Australia. \"The important point here is that any type of physical activity -- even just walking -- had similar levels of mental health benefits,\" he concluded. \nThe original survey was launched between 1984 and 1986. In that timeframe, participants (who were about 45 years old, on average) underwent physical exams, and filled out lifestyle and medical questionnaires. Mental health assessments were also completed. \nThe Norwegian pollsters conducted a follow-up survey between 1995 and 1997 among roughly two-thirds of the original participants. \nAbout 7 percent of those tracked through 1997 had developed depression, while about 9 percent had developed clinical levels of anxiety , the findings showed. \nExercise did not appear to have any impact on anxiety risk. But investigators found that, regardless of gender or activity intensity, regular exercise lasting at least an hour per week was linked to a lower risk for developing depression over time. \nThe study authors calculated that roughly 12 percent of the depression cases might have been prevented if those who had become depressed had previously routinely engaged in one hour of low-intensity activity a week. \nExercising more than one hour per week did not, however, appear to substantially decrease depression risk even further; the lion's share of the protective impact appeared to max out at the one-hour mark. \nBut as to how and why such a minimal amount of regular exercise might help stave off depression, the study team wrote that \"the bulk of the observed protective effect remains unexplained.\" And the study did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and lower risk of depression. \nHarvey and his colleagues reported their observations in the Oct. 3 issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry . \nSimon Rego, chief psychologist at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said that \"there are probably many mechanisms at play that could explain how this works. But it doesn't have the same effect on anxiety, so we just don't know yet exactly what's happening.\" \nHowever, Rego added, \"What we do know is that what they've identified is a very low bar of entry. We're talking about just an hour of activity a week. And it doesn't have to be vigorous or intense. You don't need to go out to a spin class or sign up for a running club. This could just be getting people who aren't moving much to just increase their daily walking habit. That's all.\" \nSo, he explained, \"while we don't have all the definitive answers yet, this is a very promising finding because this is something many people may find easy to do.\" Last Updated:10/4/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

Getty Images \nThere's a link between obesity and 40 percent of all the cancers diagnosed in the United States, health officials reported Tuesday. \nThat doesn't mean too much weight is causing all these cancer cases, just that there's some kind of still-to-be explained association, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nStill, the study findings suggest that being obese or overweight was associated with cancer cases involving more than 630,000 Americans in 2014, and this includes 13 types of cancer . \n\"That obesity and overweight are affecting cancers may be surprising to many Americans. The awareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and overweight is not yet widespread,\" Dr. Anne Schuchat, CDC deputy director, said during a midday media briefing. \nThe 13 cancers include: brain cancer; multiple myeloma ; cancer of the esophagus; postmenopausal breast cancer; cancers of the thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, liver, pancreas, kidney, ovaries, uterus and colon, the researchers said. \nSpeaking at the news conference, Dr. Lisa Richardson, director of CDC's Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, said early evidence indicates that losing weight can lower the risk for some cancers. \nAccording to the new report from the CDC and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, these 13 obesity-related cancers made up about 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States in 2014. \nRELATED: U.S. Cancer Death Rate Continues to Fall \nAlthough the rate of new cancer cases has decreased since the 1990s, increases in overweight and obesity-related cancers are likely slowing this progress, the researchers said. \nOf the 630,000 Americans diagnosed with a cancer associated with overweight or obesity in 2014, about two out of three occurred in adults aged 50 to 74, the researchers found. \nExcluding colon cancer, the rate of obesity-related cancer increased by 7 percent between 2005 and 2014. During the same time, rates of non-obesity-related cancers dropped, the findings showed. \nIn 2013-2014, about two out of three American adults were overweight or obese, according to the report. \nFor the study, researchers analyzed 2014 cancer data from the United States Cancer Statistics report and data from 2005 to 2014. \nKey findings include: Of all cancers, 55 percent in women and 24 percent in men were associated with overweight and obesity. Blacks and whites had higher rates of weight-related cancer than other racial or ethnic groups . Black men and American Indian/Alaska Native men had higher rates of cancer than white men. Cancers linked to obesity increased 7 percent between 2005 and 2014, but colon cancer decreased 23 percent. Screening for colon cancer is most likely the reason for that cancer's continued decline, Schuchat said. Cancers not linked to obesity dropped 13 percent. Except for colon cancer, cancers tied to overweight and obesity increased among those younger than 75. \nThe new report was published online Oct. 3 in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report . \nDr. Farhad Islami is strategic director of cancer surveillance research for the American Cancer Society. \nHe said it's \"important to note that only a fraction of the cancers included in the calculation in this report are actually caused by excess body weight.\" \nAccording to Islami, \"many are attributable to other known risk factors, like smoking , while for many others, the cause is unknown. Obesity is more strongly associated with some cancers than others.\" \nThe World Cancer Research Fund estimates that \"20 percent of all cancers in the United States are caused by a combination of excess body weight, physical inactivity, excess alcohol, and poor nutrition. The American Cancer Society is currently doing its own extensive calculation of the numbers and proportions of cancer cases attributable to excess body weight, the results of which will be published soon,\" he said.

The survey also found that one in three people said another person whose care they were closely involved with had experienced a medical error . \nMost medical errors were associated with diagnosis and patient-provider communications. Outpatient settings were a common site of medical errors. \nOn average, respondents who experienced a medical error identified at least seven different factors that caused the error. Nearly half of those who noted an error told medical staff or other workers at the health care facility about it. \nMost people feel that health care providers have the prime responsibility for patient safety . But survey participants also said that patients and their families have a role, too. \nStill, most people said they didn't worry personally about patient safety, the survey found. \nWhen medical errors occur, they often have lasting impact on the patient's physical and emotional health , finances, or family relationships. \nThe survey was done by the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute and NORC at the University of Chicago. \n\"The survey results show that Americans recognize that patient safety is a critically important, but complex, issue,\" Dr. Tejal Gandhi, chief clinical and safety officer, IHI, and president of the IHI/NPSF Lucian Leape Institute, said in an organization news release.

Please select a newsletter Patients, caregivers and family members should all guard against the flu. B. Boissonnet/Alamy \nIf you\u2019re battling cancer \u2014 or have in the past \u2014 or you care for someone who fits this description, you should get the flu shot, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). That\u2019s because cancer patients and survivors are more likely to experience serious complications if they get the flu. And if you care for someone with cancer or for a survivor, you don't want to end up inadvertently getting them sick. Here\u2019s what you need to know as flu season gets under way. 1. Current Patients and Survivors Are More Likely to Suffer From Serious Consequences of Flu \nCancer, as well as the treatments for it, can kill off immune cells and weaken the immune system, allowing a flu infection to become more severe. While it\u2019s not known whether cancer patients and survivors are more likely to catch the flu, it\u2019s well known that they are more likely to have serious complications, such as hospitalization and even death. \nA review article in The Lancet Infectious Diseases reported fatality rates greater than 10 percent in cancer patients. Another, earlier study found that up to two-thirds of children being treated for cancer who got the flu were hospitalized for two to seven days, on average, and 10 to 20 percent had respiratory complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and a need for ventilator support. 2. It\u2019s Safe to Get the Flu Shot While Undergoing Treatment \nWhile it\u2019s possible to get some mild symptoms from the flu shot, they will be vastly milder than what will happen if you get the flu. Some patients with severely weakened immune systems may not be able to mount a strong response to the vaccine, but it won\u2019t cause the flu. 3. Those Who Have Had Leukemia and Lymphoma Are the Most at Risk Among Survivors \nPeople with leukemia or lymphoma have lower immune cell counts and are less able to mount an attack against invading viruses or bacteria. 4. The Consequences of the Flu May Be Worse for Surprising Reasons \nThere are reasons beyond a weakened immune system why it's a bad situation if a cancer patient or survivor gets the flu. For example, if someone with lung cancer has had part of a lung removed, there\u2019s less lung tissue remaining to allow for the breathing process, making pneumonia much more serious, says Ted Gansler, MD , the director of medical content for the American Cancer Society. Another issue: Some patients are underweight, have poor nutrition, or have muscle loss because of their illness or its treatment. \u201cAn infection that prevents patients from eating normally or one that requires bed rest is harder to recover from,\u201d says Dr. Gansler. 5. The Vaccine May Not Fully Protect Patients \nCancer patients with a weakened immune response may not respond as heartily to the vaccine as other people, so it may not prevent the flu completely. But the vaccination can reduce the severity of the infection and the risk of complications, says Gansler. This is the main reason why family and caregivers should be vaccinated as well. \u201cJust in case the patient or survivor\u2019s immune system is not strong enough even after vaccination to successfully fight the flu virus, vaccination of family members provides another layer of protection,\u201d says Gansler. 6. FluMist Isn\u2019t a Good Idea \nThe CDC doesn't recommend the nasal flu vaccine, FluMist, these days anyway, because research indicates it\u2019s less effective than the shot. But for cancer patients, survivors, and their caregivers, FluMist is a particularly bad idea because it contains live attenuated flu vaccine. Even a weak live virus may cause flu in a person with a weakened immune system. Household members should avoid it so they don't give that version to their loved one. 7. You Should Call Your Doctor if You Have Any Symptoms or Have Just Been Around Someone With the Flu \nYour doctor may opt to give you Tamiflu (oseltamivir) , an antiviral drug, to limit the duration and severity of your symptoms should you develop the flu, as well as how long you\u2019re \u201cshedding\u201d the virus and exposing people you come in contact with. Antivirals work best if taken at the first signs of flu.

Please select a newsletter Overtesting and overtreating can be a problem for women with early stage breast cancer. Thinkstock \nImaging and tumor marker tests are transforming cancer care, helping doctors find cancers sooner and targeting treatment for later-stage disease. But new research, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June 2017 , revealed that many patients with early-stage breast cancer \u2014 which has not spread outside the breast or nearby lymph nodes \u2014 are receiving these tests unnecessarily. \nThe news is worrisome because guidelines from top physician groups (ASCO and the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation\u2019s Choosing Wisely joint initiative) clearly state that they should not be used in patients with early-stage cancer who show no symptoms after their initial treatment, because these tests are designed to pick up the distant spread of cancer cells, which is highly unlikely in early-stage breast cancer. \nMoreover, when imaging tests are used inappropriately in these patients, they can lead to false-positives \u2014 suspicious results that are ultimately insignificant but can lead to a cascade of unnecessary procedures, unneeded radiation exposure, misdiagnosis, overtreatment, and emotional distress. Ordered Tests Differ From Practice Guidelines \nIn a review of patient records for 2,193 patients with early-stage breast cancer in the National Cancer Institute SEER cancer registry of Western Washington, Gary Lyman, MD, a breast-cancer oncologist and the codirector of the Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research in Seattle, reported that 37 percent received tumor marker tests (CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29) and 17 percent received advanced imaging (PET, CT, or bone scans). On average, about 2.8 inappropriate tumor marker tests and 1.5 unnecessary imaging studies were performed per patient. Tests Have Many Downsides \nThe costs of care rose substantially for patients who had these tests. Compared with an average cost of $18,403 for all patients in the study, average costs rose to $24,380 for patients who had tumor biomarker studies and $29,998 for those who had advanced imaging. Cost information was not available for patients who had both tests. Patients inevitably end up footing the bill for at least some of the difference. \u201cDepending on a patient\u2019s coverage, the out-of-pocket costs can be substantial,\u201d says Dr. Lyman. \nJust as important, the tests don\u2019t improve the outcome for these patients, says Lyman. \u201cThere is no improvement in survival and there is a fairly high rate of harm,\u201d he adds, referring to the issue of false positives. \nAnother potential problem is that patients pressing for these tests might get \u201cfalse reassurance\u201d if the tests are negative, and assume that future symptoms are from unrelated issues, which thus remain unexplored, explains Lyman. \nDiane Mapes, a breast cancer survivor in Seattle, remembers her reaction to hearing that leading medical groups do not recommend advanced imaging and tumor marker studies. It seemed counterintuitive, because she figured the more tests you do, the more likely you are to stop cancer. \n\u201cWhen I first heard this, I thought it was crazy,\u201d Mapes says. \u201cBut I learned that with early-stage cancer these tests are not that reliable. In addition, when you start scanning, you find weird things that often are totally insignificant. More and more tests get done, making you more anxious.\u201d The more Mapes learned, the more she realized that the risks outweighed any perceived benefit. Recognizing That Inappropriate Tests Can Cause Anxiety \nN. Lynn Henry, MD, PhD , the director of breast medical oncology at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, sees the study as useful in better understanding how best to deal with survivorship, a term used for ongoing care and surveillance during the years \u2014 or decades \u2014 after a cancer patient receives treatment intended to cure her of her disease. In women with early-stage breast cancer, this period would follow initial treatment. \nIt\u2019s not an easy time for patients. After initial treatment for breast cancer concludes, follow-up visits are less frequent, but patients still need support. It\u2019s an adjustment, says Dr. Henry. In Mapes's words: \u201cYou feel like you\u2019ve been dropped off a cliff and you don\u2019t know where to turn.\u201d \nPatients are vulnerable to the idea that further testing may be a good idea during this period of ongoing surveillance and clinic visits, especially as they adjust to changes in their body following surgery and treatment. \nMapes remembers feeling sternum pain that was actually caused by her breast implant. \u201cYou need to stare it down,\u201d she says, in reference to coping with the changes, \u201cbecause these are not necessarily symptoms of recurrence.\" \nAmong other tips for handling this time: Be aware that many insurance companies won\u2019t cover the additional tests for early-stage breast cancer and that you could end up with a huge bill if you get them. Ask your doctor what symptoms you should report right away and how frequently you should be checked to see if the cancer returns. Continue to see your primary care doctor, because many health problems that emerge have nothing to do with cancer \u2014 but still need attention.

Andrew Brookes/Getty Images \nA newer drug may beat the standard treatment when it comes to battling the blood cancer follicular lymphoma, a clinical trial suggests. \nFollicular lymphoma is one type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma , a group of cancers that arise in white blood cells. \nThe new study found that a drug called obinutuzumab (Gazyva) typically kept the cancer under control longer, versus the standard drug rituximab (Rituxan). \nAfter three years, about 80 percent of obinutuzumab patients were showing no signs of cancer progression or relapse. That compared with roughly 73 percent of rituximab patients, according to the report. \nCancer experts said the results, published in the Oct. 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , are a positive step forward. \nBut they do not necessarily mean obinutuzumab is the better choice for all patients, according to Dr. James Armitage, an oncologist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in Omaha. \n\"Obinutuzumab had a modest advantage in progression-free survival,\" said Armitage, who co-wrote an editorial published with the study. \nBut the drug also tended to cause more side effects than rituximab, he pointed out. And no one knows yet whether it will ultimately help patients live longer . \nRELATED: Adding Drug to Standard Care May Prolong Lymphoma Survival \nArmitage said \"reasonable people\" could disagree over which drug option is better. \nIn the United States, more than 72,000 people are diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma each year, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). Follicular lymphoma accounts for roughly 20 percent of those cases. \nFollicular lymphoma is usually slow-growing and responds well to treatment , according to the ACS -- but most patients do eventually relapse. \nHowever, when rituximab became widely available back in 2000, it changed patients' prognosis, according to Armitage. \nThe drug is a lab-engineered antibody that latches onto a particular protein on B cells -- the type of white blood cell affected in follicular lymphoma. It's often used along with chemotherapy to get patients into remission; afterward, it can be used alone, as a longer-term \"maintenance\" therapy to keep the cancer at bay. \nWith that maintenance therapy, research has found, over 87 percent of patients are still alive after six years. \nStill, there's always a hope to do better, Armitage said. \nSo the new trial tested obinutuzumab as an alternative first-line therapy. Like rituximab, the drug is an antibody. It's already approved in the United States to treat follicular lymphoma patients who relapse or do not respond to rituximab. \nFor the study, researchers recruited 1,200 patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma and randomly assigned them to one of two groups. One received chemotherapy plus rituximab, and if they responded, that was followed by rituximab maintenance for up to two years. \nPatients in the other group underwent a similar regimen, but with obinutuzumab. \nMost patients -- around 88 percent -- responded to the treatment, regardless of which antibody therapy was used. But obinutuzumab patients were more likely to be progression-free after three years, the study found. \nDr. Robert Marcus, the lead researcher on the study, said he thinks the results will have an immediate impact on \"real-world\" treatment. \nBased on the data so far, it's \"projected\" that patients on obinutuzumab could typically go more than nine years before seeing a progression, according to Marcus, of King's College Hospital, in London, England. \nThere are downsides, though. Both antibody drugs are given by infusion every couple of months. But obinutuzumab is more likely to cause serious infusion-related problems, including severe allergic reactions. \nThat happened to 59 percent of obinutuzumab patients in the trial, compared to 49 percent of rituximab patients. \nPlus, six patients on the drug developed a second blood cancer , while no patient on rituximab did, according to the report. \n\"That's a concerning finding that should be investigated further,\" Armitage said. \nWhen rituximab came on the scene, he noted, it made such a difference in patients' outlook, \"it changed everything.\" \nWith the newer antibody, though, the possible impact on treatment is tougher to predict, Armitage said. \n\"Incremental improvements are important, but it's less clear what to do with them,\" he explained. \nThe trial was funded by the pharmaceutical company Roche, which markets obinutuzumab under the brand name Gazyva. In August, the company announced it had submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to have the drug approved as a first-line therapy for follicular lymphoma.

These findings could lead to better drugs to treat breast and ovarian cancers and help identify women at high risk for these diseases. iStock.com \nScientists say they've spotted how mutations in the BRCA1 gene can trigger breast cancer. \nResearchers from the Yale Cancer Center say they identified the molecular mechanism that enables the mutation to cause the BRCA1 gene to lose its DNA repair and tumor-fighting power. \n\"There have been about 14,000 papers written about BRCA1, and you would think we already know everything about the gene, but we don't,\" said study senior author Patrick Sung, a professor of molecular biophysics and biochemistry and of therapeutic radiology. \nThe investigators showed that the interaction of BRCA1 with the BARD1 gene is necessary for DNA repair. They said their findings could lead to better drugs to treat breast and ovarian cancers and help identify women at high risk for these diseases. \nRELATED: 19 Celebrities With Breast Cancer \n\"Defining the mechanism of the BRCA-dependent DNA repair pathway will help scientists design drugs to kill cancer cells more efficiently,\" Sung said in a Yale news release. \nScientists realized women could inherit their risk for breast cancer once they discovered the role of the BRCA1 gene in DNA repair and tumor suppression, the study authors explained. At first, it was believed that BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations might account for up to 8 percent of breast and ovarian cancers. \nThe researchers noted the risk is likely much higher because in many cancers there is no evidence of mutation but the expression of the BRCA genes is silenced. \n\"Understanding this mechanism will provide the predictive power for doctors trying to establish a patient's personal risk of developing cancer,\" Sung said.

It's not clear whether the heart attack survivors quit their jobs, or were fired or laid off. Shutterstock \nRecovering from a heart attack can be a long, painful process, and now a new study finds that almost one-quarter of those patients who returned to work ultimately left their jobs over the following year. \nThe findings suggest that \"even though patients return to work after a heart attack , they may still require individual adjustments at their workplaces in order to stay employed,\" said study author Dr. Laerke Smedegaard Petersen. She is a graduate student at Copenhagen University Hospital in Denmark. \nAn estimated 676,000 people in the United States survive heart attacks each year, according to the American Heart Association. Many survivors are of working age: The average age of heart attack is 65 for men and 72 for women, the association says. \nThe new study examined the medical and work records of over 22,000 patients in Denmark who were employed before suffering heart attacks between 1997 and 2012. \nOf those, 91 percent returned to work within a year. But within a year of going back to work, 24 percent of the patients had left their jobs. That's three times the normal rate of leaving a job, the researchers reported. It's not clear, however, whether the heart attack survivors quit their jobs, or were fired or laid off . \nPatients aged 30 to 39 and 60 to 65, and those who had heart failure , diabetes or depression, were especially likely to leave their jobs. Workers with higher incomes and more education were more likely to stay on the job, the findings showed. \nRELATED: Is It Cardiac Arrest or a Heart Attack? \nPetersen said the percentage of heart attack patients who return to work and then leave their jobs may be even higher in the United States. \n\"In Denmark, all citizens have equal access to health care and all patients receive treatment free of charge,\" she explained. \nOne U.S. expert said the findings are sobering. \n\"The study is an important reminder that recovery is often measured in months and years, not just weeks,\" said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Evaluation at Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut. \n\"To understand the impact of a heart attack requires that we fully understand people's roles and function. We should study how best to help people fully resume their prior activities and have the choice as to whether they want to continue working,\" Krumholz explained. \nKarina Davidson, executive director of Columbia University's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, said fatigue and an inability to perform manual labor are some of the reasons why heart attack survivors leave their jobs. \n\"Patients after a heart attack do indeed have a long road to recovery, and cardiac rehabilitation , strong family support and follow-up with their medical care are important components to ensure the best recovery possible,\" she said. \"Returning to work full-time will be realistic for some patients, but not for all.\" \nThe study was published Oct. 4 in the Journal of the American Heart Association .

Hot flashes and sleepless nights are among the symptoms women might notice setting in when breast cancer treatment alters their hormone production. Shutterstock \nIf you\u2019re being treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer, it\u2019s not uncommon to experience transient menopause symptoms like hot flashes and irregular or absent periods. The younger you are, the more likely that these symptoms will be temporary, and that your periods will return \u2014 usually within a year of finishing treatment , according to Breastcancer.org. \nBut that\u2019s not always the case. Sometimes chemotherapy throws you into permanent menopause. Anti-estrogen medications used after the treatment of some breast cancers can perpetuate or worsen these symptoms, and these therapies are now typically given for 10 years or longer after chemotherapy is complete. \nWhile the average age of menopause in the United States is 51, it can come much earlier for premenopausal women treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer. \nThat\u2019s because some drugs used in chemotherapy regimens, which work by destroying rapidly dividing cells, can damage the ovaries \u2014 the organs that produce eggs in a process of rapid cell division. \nThe transition can be a shock. Most women going through a natural menopause will do so gradually, and their bodies have time to adjust. \u201cThere are at least several years of wide swings in estrogen levels , both high and low, prior to the final menstrual period,\u201d says Cynthia Stuenkel, MD , a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California in San Diego and one of the authors of the study cited above. Normally, this process lasts anywhere from four to eight years . \nBut for younger women , whose bodies are accustomed to higher levels of estrogen, chemotherapy can cause hormone levels to plummet abruptly, says Dr. Stuenkel. \nThe result? More intense menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes, sleep disturbance, difficulty concentrating, muscular and joint pain, irritability, and vaginal dryness. Most women are \u201cnot psychologically prepared\u201d for this rapid change, says Courtney Hennelly , a nurse practitioner at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. \nIndeed, a study published in June 2013 in the Journal of Thoracic Disease found that not only were the physical symptoms in these women more severe, they were more likely to suffer from depression and other mental health issues as a result of the premature transition. \nHormone replacement therapy is one viable option for treating menopausal symptoms, but most experts advise against its use for women with a history of breast cancer, out of concern that the added estrogen could fuel the growth of lingering cancer cells, says Stuenkel. \nMeanwhile there are some safer, nonhormonal ways to manage menopausal symptoms. A comprehensive review of recommendations for managing menopausal symptoms in breast cancer appeared in the August 2017 issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism and emphasized a variety of broad lifestyle-related strategies for addressing symptoms, including smoking cessation, weight loss for those who are overweight, limiting or avoiding alcohol, consuming adequate calcium and vitamin D, and regular physical activity. \nOther recommendations for specific symptoms include: For Moods, Sleep Disturbances, and Hot Flashes \nFluctuating hormone levels can create feelings of being out of control, may disturb your ability to fall or stay asleep, and may mess with your inner thermostat. Two varieties of antidepressants \u2014 SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) \u2014 have been shown to be effective at controlling symptoms in women with a history of breast cancer, says Stuenkel. These drugs include Zoloft (sertraline) , Paxil (paroxetine) , Luvox (fluvoxamine) , Prozac (fluoxetine) , Lexapro (escitalopram) , Celexa (citalopram) , Effexor (venlafaxine) , and Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) . Other nonhormone medications, like Neurontin (gabapentin) , Catapres (clonidine) , and Megace (megestrol acetate) are also currently being studied for the treatment of hot flashes. If you\u2019re overweight, losing weight may help ease hot flashes and help improve the quality of your sleep, says Hennelly. The review article above found evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnosis, and acupuncture for hot flashes. For Vaginal Symptoms \nLower estrogen due to menopause can result in a thinning of the lining of the vagina. This can cause decreased lubrication and painful sex, and lead to redness, dryness, irritation, burning and itching . Regular use of over-the-counter vaginal moisturizers, like Replens can help with everyday discomfort, according to a study published in June 2015 in the Journal of Personalized Medicine . Water-soluble lubricants, like Astroglide or K-Y Jelly, can help relieve painful intercourse. Avoid perfumed soaps and toilet tissue, fabric softeners, bubble baths, douches and vaginal deodorants, and synthetic undergarments (opt for cotton instead). \nLow-dose vaginal estrogen can be very effective, but experts generally recommend nonhormonal treatments as a first-line approach, especially since some breast cancers are estrogen-dependent. In March of 2016, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a statement saying that the research thus far didn\u2019t show any worsening of disease or increased risk of recurrence in women undergoing treatment for breast cancer or those with a history of it. But experts are still cautious and will recommend the lowest dose possible. \nOther nonpharmacologic options that can effectively manage the symptoms of menopause include acupuncture, hypnosis, and weight loss. Research shows that yoga and meditation may also help improve various symptoms of menopause.

Thinkstock \nFor those people who have been diagnosed with or are at risk for type 2 diabetes, losing weight can lead to big benefits, from improved self-esteem and more energy, to increased insulin sensitivity. But regaining lost weight \u2014 a phenomenon clinically referred to as weight cycling, or conversationally as \u201cyo-yo dieting\u201d \u2014 can cause potentially serious health outcomes, especially in the case of diabetes , research suggests. Yo-Yo Dieting: How It May Affect Your Heart and Blood Sugar \nWith popular diets on the rise, many people with type 2 diabetes are attempting them, but one-third to two-thirds of the overall weight that is lost on these plans is generally regained within one year, suggests a review published in February 2015 in the journal Obesity Reviews . In fact, at least one-third of people actually gain back more weight than they lost. \nNot only can this result be emotionally frustrating, but it also can lead to physical health complications for certain individuals. For example, a study published in November 2016 in the journal Circulation suggested weight cycling in post-menopausal women may increase their risk for sudden cardiac death and death from coronary heart disease. \nYo-yo dieting can also harm the health of people with type 2 diabetes, says Reshmi Srinath, MD , an endocrinologist and an assistant professor of medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \u201cWeight cycling can contribute not only to raising the blood sugar, but also to the risk for complications,\u201d like eye disease and neuropathy , says Dr. Srinath. How Yo-Yo Dieting May Impact Your Risk for Type 2 Diabetes \nIf your genetics, body weight, or past personal health history leave you at a greater risk for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes , you may also want to be mindful of losing then regaining weight, studies suggest. According to a study published in February 2015 in the journal Diabetologia , participants who had an average yearly weight loss of more than about 2.5 pounds, followed by net weight regain (or vice versa) had a higher risk for diabetes. \nAlthough this study noted that weight cycling wasn\u2019t a strong independent risk factor for the disease, other research seems to support this conclusion. For instance, an observational study published in October 2014 in the journal Diabetes Care found that people who experienced weight cycling in the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Diabetes Prevention Program had a greater risk for type 2 diabetes than those who lost weight and kept it off. \nA study published in July 2016 in the journal BMJ found that, two years after an initial diabetes diagnosis, either weight loss or maintaining weight without it fluctuating was associated with better blood sugar control. Meanwhile, major variability in weight was associated with poorer survival and increased risks to heart health. That\u2019s crucial, considering the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates people with type 2 diabetes are two times as likely to die from heart disease compared with people who do not have diabetes. Why Can Regaining Weight You Lost Have These Effects? \nThere are two primary reasons why yo-yo dieting may have this effect on blood sugar levels, heart health, diabetes risk, and the like: \nA Loss of Lean Body Mass If you lose weight rapidly, such as on a fad diet , you\u2019re more likely to lose muscle, says Viola F. Holmes, RD, CDE , education and outreach manager at the Virginia Center for Diabetes Prevention and Education at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. With lost muscle, your metabolism also slows down, making it harder to maintain weight loss, she explains \u2014 possibly contributing to that cycle of losing and regaining. \nMaintaining muscle is important when it comes to managing your risk of type 2 diabetes: According to a study published in June 2012 in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism , a higher muscle mass is associated with better insulin sensitivity and a lower risk for both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. \nAn Increase in Stress Hormones Your body\u2019s level of stress hormones, like cortisol, may increase when you crash diet, messing with the physiology of your body, Holmes says. In turn, when we\u2019re stressed , we don\u2019t usually sleep as well, which can lead to poorer food choices and an increased risk of unhealthy abdominal fat, Srinath says. \nThis abdominal fat has been linked to a number of negative health effects, including high cholesterol and insulin resistance, according to Harvard Medical School . A study published in December 2012 in the journal Diabetic Medicine put the link between stress and type 2 diabetes more starkly: After following over 7,000 middle-aged men for 35 years, researchers concluded that self-reported stress was a long-term predictor of type 2 diabetes, even after adjusting for things like body mass index (BMI) and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes. 3 Possible Reasons Why You Regained the Weight You Lost \nThere a few different reasons why you may be struggling with yo-yo dieting: \n1. You\u2019re using a restrictive fad diet to lose weight quickly. These plans commonly lead to weight fluctuation, Holmes says. It\u2019s not uncommon for people on a fad diet to lose weight quickly when they restrict several foods or food groups, and then gain it back when they discover it isn't a realistic way to eat long term. Sometimes women are more prone to these fluctuations, given the societal pressure on women to be thin and their tendency to try popular diets, she adds. \n2. You\u2019re setting unrealistic goals. Similarly, if you approach dieting as an all-or-nothing battle, you may be more prone to weight cycling. \u201cIt\u2019s really how an individual starts the process,\u201d Holmes says. If someone tries to go to the gym every day for two hours a day, and it\u2019s not realistic for that person, it may put them on the path to weight cycling, she explains. Instead, consider your schedule and goals to come up with a weight-loss plan that works for you and is maintainable over time. \n2. Your body has a \"set point\" it gravitates toward. It\u2019s possible that your body naturally gravitates towards a set weight point unique to your individual genetics, and when you start losing weight, your metabolism slows as your body fights to get back to that set point, Srinath explains. \u201cIt definitely can be reset, but because of that, people do yo-yo back and forth,\u201d she adds. Follow These 3 Tips to Help You Lose Weight and Keep It Off \nSo how can you avoid weight cycling, and lose weight in a natural, sustainable way? The experts offered these tips: \n1. Approach weight loss with a combination of healthy eating and physical exercise . Holmes says neither crash diets nor intense exercise are sustainable in the long term \u2014 you need a balance of each. And exercising is crucial: It can actually help you reset your starting point by ramping up your metabolism, Srinath adds, noting that a mix of cardio and resistance training is best. The American Heart Association recommends at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day for at least five days a week (150 minutes per week) or 75 minutes per week of vigorous activity, she notes. \nJust be sure to talk to your medical team before trying a new activity with diabetes, as individuals with diabetes may be more prone to injury and needs to take certain precautions when exercising . That is especially true for people with poorly controlled blood sugar . \n2. Make realistic changes. Realize your diet is not about a quick fix, but about identifying sustainable dietary habits that meet your desires and needs, Holmes says. Making healthy changes that you can continue for years to come is the best way to get your weight to a healthy range and keep it there. \n3. Get help from a professional if you need it. Finding a registered dietitian who is also a certified diabetes educator (CDE) can help you come up with a responsible plan that suits your lifestyle, Holmes says. You can search for one on the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website, or simply ask your doctor for a recommendation.

Getty Images \nA rare, benign tumor that grows in the pancreas may give doctors the tools they need to help people with diabetes make more insulin. \nThese tumors are called insulinomas because they secrete the hormone insulin in excessive amounts. People with diabetes don't have enough insulin to cover their bodies' basic needs for the hormone. \nThe researchers thought by mapping the genetic makeup of insulinoma tumors, they might come up with the genomic recipe for regenerating the beta cells that produce insulin. And if they could use that \"recipe\" to make a drug that would trigger the body to make insulin , they could treat -- or possibly even reverse -- diabetes. \nThe study's senior author, Dr. Andrew Stewart, said the researchers have mapped approximately 90 insulinoma tumors at this point, but only 38 were included in the current study. \n\"We have an actual wiring diagram in molecular terms for beta cell replication, and there are different mutation patterns that lead to beta cell regeneration. We've found about 30 different pathways,\" said Stewart. \nHe directs the Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nStewart said it wasn't a complete surprise to see that there were multiple pathways, instead of just one or two. For example, he said, there isn't just one set of molecules that makes growth plates during childhood. \n\"We found many additional pathways... This is a data mine for diabetes researchers,\" he said. \nRELATED: Supplements for Diabetes: How to Pick Responsibly \nInsulin, which is made in the pancreas, is used to usher the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as energy. \nPeople with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin, and may not make enough insulin. About 29 million people in the United States have this type of diabetes, which is associated with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. \nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to mistakenly destroy insulin-producing beta cells. People with type 1 diabetes must replace that lost insulin through injections or an insulin pump. Approximately 1.25 million Americans have type 1 diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. \nWith the information from this new study, the researchers hope to find or develop drugs that could work on one of those newly identified pathways. But it's important that the pathway doesn't have any other serious effects. \nStewart and his colleagues published a study in Nature Medicine in 2015 showing how the drug harmine could prompt beta cell regeneration in the lab and in mice. The pathway linked to harmine was one of the ones found in the current paper, too. \nBut \"harmine is a hallucinogen,\" Stewart said. \nSo, if taken as a pill or given as a shot, it would affect the whole body and produce unwanted side effects. \n\"We still need a way to deliver it specifically to the beta cells,\" said Stewart. \nThere's also a concern that a drug like an insulinoma could cause the body to produce too much insulin, leading to potentially dangerous side effects. \nAndrew Rakeman is assistant vice president of research for JDRF -- formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. \n\"You don't want to replicate the lack of control of an insulinoma. The question is can we find ways to switch these pathways on and then switch them off?\" said Rakeman, who wasn't involved in the new study. \nHe also pointed out that it's important that any drug just targets the beta cells and doesn't encourage cell growth in other areas. \nStewart said a therapy developed from these pathways would likely be for people with type 2 diabetes first. People with type 1 diabetes have the added issue of the autoimmune attack, which could destroy any newly made cells. \nFor people with type 1 diabetes, some sort of immune system suppression might be necessary, Stewart said. Rakeman said it's possible repeated treatments might keep enough beta cells alive to be effective, though that remains to be seen. \nFor now, Stewart and Rakeman said these findings are hopeful. \n\"Amazing things are happening in the world of beta cell regeneration,\" Stewart said. \nRakeman agreed. \"We understand much more about what's happening with beta cells. We can take those lessons and build out therapeutic targets,\" he said. \nThe study was published Oct. 3 in the journal Nature Communications . Last Updated:10/6/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

Please select a newsletter Considering cannabis for pain relief? Include your MD in decision-making. Shutterstock; David Mack\\Getty Images \nHave you ever discussed cannabis with your doctor? Despite the fact that 29 states plus the District of Columbia have decriminalized the use of marijuana for the treatment of certain medical problems, research published in the September 2017 journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence found that nine out of ten doctors were unprepared to prescribe it to their patients . \u201cMost doctors don\u2019t know much about it, even in the states where it is legal,\u201d says Rav Ivker, DO , a holistic family physician in Boulder, Colorado and author of Cannabis for Chronic Pain: A Proven Prescription for Using Marijuana to Relieve Your Pain and Heal Your Life . No Substitute For Rheumatoid Arthritis Medication \nIt is important to note that among RA experts, there's a consensus for early, aggressive, and conventional treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). People diagnosed with RA should never use complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies in place of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) , which have been proven effective in altering the course of the disease. No other treatment can stop the inflammation, prevent the joint damage, and reduce the risk of long-term complications that are associated with RA the way DMARDs can. Can Marijuana Help Treat RA Symptoms? \nBut what about using complementary and alternative medicine therapies, such as marijuana , in addition to traditional treatment? To date, the medical establishment has largely shied away from treating RA pain with cannabis, citing a lack of evidence. But doctors who prescribe medicinal marijuana to their own patients disagree, saying there is tremendous potential in this form of treatment. There are at least 80 different cannabinoids \u2014 chemical compounds that alter neurotransmitter release in the brain \u2014 that have been identified. \u201cThe most effective ones for medicinal treatment are THC [tetrahydrocannabinol], which is the most psychoactive, and CBD [cannabidiol], which is possibly the most highly medicinal,\u201d says Ivker. Possible Mechanisms of Marijuana \nAdvocates say the drug is an effective remedy for chronic joint pain, citing theories on how the herb might be helpful. \u201cMedical marijuana has two ways it helps with rheumatoid arthritis ,\u201d says Matthew Roman, MD , president of Nature\u2019s Way Medicine, an alternative medicine practice in Wilmington, Delaware. People who use cannabis may perceive an anti-inflammatory-like effect, \u201csimilar to ibuprofen or an ice pack,\u201d he says. In addition, marijuana may influence immune cells. Research is ongoing. Cannabis and Chronic Pain \n\u201cI have seen more than 7,000 medical marijuana patients, and well over 90 percent of them suffer from chronic pain,\u201d says Dr. Ivker. \u201cTHCA [\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid] is another cannabinoid that is not psychoactive, and that\u2019s the one we use most for rheumatoid arthritis.\u201d It can be extracted into a tincture, and it is also available in transdermal patches that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream. There are also topical creams and balms that contain CBD that you can rub right into the joints. Marijuana Dispensary Access, Your State, and Your Doctor \nIf you live in a state that has legalized medical marijuana, and you are interested in trying it, Dr. Ivker says to ask your doctor to write you a recommendation, which will be authorized by the state. Once that\u2019s registered, you will receive a document that you can take to a medical dispensary to purchase treatments. \u201cBut you first have to go through a physician, and there are many who are still reluctant to provide the recommendations,\u201d he says. Dr. Roman agrees, and advises patients to be bold with their physicians when they discuss this treatment option. \u201cAsk them what their position is on the topic, and tell them that you are interested in trying it.\u201d After all, it is important to discuss any supplement or remedy that you are considering with your doctor before you use it, so she can consider, among other things, potential interactions with the medications you are already taking. In other words, you can\u2019t avoid this conversation if you want to experiment with pain treatments in a responsible way. If your own doctors won\u2019t write a recommendation, consider using a site like marijuanadoctors.com , which provides a list of cannabis-friendly MDs in your area.

Please enter a valid email address Submit A chair can help you take the weight off your joints and lower extremities during yoga. Dorling Kindersley/Getty Images \nIf you have a painful chronic condition like psoriatic arthritis , the last thing you want to do sometimes is move. And it's also hard to accept such physical limitations when you\u2019re used to an active lifestyle. \nBefore I was sentenced to a four-year disability leave, I was always on the go \u2014 I traveled for my job, went to the gym regularly, and tried to get in at least one yoga class every week. Then, thanks to an especially bad episode, I couldn\u2019t put any weight on my left leg for six months. \nSure, it was physically painful. But the mental anguish of going from a fast-paced life to spending 98 percent of the day in bed was just as unbearable. \nWhen my pain doctor said I should move as much as I could , I remember giving him a strange look. I longed for the days when I could get on my mat and finish a yoga class. But how was I supposed to move or be physically active if I didn\u2019t have full use of my left leg? What Is Chair Yoga? \nThat\u2019s when he suggested I try chair yoga. \nIf you\u2019ve never heard of chair yoga (I hadn\u2019t), it\u2019s exactly what it sounds like \u2014 yoga in a chair. It takes the weight off your joints and lower extremities, but helps you move and still get that mind-body connection going. \nThat sounded perfect for me! I began scouring the internet for YouTube videos and online classes. The ones I found were generally geared toward seniors. That was a tough pill to swallow at first, because I was 27 years old. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I was being silly. So what if the people in the videos were 50 years my senior? These people weren\u2019t moping around because they had knee or hip troubles. They were doing chair yoga and feeling better! A Daily Commitment \nI committed myself to doing some physical activity and getting on my yoga mat every day, no matter what. \nI would roll out my mat just like before, but this time I would set a chair on top of it. Honestly, some days I pushed that chair to the side and just lay on my mat. On other days, I would do a simple seated sun salutation or some leg stretches. But just the simple act of doing something started to help me mentally. \nSlowly but surely, I built up my strength. Eventually, I was able to lose the chair and went from doing seated sequences to doing standing ones. I learned to use my chair as a prop in my yoga practice. I found that you can straddle a chair and do an assisted Warrior II pose, or use the chair to do a supported Crescent Lunge. With the condition my knee was in, it was hard to do Child\u2019s pose, but I found other ways to rest. As with any yoga practice, I modified the routine to what suited me. The Importance of Setting Goals \nThroughout the process, I would set goals for myself. Having goals helped push me a bit more. \nHere are the kinds of goals that I set: By the end of the summer, I want to be able to do a 20-minute class on my own without the chair. By the end of the fall, I want to be able to do a full standing class on my own. By the end of winter, I want to be able to take a regular class at a yoga studio. Next summer, I want to make it to a local yoga festival. \nThere were times when I couldn\u2019t meet my goals or I had to change them. But whenever I had a setback, I focused on how far I had come. Honoring my progress helped put things in perspective and kept my spirits up! It was important not to push myself too hard on good days and to show myself gratitude on bad days. \nJust a little bit of movement and a slow buildup of activity helped me physically and mentally. By accepting my physical limitations, I became more appreciative of what I could do. When I switched to this mind-set, my health started to flourish. I had more energy and less pain, and I felt so much better overall. \nSo remember that when you take things step by step and day by day, it can make crossing mountains a lot more manageable.

Please select a newsletter The corticosteroid prednisone is one form of medication for IBD. Steven May/Alamy \nIf you have ulcerative colitis (UC), you\u2019re likely familiar with corticosteroid drugs like prednisone, powerful anti-inflammatories that are very effective at reducing inflammation quickly during a flare. \nBut prednisone comes with a range of unwelcome side effects, one of which is weight gain. \nAccording to a review published in August 2013 in the journal Allergy, Asthma & Clinical Immunology , weight gain from prednisone can appear as fat deposits on various parts of your body, such as at the base or back of your neck, around your abdomen, or as what\u2019s called \u201cmoon face,\u201d when changes in where fat lies make your face appear rounder and wider. The Connection Between Prednisone and Weight Gain \nWeight gain in people taking prednisone is linked to how long you take the drug, says Rudolph Bedford, MD , gastroenterologist at Providence Saint John\u2019s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. The longer you\u2019re on prednisone, the more likely you are to gain weight. Why does this happen? First, says Dr. Bedford, prednisone increases your appetite. A report published in December 2013 in the Journal of Pharmacology & Pharmacotherapeutics states that 70 percent of patients taking corticosteroids report boosted appetite. \nPrednisone also causes fluid retention, which leads to swelling, often of the hands, legs, and feet, along with the face. Prednisone may also interrupt a normal sleep-wake cycle, leading to inadequate sleep and a disruption of the hormones that help regulate appetite, says Kate Scarlata, RDN , a Boston-based dietitian. \nIf weight gain is particularly bothersome to you, talk to your doctor about modifying your drug regimen . You should never stop taking the drugs on your own. Steroids need to be tapered slowly under your doctor\u2019s guidance. According to the Hospital for Special Surgery , rapid withdrawal of steroids my cause fatigue, joint pain, muscle stiffness, or fever. \nYour doctor may be able to prescribe a different corticosteroid, like budenoside . This alternative is \u201cquickly metabolized by the liver, thereby reducing corticosteroid-related side effects, and appears to be as effective as prednisone,\u201d says Bedford. How to Control Weight Gain on Prednisone \nEmploying a few simple nutritional strategies while you\u2019re on prednisone can help you avoid the worst of the weight gain \u2014 and stay healthier overall, says Scarlata. \nReduce sodium intake. Minimizing canned and processed foods, soy sauce, cold cuts, chips, and other salty snacks is smart because high-sodium foods contribute to water retention. \nChoose low-calorie sources of calcium. Another prednisone side effect is the risk for bone mineral loss, so boosting calcium intake is important. But be careful about which calcium-rich foods you\u2019re consuming. Some, like whole milk, also contain a lot of fat. Instead, try lower-calorie sources of calcium, like low-fat dairy, broccoli, kale, and chia seeds, says Scarlata, and consider a supplement. \nConsume more potassium. \u201cIncreased potassium intake can combat water retention,\u201d notes Bedford. Good sources of this important mineral include oranges, grapefruit, bananas, kiwifruit, spinach, collard greens, and tomatoes. \nOpt for healthy fats. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of low-and-non-fat-everything, Scarlata says. Small portions of healthy fats boost nutrition and help control hunger between meals. \u201cInclude a small handful of nuts, seeds, olive oil, fatty fish \u2014 like salmon or tuna \u2014 or avocado at every meal, as tolerated.\u201d \nFinally, says Scarlata, be aware that steroids' hormonal regulation of hunger cues may make you feel hungry even when you\u2019re not. For this reason, you should try to eat regularly-timed meals, she says. \u201cIf you let yourself get over-hungry, you\u2019ll feel less in control and more likely to overeat.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rudolph bedford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate scarlata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven may/alamy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarlata", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "journal of pharmacology & pharmacotherapeutics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asthma & clinical immunology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "providence saint john\u2019s health center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa monica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T16:49:59.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eefc905dd56f260f5089c3c6f38d4899bbd44739", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2Tq6D.8y5noRfenEJiu7NkZ1W1EMqhBryqknHsfBMgSc8fhCJUET723lmjnMIP2m7yjzi17iIMUj2sKoGqe0do.hTMhOF_CffmVEC1jyOwZEgVJQ13rvEOA--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Doctor\u2019s Notes: Using Personalized Medicine to Treat IBD | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Doctor\u2019s Notes: Using Personalized Medicine to Treat IBD | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-09T11:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.756, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Personalized-Medicine-A-New-Approach-to-IBD-Treatment-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eefc905dd56f260f5089c3c6f38d4899bbd44739", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2Tq6D.8y5noRfenEJiu7NkZ1W1EMqhBryqknHsfBMgSc8fhCJUET723lmjnMIP2m7yjzi17iIMUj2sKoGqe0do.hTMhOF_CffmVEC1jyOwZEgVJQ13rvEOA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian Mastroianni", "published": "2017-10-09T11:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Doctor\u2019s Notes: Using Personalized Medicine to Treat IBD | Everyday Health", "text": "Sign Up for Our Living with Crohn's Disease Newsletter Thanks for signing up!

Please select a newsletter More and more doctors are turning to an individualized approach for treating IBD. Masterfile \nAnita Azfali, MD, MPH, wants people to rethink how inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is treated. The ways of the past \u2014 treating patients with a one-size-fits-all approach \u2014 don\u2019t work for everyone because of comorbidities and specific genetic factors. \n\u201cOur treatment plan has to be for the individual,\u201d says Dr. Azfali , the director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. \nAzfali isn\u2019t the only one in the medical community advocating this new approach. An article published in May 2016 in the journal Gastroenterology & Hepatology agrees that personalized medicine, which centers on selecting the most appropriate therapy for a specific patient, is the answer. \nAzfali says that this is especially true thanks to scientific advances that have helped researchers understand what can contribute to and impact IBD . Tailoring Treatments to Improve Outcomes \nPersonalized medicine basically comes with a two-pronged approach \u2014 the medical world\u2019s embrace of genetics and how that can be used to diagnose and treat someone, and a better understanding of how external factors from a person\u2019s past history could impact their condition. \n\u201cI think a lot of where we are today comes from our understanding of the genetic associations and components of the microflora within all of us ,\u201d Azfali says. \u201cAs we come to understand these diseases more, we\u2019re able to develop newer therapies.\u201d \nFor instance, doctors can now target specific proteins with drugs that can stop inflammation. \nDoctors are also paying more attention to external factors that can impact a person\u2019s condition, like: \nSmokers Versus Nonsmokers Smoking can have a big impact on IBD, especially Crohn\u2019s. Smokers who have Crohn\u2019s have a higher relapse rate than nonsmokers. But smoking has been found to have less of an impact on people with ulcerative colitis (UC), reports the Canadian Society of Intestinal Research . \nAge Crohn\u2019s and ulcerative colitis occur most frequently among people 15 to 30 years old. While treatment for these diseases doesn\u2019t necessarily vary between age groups, other health conditions associated with someone\u2019s age could impact the effects of the disease or interact with IBD treatment. Response time to a type of medication might also be different for an older person. \nCombordities The presence of other illnesses could impact treatment for IBD. For instance, the Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Foundation reports that biologic therapy for IBD could negatively affect someone who has congestive heart failure. Other conditions, like celiac disease and obesity, can impact IBD symptoms and treatment, according to the World Journal of Gastroenterology . As always, it\u2019s crucial to speak with your doctor about other health conditions you may have when seeking IBD treatment. \nAzfali says that it has been a challenge trying to get the medical community to view treatment of IBD in a different way. But, she adds, they\u2019re making progress. \nA personalized medicine approach is not an easy feat, Azfali says, \u201cbut it has been done before. Diabetes folks have done it, rheumatoid arthritis folks have practiced individualized therapy, and they\u2019ve been able to talk more about it in practice in real time,\u201d she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t see pushback from colleagues \u2014 this is about increasing awareness for both providers as well as patients.\u201d A Patient-Driven Approach to Treatment for IBD \nWhen you speak with people who have been impacted by IBD, you get the sense that there is a wide-ranging, supportive community out there. Azfali says this drive to support a personalized medicine approach has really been patient driven. \nThis is a topic very close to Serena Goldsmith\u2019s heart. In her twenties she was diagnosed with both Crohn\u2019s and bipolar disorder . When she was first diagnosed, she was dissatisfied by the \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach to her treatment that she felt didn\u2019t answer her specific needs. \n\u201cMy biggest frustration was how long it took to be correctly diagnosed with Crohn\u2019s disease. It was approximately a year and a half,\u201d she says. \u201cDuring that time, I suffered from inappropriate treatments, such as antibiotics, that made my condition worse, and I lost hope that I would ever get better. There were incorrect assumptions made early on about the cause of my symptoms that should not have been made. There were also times I felt I was not being taken seriously by certain doctors and other providers about my stated physical health concerns because I was also receiving mental health treatment at the same time.\u201d \nIn the years since her diagnoses, Goldsmith has become a public advocate, traveling the country and giving talks on her experience with both conditions. She says that personalized medicine is important in that it can lead to a \u201cgreater likelihood of making an accurate diagnosis.\u201d \n\u201cWhen a doctor or healthcare provider takes the time to get to know me and what my treatment approach preferences are, I feel more hopeful about my prognosis, more empowered to be involved in my own care, and more willing to listen and work with my doctor,\u201d she adds. \u201cI feel that individualizing care is a very important part of the therapeutic relationship between doctor and patient, and helps to develop trust.\u201d \nAzfali says that patient-led advocacy is key. \u201cOur patients have certainly led this drive,\u201d she says. \u201cI think having or being a patient or a loved one who suffers from inflammatory bowel disease helps people see the impact it can have \u2014 how debilitating it can be.\u201d \nAzfali says that this can fuel depression among people with IBD , but that she has been personally inspired by how motivated the IBD community at large has been. \n\u201cI think patient advocacy is extremely important. I am a strong believer in the patient being the expert on him or herself, and taking personal responsibility for one\u2019s own health,\u201d Goldsmith says. \u201cI think of my doctors and myself as a collaborative team that works together to achieve the best possible outcome.\u201d \n\u201cI believe that learning how to become my own advocate, both for my physical health and my mental health, probably saved my life and ended up bringing me a quality of life that was well beyond what I used to think was possible,\u201d she adds. \nAzfali often comes into contact with people like Goldsmith who have become their own powerful health advocates. She says the more voices that are out there, the better. \n\u201cGosh, I love it,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to participate in as many patient events as possible and bring even more awareness about this. The people sharing their stories, the people participating, well they really help change how we ultimately care for patients and manage their IBD.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T16:50:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a42333c307860061b6b7583bed9418a0b29cf4b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2lJIpYloqpJRcicXFP7tteZXU.aKyZxgrpvOnszxHvzwGFAtcCLQxEjnmOKUS0QLooPd9PMc9hMxindSNe7SA7bJtpzMH525X7kxxH0ZYcIQ-", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Can Turmeric Help Ease Ulcerative Colitis Pain? | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Can Turmeric Help Ease Ulcerative Colitis Pain? | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-09T16:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.157, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Can-Turmeric-Help-Ease-UC-Pain-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a42333c307860061b6b7583bed9418a0b29cf4b3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2lJIpYloqpJRcicXFP7tteZXU.aKyZxgrpvOnszxHvzwGFAtcCLQxEjnmOKUS0QLooPd9PMc9hMxindSNe7SA7bJtpzMH525X7kxxH0ZYcIQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ashley Welch", "published": "2017-10-09T16:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can Turmeric Help Ease Ulcerative Colitis Pain? | Everyday Health", "text": "Can Turmeric Help Ease Ulcerative Colitis Pain?

Getty Images \nWhile there are many drugs to ease symptoms of an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) like ulcerative colitis (UC), you may want to add a natural approach to your treatment plan. \nOne option that has been gaining more attention in recent years is turmeric, a spice derived from a plant related to ginger. \n\u201cFor people with mild to moderate symptoms, it may be a tool that helps with the inflammation process,\u201d says Linda Antinoro, RD , at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, who works with patients with IBD. \u201cMore and more doctors are putting turmeric in their repertoire to help treat ulcerative colitis.\u201d \nThat\u2019s because more research is being done looking at its effectiveness as a potential treatment. But so far, the evidence around this is still a bit shaky. What the Research Shows About Turmeric and IBD \nThe majority of studies that show turmeric can help ease UC symptoms have been done in animals. It\u2019s difficult to translate these findings to humans because our bodies work differently than other mammals, but some small studies provide hope that the spice may benefit people, too. \nA study published in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology found that among UC patients in remission, those who took curcumin \u2014 the main substance in turmeric \u2014 had a lower relapse rate than those who took a placebo. \n\u201cOnly 4 percent of patients taking 2 grams per day of curcumin relapsed over six months, compared with 18 percent of patients taking placebo,\u201d explains Alan Moss, MD , an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who coauthored a later review published in 2012 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews , which investigated research looking at curcumin and UC. \nBut because the earlier study only included 89 patients, \u201cthis difference was not statistically significant,\u201d he says. \nA study published in May 2017 in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics found that curcumin was not effective in inducing remission in patients with mild to moderate UC. \nStill, experts like Dr. Moss say more research is warranted to see if turmeric can be beneficial to IBD patients. \nIn the meantime, if people with UC want to try to add curcumin to their treatment plan, they should consult with their healthcare provider. Ways to Incorporate Turmeric in Your Diet \nTalk to your doctor to determine if you should take turmeric supplements, and in what form. Turmeric is available in capsule, fluid extract, or tincture form, with a range of dosage recommendations. \nTo get more turmeric in your diet naturally, Antinoro recommends sprinkling the spice on: Scrambled eggs Oatmeal or cream of wheat Any blended fruit or vegetable smoothies Tomato sauce \nPeople with UC can also add the spice to hot water to make turmeric tea, or to hot milk for turmeric lattes if they are not lactose intolerant. \nFinally, Antinoro emphasizes the importance of speaking with a registered dietitian to make sure your diet is healthy, balanced, and optimal to help with any IBD-related symptoms. \n\u201cUsually when people turn to turmeric they\u2019re embracing it as part of all the lifestyle aspects that can help with ulcerative colitis symptoms,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re learning more about how seasons and spices are part of that healthy eating routine.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lynn grieger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alan moss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antinoro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda antinoro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brigham and women\u2019s hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "research shows about turmeric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinical gastroenterology and hepatology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ibd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cochrane database of systematic reviews", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T22:27:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6d672ce30cafb997c6e373db31f5c69ddf85908", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2Tq6D.8y5noRfenEJiu7NkTFT.v7X_VYg67WjCzwzYXtTAL2nFCyGwyQG66dgOMWRS9tpsRYpwiG0sk6Pr2Ye3JvrEZ0J0dKNAQljcqlUwGWHU_k0Rol3uA--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Top Tips for Staying Body Positive When You Have Crohn's | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Top Tips for Staying Body Positive When You Have Crohn's | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-09T16:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.027, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/How-to-Stay-Body-Positive-When-You-Have-Crohns-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6d672ce30cafb997c6e373db31f5c69ddf85908", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2Tq6D.8y5noRfenEJiu7NkTFT.v7X_VYg67WjCzwzYXtTAL2nFCyGwyQG66dgOMWRS9tpsRYpwiG0sk6Pr2Ye3JvrEZ0J0dKNAQljcqlUwGWHU_k0Rol3uA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laurie Tarkan", "published": "2017-10-09T16:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Top Tips for Staying Body Positive When You Have Crohn's | Everyday Health", "text": "Sign Up for Our Living with Crohn's Disease Newsletter Thanks for signing up!

That is only partly true. \n\u201cThere are moments in life when I\u2019m like, I\u2019ve got this, everything [expletive] rocks!\u201d But, Miller admits, acceptance comes and goes. \u201cThere are times when you have so much hate and internal agony,\u201d she says. \nMiller has had Crohn\u2019s since she was a teenager. At 22, when medications could no longer control the disease, she had ileostomy surgery to remove most of her bowel and was left with a stoma, an opening in the abdomen. She now uses a J-pouch, a bag that is worn outside the body, to collect her waste. \nComing to terms with her pouch, the stoma, surgical scars, and her changed body was a slow process. Before her first surgery, Miller was in such agony because of the severity of her disease that she was thrilled to have her life back. \n\u201cI felt weirdly disconnected but completely okay with the pouch,\u201d she says. \nIn fact, some people have a significant improvement in their body image after surgery, largely because they feel so much better, says Sharon Jedel, PsyD , an assistant professor at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \nBut that\u2019s not always the case. According to a literature review Dr. Jedel coauthored, published in the April 2015 issue of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases , one study found that 73 percent of patients with Crohn\u2019s report some body image concerns. \nFor Miller, acceptance would come and go. When a boyfriend broke up with her because he couldn\u2019t deal with the pouch, it sent her into a self-loathing tailspin. \u201cI thought no one would ever love or want me with this disgusting thing hanging off me,\u201d she says. But she slowly regained her self-confidence. \nHer body image took another hit after her second surgery, when she was 28. She was in a long-term relationship and had a sixth-month-old baby. She needed to repair her bowel, which had perforated during her pregnancy, and her Crohn\u2019s had flared. \n\u201cI hated that my own body had almost taken me away from my family, I hated the new scars. The scars remind you of the horrible path you have been on,\u201d she says. \nIt was a process coming to accept her scars, one that was helped by the gorgeous tattoos she got to camouflage them. \nTo improve her self-confidence, Miller also created a blog , which she launched in January 2016, and later a Facebook page to talk about the emotional side of having Crohn\u2019s. But it was sort of an epiphany during her second pregnancy that moved her from acceptance to posting naked selfies with her pouch and scars on Facebook for all to see. \n\u201cMy photo of me in the bath with my big pregnant belly was the shift for me.\u201d When she snapped the picture, Miller said she felt \u201cgloriously pregnant and sexy. It was the feeling I wanted to share. I wanted to show a sexy photo that clearly showed my bag. I wanted others to feel empowered, sexy, and amazing,\u201d she says. \nMost of Miller\u2019s body positivity comes from her own hard work, but she also says that her husband is very supportive. \n\u201cHe\u2019s helped me a lot with being comfortable sexually,\u201d Miller says. \u201cAt the beginning, I was so anxious and would hold my hand over the bag or try to cover it up, but he\u2019d always slap my hand away and shush me when I was being overly self-conscious.\u201d \nMiller has inspired thousands of people \u2014 her Facebook page, Bag Lady Mama , has more than 35,000 followers. \u201cWhen I was first diagnosed I thought to myself, justified to myself, that this had to have happened to me so that I could help others,\u201d she says. What Contributes to Poor Body Image in People With IBD \nIt\u2019s not just the surgical scars and the bag that can damage body image. The symptoms of Crohn\u2019s can also make people feel self-conscious. Having fecal incontinence, having to constantly run to the bathroom, and having gas can be embarrassing and contribute to feelings of shame, says Jedel. \u201cIBD is not a sexy disease. People can speak about their cancer, but people aren\u2019t talking about poop or constipation or gas. There\u2019s an added element of shame, because the symptoms are a taboo subject.\u201d \nSome of the medications don\u2019t help, either. According to the same review in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, steroids have side effects, such as depression, weight gain, fluid retention, acne, and increased facial hair, all of which can damage body image. Ways to Improve Body Image If You Have Crohn\u2019s Disease \nPoor body image is associated with depression and anxiety as well as issues with sexuality, so it\u2019s important to try to work on how you feel about your body to maintain health. Here are some tips to get you started. Allow time to grieve. Miller advises people with Crohn\u2019s to be patient with themselves. It takes time to recover mentally to the changes in your body. \u201cYour body is not what you've known for however many years, and it takes time to get to know the new version of you,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to grieve, and [expletive] anyone who tries to slow or rush that process.\u201d It\u2019s very similar to a mourning process, according to Jedel. \u201cYou\u2019re grieving over the loss caused by the changes in your body,\u201d she says. Allow any emotions to be present, such as loss, anger, envy, sadness, or anxiety, says Jedel. Some people can do this on their own, and others may need a therapist to get them through this process. \u201cThrough mourning and grieving, ultimately you come to a place of acceptance about your own body and how different it is,\u201d she says. Appreciate your renewed health. Surgery is usually a last resort when all other treatment options have failed to bring you relief. Try to focus on how much better you feel and the things you can do now that perhaps you couldn\u2019t do before. Sometimes it helps to keep a gratitude list of all the things that you have in your life today thanks to surgery. Resist cultural beauty ideals. You may encounter negative reactions from people, but it\u2019s important not to let these views infiltrate your own acceptance of your body. \u201cBody image is a significant problem in our society to begin with, and it interferes with the healing process,\u201d says Jedel. Like Miller, Jedel suggests that other women with a J-pouch develop a broader sense of what beauty is and what constitutes attractiveness. \nAs Miller, who has done battle with her body image and won, says, \u201cOne day this is all you will know and it will be perfect and you will feel amazing.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T22:27:45.025+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b9fc11009e06addc3181e354d186e856898f540", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2lJIpYloqpJRcicXFP7tteZXU.aKyZxgrTclzLiNgCxz7k9n0GfdO9JjOZNqqb1pFLdC5fcEXnT0vubIoCtim2760MfcgYD3l", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "5 Fall Food Swaps to Prevent Digestive Pain for People with UC | Everyday Health", "title_full": "5 Fall Food Swaps to Prevent Digestive Pain for People with UC | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-10T16:44:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.916, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/TK-Fall-Foods-to-Avoid-If-You-Have-UC-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b9fc11009e06addc3181e354d186e856898f540", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2lJIpYloqpJRcicXFP7tteZXU.aKyZxgrTclzLiNgCxz7k9n0GfdO9JjOZNqqb1pFLdC5fcEXnT0vubIoCtim2760MfcgYD3l", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sheryl Kraft", "published": "2017-10-10T16:44:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 Fall Food Swaps to Prevent Digestive Pain for People with UC | Everyday Health", "text": "5 Fall Food Swaps to Prevent Digestive Pain for People with UC Fall favorites, like cider and butternut squash, can aggravate ulcerative colitis symptoms.

Please select a newsletter Chili is a great fall food that can be modified for people with ulcerative colitis. iStock.com \nWhile foods don\u2019t cause ulcerative colitis (UC), they do have the potential for triggering flares. That\u2019s because your body can mistake food for a foreign invader, setting off a series of uncomfortable symptoms, like inflammation, diarrhea, cramping, and pain. \n\u201cMost often, the foods causing discomfort are those that are more difficult to digest, like those high in fat or fiber,\u201d says Kelly Kennedy, RD , dietitian for Everyday Health, adding that spicy foods seasoned with things like cayenne, crushed pepper, or paprika are also problematic. \nModifying your diet can help prevent painful flares . \n\u201cIt\u2019s always a good idea to keep a food journal to help figure out which foods may be causing issues,\u201d advises Kennedy. \nWhile everyone is different, and not everyone will be affected by the same foods and beverages, these five fall foods are generally more problematic than others: 1. Apple Cider \nAutumn is the perfect time to find bountiful supplies of apples in grocery stores and at farmers markets. While you can eat these sweet fruits whole \u2014 minus the skin \u2014 a lot of people also enjoy pressing them into a cider. But cider is high in sugar, which can cause inflammation and aggravate diarrhea in people with UC. \nIf you\u2019re craving that rich apple taste, try an unsweetened baked apple sprinkled with cinnamon, suggests Kennedy. \n\u201cBaked apples contain less sugar,\u201d she says. \u201cBut make sure to leave the peel behind, since it\u2019s high in fiber.\u201d 2. Chicken-Broccoli Casserole \nThe combination of protein and crunchy cruciferous vegetables pairs well in a casserole. But this dish is high in fat and fiber from added ingredients, like cream, mayonnaise, and broccoli, which makes it difficult to digest and creates gas. \nInstead, make a casserole from baked chicken and white rice, and add vegetables that are lower in fiber, like yellow squash or green beans. White rice can also help improve inflammatory bowel disease symptoms better than other foods, according to a study published in May 2014 in the journal Digestive Disease and Science . 3. Chili \nThis spicy stew warms the kitchen with its rich aroma, but it can cause a fire in your gut because of added spice. Also, the vegetables and beans in chili contain insoluble fiber , which can cause more bloating, diarrhea, gas, and pain. \nA good alternative is chicken noodle soup , which is full of lean protein and low-fiber carbohydrates. \n\u201cMake sure to peel the carrots and celery,\u201d advises Kennedy, who adds that the broth provides hydration and some sodium, which is beneficial if you have active diarrhea. But, she warns, \u201cBeware of onions and garlic, which can be more difficult on the stomach.\u201d 4. Kettle Corn or Popcorn Balls \nAlthough this snack is crispy, satisfying, and easy to make, you\u2019re better off crunching on something else. Popcorn is a whole grain, and high in fiber. Its tough kernel can scrape and irritate the intestine as it\u2019s digested, worsening inflammation. \nInstead, Kennedy suggests pretzels made with white flour. Avoid whole-wheat and seasoned varieties, \u201cand look for pretzels with salt if you have active diarrhea,\u201d which can help replace lost sodium, Kennedy says. 5. Butternut Squash Macaroni and Cheese \nMixing macaroni and cheese with a fall vegetable, like butternut squash, adds an earthy twist to this classic childhood favorite. But squash is high in fiber, and the cheese can be an issue for those with lactose intolerance. \nAn alternative is to mix plain white pasta with one to two tablespoons of pumpkin. Kennedy advises to use fresh pumpkin, which has less fiber than the canned variety. \u201cTopping it with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese can make the flavor pop,\u201d she adds.

Please select a newsletter We respect your privacy . For preventing or controlling diabetes, certain kinds of caffeinated drinks are more beneficial than others, studies suggest. Thinkstock (3) \nNavigating what you can and cannot eat and drink when you have type 2 diabetes can be tricky. Of course, there\u2019s the obvious stuff you know is good to cut out or limit in your diet, like processed sweets and other refined carbohydrates, which can cause blood sugar levels to soar when eaten in excess. But what about those murkier diet staples, which seem to straddle the line between healthy and indulgent, but are ingrained in so many of our everyday rituals? \nFor millions of people in various cultures around the world, caffeinated drinks are likely the sort of thing that comes to mind when we talk about food or drinks in a healthy diabetes diet that aren\u2019t so cut-and-dried. If you\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or have been living with the disease for a while and are seeking better blood sugar control, the subject of caffeine in a diabetes diet is a fair concern. Caffeinated Drinks for Diabetes: Are They Safe? \n\u201cFor people already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, studies have shown caffeine consumption decreases insulin sensitivity and raises blood sugar levels,\u201d says Toby Smithson, RDN, CDE , who is based in Hilton Head, South Carolina. According to a review published in April 2017 in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews , five out of seven trials studied found that caffeine increases blood glucose and keeps levels higher longer. \nThat doesn\u2019t sound good, but if you\u2019re accustomed to having your morning java, don\u2019t skip out on the drink just yet. Some studies suggest that other components of caffeinated coffee may offer some benefits for people with diabetes. In a study published in March 2016 in the International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences , researchers looked at coffee consumption in adults with and without diabetes. They found that among coffee drinkers in both groups, uric acid levels were lower than they were in people who did not drink coffee. \nThat\u2019s a positive thing because high uric acid levels may be linked to diabetes, and may also be associated with a greater risk of heart disease and end-stage renal disorder, they point out. It may be the chlorogenic acids, which are powerful antioxidants, within the java that increase insulin sensitivity and offer this protection, researchers hypothesized. \nAnd if you haven\u2019t been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, sipping caffeinated drinks may be one habit you want to keep. Research published in February 2014 in the European Journal of Nutrition found that for every two cups consumed per day, participants\u2019 risk for type 2 diabetes decreased by 12 and 11 percent, when drinking caffeinated and decaf coffee, respectively. This suggests there are other good-for-you substances in coffee at play, not just caffeine. \nThe same goes for many types of tea, which is another good choice for people with diabetes. \u201cBoth coffee and tea have some extra benefits because they contain antioxidants, which act like soldiers to protect our body by increasing our immune system defense and repairing damage,\u201d Smithson says. \nGreen tea in particular may also help lower type 2 diabetes risk, likely because it's rich in a substance called EGCG, according to a study published in June 2013 in the journal Diabetes & Metabolism . Meanwhile, a review published in the International Journal of Obesity suggested swigging the green variety may help trim your waistline \u2014 another plus for diabetes, considering losing just 5 to 7 percent of your body weight can help prevent prediabetes from progressing to full-blown type 2 diabetes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) . \nIn terms of this weight-loss perk, \u201cgreen tea can be a beneficial beverage, but you have to be cautious about using sugar or honey in the tea. Remember to account for the added carbohydrates,\u201d Smithson says. The Best and Worst of These Drinks for Diabetes \nBut not all sources of caffeine are created equal. Regular soda , for instance, isn\u2019t ideal in a diabetes diet. Relatively speaking, the drink doesn\u2019t have a lot of caffeine \u2014 33 milligrams (mg) per can \u2014 but it does have about 37 grams (g) of sugar, which is roughly equivalent to 9 teaspoons of added sweet stuff. For people with diabetes, this added sugar and regular soda\u2019s refined carbs can easily destabilize blood sugar levels. \nAlso important, a study published in November 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health credits soft drinks like soda to rising obesity rates worldwide, an effect that is linked with insulin resistance, the hallmark of type 2 diabetes. \nDiet soda might not be all that innocent either. Smithson points out that while these beverages are a better choice than regular soda, they don\u2019t contain the natural health benefits that coffee and tea do. Plus, some research links regular consumption of artificially sweetened drinks to a greater risk for metabolic disease and type 2 diabetes. Nonetheless, diet soda contains zero added sugars, so in moderation, it can fit into the diet of someone who has diabetes, Smithson notes. \nPerhaps the worst caffeinated drink for people with diabetes? That would be energy drinks, which are essentially glorified sodas with added vitamins. An 8-ounce can has 27 g of sugar and 28 g of carbs, suggesting that virtually all of the carbs come from sugar and making it a poor choice for diabetes, says Smithson. \u201cEnergy drinks that contain carbohydrate and calories will affect blood sugar levels and may increase body weight, making controlling blood sugar readings more difficult,\u201d she says. \nAnd while these drinks often contain large amounts of vitamins, \u201cit\u2019s best to get vitamins and minerals from food, as nutrients are better absorbed through food,\u201d she says. Not to mention, energy drinks can also contain twice the caffeine as a cup of coffee. How Much Caffeine Is Okay to Drink for Blood Sugar Control? \nWhen it comes to reaping the potential health benefits of safe sources of caffeine, it\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all recommendation for people with diabetes. Because blood sugar responses vary from person to person \u2014 and caffeine doesn\u2019t raise everyone\u2019s blood sugar levels to the same degree \u2014 Smithson advises her patients to do some \u201cinvestigative reporting\u201d to find out how the caffeine in their drink of choice impacts them. \nTo do this, check your blood sugar reading before and after consuming a cup of coffee, tea, or diet soda. \u201cTry to keep consistent with what you\u2019re eating along with the beverage, to rule out the rise in blood sugar level from a food source,\u201d she says. \nAlso know that \u201cit takes about 200 mg of caffeine, or two cups of coffee, to affect blood sugar,\u201d Smithson says. If your blood sugar rises too high after consuming caffeine, you may need to scale back. For example, have one cup of coffee instead of two, or go for a half-caffeinated variety, and see if your body is better able to tolerate it. After all, research published in May 2012 in the New England Journal of Medicine links regular coffee drinking, regardless of whether the java is caffeinated, to a longer life. \nAlso important to note is that if you also have high blood pressure, as two-thirds of people with diabetes do, says Smithson, you may also have to check your blood sugar reading before and after consuming caffeine to make sure the ingredient is not causing blood pressure to spike. \nOne more consideration: If you like coffee and have high cholesterol, Smithson explains that the oils in French press coffee may raise LDL, or \u201cbad,\u201d cholesterol levels in some people who drink more than two cups a day. Indeed, some research supports the idea that French pressed, or unfiltered coffee, may have this effect. In this case, drip coffee can be a smarter option. \nBottom line: \u201cLearn how your body reacts to caffeine by monitoring your blood sugar and blood pressure before and after drinking the beverage,\u201d she says. That\u2019s going to be the best way to find out what your body can safely handle.

Please select a newsletter Would you be getting the same treatment if you were younger? Simon Jarratt/Getty Images \nSeveral studies in recent years have suggested that older cancer patients might not receive the same standard of care as younger patients. The latest piece of research to raise the possibility that ageism plays a role in cancer care involved patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the United Kingdom. \nIn the new study, published in the September 2017 issue of the journal Clinical Oncology , the researchers found that out of 317 patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, 263 were eligible for advanced radiation therapy, as recommended by the United Kingdom's national guidelines. However, only half of the 263 actually went on to receive the recommended radiotherapy. \nThe median age of the patients in the study was 72, and 178 of them, or 56 percent, were 70 or older. Those 70 and older were less likely to receive the guideline-recommended radiotherapy than patients under 70 \u2014 40 percent versus 60 percent, respectively. \nNSCLC is by far the most common type of lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among both men and women in the United States and in the United Kingdom. The disease is seen mainly in older individuals. In the United Kingdom, nearly two-thirds of those diagnosed with NSCLC are at least 70 years old, according to the authors of the new study. In the United States, the average age of a lung cancer diagnosis is 70 , the American Cancer Society says. After surgery, radiation therapy is the second most commonly used treatment to cure NSCLC. \nA number of papers have been written about ageism in medicine, particularly in cancer care. For example, U.S. researchers published a study in the March 2012 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology involving patients with high-risk colon cancer. It found that those who were older and had other health problems were less likely to be offered adjuvant chemotherapy, which is recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment guidelines. \nWhether those findings or the ones in the recent study show that physicians discriminate against patients on the basis of age isn\u2019t cut and dry, says Jonathan McAleese, MBBS, the first author of the U.K. study and an oncologist at Belfast City Hospital in Ireland. \nOther health problems, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, typically worsen in people as they age, and the fact that it may be more difficult to recover from chemotherapy given age-related changes to the immune system could also explain why they don\u2019t get guideline-recommended treatments, says Dr. McAleese. Therapy needs to be tailored to the whole patient, not just the cancer, he says. \nIn the new study, physicians didn\u2019t recommend the treatments as frequently to those 70 and older largely because the patients would have had difficulty traveling to the radiation center. However, McAleese\u2019s team found that even when the treatments were offered, older patients were more likely than younger patients to decline them. \nTo help make sure that they get appropriate treatments, older cancer patients should ask a family member to accompany them to doctor\u2019s appointments, McAleese advises. \n\u201cI have certainly had patients and relatives ask a question along these lines: 'If I was 10 years younger, would the treatments available to me be any different, and why would that be?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI found it helped with the consultation, rather than hindered it.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jonathan mcaleese", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcaleese", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsclc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal of clinical oncology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national comprehensive cancer network", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belfast city hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T03:22:27.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2894347476ab9a27e514e3d2fe38b6386ea70a64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2uNGv.aA1RUi51ZE_8DAYTtqBSFa088voUsWBpYouiUuuhFa7ZHiB37yPcMjfCbjyG31yICBc.MGiLyMIHJmKeEyFgukjqJMCIoj4vkz.z8Q-", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "How Does Diabetes Affect the Digestive System? | Everyday Health", "title_full": "How Does Diabetes Affect the Digestive System? | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-10T12:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.698, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Top-Tips-Caring-for-Digestive-Health-with-Diabetes-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 18, "comments": 0, "shares": 18}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2894347476ab9a27e514e3d2fe38b6386ea70a64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2uNGv.aA1RUi51ZE_8DAYTtqBSFa088voUsWBpYouiUuuhFa7ZHiB37yPcMjfCbjyG31yICBc.MGiLyMIHJmKeEyFgukjqJMCIoj4vkz.z8Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Stephanie Bucklin", "published": "2017-10-10T12:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Does Diabetes Affect the Digestive System? | Everyday Health", "text": "Everyday Health Type 2 Diabetes How Does Diabetes Affect the Digestive System?

Please select a newsletter Neuropathy, a complication of diabetes, can affect more than just your hands and feet. Thinkstock \nIf you\u2019ve recently been diagnosed with diabetes or have been living with the disease for a while, you\u2019re more than likely familiar with possible complications, like kidney disease, vision loss, and even amputations. But it\u2019s important to note that poorly controlled type 2 diabetes can also affect other parts of your body, including your digestive system, and that the longer you\u2019ve lived with diabetes, the more likely it may be that you could experience these types of problems. \nIn fact, some research suggests 75 percent of people visiting diabetes clinics report having significant gastrointestinal symptoms. How Diabetic Neuropathy Can Lead to Heartburn and Other Issues \nSo how might diabetes affect the digestive system? \u201cAdvanced diabetes, whether it\u2019s from type 1 or type 2 diabetes, can affect any organ in the body \u2014 including those organs in the digestive tract,\u201d says James C. Reynolds, MD , a gastroenterology specialist and clinical medicine professor at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \nDr. Reynolds notes digestive problems may be caused by the very factors that led to diabetes in the first place, such as obesity, but it\u2019s also possible that digestive problems are the result of diabetes-related complications, such as hyperglycemia , or high blood sugar. \nOne of the most serious diabetes complications that can result from consistent high blood sugar is diabetic neuropathy , or nerve damage. Neuropathy may lead to weakness, pain, and numbness, affecting feeling in your feet, legs, and hands, but the condition can also affect digestive functions like swallowing and constipation, Reynolds explains. \nIf you have diabetes, this potential complication is just another reason it\u2019s crucial to pay attention to your A1C , the average level of glucose over the past two to three months, Reynolds says. 3 Digestive Problems Linked With Type 2 Diabetes \nHere are a few of the conditions that advanced diabetes and poorly controlled blood sugar may lead to: Acid Reflux (GERD) \nThe stomach contains an incredibly concentrated amount of hydrochloric acid, and if it doesn\u2019t routinely empty that acid, your gastric juices back up, causing damage to your esophagus that can lead to acid reflux, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) , Reynolds says. Obesity is one potential cause of these symptoms, though hyperglycemia can also damage nerves along the digestive tract that interfere with this gastric emptying, he says. \nReynolds notes that common symptoms of acid reflux include chest pain and difficulty swallowing, though more serious complications include a precancerous condition known as Barrett\u2019s esophagus, which could lead to a deadly form of esophagus cancer. \nTreatment includes medication, lifestyle changes, like losing weight and quitting smoking, and potentially \u2014 as a last resort \u2014 surgery. Gastroparesis \nIf your stomach is not emptying correctly, you may experience not only acid reflux in your esophagus but also gastroparesis in your stomach, Reynolds says. \n\u201cGastroparesis is a disease in which the stomach cannot empty itself of food in a normal fashion,\u201d says Michael Cline, DO , the medical director of the multidisciplinary gastroparesis clinic at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. \nSymptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, abdominal bloating and pain, weight loss, and acid reflux itself, according to the Mayo Clinic . Dr. Cline notes that this is a common condition in people who have had diabetes for a long time, regardless of whether it is well controlled, but it's unclear why these individuals have more sensitive stomachs. \nAccording to a review published in March 2015 in the journal Gastroenterology Clinics of North America , women are more likely to deal with gastroparesis than men (about 38 women per 100,000 people versus about 10 men per 100,000 people), and those people with type 1 diabetes are more likely to have the disease than people with type 2 diabetes (about 5 percent of people with type 1 versus about 1 percent of people with type 2). \nTreatments for gastroparesis include diet changes, such as skipping high-fat or high-fiber foods, medication to help the stomach empty food faster, and surgery. Diabetes Enteroneuropathy \nThis condition is caused by damage to nerves in your gut, and can sometimes mimic symptoms of the more commonly known irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) , such as constipation and diarrhea, Reynolds says. When glucose levels become excessive in the bloodstream, glucose is deposited onto nerves and become like a syrup that poisons the inside of these cells, he explains. \u201cIf that persists for a very long time, the nerves can actually die off,\u201d and that damage to nerves in your gut can also cause other serious complications to diabetes, including kidney dysfunction and retinopathy, or damage to eyes. \nAccording to a review published in June 2015 in the journal Revista Espa\u00f1ola de Enfermedades Digestivas , treatment can include strategies such as decreasing fat and fiber consumption, taking medication that speed up the stomach\u2019s emptying, or using electrical stimulation via a device implanted during surgery. Gut Check: How to Prevent or Control Digestive Issues in Diabetes \nBut just because you have diabetes doesn\u2019t mean you have to resign yourself to digestive problems as well. To help keep your digestive system in working order, follow these tips: \nKeep your blood sugar tightly controlled. Whether you\u2019re looking to prevent or control digestive problems when you have diabetes, it is most important to rigorously pay attention to control blood sugar and keep your A1C within a healthy range, Reynolds says. \u201cA1C elevation is directly proportional to the level at which esophageal function and gastric function is impaired,\u201d he says. Everyone\u2019s A1C goal is different \u2014 talk to your doctor to learn yours. \nChoose a healthy diet low in sugar and refined carbs. \u201cA diet high in refined sugar can mess up the gut bacteria ,\u201d Cline says. He recommends staying away from foods high in saturated fat and refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, pasta, and rice, as well as processed sweets and snacks, like refined pastries and granola bars. \nResearch also suggests eating a healthy diet could help minimize disease progression, which is associated with neuropathy. A study published in April 2017 in the journal Nature , for instance, found that a certain substance produced by gut microbes is associated with a reduced likelihood of progression of type 2 diabetes in overweight people with prediabetes . That substance, indolepropionic acid, is linked with dietary fiber intake, the authors noted. \nIt's well known that prioritizing foods high in fiber \u2014 such as berries, whole grains, beans, and veggies like broccoli and artichokes \u2014 can be beneficial for people with diabetes. For one, fiber isn't digested by the body, so it helps slow the rise of blood sugar. Plus, high-fiber foods are satiating, so eating them can help keep your weight in check. \nEat small, frequent meals throughout the day. Doing so will help with symptoms of acid reflux and gastroparesis, Reynolds says. Instead of eating a full meal in one sitting, consider eating only half and saving the rest for later. \nTry not to lie down after eating a meal. Although you may feel sleepy after eating, resist the urge to lie down. Staying upright sitting, standing, or walking for two to three hours after eating will prevent just-eaten food and stomach from backing up into your throat if you have acid reflux, Reynolds says. \nDon\u2019t ignore your GI symptoms. If you are experiencing gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort, make sure you seek medical help and advice from your doctor. For instance, acid reflux symptoms may sometimes be due to other causes, like an infection of candida, so it\u2019s important to get your symptoms checked out before they get worse, Reynolds says. Preventing Digestive Issues in Diabetes: The Bottom Line \n\u201cKeeping blood sugar under control is key to prevent gastrointestinal issues from occurring,\u201d Cline says. \nIf you have any symptoms, make sure to reach out to your medical team: \u201cWith gastroparesis, it\u2019s especially important to treat it early,\u201d Cline explains. \u201cWith time and if left untreated, more nerve damage to the intestine occurs.\u201d By communicating with your providers, you can settle on a course of treatment and help prevent any severe complications.

Bernd Vogel/Getty Images \nStudying more than 1,600 middle-aged men in Finland, researchers found that those who took sauna baths four to seven times a week cut their risk of high blood pressure by nearly half, compared to once-a-week sauna bathers. \n\"Sauna bathing may decrease systemic blood pressure through different biological mechanisms,\" said study researcher Jari Laukkanen, a professor at the University of Eastern Finland, and colleagues. \nIn the sauna, your body temperature rises, widening the blood vessels. Over time, this appears to improve the function of the inside layer of blood vessels, the researchers explained. Sauna baths also remove fluid from the body through sweating, and relax the body and mind, the researchers added. \nThe research team used data from follow-up on the men over an average of 22 years. During that time, about 15 percent of the participants developed high blood pressure. \nRELATED: Is Rheumatoid Arthritis Hiding Your Blood Pressure? \nCompared with men who had a sauna only once a week, the risk of high blood pressure was 46 percent lower in those who had a sauna four to seven times a week. \nRisk of high blood pressure was 24 percent lower in those who had a sauna two to three times a week, according to the study. \nHowever, the research only found an association between better blood pressure and routine sauna use, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. \nHigh blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. The same researchers previously found that frequent saunas reduce the risk of heart-related death and death from all causes. \nThe study findings were published recently in the American Journal of Hypertension .

Masterfile \nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with lung cancer, the first thing you and your doctor will need to decide \u2014 according to your test results \u2014 is whether you\u2019ll be treated first with chemotherapy, a targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. \nIt used to be that all patients diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer automatically got chemotherapy (a combination of intravenous anti-cancer drugs). \nThese days, about a third of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer are treated first with targeted therapy or immunotherapy if their tumors test positive for mutations or markers that suggest they\u2019ll respond well to these treatments. \nThe remaining two-thirds are treated with chemotherapy first and then, if the cancer doesn\u2019t respond well enough, they\u2019re treated with immunotherapy too. \nHere\u2019s what to expect from a chemotherapy experience. \nHow long it will last Non-small-cell lung cancer patients generally receive four months of chemotherapy, then take a break, says David Graham, MD , a medical oncologist at the Levine Cancer Institute in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cChemo is usually given in \u2018cycles,\u2019 and depending on the recipe, it may be 1 to 3 days every 3 to 4 weeks. There are some that are given weekly, but that is less common. And then we see where we are,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will go as long as we can without treating again. We need to balance the effect against the cancer and the effect against the patient.\u201d For some patients with advanced cancer, after finishing 4 to 6 cycles of combination chemotherapy (2 to 3 drugs given on the same day every three weeks), doctors will suggest that continuing 1 or 2 of the drugs, which typically have fewer side effects, indefinitely; for some cancers this prolongs the time before it's necessary to try a new treatment. \nDrugs you might get In non-small-cell lung cancer, oncologists look at what kind of cells are involved, such as squamous cells, adenocarcinoma cells, or unspecified large cells, then tailor the treatment to the specific cells, depending on what the pathology is. Drugs can be taken orally or intravenously. There are several regimens of chemotherapy used for lung cancer, says Dr. Graham. \nAll regimens usually contain a platinum-based drug such as Platinol (cisplatin) or Paraplatin (carboplatin) , and another drug such as Alimta (pemetrexed) . Other drugs used may include Taxotere (docetaxel) , Taxol (paclitaxel) , and Gemzar (gemcitabine) . All the drugs mentioned here are given intravenously. \nSide effects you may experience Chemotherapy drugs are notoriously tough to take. They work by killing off cancer cells, but can kill off cells in other parts of the body as well, leading to some unpleasant side effects. Upset stomach Queasiness, nausea, and vomiting are the most common side effects of chemotherapy, says Graham. \u201cBut we are much better at controlling that now.\u201d Zofran is commonly prescribed to combat these side effects. \u201cThis drug really revolutionized how we are able to give chemotherapy,\u201d he says. \u201cBefore Zofran, we had to put people in the hospital and basically sedate them to give them their chemotherapy.\u201d Many other antinausea medications have been developed in the last few decades that are able to control nausea should Zofran not work. Hair loss This tends to be more prevalent with Taxotere or paclitaxel, says Graham. \u201cBut it\u2019s just temporary and [the hair] often comes back before chemotherapy ends.\u201d Kidney damage This can happen with cisplatin, particularly if the patient doesn\u2019t get enough fluid during treatment. \u201cWe make sure they are watched closely and we keep the tank full,\u201d said Graham. \u201cWe can do that intravenously.\u201d Neutropenia Chemotherapy can be hard on the bone marrow, causing low platelet counts and low white blood cells. If counts get too low, there is an increased risk of infection. \u201cBlood counts may be checked mid-cycle the first cycle but not usually after that,\u201d says Graham. \u201cThere are some folks who tell patients to avoid crowds, etc. but I do not,\u201d he says. \u201cMost infections that occur from a too-low white count come from bacteria already inside a person. It\u2019s not from someone who sneezes across the mall or in church.\u201d Neuropathy Numbness or weakness in the fingers and toes can happen with some of the platinum drugs and the taxanes (docetaxel and paclitaxel), which can also damage nerves. \u201cIt can be a problem, and it can take a long time for the nerves to grow back and heal, says Graham. \u201cThe neuropathy can feel like the hands or feet have \u2018fallen asleep,\u2019 and it can lead to trouble holding onto or grabbing things, as well as trouble walking.\u201d At this time, \u201cwe do not have any good treatments for neuropathy.\u201d Hearing loss This one isn\u2019t very common, but it can happen. Graham says occasionally a couple will come to him and say \u201cHe or she doesn\u2019t listen to me any longer,\u201d says Graham. \u201cI\u2019ve occasionally had to intervene between spouses and say \u2018I have to take the blame for that.\u2019\u201d Keep in Mind \nIf you are experiencing health issues related to your chemo medication, speak up.

Thinkstock \nThough the majority of children with congenital heart disease survive into adulthood, they often struggle with a number of lifelong illnesses, researchers report. \nThe health issues may include neurodevelopment disorders such as autism , respiratory problems, and/or heart arrhythmias. \n\"We are great at fixing the plumbing, but not at fixing the patient,\" said study author Martina Brueckner, a professor of pediatrics and genetics at the Yale School of Medicine. \nBrueckner and her team pointed out that congenital heart disease affects roughly 1 percent of newborns. About 90 percent will make it into adulthood. \nBut a new genetic analysis that involved nearly 2,900 congenital heart disease survivors and their family members revealed that being born with that specific condition appears to be associated with a higher risk for developing other major health problems. \nRELATED: Mediterranean Diet Plus Olive Oil a Boost to Heart Health? \nMany genes already implicated in autism were also associated with congenital heart disease, and the scientists also found new genes that were linked to congenital heart disease in some patients. \nBut the study did not prove that heart defects at birth caused these other illnesses, it just showed an association. \nAlso, the analysis suggested that some respiratory ailments found in patients with congestive heart failure are linked to defects in cilia, the hairlike structures on the surface of cells that carry out many biological functions. \n\"It has been frustrating to see one patient recover nicely and another with the exact same heart defect struggle,\" Brueckner said in a Yale news release. \"This type of study helps us understand why and is a step toward personalized treatment.\" \nThe findings could help with counseling for affected families regarding the risk for recurrence of congestive heart disease, the researchers said. \nBrueckner and her colleagues reported their findings in the Oct. 9 issue of Nature Genetics .

Please select a newsletter Light cigarettes are just as dangerous as the regular kind. Thinkstock \nAbout 50 years ago, smokers were introduced to a new cigarette with tiny ventilation holes in the filter that, manufacturers claimed, would cut the amount of tar entering their lungs. The cigarettes with filter ventilation, dubbed \"light,\" were a hit. Smokers assumed they were using a product that was less likely to harm their health. \nToday, emerging research argues that \u201clight\u201d cigarettes backfired badly. A study published in May 2017 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute analyzed decades of data on filter ventilation and low-tar cigarettes concluded that those products actually increased a type of lung cancer called adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a type of non\u2013small cell lung cancer and is the most common type of lung cancer. \nToday, approximately 80 percent of smokers use light cigarettes, says the lead author of the study, Peter Shields, MD , deputy director of the Comprehensive Cancer Center at The Ohio State University and a lung oncologist at the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute in Columbus. \n\u201cVentilation holes made for a smoother smoke,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the way these products were advertised: If you can\u2019t quit, then switch to light cigarettes. Everyone bought into that, including the public health community.\u201d \nBut statistics show that lung cancer cases continued to rise as smokers switched to light cigarettes. New cases of lung cancer rose from around 52 per 100,000 people in 1975 to 69.2 per 100,000 in 1991, according to government statistics. The U.S. Surgeon General reported in 2014 that cases of adenocarcinoma, specifically, were rising and had become the most common form of the disease. Decades ago, the most common type of lung cancer was squamous cell carcinoma. \nAlso, Dr. Shields says, data from tobacco companies submitted in court cases showed possible increased harm from cigarettes. Filters were touted as a way to trap tar, which would reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals from entering the lungs. But instead, two mechanisms appear to make filtered cigarettes more dangerous than nonfiltered cigarettes. \nFirst, the tiny ventilation holes allow smoke to mix with air, and smokers may inhale more deeply when smoking ventilated cigarettes, perhaps to overcompensate for the reduction in nicotine, Shields says. Smoking machine tests performed on filtered cigarettes showed a reduced intake of smoke. But, he notes, machines aren\u2019t people. \nThe second factor is that filtered cigarette smoke has a different chemical makeup. \u201cThe chemistry changes,\u201d Shields says. \u201cWith more ventilation, the cigarette burns less quickly and less hot. That makes more bad chemicals (nitrosamines). The relative proportion in smoke of the bad chemicals changes and goes up. Areas of the lungs more sensitive to adenocarcinoma are affected.\u201d \nShields and his research team have applied for a large grant to expand upon the research. They seek to show how there are \u201cunintended consequences\u201d to public health with the continued use of filtered cigarettes. \nWhile tobacco companies can no longer advertise filtered cigarettes as \u201clight\u201d or \u201cmild,\u201d or as safer, the package colors and designs that help identify filtered cigarettes have remained the same, and many smokers continue to believe that filtered cigarettes are less harmful, he says. \n\u201cThe public still believes filtered cigarettes are healthier,\u201d he says. \u201cI had patient say to me the other day, \u2018I can\u2019t quit, so I switched to a light cigarette.\u2019\u201d \nIn late July, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a comprehensive plan for tobacco and nicotine regulation, part of its strengthened authority to regulate tobacco products . High on the agency\u2019s to-do list is to lower nicotine levels in cigarettes to nonaddictive levels. That\u2019s a start, Shields says. But his recent journal article argues for tighter regulation of filtered cigarettes. Despite the known risks, 15.8 percent of Americans ages 18 and older smoke cigarettes.

Please select a newsletter Everyone, including people with type 2 diabetes, needs carbs to fuel the body for exercise. iStock.com \nIf you have diabetes, you know that counting and cutting carbs is nothing new. But there\u2019s such a thing as cutting carbs too much. \nThat\u2019s especially true if you\u2019re working out with diabetes \u2014 which you should, considering that exercise is a great way to naturally improve your body\u2019s blood sugar control and insulin sensitivity, per a position statement from the American Diabetes Association published in November 2016 i n Diabetes Care . After all, carbs provide essential energy to the body, and you can\u2019t exercise, or at least not well, without them! \nEven more important, if you don\u2019t have enough carbs before and during your workouts, you put yourself at risk of hypoglycemia , or excessively low blood sugar. And the last thing you want is to faint when you\u2019re under the bench-press bar. \nHere, experts explain exactly how carbs can affect your workout performance and blood sugar , and how to approach both: Why Your Body Craves Carbs When Working Out \n\u201cCarbs are an important source of fuel and provide the body with a quick burst of energy,\u201d says Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDE , a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. That\u2019s significant even for sedentary activities \u2014 and why the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine recommends that adults consume 130 grams (g) of carbohydrates per day, spaced out between meals \u2014 but becomes increasingly meaningful when fueling yourself for exercise. This rule also applies to people with diabetes, whose carb recommendations need to be individualized but whose diets ought to include them all the same. \nDuring exercise, the bulk of your body\u2019s energy comes from carbohydrates, both those floating through your bloodstream in the form of blood glucose and those stored in your liver and muscles as glycogen, Sheth says. The longer and harder you work during any given workout, the more carbohydrates your organs and muscles need to stay energized, with research published in November 2013 in Sports Medicine showing that increasing carb intake can boost not only marathon performances but high-intensity intervals as well. \nWhether you are looking to lose weight, build muscle , or improve your insulin and cardiovascular health , the more you can put into your workouts, the more you stand to get out of them. How Your Blood Sugar Behaves During Exercise \nWhen your body burns through carbohydrates for fuel during exercise, guess what happens? Your blood sugar drops. \nIf it drops too low, your workout isn\u2019t the only thing that will suffer, warns Rachel Johnson, RD , a researcher specializing in diabetes nutrition at Abbott, who is based in Lake Bluff, Illinois. Signs of severe hypoglycemia include everything from shakiness and dizziness to rapid heartbeat and loss of consciousness. \nThe risk of low blood sugar during exercise is especially high in those people who take insulin or other diabetes-regulating medications, says Anthony Pick, MD, CDE , an endocrinologist at Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest Hospital in Lake Forest, Illinois. \nIn some individuals with diabetes, a spike in stress hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, which naturally occurs during exercise, can cause blood sugar to rise rather than fall, he says. Potential consequences of experiencing an excessively high blood sugar level, called hyperglycemia , include headaches, nausea, and blurred vision. However, heightened blood sugar during exercise tends to be the exception, not the rule. The Best Carb Strategy for Your Workouts \nSo how many carbs do you need before, during, and after exercise to maintain a healthy blood sugar level? Short answer: It depends. \nLong answer: It depends on how long and hard you exercise, your current medications, and most important, your blood sugar level heading into your workout. \u201cJust because you have diabetes, it does not automatically mean that you need additional carbs,\u201d Sheth says. \u201cIt is important to check your blood sugar before and after your workout to determine the effect of your activity on your carbohydrate needs.\u201d \nAccording to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), it\u2019s best to start your workouts with a blood sugar level between 90 and 250 milligrams per decileter (mg/dL). If your level is lower than 90 mg/dL, the organization recommends ingesting 15 to 30 g of fast-acting carbohydrates prior to the start of exercise, although the exact amount will depend on your body size and the workout you have planned. Larger bodies and longer, harder workouts require more fuel. Good preworkout snacks include a whole, tennis ball-size piece of fruit (think: apple, peach, or pear), rice cakes, white toast, or yogurt, Sheth says. \nMeanwhile, if prior to exercise your blood sugar level measures at 250 mg/dL or more, it\u2019s important to test for ketones , which are fat metabolites that indicate the body\u2019s insulin level isn\u2019t high enough to effectively control your blood sugar, according to the ADA . Consult your doctor on adjusting your insulin and do not exercise if you detect moderate to large amounts of ketones in your body. \nBlood sugar testing shouldn\u2019t stop once you start exercising. Aim to test your level every 30 to 60 minutes during exercise, and consider tweaking your carb intake as you go. You may need 10 to 20 g of carbohydrates for every 30 minutes of moderate exercise and anywhere from 5 to 10 g of carbs per 30 minutes for low-intensity cardiovascular exercise, Sheth says. She adds, \u201cThose numbers can vary greatly per person, so use them as a guideline rather than a rule.\" During exercise, consider getting any needed carbs from the same foods that you snacked on before your workout, or potentially from sports drinks and gels. However, it\u2019s important to remember that these products are designed to quickly digest and absorb into the body, rapidly raising blood sugar , Sheth says. \nFollowing exercise, test your blood sugar to determine the best postworkout snack or meal for you, Dr. Pick says. Then repeat testing every few hours. As your body recovers from exercise by shuttling carbohydrates into your liver and muscles, your blood sugar level may fall. In some people, exercise has a delayed effect on blood sugar, causing it to fall up to 12 to 16 hours following exercise, he says. It involves a bit of trial and error, but over time, it becomes a habit. \n\u201cEvery person\u2019s needs are so unique, so it\u2019s important to work with your healthcare provider to determine a plan for you,\u201d Johnson says. Get your medical team 's okay before beginning any exercise program, especially if you are new to exercise. \nDiscuss your workout of choice and ask for feedback on exercise and meal timing, the potential impact of medications on your blood sugar, and how you might need to adjust your medications as you become more active, Sheth says. A registered dietitian or certified diabetes educator, both of whom you can find through the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics , can help you evaluate your unique needs so you can start your workout routine with confidence.

Getty Images \nPsoriatic arthritis is a systemic autoimmune disease and an inflammatory form of arthritis. While it shares characteristics with other types of arthritis, there are ways to distinguish this disease and treat it accordingly. \nOne distinctive feature of psoriatic arthritis is the presence of psoriasis, a disease that causes thick, red, dry skin patches known as plaques, as well as pitted nails or nails that separate from the nail bed. Like psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis stems from a faulty immune response, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. \nRoughly 30 percent of people with psoriasis may develop psoriatic arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation . \u201cAbout 10 percent of people develop arthritis first, then psoriasis later,\u201d says Eric Ruderman, MD , the clinical practice director of rheumatology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Symptoms of psoriatic arthritis include joint pain, swelling, stiffness (especially in the morning), and fatigue. Psoriatic Arthritis Versus Rheumatoid Arthritis \nAs a review published in April 2015 in the journal Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases points out, psoriatic arthritis has several features in common with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . Both are autoimmune disorders causing joint inflammation and pain. But there are differences in how the diseases develop and affect the joints. \nWhile RA is much more likely to affect the same joints on both sides of the body, psoriatic arthritis patients often have asymmetric arthritis, notes Kathleen Maksimowicz-Mckinnon, DO , a senior staff physician at Henry Ford Health System and an associate professor of medicine at Wayne State University in Detroit. \n\u201cAnother difference is that in psoriatic arthritis, it is very common to have inflammatory disease of the lower spine,\u201d says Dr. Mckinnon. \nPatients with psoriatic arthritis also tend to have arthritis in the distal joints of the fingers (closest to the nails), whereas the joints closest to the palm of the hand are more commonly affected with rheumatoid arthritis, she adds. \nPsoriatic arthritis often causes inflammation or pain at the point where tendons attach to bones (enthesitis). \u201cThis can hurt more than the joints themselves,\u201d Dr. Ruderman says. Enthesitis most commonly occurs at the heel, on the bottom of the foot, or in the elbow. How Psoriatic Arthritis Differs From Osteoarthritis \nMany people who have joint pain and stiffness are diagnosed with osteoarthritis , which is the most common type of arthritis. Osteoarthritis is a progressive disease that affects cartilage, the slippery covering that allows bones to slide over each other when joints bend. \nPsoriatic arthritis is not caused by wear and tear on the joints the way osteoarthritis is. While psoriatic arthritis symptoms come in flares, osteoarthritis-related pain and swelling usually gets worse over time. On the other hand, people with osteoarthritis don\u2019t experience the psoriasis-related skin symptoms that often accompany psoriatic arthritis. Steps to Diagnosing Psoriatic Arthritis \nDiagnosing psoriatic arthritis can be tricky . In addition to a physical exam and a comprehensive medical history, your doctor may order imaging tests (such as an X-ray or ultrasound) to look for joint damage. \nA study published in the May\u2013June 2016 issue of Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology found that using ultrasound can help distinguish early psoriatic arthritis from rheumatoid arthritis in the small joints of the hands. \nNegative blood tests for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies can help rule out rheumatoid arthritis. Challenges of Treating Psoriatic Arthritis \n\u201cRheumatoid arthritis can be very destructive if it\u2019s not treated, which is why we treat it aggressively with biologics,\u201d Ruderman says. \u201cBut psoriatic arthritis doesn\u2019t manifest that way. Fewer than half of people with psoriatic arthritis develop a particularly aggressive form, which makes treatment challenging because we don\u2019t want to over-treat it.\u201d \nEven so, the pain and discomfort associated with psoriatic arthritis can be significant. A study published in April 2015 in PLoS One found that the overall pain, joint pain, and fatigue reported by psoriatic arthritis patients was significantly greater than that reported by people with rheumatoid arthritis. \nFor milder forms of psoriatic arthritis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended for joint symptoms. Topical creams, ointments, and lotions are often used to address the scaly, itchy skin rashes that occur with psoriasis. \nIf there are signs of joint damage, doctors treat psoriatic arthritis more aggressively with medications like the ones used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, Ruderman says. These include disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologics . \n\u201cWithout disease-modifying therapy, the prognosis for psoriatic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis is usually significantly worse than for osteoarthritis,\u201d says Neil Kramer, MD , the medical co-director for the Institute for Rheumatic and Autoimmune Diseases at Atlantic Health System\u2019s Overlook Medical Center in Summit, New Jersey. \nAs with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis complications can include increased risk of heart disease, depression, obesity, certain cancers (such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma ), infections, and osteoporosis, according to research published in October 2015 in the Journal of Rheumatology . In addition, \u201cpeople with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis have a high incidence of metabolic syndrome, fatty liver disease, and cholesterol abnormalities,\u201d Ruderman says. \n\u201cWe need to think of it as psoriatic disease that affects the joints, tendons, skin, and nails, and use multiple things to treat it,\u201d he adds.

Please select a newsletter Monica Sengupta shares RA-friendly beauty tips and demystifies DIY nail art on her blog. Courtesy of Monica Sengupta \nMonica Sengupta, 27, blogs and vlogs (makes videos) about the perils of regular doses of prednisone, what not to say to someone with rheumatoid arthritis (\"But you don\u2019t look sick\u201d), and how to make eye-catching, pro-level nail art. The Washington, DC\u2013based teacher was a pre\u2013veterinary medicine student at 21 when she was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . Confronting an RA Diagnosis at Age 21 \n\u201cA typical 20-something,\u201d she says, with an education, pets, a car, and a love of travel, she was living life to the fullest. She still does. As the brown-skinned woman (her background is Indian and Peruvian) introduces herself on her blog: \u201cI enjoy the freedom of being young. I am determined, self-assured, strong, successful, intelligent, and ambitious. I have my entire life ahead of me to do whatever I want, however I want. I just described thousands of people. What sets me apart from everyone else? I have rheumatoid arthritis .\u201d Navigating RA Though Makeup \nOne of the things she wanted was to be a beauty blogger \u2014 discussing skin care (a passion), makeup, and nail art. \u201cAs an autoimmune patient, I struggle with endless fatigue, pain, and stiffness ,\u201d she writes. Hence the name of her blog, The Rite of Aging\u2026Early: Navigating Rheumatoid Arthritis Through Beauty and Nail Art . Her chronic aches and the 15 or so pills she downs every morning make her feel old before her time, she says. \u201cUp until my diagnosis, I was very physical. I worked with animals. I could carry up to my own weight in whatever. I was an avid rock climber \u2014 and then out of nowhere \u2014 RA. I never expected to have a physical disability at the age of 21.\u201d That said, she has in no way given up on her dreams (becoming a vet, included). \u201cHonestly, I\u2019ve just spent the last six years fighting,\u201d she says. \u201cI keep trying to live my life like I don\u2019t have arthritis. I\u2019m stubborn and will not accept that I have a physical disability. I\u2019m not embracing it.\u201d Medical Leave: An Opportunity to Indulge in a Passion \nHer nail art hobby began as a distraction not long after her diagnosis , when her rheumatologist put her on medical leave. \u201cThat winter was particularly hard,\u201d she says. Feeling confined, she began experimenting with a few bottles of nail polish she had picked up. She had been perusing nail blogs and online tutorials. A Small Canvas and Small Tools Make Art Challenging for RA Hands \n\u201cWhen I first started, it took me weeks to get any sort of technique down,\u201d she says. \u201cNail art is difficult on the joints \u2014 it\u2019s a small canvas with small tools. The more tools I use, the more manipulation that is for my joints .\u201d Sometimes even opening a bottle of polish is a challenge, says Sengupta, who works part-time in an after-school education program \u2014 she had to step back from full-time because of all the standing involved. \nShe began blogging with the annual nail art 31-Day Challenge popular with bloggers and nail fans, which starts in September every year. Participants respond to daily prompts; for example, a color, a pattern (animal print, stripes, flowers), or inspiration from fashion or a song. Many of Sengupta\u2019s nail creations relate to her health \u2014 the ombr\u00e9 red nails remind her of the many blood tests she takes (she points out that she has seen her blood be every color of red she used). The sunny yellow speaks to her of how much better she feels in warm weather ; the metallic look is stamped with a clock , because she wishes \u201ctime would stand still\u201d while she wrestles with the disease that is preventing her from pursuing her veterinary studies. Now she has an impressive playlist of tutorials , and is working on more. Joint Pain and Other Symptoms Challenge Yet Inspire Her \nDespite her drive to create , her symptoms affect her ability to do many things \u2014 especially fiddle around with the teensy brushes, bottles, clippers, and files uses to create blogworthy manicures. In a perfect world, she would be able to buy nail brushes and other tools with extra-big, easy-to-hold handles, but that\u2019s not always possible. Following in the footsteps of creative visionaries like Renoir , who turned RA-related limitations into innovation, her solution is to MyGyver her nail kit, picking up (and sometimes making up) the most RA-friendly techniques and shortcuts, and streamlining the tools and materials she uses. 8 RA-Friendly Nail Art Hacks \nAmong her work-arounds and tips (no pun intended: A magnifying glass \u201cIt\u2019s been a lifesaver,\u201d Sengupta says. The 2X magnifier lights up, has a flexible neck, and \u201cit helps me see the nails when my eyes are tired and dried out .\u201d Abstract designs are \u201csimple and fast, and tend to require fewer materials,\u201d she says. One easy example is glitter tips , which she calls one of the top techniques for those with dexterity challenges. First apply a base coat of whatever color you like. Then use a cosmetic wedge dipped in glitter polish to dab it on either just the tips or just near the cuticles. \u201cFor even more control, you can use a foam eyeshadow applicator \u2014 although I can\u2019t if I\u2019m having an arthritis flare ,\u201d she says. Finish with a clear topcoat. Water decals , basically temporary tattoos for your nails, are easy and a fave \u201ccheat.\u201d Her meds help control joint swelling , but, \u201cI can get a little shaky if I\u2019m in a little more pain than usual and, if I\u2019m tired, I have difficulty holding smaller objects,\u201d she says. \u201cAll you do is cut off a piece or cut it in a nail shape, peel off the plastic on top, and put it in water. Then the image slides off onto the nail . It\u2019s meticulous work, but easier than drawing freehand,\u201d she says. Nail appliqu\u00e9s are \u201cbasically full nail wraps,\u201d she says. A favorite brand is Incoco . \u201cThey come in regular colors, fun accents, and other designs. They take a bit of manipulation like placing, filing, etc., but it beats applying multiple layers of polish and adding details yourself! They are a little more expensive but they are made from nail polish and last for a few days.\u201d Stamping plates help with the application of complicated designs such as trailing vines, lace, or holiday-themed images. Sengupta finds using stamps easier than trying to freehand draw something so intricate. Dry-brushing sounds technical, but it merely means cleaning off the polish brush on the neck of the bottle and even swiping it on a piece of paper before drawing subtle paint strokes on top of a basecoat, as she did here under the tiger decals (which remind her of her desire to someday work with Bengal tigers). \u201cAll you do is wipe excess polish from the brush until there is very little left and swipe it across the nail in any direction you want,\u201d she says. \u201cNo extra materials needed!\u201d \u201c Messy marbles are RA-friendly,\u201d she says, in a post that shouts out to \u201cdrag marbling,\u201d a technique learned from another blogger . \u201cYou apply small drops of polish to the nail then use a clean artist's brush to drag the color around,\u201d she says. Water marbling techniques are a bit more complicated and involve dropping dots of polish on the surface of water in a container. Then lines are drawn through the colors to create a marbled-paper effect, and the nails are dipped in to pick up the pattern. How she makes it a bit easier : \u201cI do not mess with the design\u2019s perfection in the water,\u201d she says. \u201cI dunk two or three of my fingers at a time because the nails do not have to be the same. I also marble one color at a time so the design is easier to manipulate.\u201d She puts one color down and drops another color onto it before patterning and then dipping her nails in. Sponging involves drawing lines of polish in different colors on the flat edge of a makeup sponge and then just pressing it onto the nails (already painted with a neutral base color) to create a fuzzy rainbow. Dotticures use bobby pins (or, if you like, special dotting tools) to deposit dots of polish for a polka-dot pattern on top of a base color. They are quick, \u201cwallet-friendly,\u201d and easy, she says.

A quicker method for harvesting and freezing eggs from women with breast cancer means no treatment delays. Getty Images \nAn egg retrieval technique known as random start allows women recently diagnosed with breast cancer to retrieve and freeze their eggs more quickly than is possible using standard techniques, preventing delays in treatment, according to a study published in September 2017 in the journal Human Reproduction . \nThe chemotherapy and radiation women with breast cancer receive in order to shrink breast tumors can make them infertile or undergo early menopause, so before treatment starts is the time to store eggs. Though advances in fertility preservation have long made it possible for women to freeze their eggs to use at a later date, these procedures are underutilized \u2014 in part because oncologists worry that egg or embryo freezing will delay cancer treatment. \nStandard fertility techniques for egg retrieval require waiting for the first day of a menstrual period. Depending on where the woman is in her cycle at the time of the cancer diagnosis, that can mean a wait of up to a month before even beginning, and then another few weeks for fertility drugs to stimulate the ovaries into egg production and for the egg extraction procedure. \nRandom start isn\u2019t dependent on ovulation during the menstrual cycle. In all, the egg retrieval process takes only two weeks. \u201cWhat this does is cut out up to four weeks in which women do not have to wait for a period to harvest their eggs,\u201d says Mitchell Rosen, MD , a senior investigator on the study and an associate professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California in San Francisco (UCSF). \nThe study looked at the cases of 89 women with breast cancer referred to the UCSF fertility clinic. Sixty-seven of the women chose to proceed with random-start ovarian stimulation. These women began cancer treatment an average of 38 days after they were diagnosed, compared with 39 days for patients who did not pursue fertility treatment, suggesting that random start didn\u2019t interfere with their cancer care. \n\u201cWhat it really does is facilitate fertility preservation where it wasn\u2019t an option before,\u201d says Sacha Ann Krieg, MD, PhD , an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. \u201cYou no longer have to figure out where a woman is in her menstrual cycle.\u201d \nOne unanswered question is whether the embryos will perform as well as the eggs with non-random start, says Jamie Grifo, MD, PhD , the director of the division of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at New York University Langone Health in New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to think that the embryos won\u2019t do as well, but it has to be studied,\u201d he says. \n\u201cEgg freezing is not 100 percent,\u201d Dr. Grifo acknowledges. \u201cThe younger the eggs are, the better.\u201d But looking at the big picture, he adds, \u201cwe are getting better at a fertile life after cancer treatment.\u201d \nYoung women diagnosed with breast cancer should be aware that fertility preservation is now recognized as a quality-of-life concern for women that should be addressed before breast cancer treatment. Both the oncology and fertility preservation fields consider it part of cancer care. \nWomen interested in having a family may be more comfortable with an oncologist who can facilitate quick fertility preservation referrals. Alternatively, check with your obstetrician or gynecologist, primary care doctor, and insurer for referrals and coverage questions. \nCosts for egg harvesting are high, out of reach for many women. However, some employers and two states (Connecticut and Rhode Island) are starting to cover these costs and make them part of insurance packages. Financial assistance is limited; but Livestrong has a program that provides free fertility medications for women meeting income criteria.

Alamy \nHow to keep from developing skin cancer should be something all doctors discuss with the parents of their young, fair-skinned patients, suggests the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. \nThose conversations should begin much earlier than previously recommended -- starting when a child is just 6 months old, according to new recommendations from the task force. \n\"Providing behavioral counseling to children, their parents and young adults encourages sun-protective behaviors,\" said Karina Davidson, a U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) member. \n\"These actions -- such as using sunscreen , wearing sun-protective clothing and avoiding indoor tanning -- can help prevent skin cancer later in life,\" Davidson explained in a USPSTF news release. \nShe is vice dean at Columbia University Medical Center's departments of medicine, cardiology and psychiatry and director of the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health, in New York City. \nThe task force recommends that doctors with fair-skinned patients aged 6 months to 24 years of age should talk with them, or their parents, about ways to protect skin from sun exposure to reduce the risk for skin cancer. \nRELATED: Melanoma Isn't the Only Serious Skin Cancer \nFor patients older than 24, the task force suggests that doctors decide case-by-case whether counseling on skin cancer prevention would be appropriate. \nAccording to another task force member, Dr. John Epling, \"Now, there is more evidence that counseling people to practice sun-protective behaviors can benefit some adults with fair skin.\" Epling is a professor of family and community medicine at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke. \nAt this point, the recommendation by the task force, an independent panel of national experts, is considered a draft. It expands on guidelines issued in 2012 that advised doctors to counsel fair-skinned patients aged 10 to 24 years on skin cancer protection. Public comment on the draft will be accepted until Nov. 6, and a final, updated guideline will be issued after that. \nSkin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the United States, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. \nChildren and teens exposed to the sun's ultraviolet rays are at greater risk for skin cancer later in life, especially those with light skin and freckles who easily burn in the sun, the task force noted. People who've had sunburns in the past, used tanning beds or have had skin cancer also are at greater risk for the disease. Last Updated:10/11/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay . All rights reserved.

Children and teens on pumps were less likely to experience severe hypoglycemia and DKA than those on shots. Mark Hatfield/Getty Images \nIn young people with type 1 diabetes , insulin pump therapy may offer better blood sugar control and fewer complications than daily injections of the vital hormone, new German research suggests. \n\"Insulin pumps work, and they work even somewhat better than multiple daily injections overall,\" said Dr. Robert Rapaport, chief of the division of pediatric endocrinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \nDr. Siham Accacha, a pediatric endocrinologist at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y., explained why that might be so. \n\"If the pump is really taken care of, you can micromanage your diabetes ,\" she said. \"You can stop the pump if your blood glucose is coming down, or you can give a bit more insulin if it's going up.\" \nBoth Rapaport and Accacha prefer pump use, but if patients would rather do multiple daily injections, the doctors said that excellent control can also be maintained with shots. It's really a matter of patient preference, they noted. \nOne issue with the pump is price. The start-up cost for a pump can be as much as $5,000, according to Accacha. And there are monthly costs for supplies as well. Insurers, especially Medicaid, sometimes hesitate to pay, both experts said. But studies like this latest one help provide more evidence about the importance of pump therapy. \n\"Pumps are more expensive, but I don't think expense should guide quality of therapy,\" Rapaport said. \"Even though pumps are more expensive, they lead to better results and less complications, so health care costs will even out.\" \nRELATED: What's the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? \nPlus, Accacha said, \"It helps to make kids with diabetes feel more like other kids, and makes them feel a little bit more normal.\" \nType 1 diabetes patients don't make enough insulin, a hormone that helps carry the sugar from foods into the body's cells to be used as fuel. \nTo replace that lost insulin, patients must either take multiple daily insulin injections or get insulin via a tiny tube inserted temporarily under the skin and attached to an insulin pump. \nNo matter which delivery system a person chooses, getting the dose of insulin right remains a difficult balancing act. Too much insulin can send blood sugar levels dangerously low, which can cause hypoglycemia. Initially, hypoglycemia causes dizziness, a racing heart, sweating and confusion, according to JDRF (formerly the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). Left untreated, hypoglycemia can cause fainting or seizures. Severe hypoglycemia can cause death. \nToo little insulin causes blood sugar levels to rise. This can cause fatigue, dry mouth, blurry vision and stomach pain. If blood sugar stays too high too long, a complication called diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can occur, according to JDRF. This means the body uses fat and body tissue for fuel. This produces toxic acids called ketones. If these are allowed to build up, a diabetic coma can result and possibly lead to death. \nIf blood sugar levels are high, but not high enough to cause DKA, they can contribute to complications in the long run, such as heart disease, serious vision problems and kidney disease. \nThe new study looked at the rates of severe hypoglycemia and DKA, as well as overall blood sugar levels in people aged 20 and younger who used either an insulin pump or multiple daily injections. \nThe children and teens came from 446 diabetes centers in Germany, Austria and Luxembourg. The initial study group included just over 30,000 people with a mean age of 14. The final matched comparison groups included almost 10,000 people on insulin pumps versus 10,000 on shots. \nThe researchers, led by Drs. Joachim Rosenbauer and Reinhard Holl of the German Center for Diabetes Research in Neuherberg, saw a slight improvement in blood sugar control for those on pump therapy over a year of treatment. \nChildren and teens on pumps were less likely to experience severe hypoglycemia and DKA than those on shots. \nRapaport noted that the improvement in DKA wasn't in all age groups. For example, in kids aged 1 to 5, there was no difference. \"But, there was a major difference in adolescents, and that would be very important,\" he said. \nThe study was published Oct. 10 in Journal of the American Medical Association .

Please select a newsletter Regular bone density checks will help you keep your bones strong. Getty Images \nIt\u2019s no secret that rheumatoid arthritis increases a person\u2019s chances of developing osteoporosis, a disease in which bones become brittle and fragile from low bone mass and bone tissue loss. This in turn increases the risk of fracture. \nDespite these added risks, many people who have rheumatoid arthritis (RA) aren\u2019t being screened for osteoporosis the way they should be. In fact, 33 percent of 11,669 patients with RA didn\u2019t have any screening for osteoporosis over a five-and-a-half-year period, and only half of RA patients who should have been treated with a medication for osteoporosis actually were, according to a study published online in August 2017 in Arthritis Care & Research . Systemic Inflammation Threatens Health of Bones \nThe primary reason why people with RA have a higher risk of developing osteoporosis is that RA is an autoimmune disease that involves systemic inflammation . \u201cThe inflammation from RA doesn't just affect the joints \u2014 it also affects the bones,\u201d says Veena K. Ranganath, MD , an associate clinical professor of medicine in the division of rheumatology at the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine in Los Angeles. Specifically, a chronic inflammatory state can accelerate bone loss and bone turnover. RA Can Interfere With Fitness Activity Required for Healthy Bones \nOn top of that, symptoms such as RA-induced pain, swelling, joint stiffness, and fatigue can cause people with the disease to be less physically active, which also increases the risk of osteoporosis . Normally, engaging in weight-bearing activities provides the signals the body needs to build stronger bones, explains Ashira Blazer, MD , a rheumatologist at New York University's Langone Medical Center in New York City. \u201cAvoiding weight-bearing activities means the body gets fewer of these signals\" to increase bone density. Rheumatoid Arthritis Drugs Can Weaken Bones \nIn addition, some of the drugs that are used to treat RA can lead to loss of bone density. For example, glucocorticoids (a class of corticosteroids) like prednisone are known to increase the risk of fractures. \u201cIf anyone is taking steroids for more than two months, their bone density should be checked, especially if they\u2019re over 65 or if they have risk factors such as a previous fracture or they smoke,\u201d Ranganath says. Doctors Don't Always Screen for Bone Density Problems \nBut this screening protocol isn\u2019t being practiced consistently, either. In a study published in September 2015 by the American College of Rheumatology , researchers evaluated 52 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that 53 percent of them were not screened appropriately for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis; the American College of Rheumatology recommends screenings based on patients' risk factors, their score on FRAX (a diagnostic tool used to evaluate bone fracture risk) , and their use of prednisone. This lack of screening was especially true for younger patients and male patients. Medication Side Effects: Ask Your MD About Your Bone Risks \nSince hard-and-fast guidelines for measuring bone density in people with RA don\u2019t exist, the onus may be on you to broach the subject if your doctor doesn\u2019t. This is particularly important if you\u2019ve been taking steroid medications for two months or more. If you have RA, you should also have a candid discussion with your doctor about your other risk factors for osteoporosis . Make Sure You Get Bone Mineral Density Tests \nA simple, painless assessment of your bone mineral density, called a DXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scan, can be done to check for osteoporosis, especially in the spine and hips. With repeated DXA scans, \u201cyou really want to use the same machine you used before for the sake of consistent results,\u201d Ranganath says. \u201cThe results are also operator dependent.\u201d What You Can Do to Keep Your Bones Strong \nOnce you know your bone mineral density, you can take additional steps to protect it \u2014 perhaps by consuming more calcium and vitamin D , getting more physical exercise, avoiding smoking or excessive alcohol consumption, or adjusting your medications. After all, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and some of the newer biologic drugs have a more positive effect on bone mineral density, Ranganath says.

Getty Images \nAs marriage ebbs and flows, so might the health of your heart, at least for men. \nA new British study of married fathers found real -- if small -- effects on such cardiovascular risk factors as cholesterol levels , body weight and blood pressure that corresponded to improvement or deterioration in the men's marriages. \nThose whose marriages seemed to be improving fared better, while the reverse was true for men in worsening marriages. \n\"An apparent link between marriage and health is a consistent finding across many studies, going back as far as 1912,\" said Dr. Ian Bennett-Britton. He's the study's lead author and a research fellow at the University of Bristol in England. \n\"What's not been clear is whether this is simply a reflection of healthier and wealthier people getting married or a true protective effect of the marriage itself,\" he added. \nMarriage researcher Dr. Rahul Potluri, a cardiologist with Aston University in Birmingham, England, said that \"the evidence so far suggests that married couples and perhaps happier couples are more inclined to look after each other, which may have a direct impact on cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease .\" \nFor the new study, Bennett-Britton and his colleagues surveyed 620 married fathers about their relationships, and then tracked the men for about 19 years. \nRELATED: Sexism Could Harm Men's Health \n\"We found little change in cardiovascular risk factors for those whose relationships were consistently good or bad,\" Bennett-Britton said. \"But we found a more consistent pattern for those whose relationships had either improved or deteriorated during the study period, with respective improvements and worsening in cardiovascular risk profile.\" \nCompared with men in \"consistently good\" relationships, those whose relationships had improved had slightly lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the so-called \"bad\" type. They also had a slightly lower body mass index , a measurement of body fat based on height and weight, the findings showed. \n\"Weaker links were found with improved total cholesterol and improved blood pressure,\" Bennett-Britton said. \nOn the other hand, the investigators found that men in deteriorating relationships had slightly worse blood pressure than those in stable, good relationships. Their diastolic blood pressure, the bottom number in a reading, was, on average, about 3 points higher. \nThe researchers reached these numbers after adjusting their statistics to account for variable factors, such as wealth and age. \nThough the possible individual impact of the findings may be small, Bennett-Britton said they could add up to quite a gain in the entire population. \nStill, Potluri noted that the number of men in the study was low and their age was on the young side. The men averaged 36 years old when they first began to be tracked. \"The long-term impact of these changes is difficult to ascertain,\" he said. \nWhat impact, if any, marriage ups and downs might have on women was not studied. \nFor men, though, the possible link between the health of their marriage and the health of their heart could have various origins, the study authors suggested. And the study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship. \nPatrick Markey, a psychology professor at Villanova University in Pennsylvania, said, \"Stress is highly related to physical health, so bad marriages likely cause stress, which causes poor health.\" \nAlso, Markey added, \"especially for men, romantic partners often contribute to our physical health more directly. For example, some research in our lab has found that wives often monitor their husband's eating and are more likely to encourage them to eat in a healthy manner. Similarly, wives also appear to be more likely to encourage their husbands to go to doctors, get flu shots and take medication.\" \nPotluri said another possibility is that worsening health translates to a less happy marriage, and vice versa, but \"certainly more evidence is required to address this.\" \nOne thing is clear, though, Markey said: \"There is little doubt that people in healthy relationships are, on average, much more healthy than those who are single. Being in a happy relationship is likely good for you both psychologically and physically.\" \nThe study was published online Oct. 9 in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health .

Please select a newsletter The beneficial effects of quitting cigarettes starts immediately and lasts for years. Shutterstock \nLung cancer is the No. 1 cause of cancer deaths for men and women, and 80 to 90 percent of lung cancer cases are linked to cigarette smoke. You might wonder how much difference a day, a week, or a year off cigarettes means to your health, especially if you\u2019re a longtime smoker. Turns out, every increment of time makes a difference in some way. \n1. You\u2019ll feel a difference within hours. Within 12 hours of quitting , the carbon monoxide level in your blood returns to normal. Within 14 to 90 days, your circulation improves and your lung function increases. \n2. Everything will taste and smell better \u2014 and you\u2019ll look better, too. Quitters say food tastes better, their sense of smell returns to normal, there\u2019s no lingering cigarette smell on clothes, hair, and breath, and teeth and fingernails stop yellowing and return to a normal color. \n3. Lung cancer risk drops by the year. For every year you don\u2019t smoke, your risk of lung cancer drops. Stay away from smoking for 10 to 15 years, and your chances of this cancer plunge to half of that of current smokers, and they keep going down. When you\u2019ve stayed away from smoking for 30 years, your risk is just 10 to 20 percent of what it is for people who keep up the habit. \n4. Even long term smokers benefit. Men who quit in middle age had only about a 2.5 percent risk of dying from lung cancer by age 75, while those who continue to smoke had an 11 percent risk. Women who quit in their forties had a less than 2 percent chance of dying from lung cancer by age 75, compared with a roughly 6 percent chance if they kept lighting up. \n5. You\u2019re lowering your risk of coronary heart disease, too. Within a year after stubbing out the last cigarette, the risk of coronary heart disease drops to half of that of someone who still smokes \u2014 and 15 years after quitting, risk drops to that of a nonsmoker. The likelihood of heart attacks drops , too. \n6. Quitting matters even if you\u2019ve been diagnosed with lung cancer. Research has found that people diagnosed with lung cancer who quit smoking live longer than people who continue to smoke. \u201cBetter survival may be a result of several factors, including better response to treatment, lower recurrence rates, and lower risk of developing a second cancer or other disease,\u201d says Eric Jacobs, PhD , strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T03:02:40.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01989046390d4b6028d8780faf491ef115d50d58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2Tq6D.8y5noRfenEJiu7NkTFT.v7X_VYg67WjCzwzYXv0pKhLMaWh6m.D_PqU6E8F93U3mYxTts9OJZtyri.kTKuoAN79HBZ9qfpG2R4yAaZqSFXmwHrkjw--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Crohn\u2019s Guide to Navigating Bathrooms Around the World | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Crohn\u2019s Guide to Navigating Bathrooms Around the World | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-12T13:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.695, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Crohns-Guide-to-Navigating-Bathrooms-Around-the-World-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "01989046390d4b6028d8780faf491ef115d50d58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2Tq6D.8y5noRfenEJiu7NkTFT.v7X_VYg67WjCzwzYXv0pKhLMaWh6m.D_PqU6E8F93U3mYxTts9OJZtyri.kTKuoAN79HBZ9qfpG2R4yAaZqSFXmwHrkjw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sheryl Kraft", "published": "2017-10-12T13:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Crohn\u2019s Guide to Navigating Bathrooms Around the World | Everyday Health", "text": "Crohn\u2019s Guide to Navigating Bathrooms Around the World Here\u2019s everything you need to know about bathroom etiquette in foreign countries.

Reinhard Krull/Getty Images \nIf you\u2019re living with Crohn\u2019s disease, you\u2019ve probably taken note of \u2014 or even memorized \u2014 every bathroom in every location you\u2019ve ever visited. It is, after all, essential information in case of an emergency. \nBut that all changes as soon as you decide to travel, especially if you\u2019re going to a foreign country where you may not even know the word for \u201cbathroom\u201d or how to use the toilet. (Believe me, this can happen.) \nIn general you can usually count on places like transportation hubs, historical sites, hotel lobbies, museums and galleries, and department stores to have public restrooms. \nAside from obvious latrine locations, here are some tips for how to find and properly use toilets around the world. Packing Bathroom Hygiene Products Before You Go \nPrepping for a bathroom emergency while on vacation should start even before you leave home. Be sure to pack things like: Anti-diarrheal medications Cards to communicate your urgent need to use a bathroom, such as the \u201c I Can\u2019t Wait Card\u201d from the Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation . Spare underwear Toilet paper or gentle wipes Toilet seat covers \nAdditionally, it\u2019s always a good idea to evaluate your mode of travel. \nWhen you reserve your seat on an airplane or train, find out where the closest bathroom is located, and request an aisle seat and special meals where possible. If you\u2019re traveling by bus, check that there is a toilet on board, especially for long trips. \n\u201cIt can also be helpful to know your body,\u201d says Jessica Philpott, MD, PhD , a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. \u201cIf you tend to have bad mornings, then schedule your travel plans for later in the day if possible.\u201d The 411 on Toilets Around the World \nAll toilets are not created equal, and range from the basic to the bizarre. The three main kinds of toilets you\u2019ll find around the world are porcelain flush toilets, squat toilets, and luxury latrines. Porcelain flush toilets These are the toilets you\u2019re most likely familiar with, typically found in the United States and most of Europe. Most have seats, but you can\u2019t always take that for granted: Public toilets in some European countries like Greece and Italy may be seatless, and you\u2019ll have to sit on the rim; this gets more common as you go farther south, according to the Toilet Guru . The reason, he says, is that they're easier to keep clean. Squat toilets In much of the world \u2014 Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and some older buildings in Europe \u2014 people use squat toilets. Squat toilets, also called \u201cTurkish toilets\u201d or \u201celephant feet\u201d are basically bowls or pans on the floor that you squat over. Some are equipped with a water nozzle (a shower head or hose), or a bucket to fill with water in order to clean off. Some are dry, meaning they don\u2019t flush, and others use a water seal and can be flushed. Luxury latrines Commonly found in Japan, these models are called \u201cintelligent\u201d for many reasons: Their amenities include remote-controlled heated seats, massage functions, bidet, and air-purifying and air-drying functions. Some even check your health, measuring blood pressure, body temperature, and even your weight using a built-in floor scale. And if you\u2019re the self-conscious type, many will supply background music to cover up errant sounds. \nRemember when you're looking for a restroom that it may not be labeled in a way that is familiar. Some bathroom signs are illustrated with recognizable pictures of females and males, or have the initials \u201cWC\u201d (water closet) on their doors. Others will have the word \u201ctoilet\u201d in that country's language. Learn the Terminology \nMost travel guidebooks will give you the word or phrase you need to use to ask for a bathroom. Or you can simply google the phrase. Make sure to jot it down and keep it handy, so you can refer to it in a hurry. \nBefore you leave: Learn a few key words and phrases in the local language, such as \u201ctoilet,\u201d \u201cbathroom,\u201d \u201curgent,\u201d \u201cemergency,\u201d and \u201cwhere is.\u201d Travel guidebooks, and the information below, can help make for a pleasant bathroom visit. All About Toilet Paper (TP) \nJust because people use TP doesn\u2019t mean the bathrooms are well stocked with it (or it will be to your liking). Play it safe by carrying pocket-size tissue packs with you. \nBefore heading into the stall, take a moment to observe your surroundings: Sometimes there will be a person in the corner selling sheets of toilet paper, notes the travel blogger Rick Steves . Notice whether other people are reaching for paper before they go in, and follow suit. \nAnd of course, it\u2019s always wise to check the TP situation before sitting down, since you can\u2019t always count on the supply being immediately restocked. \nIf there\u2019s a wastebasket next to the toilet with used TP in it, that's a sure sign not to flush, says Steves. Some countries, like Greece and Turkey, have delicate plumbing and moody sewers, and they utilize this method instead of flushing. \nIn some areas of Asia, India, and Turkey, the locals don\u2019t use toilet paper \u2014 your clue may be a little squirter or small hose near the toilet for rinsing. You\u2019re Making Me Flush \nFlushes come in all shapes and sizes \u2014 and locations \u2014 and it may be difficult, or even embarrassing, to figure it all out. But flush you must: You don\u2019t want to leave your \u201cevidence\u201d behind. \nThroughout most of Europe, along with the familiar flushers, you\u2019ll also find flushers that require a little thought and sleuthing. (Of course, the easiest type is an automatic flusher that activates once you are finished.) \nSome have a pull string instead of a handle; it\u2019s usually attached to the tank above the toilet. \nOther, more modern bathrooms have two buttons on the top of the tank: One is for regular flushing; the other, which uses less water, is for lighter loads. \nMany bathrooms around Great Britain sport \u201cpump toilets\u201d whose handles are sensitive to the touch and need just the right amount of pressure to get them to work. \nCan\u2019t find a flusher? Look down: Some toilets ( Italy has them) have a metal pedal resembling a car accelerator. Or look sideways and you might see a large white or metal button on the left or right of the toilet. Other times, the flusher can be hidden in the middle of the wall, around knee-level. \nAnother type of flusher is a doorknob-like handle on the wall behind the toilet; to work it, you turn it one way or another. \nMany parts of Europe have shared spaces for handwashing, although the men\u2019s and women\u2019s toilet facilities will most likely be separate. Some sinks, rather than having the familiar faucet knobs or levers, have pedals on the floor. To Pay or Not to Pay \nNot all public bathrooms are free, so it\u2019s best to bring change with you when exploring new ground in case you have to pay to heed nature's call. \nLarge cities, like Paris, London, and Amsterdam, have bathrooms on street corners that resemble telephone booths. Once you insert the coins, you have 15 minutes to do your thing while you listen to piped-in Muzak. Upon exiting, the bathroom self-disinfects. Then you can breathe in the fresh air and get on with your travels.

Please select a newsletter Grandma Moses (1860\u20131961) didn\u2019t start painting until she was in her seventies. Getty Images \nThe woman known as Grandma Moses was a famous American painter known for her 20 th -century folk art style and her own late start \u2014 she didn\u2019t start painting extensively until she was 76 years old, and was entirely self-taught. Early Years on a Farm \nMoses, born in 1860 as Anna Mary Robertson in Greenwich, New York, left school at age 12 and worked on a local farm for a wealthy family, where she did housework, cooked, and learned needlework and embroidery. By age 27, she had met and married farmhand Thomas Salmon Moses, and moved with him to run a farm in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia; later, they moved to Eagle Bridge, New York. Together, Anna and Thomas had ten children, though only five lived past infancy. Self-Expression Through Needlework, Embroidery, and Culinary Arts \nWhile farming and raising a family were hard work, Anna also spent her time being creative , particularly with needlework and cooking \u2014 her jams won awards at local fairs. But pain and health issues ultimately pushed Anna toward painting. Hand Pain and Stiffness Interfered with Sewing \nWhen she could no longer sew comfortably due to her stiff and painful hands, Anna\u2019s sister Celestia suggested she paint instead, according to V.F. Azevedo in an article published in the journal Rheumatology . As William J. Maloney wrote in the book Diseases, Disorders, and Diagnoses of Historical Individuals , \u201cInflammation of the small joints of the hand and wrist are common in rheumatoid arthritis . Women are three times more likely to be afflicted than men. Grandma Moses was most likely afflicted with this form of arthritis.\u201d Self-Treating Severe Joint Pain \nIn Rheumatology , Azevdo quoted Moses\u2019s efforts to soothe her arthritic hands : \u201cI used to wrap my hands up in scarves and lay them on a chair beside the bed at night. I couldn\u2019t sleep on account of the aching, just like a toothache. Then, one night I got desperate ... [and tried a sweet milk remedy]. I took it for about three months, and all of a sudden, there were no pains anymore, but the hardness of the joints stayed.\u201d Discovering Painting at 70 \nOnce she began painting, she focused on scenes depicting country life and natural settings. As her collection grew, a relative suggested she hang her work in the window of a local department store in Hoosic Falls, New York, along with other community artwork. It was there that a visiting art collector and dealer saw her work, loved it, and bought it. Making Contemporary Folk Art \nWithin a year, three of her paintings were hanging in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, as part of a contemporary folk art exhibit. By 1940, Anna had her own exhibit of 35 pieces at the Galerie St. Etienne in New York City . At the time of her death in 1961 at age 101, Anna \u2014 now known professionally as Grandma Moses \u2014 had produced more than 1600 paintings, and was renowned around the world for her style and character. Social and Health Benefits of Making Arts and Crafts \nPainting in a folk art style may be a useful way for older people to cope with aging, counter illness-related isolation , and help prevent depression , a common comorbidity of rheumatoid arthritis. Grandma Moses\u2019s late-life art work may have brought her additional relief, noted Azevedo in Rheumatology . Some specially developed therapeutic art programs for aged rheumatic patients were inspired by Grandma Moses\u2019s example, he explained. \nBesides helping improve the self-esteem of the elderly people, [folk art programs] also foster the communication skills. \u201cTo work with folk art in an environment that does not demand a complete mastering of artistic techniques may produce a beneficial effect in rheumatic and depressed elderly people.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T03:35:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d61790a58c886d633ee524952066e42ce1a4209a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2dJBERhM01arUE_2AiRTpbSFSGO3zGcHY4.VmPqh5BnhKA4_z71plFEbTt7BxlC1SmLCCsIX6XxInrS6sd8BjzdwgVn.wXdw05kwQQzayaAykNcy5vHBzrw--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "What Does Clean Eating Have to Do With Rheumatoid Arthritis? | Everyday Health", "title_full": "What Does Clean Eating Have to Do With Rheumatoid Arthritis? | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-12T13:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.01, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Can-Clean-Eating-Help-RA-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 180, "comments": 0, "shares": 180}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d61790a58c886d633ee524952066e42ce1a4209a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2dJBERhM01arUE_2AiRTpbSFSGO3zGcHY4.VmPqh5BnhKA4_z71plFEbTt7BxlC1SmLCCsIX6XxInrS6sd8BjzdwgVn.wXdw05kwQQzayaAykNcy5vHBzrw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Beth Levine", "published": "2017-10-12T13:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Does Clean Eating Have to Do With Rheumatoid Arthritis? | Everyday Health", "text": "Sign Up for Our Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis Newsletter Thanks for signing up!

Please select a newsletter Clean eating, or avoiding processed foods in your diet, may help you lose weight. Jill Chen/Stocksy \nThere\u2019s been a lot of buzz lately about \u201cclean eating,\u201d but definitions have been widely divergent and confusing. To set the record straight, clean eating is simply a style of eating \u2014 not a strict diet \u2014 that aims for optimal health by limiting processed foods. \u201cWhat we should be looking for is food that is as close to what it looked like when in the ground, on a tree, or swimming in water, and food that has a label with recognizable ingredients and limited additives and preservatives,\u201d says Bonnie Taub-Dix, RDN , author of Read It Before You Eat It. The Importance of a Food\u2019s Origin, Source, and Freshness \nJames Loomis, MD , medical director of the nonprofit Barnard Medical Center in Washington, DC, and a representative of The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , explains that the food is clean in the sense of what is the ideal diet for human health. \u201cThink about what foods are optimal and then, where do those foods come from. Are they grown cleanly?\u201d Why People With Rheumatoid Arthritis Should Pay Attention to Clean Eating \nThe top reasons that a clean diet may help those living with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) stem from the way foods in your regular diet may affect your body and disease activity. \nOmega-6 foods can increase inflammation. The standard American diet is considered highly inflammatory. Most of the inflammation comes from the skewed ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. The omega-3s, which we don\u2019t eat enough, create compounds that are anti-inflammatory; omega-6s, which we eat too much, create compounds that are considered inflammatory. \n\u201cWe need some inflammation to fight infection and fight wounds, but we need a balance. When we get rid of meat and dairy and start to consume fresh fruit, fiber, and whole grains, we bring that ratio back down, and that can help with all autoimmune diseases,\u201d says Dr. Loomis. \nOmega-6 is contained in processed seeds and vegetable oils, especially sunflower, corn, soybean, and cottonseed oils. Omega-3 comes from fatty fish, such as salmon, mackerel, sardines, and tuna, as well as walnuts, flaxseed, and egg yolks. \nPesticide exposure has been linked to an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases . A study published in the journal Arthritis Care and Research showed that frequent exposure might increase your risk for developing rheumatoid arthritis and lupus . \nWeight loss can result from eating cleanly . The added bonus to clean eating is that it promotes weight loss, which helps improve joint pain, and can decrease the risks for developing comorbids of RA, such as osteoporosis and heart disease. What a Clean-Eating Diet Looks Like \nEat local and organic fruits and vegetables. Research suggests that choosing meat from grass-fed, antibiotic-free animals helps lower the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio. \nBalance your plate. The recommendation is that carbs should make up about 50 percent of your diet, protein around 15 to 20 percent, and fat about 30 percent, says Taub-Dix. \u201cWhen you balance the nutrients in your diet, it enables you to feel more satiated in body and mind so you can eat a cleaner diet. You are less apt to start snacking.\u201d \nTake it easy on salt, sugar, and saturated fats. \u201cPeople with RA are at increased risk of cardiac disease, so you will help decrease that by reducing your intake of these inflammatory foods . Humans are just not designed to eat processed sugar, salt, and saturated fats,\u201d says Loomis. \nFind your calcium from nondairy sources. Calcium intake is important because it helps decrease the risk of osteoporosis, often a cormorbid disease with RA. But studies have shown that dairy can cause RA symptoms to flare up in response to specific proteins. You can find alternative sources of calcium in plants such as navy beans, Swiss chard, kale, and beet greens. \nFlavor with spices, not sauces. Eating in a less adulterated fashion doesn\u2019t mean the food has to be bland. Instead of covering up your dish with sauces, gravies, or melted cheese, add fresh organic spices to give it a zip and zing. \nWatch what you drink. Those fancy lattes and sodas can add empty calories without actually filling you up. Stay hydrated instead with 100 percent fruit juice diluted with sparkling water or seltzer. Try unsweetened tea with cut-up fruit in it. Put fruit into a water jug. \u201cAfterward you can munch on a fruit, which can be a good speed bump to an unnecessary snack,\u201d says Taub-Dix. \nDon\u2019t get too strict. There has been some backlash against clean eating \u2014 that it is too restricting and focuses too much on clean versus dirty food, instead of proportions. Some experts fear that it creates panic around certain so-called toxins and under-recognized sensitivities that either do not exist or are greatly misunderstood. Also, eliminating an entire food group may lead to disordered eating . Taub-Dix cautions that people are interpreting it too strictly. \nShe says, \"Clean eating really means you are eating food that you can identify, that you can rely on for energy, and will make you feel satiated in your head and body. There are so many fearmongers making people think certain foods are poison. People become overwhelmed so they wind up not knowing what to do. Food shouldn\u2019t be feared, just practice balance and moderation. These are boring words, but they really mean a lot.\u201d Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T05:32:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5555678ce4ad8dcc8ebb56bd4d23feb9df2a9841", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2gMgvRAShbR13ukQ2C_Z.IGbCcx8utfSzHHTp3QCCldASvZC2Pi2_Nml3kVpEbv7WLiwd01CFFj9JJh1TvqK9dGvw4doE0YifJn9DQypM6w_490fSfcurQ0zE6YA87yfCX16jqn4I2do-", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "New Drug Offers Hope for Patients With Stage 3 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer | Everyday Health", "title_full": "New Drug Offers Hope for Patients With Stage 3 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-12T13:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.138, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Promising-New-Drug-Stage-3-Non-Small-Cell-Lung-Cancer-Patients-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5555678ce4ad8dcc8ebb56bd4d23feb9df2a9841", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2gMgvRAShbR13ukQ2C_Z.IGbCcx8utfSzHHTp3QCCldASvZC2Pi2_Nml3kVpEbv7WLiwd01CFFj9JJh1TvqK9dGvw4doE0YifJn9DQypM6w_490fSfcurQ0zE6YA87yfCX16jqn4I2do-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Howard Wolinsky", "published": "2017-10-12T13:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "New Drug Offers Hope for Patients With Stage 3 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer | Everyday Health", "text": "Everyday Health Lung Cancer New Drug Offers Hope for Patients With Stage 3 Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Patients who have reached the end of traditional lung cancer treatment options may find success with a new immunotherapy drug.

Photo Courtesy of AstraZeneca \nNew study results presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in September in Madrid offered the hope of a potential new curative immunotherapy drug \u2014 Imfinzi (durvalumab) \u2014 for patients with stage 3 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The study results were published online in September 2017 in the New England Journal of Medicine . \nThe study, known as the PACIFIC trial, included 700 patients from 26 countries with locally advanced inoperable stage 3 NSCLC whose tumors had not gotten larger or spread after they received chemotherapy and radiation therapy. \nPatients with inoperable stage 3 NSCLC have had few therapy options. Since these tumors cannot be removed surgically, patients have traditionally undergone combined radiation and chemotherapy, an approach with a high rate of recurrent disease and a survival rate of only 25 to 30 percent. \nIn the PACIFIC trial, patients received either a placebo or Imfinzi, an antibody checkpoint inhibitor that counters NSCLC tumors\u2019 immune-evading tactics and induces an immune response against the residual tumor cells. \nSubjects receiving Imfinzi had a progression-free survival time \u2014 the length of time patients live without the cancer coming back or getting worse \u2014 of 16.8 months compared with 5.6 months in the placebo group. The cure rate for the patients in the study has not yet been recorded. \n\u201cFor patients with locally advanced unresectable NSCLC who have completed chemoradiation therapy, Imfinzi represents a potential new treatment option in the context of clear unmet clinical need,\u201d says Luis Paz-Ares, MD , the chair of the medical oncology department at the Hospital Doce de Octubre in Madrid, Spain, and the principal investigator of the trial. \"Imfinzi overtly prolongs the period in which the disease is controlled with reasonable side effects.\u201d \nCommon side effects seen with Imfinzi include muscle and bone pain, fatigue, nausea, constipation, swollen feet and legs, and urinary tract infections; some of these effects were likely a complication of the chemotherapy and radiation subjects received before the Imfinzi. \nSean Bohen, MD, PhD , the executive vice president for global medicines development and the chief medical officer at AstraZeneca, said the \u201cresults are incredibly encouraging for a patient population that until now has been without treatment options. As the first immuno-oncology medicine to achieve improvement in progression-free survival in this setting, Imfinzi is showing clear potential to become a new standard of care for patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC who have not progressed following chemoradiation.\u201d \nIn July, the FDA gave Imfinzi Breakthrough Therapy Designation (meaning it will go through a faster review process than usual) as a potential treatment for patients with locally advanced, inoperable NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy. And AstraZeneca, the maker of the drug, is in discussions with global health authorities regarding regulatory submissions for Imfinzi based on the PACIFIC data. In May 2017, the FDA gave Imfinzi accelerated approval for previously treated patients with advanced bladder cancer. \nImfinzi is also being tested as a first-line therapy for stage 4 NSCLC which \u2014 for certain patients \u2014 is already treated with a similar class of immune-targeted therapy.

Raoul Minsart/Masterfile \nPeople with heart disease who shy away from traditional cardiac rehabilitation may benefit from tai chi. \nA small study found that the slow, gentle movements of this traditional Chinese practice may help increase physical activity among those who are reluctant to exercise. \nMore than 60 percent of heart attack survivors opt out of cardiac rehabilitation , often because of the perception that the exercise involved will be unpleasant or painful, according to the study authors. \n\"We thought that tai chi might be a good option for these people because you can start very slowly and simply and, as their confidence increases, the pace and movements can be modified to increase intensity,\" said study author Dr. Elena Salmoirago-Blotcher. She is an assistant professor of medicine at the Warren Alpert School of Medicine at Brown University. \n\"Tai chi exercise can reach low-to-moderate intensity levels,\" she explained in a news release from the American Heart Association. \"The emphasis on breathing and relaxation can also help with stress reduction and psychological distress.\" \nParticipants in the study included 29 people, age 68 on average, who'd had a heart attack or a procedure to open a blocked artery. All were sedentary, and most had risk factors for heart problems, such as being overweight, smoking or having diabetes or high cholesterol . All of them also had rejected participation in cardiac rehabilitation. \nRELATED: Exercise a Good Prescription to Help Older Hearts \nFor the study, they took part in either a short program (24 classes over 12 weeks) or a longer one (52 classes over 24 weeks). All were given a DVD so they could practice tai chi at home. \nTai chi was found to be safe for the participants with heart disease, with minor muscle pain at the very start the only negative effect. Tai chi also was well-liked by the participants, who all reported they would recommend it to a friend. The researchers said the participants attended 66 percent of classes, suggesting it's a manageable routine. \nTai chi didn't boost the participants' aerobic fitness levels after three months. But those who completed the longer program did get more moderate to vigorous physical activity on a weekly basis, the study reported. \nThe findings were published Oct. 11 in the Journal of the American Heart Association . \n\"On its own, tai chi wouldn't obviously replace other components of traditional cardiac rehabilitation, such as education on risk factors, diet and adherence to needed medications,\" Salmoirago-Blotcher said. \n\"If proven effective in larger studies,\" she said, \"it might be possible to offer it as an exercise option within a rehab center as a bridge to more strenuous exercise, or in a community setting with the educational components of rehab delivered outside of a medical setting.\" Last Updated:10/12/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

Please select a newsletter Emotional support is critical for curbing depression, anxiety, and suicidal intentions. Getty Images \nA cancer diagnosis of any type raises a person's risk of suicide. But people diagnosed with lung cancer are at more than four times the risk of the general population, according to a study presented in May at the American Thoracic Society's 2017 international conference in Washington, DC. \nWhile alarming, the findings are not entirely surprising, says study corresponding author Mohamed Rahouma, MD, a post-doctoral cardiothoracic research fellow at Weill Cornell Medical College and New York Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. \n\"We know that lung cancer is an aggressive disease with a low median survival rate,\" Dr. Rahouma says, adding that the research further showed that suicide appears to be more common in people with advanced stages of lung cancer, which have significantly lower odds of survival than early-stage lung cancer. Study Highlights High Risk for Lung Cancer Patients Among All Patients \nFor the study, researchers analyzed cancer-related suicide information from more than 3.5 million people in a large database that spanned four decades. Cancer was associated with nearly 6,700 suicides. The scientists investigated the suicide rate of the four most common non\u2013skin cancers: breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal. \nCompared with the general population, the suicide rate of people with any kind of cancer was 60 percent higher. \nWhen broken down by type of cancer, the suicide rate of people with breast or prostate cancer was 20 percent higher than the general population and 40 percent higher for colorectal cancer. By comparison, lung cancer corresponded with a 420 percent higher rate of suicide. \nAmong those with lung cancer, Asians and men were significantly more likely to take their own lives. Being older, being widowed, refusing surgical treatment, and having cancer that has spread to other areas of the body also increased suicide risk. Findings Support Earlier Research \nThe new research falls in line with what previous studies have suggested, says Wolfgang Linden, PhD , a psychologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \nFor example, a previous study published in October 2013 in the journal Chest found that the suicide rate of people with lung cancer is higher than the general population, especially within three months of diagnosis. And in research published in December 2012 in the Journal of Affective Disorders , Dr. Linden and his colleagues found that nearly 25 percent of women with lung cancer were clinically depressed \u2014 the highest prevalence rate among cancer types. \"Depression goes hand-in-hand with suicidal intentions,\" Linden says. Many Aspects of the Diagnosis May Play a Role \nThough the new study didn\u2019t look specifically at what causes the high rate of suicide among people with lung cancer, there may be a few possible explanations. \nFor one thing, lung cancer is generally asymptomatic until the advanced stages of the disease, so diagnosis often comes late. As such, the five-year survival rate (the percentage of people who survive at least 5 years after diagnosis) for lung cancer is significantly lower than for other common cancers, including prostate and breast cancer. \n\u201cIt's pretty easy to convince yourself that you can get through prostate or breast cancer,\" Linden says. Not so with lung cancer, he adds. \nAdditionally, the number one risk factor for lung cancer is cigarette smoking. People diagnosed with the disease who have a history of smoking likely feel a lot of guilt and self-anger knowing that they could have prevented their ailment. The combination of depression from the cancer prognosis and self-anger may be what ultimately drives people over the edge, Linden says. \nOther factors may include co-occurring health issues caused by smoking, such as heart disease, as well as lack of emotional support found in support groups; given the disease's lower cure rates and shorter survival times, there are relatively few support groups for survivors compared with other cancers. Preventing Despair, Offering Support \nFor people diagnosed with lung cancer, adequate emotional support is critical for curbing depression, anxiety, and suicidal intentions. \nIf you have a family member or friend with lung cancer, you should keep an eye out for signs of depression, including changes in mood, sleep, and appetite. Additionally, you should take an interest in how they're doing and show that you're there for support, but don't press them to do things or try to force them to open up emotionally because this approach could backfire, Linden says. \n\"In our practice, we've decided that we need to intervene for those patients that seem at higher risk of suicide,\" Rahouma says. Upon diagnosing patients, physicians need to ask about the emotional support they have at home or elsewhere, as well as how often they're alone and if they're frequently at home. \"If the patient looks to be at a higher risk, we can start to consult with them and refer them to a psychologist.\" \nLinden agrees that \"supportive emotional therapy\" from a psychologist is important if you've been recently diagnosed with lung cancer. He stresses that the goal isn't necessarily to completely remove those feelings of sadness and anger, but rather to help you see what you have left to live for. \n\"The bottom line is that all our days are counted,\" Linden says. \"Life is full of crappy things that are bound to happen, but if you don't take the time to enjoy the good things, you are missing out on life.\" Last Updated: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rahouma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolfgang linden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamed rahouma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linden", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "thoracic society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of british columbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weill cornell medical college", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vancouver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington, dc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york presbyterian hospital", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-14T03:48:43.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5320904c95699a651e72abcd5b1571f78d9d61b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2dJBERhM01arUE_2AiRTpbSFSGO3zGcHY6o5rpnaAZUS5nzxWKGnBYxHUnbdRtzq11ckafL5E2YZ44lMVCKepaCMOHXKdz3KUmHwNc4SJKpA_nzWJgOZe9A--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Convince a Doctor to Take Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms Seriously | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Convince a Doctor to Take Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms Seriously | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-13T14:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.018, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Not-All-In-Your-Head-Get-Dr-To-Take-You-Seriously-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5320904c95699a651e72abcd5b1571f78d9d61b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2dJBERhM01arUE_2AiRTpbSFSGO3zGcHY6o5rpnaAZUS5nzxWKGnBYxHUnbdRtzq11ckafL5E2YZ44lMVCKepaCMOHXKdz3KUmHwNc4SJKpA_nzWJgOZe9A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Beth Levine", "published": "2017-10-13T14:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Convince a Doctor to Take Rheumatoid Arthritis Symptoms Seriously | Everyday Health", "text": "Sign Up for Our Living with Rheumatoid Arthritis Newsletter Thanks for signing up!

Please select a newsletter Don\u2019t let a dismissive doctor delay your diagnosis. Lumina/Stocksy \nIt took Kristen Towery, of Tampa, Florida, more than 20 years to get her rheumatoid arthritis (RA) properly diagnosed. It started in her late twenties when she felt exhausted and had random rashes and other vague symptoms . In her early thirties, her hands started to bother her and the joint symptoms started to spread. She went through many doctors who told her it was all in her head, she was depressed, and should go see a therapist. \n\u201cI knew something was wrong with me, and I knew it wasn\u2019t depression . I just didn\u2019t know if we\u2019d ever find it. It went on so long, the best I was hoping for was that they\u2019d find it when they did my autopsy!\u201d says Towery, who is now a Florida representative for CreakyJoint\u2019s Patient Council . \nShe finally got the diagnosis when she saw a rheumatologist who immediately found the rheumatoid arthritis through X-rays. She recalls, \u201cMost people would be devastated but the day I was diagnosed, I was so happy, I was giddy \u2014 because I finally I knew what I was dealing with.\u201d Too Many Women on the Medical Battlefront \nMany RA patients can relate to Towery\u2019s story, since most autoimmune patients see five doctors over 4.6 years before they are correctly diagnosed. \u201cSixty percent will be told they are just chronic complainers,\u201d says Virginia Ladd, president and executive director, American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association (AARDA) . This affects women disproportionately. According to AARDA, 75 percent of those with RA are female, and autoimmune diseases in general are the top killers of women under age 65. Diagnosis Delays Can Be Dangerous \nThere are many reasons why this is happening, but the biggest issue is that RA symptoms often tend to be numerous and vague: fatigue , rashes, random pain. \u201cDoctors are uncomfortable with ambiguity. When something is not clear, we become discombobulated, so it is easy to say it\u2019s psychosomatic. And sometimes that might be. But there is some underlying sexism as well \u2014 the thinking that women are so menopausal and emotional,\u201d says Danielle Ofri, MD, PhD , author of What Patients Say, What Doctors Hear , and associate professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine in New York City. \nLadd adds, \u201cAutoimmune diseases often have an array of symptoms. The fact that you are listing a whole bunch of symptoms, when you are young and look healthy, can throw a physician off. In fact, women doctors are just as likely as male doctors to respond this way.\" She notes that men with autoimmune diseases who are told it is psychological are significantly fewer, but there are significantly fewer men with these disease as well. Bad Communication Is a Big Part of the Delayed Diagnosis Problem \nAnother major problem is that many physicians just don\u2019t take the time to listen to their patients. Research published in the journal Family Medicine found that \u201cpatients spoke, uninterrupted, an average of 12 seconds after the resident entered the room. One-fourth of the time, residents interrupted patients before they finished speaking.\u201d Don\u2019t Give Up, Do Fight for a Diagnosis \nIf you feel your doctor isn\u2019t listening to you or taking you seriously, here\u2019s what to do: \nDon\u2019t overwhelm the doctor with symptoms. When too many things are thrown at the doctor in one sitting, it becomes hard to see the forest for the trees. \u201cWhittle down the list to what is most important to you and had the most impact on your life. Mention those first and don\u2019t get into the minutiae. Make the doctor ask you for more information, because that engages the doctor,\u201d says Ladd. \nWatch your doctors as they interact with you. \u201cPay attention to their reactions,\u201d says Dr. Ofri. Are they not even making eye contact because they are staring at their computers? Do they respond to what you are saying? Are they asking the right questions that indicate that they have heard what you\u2019ve said? If you say you have joint pain, do they ask which joint? How often? Are the other questions related to what you are saying? \nBe wary that they are going in the \u201call in your head\u201d direction. They ask, \u201cAre you under stress or are you happily married?\u201d \u201cThat means they are making excuses for your symptoms instead of saying let\u2019s follow you, let\u2019s try this or that and come back in two months. Some things do take time to be diagnosed but it can\u2019t be diagnosed if no one is following you. If your doctor doesn\u2019t set up another appointment, it means he isn\u2019t taking you too seriously,\u201d says Ladd. \nIf your general practitioners don\u2019t seem to be paying attention, ask to see a specialist. If they refuse, go to see one on your own. \nChange doctors if you feel dismissed or unheard. \u201cThe conversation you have with your doctor is the most important process that you have. Communication is key, especially in rheumatoid diseases ,\u201d says Ofri. Be Sure to Self-Treat Carefully and Responsibly \nMany frustrated RA patients are tempted to self-treat, which can be good and bad. Most of the supplements are harmless and there can be a placebo effect, but be sure you are honest with your physician about what you are taking. Ofri says, \u201cWork with your doctor, don\u2019t try to hide it. Some of these alternative therapies may work, but there can be toxicities that we don\u2019t know about. Also, the supplement might not contain what it says it contains. If your doctors are really listening to you, they should be able to integrate complementary healing .\u201d Believe in Yourself, Advocate for Yourself \n\u201cIt comes down to: You have to believe in yourself, your own experience, and fight for proper d iagnosis . You can\u2019t give up. You have to realize that your doctor is not in charge of your personal health \u2014 you are. If that doctor is not giving you the answers you want, but you know there is something wrong, it is your responsibility to keep going and advocate for yourself,\u201d says Towery.

Flu season peaks anywhere from late November through March, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , and keeping hands clean and hygienic is one of the most important ways to avoid getting sick. Even when you act early and get the influenza shot , it takes two weeks after vaccination for your body to create the antibodies that protect against flu. How to Prevent Flu Despite Rheumatoid Arthritis Joint Pain \nSince people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are especially vulnerable to flu-related infections , flu prevention is key. But frequent hand-washing can be a drag when your hands are painful or swollen, a frequent RA symptom. Why? Hands contain many small joints, quite of a few containing the synovial tissue most often attacked by RA. Regular cleaning gadgets that require a certain level of manual dexterity can be, literally, a pain for those with RA. Soap Dispensers Designed With Arthritis Symptoms In Mind \n\u201cPeople with arthritis and tender joints are so appreciative and loyal to brands and products that make their lives easier,\u201d says Marcy O\u2019Koon, senior director for consumer health at the Arthritis Foundation . She suggests checking out the Arthritis Foundation Ease of Use program for products tested by ergonomic experts and a panel of people with arthritis (look for the Ease-of-Use Commendation on labels). \u201cThe process includes a real-world review by a panel of people with arthritis. All too often, products that are not arthritis-friendly are actually not \u2018people-friendly,\u2019 meaning they are actually difficult for everybody to use.\u201d \nUntil the Arthritis Foundation program includes a hand-washing recommendation, consider these options. These four easy-to-use soap dispensers \u2014 and one scrub brush \u2014 will help you clean up nice, in more ways than one.

Loss is participating in the Lungevity Breathe Deep DC Walk in Washington, DC, on November 5. \nWhen Karen Loss, 57, tells people that she has lung cancer, she always braces for the inevitable question: \u201cAre you a smoker?\u201d She isn\u2019t, and never has been, but ever since she was diagnosed with non-small-cell lung cancer in 2012, it\u2019s one of the most common questions she faces. She tries not to get annoyed. She\u2019s learned through experience that lung cancer carries a stigma because of its association with smoking, and that people are misinformed. \nThat\u2019s one of the main reasons Loss decided to become an advocate and educator, and why she\u2019ll be walking for the fourth year in the Lungevity Breathe Deep Walk fundraiser . \u201cPeople think that if they didn\u2019t smoke, they\u2019re not at risk of lung cancer,\u201d she says. \u201cI have two responses to this. One, anyone who has lungs is potentially at risk, and two, even smokers deserve compassion just like the rest of us,\u201d she says. \n\u201cMy goal is to spread awareness about the disease, because there\u2019s a lot unintentional ignorance surrounding it,\u201d says Loss. An estimated 10 to 20 percent of people who die from lung cancer were never smokers. A Delayed Diagnosis \nThis kind of misconception about lung cancer may have delayed Loss\u2019s own diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019m not a smoker and I had symptoms that didn\u2019t make me or anyone else think lung cancer,\u201d she says. She had what she calls, \u201cchest attacks,\u201d feeling like a rubber band was constricting her chest, which would last for a day or so and then go away. The only other symptom was that her voice was raspy. \nShe first went to a gastroenterologist, who looked for heartburn, hernias, and other causes of her symptoms. Finally, her doctor ordered a CAT scan to image her gallbladder. Her gallbladder was fine, it turned out, but her lungs were not. The scan caught the tumor, which was categorized as stage IV, the most advanced stage. \nLung cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage, because it\u2019s only in the late stages that symptoms first appear. The diagnosis can get further delayed in patients, like Loss, who are not smokers, because even physicians tend not to consider lung cancer as a diagnosis in nonsmokers. It\u2019s not unusual for tumors to show up on scans ordered for other reasons. A Positive Outlook \nLoss was surprised by her diagnosis, but she knew how to cope. This was the second time around for her. When she was 36, she was diagnosed with ovarian and uterine cancer, which was treated successfully. In some ways, she says, her diagnosis \u201cwas probably easier for me because I had some experience with cancer.\u201d She says her religious faith and a determined optimism has sustained her through the difficult treatments. \n\u201cI am a firm believer in trying to maintain a positive attitude toward living with cancer. It won\u2019t necessarily lengthen one\u2019s life,\u201d she says, \u201cbut it will make living easier and better.\u201d \nLoss documented her cancer treatments and thoughts in a book, Trekking Through Cancerland , which started as a weekly email update to friends and family. It covers the first nine months after she was diagnosed with lung cancer and walks readers through the ups and downs of her treatment. Advocating for Clinical Trials \nIn November, she will reach the five-year anniversary of her diagnosis, putting her in a very small group of survivors. The five-year survival rate for people diagnosed with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer is less than 1 percent. She is not \u201ccured,\u201d though. \nLoss is currently in an experimental trial of an immunotherapy drug, and one of her advocacy goals is to encourage others to do the same. \n\u201cClinical trials in lung cancer are very important for an awful lot of us, but only about 3 percent of cancer patients participate in them,\u201d she says. For Loss, participating in clinical trials may increase her chance of survival, but also helps provide scientific data that will benefit future cancer patients.

Please select a newsletter Older adults who took weekly dance classes showed gains in their balancing ability. Tom Stewart/Getty Images \nDance classes may beat traditional exercise when it comes to improving older adults' balance -- and it might enhance brain areas related to memory and learning along the way. \nThat's the finding of a small study that compared dance lessons against standard exercise -- including brisk walking -- among 52 healthy seniors. \nOver a year and a half, older adults who took weekly dance classes showed gains in their balancing ability. There were no such improvements in the traditional exercise group. \nResearchers also found hints that all those mambos and cha-chas had extra brain benefits. \nSeniors in both groups showed growth in the hippocampus -- a brain structure that's involved in memory and learning. But the dancers showed changes in more areas of the hippocampus. \nPatrick Muller, one of the researchers on the study, suggested an explanation: The \"multimodal\" nature of dance -- its physical and mental components -- might be behind the extra brain boost. \nSeniors in the dance group had to continually learn and \"imprint\" new steps, explained Muller, a Ph.D. candidate at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Magdeburg, Germany. \nAlong with that mental challenge, he said, dance also involves coordinating movement with music -- which itself affects the brain. Plus, there's the fun, Muller noted. \nRELATED: The 15 Most Common Health Concerns for Seniors \nDavid Marquez is an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He said it's hard to know what to make of the brain findings, since the study group was so small. \nMarquez, who was not involved in the research, is studying the effects of Latin dance classes on older Hispanic adults' well-being. \nHe agreed that dance can offer things that simpler repetitive activity may not. \n\"With dance, you're having to think about each step,\" Marquez said. \"There are motor, cognitive and social components . And there's the music.\" \nBut, he added, both exercise groups in this study showed changes in the hippocampus, on average. And that's in line with past research, Marquez noted: Studies have found that regular aerobic exercise, like walking, may boost the volume of brain areas involved in memory, planning and other vital functions. \n\"So the message is, get moving,\" Marquez said. \nUltimately, he added, the \"best\" form of exercise for any one person is the one that can be maintained. \n\"If you don't enjoy the activity, you won't do it,\" Marquez said. \"So find something you enjoy and do it regularly.\" \nThe study, published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience , included healthy volunteers who were typically in their late 60s. \nHalf were randomly assigned to take dance classes over 18 months. The rest attended a traditional exercise program that included walking, stationary bikes, strength-training and stretching. \nThe dance group met twice a week for the first six months, then weekly. To keep participants on their toes, the dance styles changed every couple of weeks and ranged from Latin to line dancing to jazz. \nJust 14 seniors from the dance group and 12 from the traditional fitness group stayed with the program for the full 18 months. \nIn the end, the study found, only the dancers showed clear improvements on balance tests. And while both groups had increases in their hippocampal volume, the dance group tended to show changes in more subregions of the hippocampus. \nThe hippocampus is critical, according to Muller, because it is affected in dementia -- including Alzheimer's disease -- and it can also shrink with age. \nThe big question, though, is whether dance can make any difference in the odds of seniors' mental decline. \n\"Further research is needed to clarify whether this intervention truly has the potential to reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's,\" Muller said. \nAccording to Marquez, it would be interesting to do the same study with older adults who already have some cognitive impairment, and see if there are similar brain changes. \nFor now, Muller said, the findings suggest dance might have some advantages over simpler repetitive physical activity. \nBut he agreed that exercise in general -- plus a healthy lifestyle overall -- \"can help the brain stay young.\" Last Updated:10/16/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

Please select a newsletter Light therapy can sometimes cause side effects, such as mania, in people with bipolar disorder. Corbis \nPeople afflicted with bipolar disorder may find some relief from depression with daily doses of light therapy, new research suggests. \nWith light therapy, people spend time sitting in close proximity to a light-emitting box -- in this case, bright white light -- with exposures increasing from 15 minutes per day to a full hour over a period of weeks. \nThe study found that within a month the therapy helped treat depression in people with bipolar disorder . \n\"Effective treatments for bipolar depression are very limited,\" noted lead researcher Dr. Dorothy Sit. \n\"This gives us a new treatment option for bipolar patients that we know gets us a robust response within four to six weeks,\" said Sit, who is associate professor of psychiatry at Northwestern University in Chicago. \nAccording to the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, bipolar disorder \"is a brain and behavior disorder characterized by severe shifts in a person's mood and energy, making it difficult for the person to function.\" Over 5.7 million Americans are thought to have the disorder, which often involves depressive episodes. \nAs Sit's team noted, prior research had shown that morning light therapy reduces symptoms of depression in people with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) , a condition where winter's reduced light spurs depression. \nHowever, it's also been noted that light therapy can sometimes cause side effects, such as mania, in people with bipolar disorder. \nRELATED: 10 Celebrities With Depression, Bipolar Disorder, or Both \nStill, the Northwestern team wondered if the treatment might not have a role for bipolar patients with at least moderate depression who were also taking a mood stabilizer drug. \nIn the study, 46 patients received either a 7,000 lux bright white light or a 50 lux light (acting as the \"placebo arm\" of the trial). \nThe study participants were told to place the light box about one foot from their face for 15 minutes between noon and 2:30 p.m. each day at the start of the study. \nOver six weeks, the patients increased their light therapy \"doses\" in 15-minute increments until they reached a dose of 60 minutes per day -- or had a significant change in their mood. \nCompared with people in the placebo group, those in the treatment group were more likely to have significant improvements, Sit's team said. \nMore than 68 percent of patients in the treatment group achieved a normal mood versus 22 percent of those in the placebo group, the findings showed. Patients in the treatment group also had a much lower average depression score than those in the placebo group, and significantly higher functioning, meaning they could return to work or complete household tasks they hadn't been able to finish before treatment. \nSignificantly, none of the patients experienced mania or hypomania , a condition that includes a period of elation, euphoria, irritability, agitation, rapid speech, racing thoughts, a lack of focus and risk-taking behaviors. \n\"As clinicians, we need to find treatments that avoid these side effects and allow for a nice, stable response. Treatment with bright light at midday can provide this,\" Sit said in a university news release. \nTwo psychiatrists agreed that the therapy may have merit for patients, who often have few options. \n\"No standard antidepressants are approved for treatment of bipolar depression,\" said Dr. Seth Mandel, who directs psychiatry at Northwell Health's Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. He added that antipsychotics that are approved for bipolar disorder often come with side effects that cause many patients to stop using them. \nLight therapy \"offers us another option, one that certainly appears to do no harm,\" Mandel said. \nStill, he noted that patients with more severe symptoms weren't included in the Chicago study, and he also believes many people won't be able to adhere to the hour-long, daily dosage required. \nDr. Ami Baxi is a psychiatrist who directs adult inpatient services at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She agreed that light therapy may be \"a welcome addition to our limited treatment options for bipolar depression.\" \nThe study was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health and published Oct. 3 in the American Journal of Psychiatry .

Please enter a valid email address Sign up Oops! Please enter a valid email address Oops! Please select a newsletter Don't rely too heavily on doctor review websites when looking for a gastroenterologist. Shutterstock \nBefore the internet, people in search of a new gastroenterologist usually had to rely on word-of-mouth recommendations from other doctors, family members, or friends. Of course, many people still look for a doctor this way, but for several years, there have also been websites and other online tools available where you can read and write reviews of doctors in your area. Can these websites really connect you with the care you need? \nIn a word, no \u2014 for a variety of reasons. One is that there still isn\u2019t any online hub where you\u2019re likely to find all the information you care about when looking for a doctor. Many commercial websites that offer doctor ratings, such as Healthgrades, Vitals, and Yelp, don\u2019t let you easily search by insurance plan or hospital network, and often don\u2019t offer much information on the focus of a doctor\u2019s practice, such as the conditions they specialize in treating. \nThen there\u2019s the question of how much you should trust or rely on the reviews that people post on doctor-rating websites. One major limitation of commercial doctor-rating websites is that most doctors in a given area probably aren\u2019t listed on them, and among those that are listed, there probably won\u2019t be many reviews. It\u2019s also important to remember that reviews are subjective, so you might not even get the information you\u2019re seeking. \nAlso, because it\u2019s important to find a doctor with whom you can discuss personal and oftentimes embarrassing Crohn\u2019s symptoms, you might want to tread carefully when relying on doctor review websites. 3 Things to Know Before Scheduling an Appointment 1. Not a Lot of People Actually Post Ratings \nAs noted in a study published in February 2017 in the journal JAMA , among doctors with at least one review on any of the main commercial sites, the median number of reviews of that doctor was just 7 \u2014 across all the sites. This isn\u2019t a large enough number to get much of an overall impression of an MD, especially when you consider that some of these reviews may have been written by the same person on different sites. \n\u201cEven though these sites have really good intentions, they haven\u2019t fulfilled the promises that they made initially,\u201d says Tara Lagu, MD , a research scientist in the Center for Quality of Care Research at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, who coauthored the JAMA study. \n\u201cI think it\u2019s partly that the sites are not great,\u201d Dr. Lagu says, \u201cpartly that patients hesitate to write reviews, and partly that the numbers aren\u2019t sufficient\u201d when it comes to how many patients a doctor typically sees, compared with the number of people who do things like visit restaurants and buy appliances \u2014 areas in which reviews are much easier to come by. \nLagu believes there may be a simple explanation for why people are more hesitant to review their doctors than other services. \u201cReviewing your doctor is like reviewing your mother,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re probably going to give your mother a mixed review, but overall, you\u2019re most interested in preserving the relationship. So overall, you\u2019re going to hesitate to say anything negative.\u201d 2. Not All Local Doctors Are Included on Rating Sites \nOn all of the major commercial doctor rating sites, you can search for a doctor based on their name, location, or specialty. Some also let you search based on a condition or procedure, or a hospital where the doctor works. \nIt\u2019s often very difficult, though, to find out what insurance a doctor accepts, and not possible on most of the major sites to search based on this information. Some sites have a tab on each doctor\u2019s profile for insurance carriers or plans accepted, but this information may be incomplete or missing. And searching for doctors in your area, then clicking around to find out if a particular one accepts your insurance, is hardly an efficient way to get this information. \nIt\u2019s also worth noting that when you do a location-based search on any of these sites, you\u2019re not going to find every doctor in your area who fits your search criteria \u2014 just the ones with a profile on that site. Depending on where you live, this can be extremely limiting, with potentially only a handful of doctors nearby showing up in your search. And even if you live in a major metropolitan area, your search is likely to leave out many qualified doctors. \nYou\u2019re also likely to be directed to doctors with the highest ratings, rather than just those closest to you, when you do a location-based search. This makes a certain amount of sense \u2014 after all, these ratings are probably a major reason why you\u2019re on the site. But you may miss a nearby doctor with only a couple of ratings, potentially placing them lower on the list of search results. 3. Ratings Are Highly Subjective \nLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve done a search, found a doctor who appears to fit your basic needs, and are now browsing the doctor\u2019s ratings and reviews. A large number of positive scores or comments is a good sign, right? \nPossibly \u2014 but it should be telling that especially among doctors with many more reviews than others, the comments tend to be overwhelmingly positive. This probably isn\u2019t because the doctor has many more happy patients than other doctors, or happens to see more patients who decide to write reviews. Instead, there\u2019s a good chance that the doctor\u2019s office is encouraging patients to write reviews \u2014 possibly in a selective manner. \nEven assuming that a review isn\u2019t solicited or biased in any way, what exactly is a patient reviewing? Most likely, it\u2019s the overall experience of their visit: whether they were seen in a timely manner, how receptive the doctor was to their concerns, and whether they got a diagnosis or treatment they were looking for. \nWhile it\u2019s perfectly fine to care about these factors, a patient is unlikely to have the expertise to judge a doctor\u2019s skill or competence beyond a basic level, and even if this were possible, a handful of reviews doesn\u2019t tell you much about a doctor\u2019s overall track record. \nIn fact, there\u2019s some evidence that online reviews don\u2019t reflect a doctor\u2019s overall performance. Researchers at ConsumerMedical , a healthcare support and concierge company, did a comparison of doctor ratings on commercial sites with doctors\u2019 actual performance data \u2014 such as hospital readmission and infection rates, and other measurable outcomes \u2014 within five medical specialties, including gastroenterology, in three major U.S. cities. They found that only 2 percent of top-ranked doctors on the sites were also top-ranked based on outcomes. \n\u201cUnfortunately, patient-generated reviews just don\u2019t work that well when it comes to picking doctors,\u201d says Sue Lewis , chief product and strategy officer at ConsumerMedical. \u201cVery little exists out there that helps patients choose a high-quality physician.\u201d \nSo where does this leave those of us who want access to useful ratings tools that are as objective as possible? \nLewis notes that some health insurance plans have a directory that includes some measures of doctor performance, but that this feature tends not to be advertised widely to members. So it\u2019s worth checking out your plan\u2019s online search function to see if anything like this exists. How to Improve Doctor Review Sites for the Future \nWhen it comes to reviews by patients, Lagu believes the wave of the future may be a public website incorporating the results of surveys designed by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality , which are already widely administered across the country. Planning for such a site is already under way, Lagu notes, adding that such a site would incorporate the experiences of a large, random sample of patients. \nA handful of health systems \u2014 notably University of Utah Health \u2014 already post the results of these surveys on their doctor profiles, yielding far more reviews than exist on most commercial sites. \nIn the meantime, if you\u2019re intent on looking at doctor reviews, read as many as you can before making an appointment, and take what you read, positive or negative, with a grain of salt. And even if it seems hopelessly old-fashioned, you may also want to ask friends, family, or a doctor you trust for recommendations. Word of mouth may not be perfect, but neither are the newer methods of finding a doctor. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "despi", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "crohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthgrades", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sue lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tara lagu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "crohn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "everyday health everyday health crohn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "baystate medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agency for healthcare research and quality", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of utah health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for quality of care research", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "springfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T22:09:02.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5badac46190f74cafe86393bf5589cf85493db4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2VECmAHwbmo0fRhHnCIGPAhekjixeM1N4YnIR8dQTUgTedwbH3Qe94WzXiDN01NNCLmdzpK60JMdDWRvpJ1riPbOEl0UTQQh20OFUTAqPE96TpA0IC8_eQzje4APvLPvdZ0_GsOTM89HkW2OdLc6rPjAIfaDWiZy3X4CJjd55e7Ze0HMVZGtxAvfZX8Mhyyrf4cTu7iWYMmqm.iHDA4IJGcE65UTKe6HUvlI36ARQmsmLs6pbMF5CvZ64AYIgHAJ1UKVFaS9TQErWbajs293vWA--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "Breast Cancer Screenings Still Best for Early Detection | Everyday Health", "title_full": "Breast Cancer Screenings Still Best for Early Detection | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-16T13:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.23, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/Breast-Cancer-Screenings-Still-Best-for-Early-Detection-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5badac46190f74cafe86393bf5589cf85493db4c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2VECmAHwbmo0fRhHnCIGPAhekjixeM1N4YnIR8dQTUgTedwbH3Qe94WzXiDN01NNCLmdzpK60JMdDWRvpJ1riPbOEl0UTQQh20OFUTAqPE96TpA0IC8_eQzje4APvLPvdZ0_GsOTM89HkW2OdLc6rPjAIfaDWiZy3X4CJjd55e7Ze0HMVZGtxAvfZX8Mhyyrf4cTu7iWYMmqm.iHDA4IJGcE65UTKe6HUvlI36ARQmsmLs6pbMF5CvZ64AYIgHAJ1UKVFaS9TQErWbajs293vWA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mary Elizabeth Dallas", "published": "2017-10-16T13:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breast Cancer Screenings Still Best for Early Detection | Everyday Health", "text": "Breast Cancer Screenings Still Best for Early Detection Newer treatments, early diagnoses are improving outcomes for women with the disease, experts say.

Getty Images \nBreast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States, and routine screenings remain the most reliable way to detect the disease early, a breast cancer expert says. \n\" Breast cancer can be treated more successfully if detected in its early phases, while it is small and has not yet spread,\" said Dr. Kathryn Evers, director of mammography at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. \"With today's state-of-the-art treatment options and less extensive surgery, patients are experiencing better outcomes.\" \nOlder age is a leading risk factor for breast cancer. Most women are diagnosed after the age of 50. Having certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also predispose women to the disease. And there are some lifestyle-related risk factors that can be controlled, such as hormone therapy after menopause, obesity, alcohol intake and physical inactivity, Evers said. \n\"Having one risk factor or even several doesn't mean a woman will definitely develop breast cancer,\" she said in a Fox Chase news release. \"Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly.\" \nNot all women with breast cancer experience the same warning signs of the disease. Symptoms of breast cancer may include: A lump in the breast or armpit. Swelling or thickening in part of the breast. Dimpling or irritation of the skin on the breast. Pain in the breast that doesn't go away. Redness or flaky skin on the breast or nipple. Unusual nipple discharge. A change in the size or shape of the breast. \nIn some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted. \n\"All women should know how their breasts look and feel so they can recognize any changes in them. This is an important part of breast health,\" she said. \"But just being familiar with your breasts should never take the place of regular screenings and mammograms. These tests can help find breast cancer in its early stages, even before symptoms appear.\" \nThere are three tests often used to look for breast cancer, Evers said. Mammogram: An X-ray of the breast used to examine breast changes. Its effectiveness depends on the size of a breast tumor and the density of breast tissue. Three-dimensional (3D) mammography involves X-ray machines that take pictures of thin slices of the breast from different angles, to build a 3D image.

Please select a newsletter Diagnosing oral psoriasis is tricky because it can resemble conditions such as stomatitis and oral thrush. Getty Images \nPsoriasis can affect different parts of your body, such as the scalp, the skin on your knees and elbows, and even the nails. Less common and often overlooked is oral psoriasis, which results in symptoms in and around the mouth. \nOral psoriasis \u201ccan affect the inside of the cheeks, the tongue, and very rarely the gums,\u201d says Timothy Chase , doctor of dental medicine, a cosmetic dentist in New York City and a faculty mentor at Spear Advanced Dental Education Center in Scottsdale, Arizona. Like other forms of psoriasis, it can cause redness, scaling, and breaks in the skin. Why Diagnosing Oral Psoriasis Can Be Tricky \nAccording to a study published in June 2016 in the journal Dermatology , diagnosing oral psoriasis is challenging because it can trigger different symptoms that resemble other conditions affecting the mouth and lips, such as stomatitis, oral thrush, or chronic eczema. Symptoms may include oral pain, burning, or changes in taste perception. \nA case study published in January 2013 in the European Journal of General Dentistry described one patient\u2019s oral psoriasis symptoms as including \u201cgum bleeding, chronic irritation, intolerance to salt and spicy food, and frequent occurrence of painful mouth ulcers with a fissured tongue.\u201d Is It Oral Psoriasis or Geographic Tongue? \n\u201cPeople who have psoriasis may be more prone to a condition called geographic tongue,\u201d says Dr. Chase. The American Academy of Oral Medicine describes this as an inflammatory condition that typically appears on the top and sides of the tongue. \nWhile it doesn\u2019t cause pain, the condition can change the tongue\u2019s appearance with red areas of varying size surrounded by a white border. It\u2019s believed that 10 to 15 percent of people with psoriasis will develop geographic tongue at some point in their lifetime. How to Prevent and Treat Symptoms of the Mouth \nAccording to Estee Williams, MD , a dermatologist in New York City, there are some things patients can do to minimize the risk for oral psoriasis. \n\u201cFirst and foremost, I recommend maintaining good oral hygiene, including use of any alkaline mouth rinses,\u201d Dr. Williams says. A do-it-yourself rinse can be made from baking soda and water. \nSmoking is a risk factor for a variety of oral problems. \u201cIf you smoke, stop immediately,\u201d Williams says. Also, avoid alcohol and find ways to manage stress, both of which are common psoriasis triggers. \n\u201cAnother way to ward off any oral issues is to have regular dental checkups,\u201d Williams adds. \nIf you have red and white patches or lesions in your mouth, your dentist may want to perform an oral tissue biopsy. While it may not establish that you have oral psoriasis, a biopsy can help diagnose or rule out other conditions, such as cancer. \nYour doctor may recommend an anesthetic rinse, such as Xylocaine Viscous ( lidocaine ), a hydrochloride solution, if you have an oral irritation that is causing pain. For more severe cases, you may be prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids . But systemic treatment usually isn\u2019t usually recommended if the symptoms are limited to your mouth.

Health experts are concerned that the continuing rise in obesity will lead to greater numbers of people suffering from diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses. Thinkstock \nAlmost forty percent adults in the United States are now obese, continuing an ever-expanding epidemic of obesity that's expected to lead to sicker Americans and higher health care costs. \nAlmost four out of 10 adults and 18.5 percent of kids aged 2 to 19 now meet the clinical definition of obesity , according to a new report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \nThat's up from 30.5 percent of adults and 13.9 percent of children in 1999-2000, the CDC report noted. \nPublic health experts are concerned that the continuing rise in obesity will lead to greater numbers of people suffering from diabetes, heart disease and other chronic illnesses. \n\"We've made tremendous progress reducing deaths due to cardiovascular disease and stroke in our country. Part of that is due to treatment. Part of that is due to the tremendous reduction in tobacco use,\" said Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, chief medical officer for the American Heart Association. \"But we've worried if obesity trends stayed or worsened that some of those gains might be reduced.\" \nObesity is defined as a body mass index of 30 or more. A 6-foot-tall man weighing 221 pounds is considered obese, as is a 5-foot-9 woman weighing 203 pounds. \nThe increase in youth obesity is of particular concern because these children are at greater risk for lifelong health problems, said Dr. Seema Kumar, a childhood obesity specialist with the Mayo Clinic. \nKumar said she regularly sees children with diseases that used to be considered adult-only, including type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol and fatty liver disease. \n\"Because rates of obesity are so high, despite all the advances we're seeing, our children may live less healthy and shorter lives than their parents,\" Kumar said. \"We're going to have a much higher number of adults with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease down the line.\" \nSome trends within the overall increase in obesity also have health experts worried. \nRELATED: Obesity Linked to 13 Types of Cancer \nFor example, Sanchez noted, obesity appears to be more prevalent in ethnic groups that are growing rapidly in the United States. \nAbout 47 percent of Hispanic and black adults are obese, compared with 38 percent of whites and 13 percent of Asians, the researchers found. \n\"The demographic profile of our country is shifting in such a way that the burden of obesity will continue to grow unless we address these disparities,\" Sanchez said. \"We're still going to be heading in a challenging direction.\" \nDiana Thomas, a fellow with The Obesity Society, pointed out that the rise in youth obesity also is likely to continue because obese adults tend to mate, reproduce more often, and produce children that also struggle with excess weight. \n\"That next generation that's coming in with a high prevalence of obesity will probably continue to affect us in the future,\" said Thomas, who is a professor of mathematical sciences at West Point. \nRates of obesity increase with age, the investigators found. Close to 43 percent of middle-aged adults are obese, compared with about 36 percent of younger adults, nearly 21 percent of teenagers and 14 percent of children aged 2 to 5. \nStemming the obesity epidemic will involve action at both the personal and the community level, Sanchez and Kumar said. \nFamily-based programs are available that teach young parents how to cook healthy meals, Kumar said. These programs teach healthy eating habits that kids will model once they see their parents setting an example. \n\"If we can teach our families to eat healthy, that would probably be the most important thing we could do,\" Kumar said. \nCommunities also play a crucial role. They can help by adopting policies that encourage a healthy diet and more physical activity, Sanchez suggested. These might include: Healthier food and drinks in vending machines in schools and businesses. Improving accessibility to healthy foods by promoting farmers' markets. Designing neighborhoods to be more walkable and bike-friendly. Promoting physical activity for kids both in and outside of school. \n\"It's not just about giving people information,\" Sanchez said. \"It's about helping individuals and their families adopt different behaviors, and make it easier for them to do so.\" \nThe report, by Dr. Craig Hales and colleagues at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), was published in the October issue of the CDC's NCHS Data Brief .

Yury Rumovsky/Getty Images \nA slow cooker can be a terrific tool for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who want to cook for themselves without overdoing it. If you have stiff or painful hands from joint pain, or rheumatoid arthritis -related fatigue, prepping elaborate meals can be difficult. Instead, consider slow cooking, which uses a specific countertop appliance to simmer ingredients at a low temperature over several hours. A Joint-Friendly, Convenient, and Affordable Way to Avoid Takeout Meals \nBecause the temperature doesn\u2019t get too high, it\u2019s safe to leave the appliance on when you go out, which makes this method especially convenient. The term Crock-Pot refers to a specific brand of slow cooker, but it can also be used to describe this method, too. \nWhat\u2019s great about slow cooking for people with RA? Slow Cooking Saves Time and Doesn\u2019t Require Much Standing \nWith a cook time of 4 to 10 hours, you don\u2019t have to stand over a hot stove and tend to your meal as it cooks. Instead, toss ingredients into the cooker and leave them until dinnertime. Similarly, with just one pot, there\u2019s minimal cleanup. \n\u201cI really like slow cooking, because it cuts down on the number of pots and utensils you are using,\u201d notes Sonya Angelone, RDN , spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and owner of a nutrition counseling firm based in the San Francisco area. Slow Cooking Reduces Prep Time, Prep Work, and Food Waste \nTypically, chunks of meat or fish, vegetables, and starches blend together in a slow cooker. To save yourself the potential pain-inducing work of chopping your own vegetables or proteins, look for grocery items that have already been prepared. \n\u201cPrecut veggies are great,\u201d says Sara Haas, LDN , a consultant chef and dietitian based in Chicago. \u201cThere are so many options available now and you can find them right in the produce section. You can also use the salad bar, which offers an array of precut veggies.\u201d \nBite-sized veggies require less preparation. Think about how other ingredients can cook more easily, too. \u201cInstead of buying big russet potatoes, buy fingerlings or small new potatoes so you don\u2019t have to chop them,\u201d says Haas. For proteins, consider those already cut into smaller pieces. \u201cYou can buy chicken tenders, which will cost more, but often not that much more if you shop carefully when they are on sale,\u201d says Angelone. \nSlow-cooked foods can be easier to eat, too. When meats, such as a pork tenderloin or chicken thighs, are slow cooked, they typically are stewed in a sauce or liquid so that they are falling apart when done. \u201cThere\u2019s not much cutting needed when they are cooked,\u201d she says. \nBuying pre-chopped foods can mean less cleanup and fewer food scraps, too. Notes Angelone: \u201cYou may seem like you are paying a bit more to buy a bag of precut onions, but when you buy onions by the pound, you need to cut off the outer layer and throw it away.\u201d Slow Cooking Is Another Way to Make Anti-Inflammatory Meals \nIf you experience chronic pain from RA, it may be worth considering the role of diet in your broader treatment plan. Part of the reason for painful symptoms may be inflammation , a protective response by the immune system to any type of bodily injury. The relationship between inflammation and pain is well established, so foods that are known to be anti-inflammatory are often suggested as part of pain treatment. \nFoods with direct benefits to help reduce inflammation include ginger, turmeric , rosemary, and sage, according to Robin Foroutan, RDN , an integrative medicine dietitian and a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. She also recommends foods high in potassium , since some medication taken for rheumatoid arthritis can deplete potassium. These include dark leafy greens, avocados, winter squash, butternut squash, acorn squash, and pumpkin. \nForoutan and Haas both recommend fatty fish, like salmon, for its anti-inflammatory effects. \u201cAdd fish to the Crock-Pot \u2014 omega-3s are a great addition to an RA diet,\u201d says Haas. \u201cFind slow cooker recipes that use salmon, sardines, herring, or mackerel. Have the fishmonger cut the fish into small pieces for you, and if necessary, ask them to de-skin and debone as well.\u201d A Slow Cooker Is One of Several Special Tools and Strategies That Can Help Take the Burden off Joints \nChicken, beef, and vegetable broth, which can help foods simmer while being slow cooked, can be found in vacuum-packaging that can be easier to open by hand then by using a hand-operated can opener. Similarly, many energy-saving tools, such as an electronic jar opener, or a cookbook stand that holds open a page for you, as well as arthritis-friendly utensils , can make it much easier to prep meals and then enjoy them with ease.

Getty Images \nPsoriatic arthritis varies from person to person, and the difference isn\u2019t just a matter of severity. \nThere are five subtypes of psoriatic arthritis , based on which parts of the body are affected. You can also have one type of psoriatic arthritis and then develop a different subtype down the road. \n\u201cThe categories tend to bleed into each other,\u201d says Anca Askanase, MD , a rheumatologist and associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. \u201cUltimately, they\u2019re all about joint pain, stiffness, and loss of function.\u201d \nKnowing which type of psoriatic arthritis you have can help inform your treatment and perhaps your prognosis. The systemic, or whole-body, and biologic drug treatments are similar for these types, but the approach to flare-ups may vary, Dr. Askanase notes. \nHere\u2019s a look at the different types of psoriatic arthritis: Symmetric Psoriatic Arthritis \nJust as rheumatoid arthritis tends to affect the same joints on opposite sides of the body, symmetric psoriatic arthritis can follow a similar pattern, says Kathy McKinnon, DO , a senior staff physician at Henry Ford Health System and an associate professor of medicine at Wayne State University in Detroit. \nWith symmetric psoriatic arthritis, the exact same joints aren\u2019t necessarily affected. While joints in the fingers of the right and left hands may be affected simultaneously, the joints closest to your fingertips might be affected on the right hand, while the joints closest to the base of the fingers might be affected on the left, or vice versa, for example. This type, which makes up about 33 percent of psoriatic arthritis cases, can also affect the knees, wrists, and ankles. \nBesides the usual systemic treatments, steroid injections, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) , and physical therapy can help, Askanase says. Asymmetric Psoriatic Arthritis \nThis is the most common subtype, accounting for 43 percent of cases of psoriatic arthritis, according to research published in the journal Rheumatology . While asymmetric psoriatic arthritis can occur in any joint, it doesn\u2019t affect the same joints on both sides of the body. \nWhen it affects the fingers and toes, the swelling and redness can make them look like small sausages (known as dactylitis). Even though fewer joints may be affected, given the lack of symmetry, the intensity can be disabling and difficult to treat, Askanase says. For acute flare-ups, steroid injections, NSAIDs, and physical therapy can help. Distal Psoriatic Arthritis \nThis type is usually a milder version and not as damaging to functionality, Askanase says. It affects the \u201cdistal\u201d joints, meaning it causes inflammation and stiffness in the small joints that are closest to the nails on your fingers and toes. Since these joints are so close to the nails, symptoms can include spotting or pitting in the nails or a lifting of the nail from the nail bed. \nJoint inflammation is typically associated with nail changes on the same fingers or toes, according to a study published in August 2015 in the Journal of Cutaneous Medicine and Surgery . Predominantly distal psoriatic arthritis accounts for approximately 16 percent of psoriatic arthritis cases. NSAIDs and physical therapy can help treat acute flare-ups. Spondylitis \nPain, inflammation, and stiffness in the neck, spine, and sacroiliac joints \u2014 which are between the sacrum, the bone connected to your tailbone, and the pelvis \u2014 are the telltale signs of this psoriatic arthritis subtype. \n\u201cThe big concern is this disease can progress relentlessly and lead to severe, incapacitating damage to the spine,\u201d Askanase says. The end result can cause significant impairments in mobility and functionality. \u201c TNF inhibitors [a type of biologic therapy that blocks a protein called tumor necrosis factor alpha, or TNF-alpha] have made a huge difference in our ability to control pain and provide continuous functionality in early stages [of spondylitis],\u201d Askanase notes. \nOnly 4 percent of people with psoriatic arthritis have spondylitis as their primary symptom. Arthritis Mutilans \nA relatively rare subtype, arthritis mutilans can cause serious damage and deformity to the joints in the hands and feet. It can affect other parts of the body, such as the neck and back, too. \n\u201cIt may not be as noisy in terms of pain and stiffness, yet the end result is quite extraordinary because of the amount of damage it causes,\u201d Askanase says. The most common forms of damage include bone loss, telescoping of the fingers (in which the fingers lose bone and soft tissues can\u2019t hold the fingers up), and shortening of the fingers, according to a study published in August 2015 in the Journal of Rheumatology . \nEarly treatment is important. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can prevent some permanent damage, while NSAIDs can relieve pain. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sanjai sinha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathy mckinnon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anca askanase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "askanase", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "henry ford health system", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university medical center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T10:37:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9301131dc6efd8e6fec6ff1a80cb917caedcca21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2LubsPjVrNR3s0j.WE.Qcnbyc.qLEfOUUMU58rpfPbwn.w3DDnwR.6eWutZl1qleykRAvVs8NFEYhGUBBcpIucu5940UD8mzmzIyuQjOn5P0-", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "What Makes Light Therapy Effective for Psoriasis? | Everyday Health", "title_full": "What Makes Light Therapy Effective for Psoriasis? | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-17T13:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.725, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/What-Makes-Light-Therapy-Effective-for-Psoriasis-RM-1440X810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9301131dc6efd8e6fec6ff1a80cb917caedcca21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2LubsPjVrNR3s0j.WE.Qcnbyc.qLEfOUUMU58rpfPbwn.w3DDnwR.6eWutZl1qleykRAvVs8NFEYhGUBBcpIucu5940UD8mzmzIyuQjOn5P0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Erinn Connor", "published": "2017-10-17T13:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Makes Light Therapy Effective for Psoriasis? | Everyday Health", "text": "Sign Up for Our Living with Psoriasis Newsletter Thanks for signing up!

Getty Images \nThere is no one-size-fits-all treatment for psoriasis, but there are many ways to manage the condition. Psoriasis medications include topicals that are applied directly to the skin and biologic drugs that target the immune system. Another treatment option that can be highly effective is light therapy. \nPsoriasis treatments aim to reduce inflammation and stop skin cells from growing too quickly. Light therapy, also known as phototherapy, involves repeatedly exposing the skin to ultraviolet light in order to slow cell growth. \nAccording to the National Psoriasis Foundation , psoriasis is often referred to as a \u201cT-cell mediated disease.\u201d That\u2019s because the disease occurs when immune system cells known as T cells \u201cmisfire\u201d and attack skin cells, resulting in accelerated skin production. \nBy \u201cslowing skin turnover, [phototherapy] can decrease the inflammation signals associated with psoriasis,\u201d says Adam Friedman, MD , an associate professor of dermatology and the director of translational research at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, DC. What Kinds of Light Therapy Are There? \nDifferent forms of light therapy vary according to the type of light exposure and whether it\u2019s combined with medication. Ultraviolet B (UVB) can be delivered as broadband UVB (BB-UVB) or narrowband UVB (NB-UVB). BB-UVB therapy was developed first, but NB-UVB is now more commonly used for its effectiveness and fewer side effects. A benefit of narrowband UVB is that patients are exposed to a more specific and therapeutic wavelength of light. UVB phototherapy is used to treat moderate to severe psoriasis. \nFor people with more advanced psoriasis, another form of light therapy combines ultraviolet A (UVA) with a psoralen drug ( methoxsalen ). In this combination therapy, known as PUVA, the patient takes the medication shortly before light treatment to boost the light\u2019s effect on the immune system. \nA study published in April 2013 in the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology found that PUVA therapy was most effective among adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis . According to the study, between 60 and 75 percent of patients overall who received some type of light therapy achieved at least 75 percent improvement in their condition. The results were based on the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index , an assessment tool used to score a person\u2019s condition according to disease progression. \nPUVA isn\u2019t without side effects, however, including a heightened risk of skin cancer, severe burn, and nausea. How Many Light Therapy Sessions Are Needed? \nOne of the keys \u2014 and challenges \u2014 to light therapy is that it has to be done consistently, whether it\u2019s at a doctor\u2019s office, a clinic, or at home. \u201cFor [NB-UVB] to be effective, for example, patients must come in two to three times per week, which can be onerous,\u201d says Dr. Friedman. \nStudies, including one in the American Journal of Clinical Dermatology , suggest that using a device known as an excimer laser to administer light therapy can cut down on how many sessions are needed. Laser therapy delivers highly targeted beams of ultraviolet light to specific areas of affected skin. That means higher doses can be safely administered without affecting the surrounding skin. What Are the Side Effects of Light Therapy? \nAs compared with other treatment options, light therapy poses fewer side-effects risks. \u201cMost people do not experience side effects when they are treated with phototherapy,\u201d says Shari Lipner, MD, PhD , an assistant professor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. \u201cThe most common side effect is a mild sunburn reaction, and this is more likely to occur if the person is taking a medication that causes sun sensitivity.\u201d \nBefore receiving light therapy, patients should tell their doctor about any drugs they\u2019re taking. The treatment also may not be an option for people who should avoid sunlight exposure, such as those with lupus .

Getty Images \nA U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel on Thursday recommended approval of a gene therapy that could grant the gift of sight to young people with a rare type of inherited vision loss. \nThe panel members' vote was unanimous. The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its panels, but it usually does. \nThe treatment, which involves replacing a nonworking gene with a new one, is opening a new world for children and teens with the inherited retinal disease called Leber congenital amaurosis. \n\"This is a gene therapy that can restore some vision to people who have very limited vision or no vision due to the mutation in the RPE65 gene, and as such, it's a great breakthrough,\" said Stephen Rose, chief research officer at the Foundation Fighting Blindness. \nFor those who have already received the therapy, the treatment has been life-changing. \nRELATED: How to Prevent Vision Loss and Heart Disease \nEleven-year-old Cole Carper got the treatment when he was 8, according to the Associated Press . Afterwards, \"I looked up and said, 'What are those light things?' And my mom said, 'Those are stars,'\" he said. \nHis 13-year-old sister, Caroline, was treated when she was 10. \"I saw snow falling and rain falling. I was completely surprised,\" she told the wire service. \"I thought of water on the ground or snow on the ground. I never thought of it falling.\" \nApproval by the FDA advisory panel puts the treatment on its way to becoming the first gene therapy approved for an inherited disease, said Rose. His foundation helped fund the research that led to the treatment. \nOnly one other gene therapy has so far met FDA approval -- a cancer treatment that the agency sanctioned in August. \nThis type of vision loss is rare and affects about 1,000 people in the United States, Rose said. \"But for these individuals who are essentially blind , it's a huge impact,\" he said. \nIn total, about 200,000 Americans have some type of inherited disease that causes blindness involving some 250 different genes, Rose said. \n\"We are not restoring 20/20 vision,\" he said. \"We are restoring functional vision.\" \nThis means that people can be mobile without the need for a guide dog or a cane, Rose said. \nRose said this therapy treats only this one type of vision loss. \"There are 22 different genes that can cause Leber congenital amaurosis -- RPE65 is only one of them,\" he said. \nThe treatment, voretigene neparvovec (Luxturna), was developed by Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics. \nClinical trials using gene therapy, drugs or cell therapy to treat other types of inherited visions are currently going on, Rose said. \nThis new treatment is proof that replacing a gene in the eye can restore some vision , he said, and along with other therapies, offers hope for people with previously untreatable inherited vision loss. \nIt has been tried on kids as young as 4, Rose said. \"The earlier you treat the better,\" he said. \"Ideally, you would treat people as early as possible and prevent any retinal degeneration.\" \nWhether the treatment will last a lifetime isn't known, Rose said. But people who received the treatment in early trials more than 10 years ago continue to have their sight, he noted. \nDr. Jean Bennett, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, is one of the researchers who is actually giving the treatment. \nUsing a harmless virus to carry a new, working RPE65 gene, doctors perform microscopic surgery and, with a tube about the width of a human eyelash, implant the new gene into cells in the retina, she explained. \nFor maximum vision improvement, the procedure has to be done in each eye, Bennett said. \n\"We think this same procedure would be effective for other genes,\" she said. \"It would just require that the gene we used be swapped out and replaced with a different gene.\" \nDr. Zenia Aguilera, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, said that the FDA is taking a big step in gene therapy for these genetic eye diseases. \n\"If we can treat the disease early, we may prevent blindness in all these kids,\" Aguilera said. \nIt isn't known how much the treatment will cost or if it will be covered by insurance, Rose said. But the foundation believes that everyone who needs the treatment should get it. \n\"Our goal is that there will be treatments for individuals who need these treatments such that nobody will ever have to hear: 'You have retinal degeneration, get a guide dog, learn braille, get a cane,'\" Rose said.

Vanessa Davies/Getty Images \nOnly a third of women are taking a multivitamin containing folic acid -- a nutrient known to prevent serious birth defects -- before they know they're pregnant, a new survey has found. \nThe poll, conducted by the March of Dimes, also revealed significant racial disparities: Just 10 percent of black women and 27 percent of Hispanic women of childbearing age report taking multivitamins with folic acid before pregnancy. \n\"One of the things that's striking for us is how much more we need to make sure women understand the importance of being healthy before pregnancy ,\" said Stacey Stewart, president of the March of Dimes Foundation. \n\"Half of all pregnancies are unexpected, which means women of childbearing age need to be doing all they can to be healthy in the event they do get pregnant,\" she said. \nIn the United States, more than 120,000 babies -- about 3 percent of all births -- will be born with birth defects this year, including about 3,000 babies born with neural tube defects, according to March of Dimes estimates. \nUp to 70 percent of the neural tube defects, which affect the brain and spine, could be prevented if all women of childbearing age took daily multivitamins containing folic acid, the group said. \nRELATED: Should You Take IBD Medication During Pregnancy? \nThe survey on prenatal health measures, conducted online in August 2017 by The Harris Poll on behalf of the March of Dimes, polled a nationally representative sample of more than 1,000 U.S. women, 18 to 45 years of age. It also found that: 77 percent of women are concerned there may be changes to the U.S. health care system that may hamper access to prenatal care, 43 percent of women say that cost affects when and whether they seek prenatal care, nearly two-thirds of women identify folic acid as an important nutrient in birth defect prevention, and only 40 percent identify iron, calcium and vitamin D as other vitamins important for this purpose, 97 percent of women report taking prenatal vitamins or multivitamins during a pregnancy, 13 percent of women do not know that avoiding smoking or tobacco products reduces the risk for birth defects, and 12 percent are unaware that eliminating drinking and illegal drugs would do the same. \nStewart said that the number of women concerned about possible changes to the U.S. health care system, as well as costs, points to a serious regard for their access to proper care for themselves and their pregnancies. \n\"At the March of Dimes, we work very hard to make sure that members of Congress, especially over the last several months, understand how important it is to take into account the health of women and mothers, and the impact health care changes would have on pregnancies and newborn babies,\" she said. \n\"We have to make sure the most vulnerable in our country are safe and protected, and that certainly has to be true for babies,\" Stewart added. \nDr. Michael Pirics, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas, said he wasn't surprised by the new survey findings, noting that many women don't seek preconception care \"either because they don't know that kind of thing is important or they're not getting regular gynecological checkups where it's addressed.\" He was not involved with the survey. \nPirics called the revelation of racial and ethnic disparities in multivitamin use among women of childbearing age \"one snapshot of a larger problem\" that he also found not surprising. All women in this age group should discuss taking folic acid-containing vitamins with their doctors well before conception, he said. \n\"But the idea of prevention is an overarching concern that should be more valued in our society,\" Pirics added. \"We should be encouraging women to continue getting regular health visits, both for their own health and the health of their potential pregnancies in the future.\" Last Updated:10/17/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

Bloomberg/Getty Images \nThe active ingredient in \"magic mushrooms\" may help patients with tough-to-treat depression, a new study suggests. \nTwenty patients received psilocybin -- the psychoactive compound in a group of mushrooms that cause hallucinations. Nineteen who completed the study showed improvement in their depression symptoms for up to five weeks after treatment, according to the researchers at Imperial College London. \nNone had responded to traditional depression treatment , they noted. \n\"We have shown for the first time clear changes in brain activity in depressed people treated with psilocybin after failing to respond to conventional treatments,\" said study leader Robin Carhart-Harris, head of psychedelic research at Imperial. \nHowever, his team emphasized that patients with depression should not try to self-medicate with magic mushrooms. While these results are promising, the study was small and did not include a comparison group of patients who did not receive psilocybin, they noted. \nStill, brain scans before and after treatment suggest psilocybin may reset the activity of brain circuits that play a role in depression. \n\"Several of our patients described feeling 'reset' after the treatment and often used computer analogies,\" Carhart-Harris reported in a college news release. One said he felt like his brain had been \"defragged\" like a computer hard drive, and another said he felt \"rebooted,\" the researcher added. \nRELATED: Depression May Hasten Death in Years After Heart Diagnosis \n\"Psilocybin may be giving these individuals the temporary 'kick-start' they need to break out of their depressive states, and these imaging results do tentatively support a 'reset' analogy. Similar brain effects to these have been seen with electroconvulsive therapy,\" Carhart-Harris said. \nLarger studies are needed to see if this positive effect can be reproduced in more patients, said study senior author David Nutt. \n\"But these initial findings are exciting and provide another treatment avenue to explore,\" said Nutt, director of neuropsychopharmacology in the division of brain sciences. \nHe added that a trial scheduled to start early in 2018 will test the psychedelic drug against a leading antidepressant . \nFor this latest study, patients received two different doses of psilocybin, one week apart. \nIn recent years, promising results have emerged from a number of clinical trials testing the safety and effectiveness of psychedelics in patients with conditions such as depression and addiction. \n\"Psilocybin can be a promising agent for depression,\" said Dr. Scott Krakower, assistant unit chief of psychiatry at Zucker Hillside Hospital, in Glen Oaks, N.Y. \"For decades, there has been suspected benefit of psychedelic agents for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders.\" \nHowever, he said, the clinical trials to date have been very small, and without a placebo arm for comparison. He agreed that replication in larger studies is warranted. \nThe study was published Oct. 13 in the journal Scientific Reports . Last Updated: Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay . All rights reserved.

Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in the last month of pregnancy. Jose Luis Pelaez/Getty Images \nBlack American women are twice as likely as women in other racial/ethnic groups to develop a form of pregnancy-related heart failure, a new study finds. \nPeripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can occur in the last month of pregnancy or up to five months following delivery. With this disorder the heart chambers enlarge and heart muscle weakens, leading to reduced blood flow that affects the lungs, liver and other organs. \nResearchers analyzed the medical records of 220 women diagnosed with PPCM. Black women with PPCM were younger (age 27 vs. 31), had more severe disease, and took longer to recover than white, Hispanic or Asian women. \nRELATED: How Long Can You Live With Congestive Heart Failure? \n\"Not only are African-American women at twice the risk, but in this study we found they also took twice as long to recover, they were twice as likely to worsen before getting better after diagnosis, and they were twice as likely to fail to recover altogether, meaning their heart failure persisted for months following delivery,\" said senior author Dr. Zoltan Arany in a University of Pennsylvania news release. He is an associate professor of cardiovascular medicine and director of the university's Cardiovascular Metabolism Program. \nThe study \"opens the door for even more research on this subject, to find out why these women are more at risk,\" study author Dr. Jennifer Lewey said. She's an assistant professor of cardiovascular medicine and director of the Penn Women's Cardiovascular Center. \nThe researchers don't know why these differences occur. Lewey suggested the increased risk might be due to genetics, socioeconomic status or access to care. Or it could be due to medical problems such as high blood pressure . \n\"Our next step will be to answer these questions, and identify how we can proactively diagnose and potentially prevent such a dangerous diagnosis in this at-risk patient population,\" Lewey said. \nThe study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association .

Bromances appeared to offer a safe space that was presumed to be free of the kind of ridicule, judgment or embarrassment they associated with romantic intimacy. Getty Images \nIn a decidedly male take on the BFF, new research shows that the emotional safety of a bromance might beat romance for some men. \nA series of in-depth interviews with a small group of young, straight men revealed that the guys felt more comfortable sharing feelings and resolving conflicts with their male best friend than with their lover. \n\"The key differences we found is that romances are the sexual partner, and the bromance is the emotional partner,\" said study author Adam White. \nThe men his team interviewed said they \"could be more emotionally open, without fear of being judged or policed, with their bromances, whereas they often were fearful of being their true selves with their romances through worry that sex may be withheld, they may end up arguing, or they may be judged negatively,\" he explained. \nThat could mean that romance is starting to lose some of its privileged status, White noted. \n\"In fact, some may consider the bromance a better option, as many of the emotional benefits are superior in a bromance,\" he said. \nWhite is currently a Ph.D. candidate and lecturer of sport and physical education at the University of Bedfordshire in Luton, England. \nThe research team pointed out that the notion of \"bromance\" appeared to gain cultural currency around 2005, as a way to describe the increasing intimacy of straight male-male relationships as depicted in movies and on television. \nRELATED: A Man's Health May Rely on Health of His Marriage \nTo explore the phenomenon's impact, the British investigators conducted interviews with 30 men over a three-month period in 2014. \nAll were enrolled in the second year of their undergraduate studies. Most were white and described themselves as middle-class. \nWhile all of the men voiced generally positive views of homosexuality, all were straight and had been involved in at least one romance with a girl, as well as at least one bromance with a guy. \nMost participants said that -- sex aside -- they saw very little difference between the two types of relationships . \nBut nearly all (28 of 30) said they preferred sharing personal concerns and secrets with their bromance, the study found. \nWhy? Bromances appeared to offer a safe space that was presumed to be free of the kind of ridicule, judgment or embarrassment they associated with romantic intimacy . \nWhat's more, nearly all the men (29 of 30) said they had cuddled with their bromance partner, without either sexual desire or shame. Most said their girlfriends were aware of -- and seemingly at ease about -- such physical contact. And some men indicated that they even kissed one another as a non-sexual sign of affection. \nNearly all the men also said that the arguments they got into with their girlfriends were far more intense, silly and enduring than bromantic conflicts. In the same vein, resolving differences seemed to be easier between men than between lovers, they said. \nAs to whether the rise of bromance inevitably comes at the expense of romance, White said the jury is still out. \n\"There is a real possibility that bromances and romances can co-exist harmoniously,\" he noted. \"Likewise, the bromance may well challenge the construct of monogamy, and either the bromance or romance partner may feel jealous and threatened by the other.\" \nWhite and his colleagues reported their findings in the Oct. 12 issue of Men and Masculinities . \nCassandra Alexopoulos, an assistant professor of communication with the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, said she viewed the advent of bromances as \"a benefit for society, especially during a time in which we want to promote inclusive masculinity and allow men to feel comfortable expressing themselves emotionally.\" \nStill, she cautioned that the \"no judgment\" nature of bromance may end up \"leading men to see their romantic partner as a burden,\" giving rise to an \"us versus them\" view of women. \n\"For many people,\" Alexopoulos explained, \"communicating in cross-sex relationships takes work, and requires a great deal of empathy and perspective-taking. It's important to remember that even though cross-sex communication can sometimes be more effortful, the social rewards that come with a cross-sex friendship or a romantic relationship are unique and emotionally fulfilling as well.\" Last Updated:10/17/2017 Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

Please select a newsletter Signs of low blood sugar include shakiness, confusion, and, in serious cases, loss of consciousness. Getty Images \nEvery so often, there\u2019s a news story about a person with type 2 diabetes who loses consciousness while driving because of very low blood sugar. Such terrifying accidents are usually caused by hypoglycemia unawareness , when blood sugar drops dangerously low without the person ever noticing. \nWhile driving with hypoglycemia may be the worst-case scenario, when you have diabetes , this can happen at work while sitting at your desk, while at the grocery store shopping among strangers, or even at home while going about your routine. The fact of the matter is hypoglycemia unawareness is scary no matter when it happens. \nMost people with diabetes feel symptoms of hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar , once their blood sugar drops below about 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), says Jill Silverman, MD , chief endocrinologist at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles, California. You might feel shaky, irritable, sweaty, or hungry, all due to \u201cfight or flight\u201d hormones, your body\u2019s way of telling you that you need more glucose \u2014 our cells\u2019 main source of energy \u2014 right away. \nIn people with hypoglycemia unawareness, that hormonal response doesn\u2019t happen, and your blood sugar levels continue to drop. This is very dangerous for the brain, which needs a constant supply of glucose to function properly. \u201cIf the blood sugar level gets below about 55 [mg/dL], then people start to get confused and can progress to where they can lose consciousness,\u201d says Dr. Silverman, referring to the American Diabetes Association\u2019s (ADA) guidelines on glycemic control, which appeared in an article published in January 2017 in the journal Diabetes Care . \nHypoglycemia unawareness is most common in people with type 1 diabetes , but these scary episodes can also happen in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes who are on insulin . The good news is that the better you understand this condition, the more you can take control to prevent it from happening. Here\u2019s what you need to know: 1. It\u2019s Caused by Repeated Episodes of Low Blood Sugar \n\u201cThe main reason hypoglycemia unawareness occurs is because a person has low blood sugar repeatedly, over and over again, and the body stops recognizing it as abnormal,\u201d Silverman says. \nHypoglycemia is usually caused by changes in diet, exercise, or medication . \u201cA lot of times this happens when a patient decides to get their diabetes under control,\u201d Silverman explains. They start eating better, exercising more, and taking all of their medication. \u201cMaybe they weren\u2019t doing it perfectly before, and now they start doing all the right things, but they find out that the medication is actually too much.\u201d \nAdvanced type 2 diabetes can also cause deteriorating pancreas and kidney function , increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. The longer a person has been on insulin and the more injections required, the greater the risk, says Kathleen Dungan, MD, MPH , an endocrinologist at The Ohio State University\u2019s Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. \u201cAny frequent hypoglycemia or repeat hypoglycemia can set the patient up for hypoglycemia unawareness,\u201d she says. 2. It Happens More Than You May Realize, Including Overnight \nA study published in the journal Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice estimated that nearly 10 percent of people with type 2 diabetes taking insulin experience hypoglycemia unawareness. Another study published in September 2017 in the journal Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice found that people with diabetes who had been using continuous glucose monitors experienced many episodes of severe hypoglycemia that they didn\u2019t notice on their own, and more than half of these happened during the night. \nHypoglycemia is common overnight because you\u2019re going eight hours or more without eating anything, Silverman says. \u201cPeople may be having low blood sugars overnight without realizing it. They get up in the morning and maybe they\u2019re feeling a little bit low, but then they eat, and the rest of the day they\u2019re okay.\u201d Those episodes may seem minor, but they can contribute to the risk of hypoglycemia unawareness and worsen over time if untreated. 3. It Has a Treatment Many People May Find Surprising \nYou can work with your medical team to correct hypoglycemia unawareness. Interestingly, the solution is often to let your blood sugar run a little bit high \u2014 never low \u2014 for a few weeks, which might mean making temporary adjustments to your medication. \u201cThe best way to recover hypoglycemia awareness is to completely avoid hypoglycemia,\u201d Dr. Dungan says. \nThe ADA also recommends this approach in their aforementioned guidelines . Raising blood sugar targets for several weeks can \u201cpartially reverse hypoglycemia unawareness and reduce the risk of future episodes,\u201d the guidelines state. For all intents and purposes, you\u2019re reteaching your body how to recognize low blood glucose. \nDungan emphasizes that this is a \u201cloosening of glucose targets rather than completely abandoning them,\u201d and it\u2019s only temporary. Your doctor can help you adjust your medication and plan for checking your blood sugar to be sure you\u2019re avoiding hypoglycemia without going too high. Once hypoglycemia awareness is restored, you\u2019ll return to tighter glycemic control. 4. You Can Take Steps to Prevent It From Happening Again \nOnce you\u2019ve regained hypoglycemia awareness, your doctor can help identify changes to prevent a repeat experience. This could mean looking at meal and exercise timing or adjusting your insulin or other medication. Dungan says that some newer drugs \u2014 including GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP-4 inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors \u2014 are less likely to cause hypoglycemia, so if you\u2019ve been on the same medication for years, your doctor might consider switching things up. \u201cSome patients \u2014 not all \u2014 but some patients may be able to simplify their regimens and reduce the number of injections by folding in some of these newer therapies,\u201d she says. \nFor patients who continue to struggle with hypoglycemia, a continuous glucose monitor might be worth considering. It can alert you when your glucose is dropping so that you know to respond appropriately. 5. If You Experience Hypoglycemia, Don\u2019t Wait to Talk to Your Doctor \nEven if you\u2019ve only had mild hypoglycemia (blood sugar below about 70 mg/dL) with normal symptoms, like shakiness and hunger, now is the time to troubleshoot the issue, so that you can avoid the repeat episodes that cause hypoglycemia unawareness. \nTesting your blood glucose more often can provide important information and peace of mind. For safety\u2019s sake, always test before you drive , but also test before and after meals, exercise, and sleep, and bring that information to your doctor. \u201cIf you\u2019re not testing your blood sugar at home, it\u2019s very difficult for the doctor to figure out why you\u2019re having the low sugars,\u201d says Silverman. \nTesting your sugars more often may be tedious, but it gives you vital information about how you\u2019re responding to medication, meals, and different activities, so you can address hypoglycemia before it becomes more serious.

Stocksy \nYou're probably already aware that picking whole foods over processed ones can help reduce your risk for developing diabetes, but did you know that the types of oils, nuts, and seeds you include in your diet may also play a role? \nA study published in October 2017 in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology found that diets rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids \u2014 like those in corn oils, walnuts, and flaxseed \u2014 could reduce the risk of developing the disease. More specifically, high levels of linoleic acid, which is the most predominant of the omega-6s, reduced the risk of diabetes by 43 percent. How Researchers Drew Their Findings on Omega-6 Fats \nThe research team from the George Institute for Global Health in Newtown, Australia, looked at the relationship between type 2 diabetes and the level of omega-6 fatty acids. They gathered data from 20 studies that had been completed between 1970 and 2010, which included nearly 40,000 people across 10 mostly European countries. \nThose who were included in the study did not have diabetes when the studies began, so the study didn\u2019t focus on people who were already diagnosed. Rather, \u201cwe followed participants in our study who did not have diabetes at baseline, measured how much omega-6 fats were in their blood, then followed them up and ascertained who developed diabetes,\u201d says study author Jason Wu, PhD , a senior research fellow in the food policy division of the George Institute for Global Health. Of the 40,000 people analyzed, about 4,300 new cases of diabetes occurred over the study period. \nThe researchers observed that those who had the highest levels of blood linoleic acid were much less likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those with low levels. Dietary intake of linoleic acid correlates well with tissue levels. \u201cThese findings suggest the long-term benefits of linoleic acid for preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes,\u201d Wu says. \u201cThe research also supports the recommendation to increase dietary intake of linoleic-acid-rich vegetable oils.\u201d The researchers furthermore looked at a metabolite of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, which is more tightly regulated by the body and not as greatly affected by dietary intake. This fatty acid was found to be neutral in the development of type 2 diabetes. What Are the Health Benefits of Omega-6 Fatty Acids? \nDespite these promising findings, omega-6s historically don\u2019t have a stellar reputation . They\u2019ve been said to contribute to inflammation , and one study published in March 2014 in the journal Food & Function concluded that this inflammation means polyunsaturated fatty acids could increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which is a particular concern for people with diabetes, who are at a greater risk for the ailment compared with the general population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . \nBut take the 2014 study with a grain of salt because plenty of opposing research exists. Wu cites a study published in July 2012 in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics that shuts down the argument that omega-6s increase inflammation. \u201cWe do know for sure they\u2019re not inflammatory as we once thought,\u201d says April Saunders, RD, CDE, with April Saunders Nutrition in Ontario, Canada. The American Heart Association (AHA) agrees and recommends replacing unhealthy fats, such as trans fats and saturated fats found in things like butter, cheese, and fatty meat , with polyunsaturated fatty acids, noting that they can help reduce the presence of LDL ( \u201cbad\u201d) cholesterol , thereby lowering your risk of heart disease and stroke. \nResearch has also shown how omega-6s are particularly helpful for people with diabetes. According to a study published in July 2016 in PLoS Med , polyunsaturated fatty acids may help improve glucose levels and insulin resistance compared with other macronutrients, such as carbs , monounsaturated fat, and saturated fat. Another study, published in April 2012 in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , found that eating a diet rich in omega-6s helped reduce liver fat and improve fasting insulin, and may act as an anti-inflammatory compared with a diet high in saturated fatty acids. Diabetes-Friendly Foods Rich in Omega-6 Fatty Acids \nYour body can\u2019t produce omega-6 fatty acids on its own, so it\u2019s up to you to incorporate them into your diet. The AHA recommends sourcing 5 to 10 percent of your daily calories from omega-6 fatty acids, which you\u2019ll find in high amounts in vegetable oils (primarily soybean, sunflower, and corn oils), seeds (sesame and pumpkin seeds, as well as flaxseed), and nuts (walnuts and pine nuts), according to the AHA and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2015\u20132020 . \nSaunders recommends that people with diabetes aim to eat \u00bc cup of nuts or seeds each day. \u201cBut don\u2019t go crazy,\u201d she warns. \u201cOne cup of nuts has about 1,000 calories, so too much of a good thing is easily possible.\u201d \nEven if it\u2019s a healthy fat, it\u2019s still fat. And fat has 9 calories per gram, which is more than twice as much as carbs or protein, Saunders says. \u201cDon\u2019t fall into the trap of more is better when it comes to fat \u2014 even for healthy fat,\u201d she says.

Shutterstock \nExercise can affect your blood glucose levels, so you have to show up to the gym prepared. But don\u2019t let that deter you; working out is an important part of diabetes management. \nThe American Diabetes Association recommends getting 30 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise five days a week, as well as some type of strength training, such as lifting weights or performing body-weight moves, twice a week. According to a study published in December 2016 in the journal Diabetologia , 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes by 26 percent. The researchers found that the more people moved, the lower their risk for diabetes . \nBut before you jump into your workout, you\u2019ll want to take a few precautions. First, if you\u2019re new to exercise or haven\u2019t exercised in a while, you may want to visit your doctor to get the okay, suggests Brittany Poulson, RDN, CDE, founder of Your Choice Nutrition in Granstville, Utah. \nIt\u2019s also a good idea to keep a medical ID with you when you head to the gym and introduce yourself to the people at the front desk. Let them know you have diabetes and give them the phone number of your emergency contact, just in case. \nBeyond that, here are five things to store in your gym bag so every sweat session is a safe one: 1. Blood Glucose Meter to Ensure Levels Stay in a Safe Range \nIt\u2019s important to check your blood sugar before and after exercise, so always keep a blood glucose meter in your bag, says Donna Webb, RD, CDE , with Fit4D, who is based in Springfield, Missouri. These devices can help you easily track your blood sugar and assist your medical team in prescribing diabetes medication . \nAccording to the American Council on Exercise , you want your blood glucose to be greater than 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) and at or less than 250 mg/dL if ketosis is present, or 300 mg/dL without ketosis . (Ketosis occurs when the body doesn't have sufficient glucose to burn so instead burns fat, thereby producing acids called ketones that reach high levels in the body. Ketosis is a natural metabolic process.) \n\u201cEnsuring your glucose levels are in a good range before exercising can help prevent a low from happening during your workout,\u201d Poulson says. 2. Glucose Tablets to Help Correct and Stabilize Low Blood Sugar \nYou should always be prepared for low blood sugar , or hypoglycemia , so be sure to stash glucose tablets in your bag, especially if you\u2019re just starting an exercise program, Webb says. \nThis is generally a bigger concern for people with type 1 diabetes, but it\u2019s important to be ready for low blood sugar if you have type 2 diabetes and are on insulin or other medication, according to the American Diabetes Association . 3. Snacks to Balance Blood Sugar Levels and Stay Energized \nIn addition to glucose tablets, toss in a few diabetes-friendly exercise snacks that\u2019ll help you counter low blood sugar before or during your workout. If your levels are below 100 mg/dL before you warm up, Poulson recommends eating something with about 15 grams (g) of carbohydrates, such as half of a peanut butter sandwich (major bonus: no refrigeration needed!). \nSnacks with fast-acting carbs , like a small packet of raisins or rice cakes, are good choices if you\u2019re experiencing low blood sugar during your workout, Poulson says. 4. Water or a Sports Drink to Help You Stay Hydrated \nEveryone needs to stay hydrated as they exercise, but people with diabetes need to pay extra attention to this step because dehydration can cause high blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia , Poulson says. \nWater is your best bet during a low-intensity workout, since sports drinks are oftentimes loaded with sugar \u2014 there are more than 20 g in a 12-ounce (oz) serving of Gatorade ! Sports drinks also tend to be high in sodium and potassium, which could mess with any blood pressure or cardiac medication you may be on, Webb says. \nDon\u2019t rule out sports drinks entirely, though. Just save them for long workouts of over one hour. In those cases, Poulson recommends drinking 4 to 8 oz of sports drinks every 15 to 20 minutes to help replenish electrolytes and provide carbohydrates that keep blood glucose levels from dropping too low. 5. Appropriate Footwear to Protect Feet, Especially if You Have Neuropathy \nDiabetes can increase your risk of foot problems due to neuropathy , or nerve damage, so it\u2019s important to pay attention to your gym shoes . If you don\u2019t have any issues with your feet and have good blood glucose control, choose a pair that isn\u2019t too loose or too tight and you should be good to go, Poulson says. \nBut if you have foot problems or are at risk of developing them, visit your podiatrist for orthotic inserts and buy a pair of shoes that\u2019s wide and deep enough to fit them, Poulson says. She also recommends looking for shoes with breathable materials on top and protective cushioning so you won\u2019t end up with blisters or cuts.

Getty Images \nWaiters, contractors and other employees of America's small businesses are more likely to miss out on cancer screening, mostly because of a lack of insurance, new research shows. \n\"Workers employed at smaller organizations had substantially lower breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening rates\" compared to people working at larger corporations or organizations, American Cancer Society (ACS) researchers reported. \nAnd poorer insurance coverage accounted for much of these differences, said the team led by ACS researcher Stacey Fedewa. \nOne breast cancer specialist who reviewed the findings said the issue is an important one, because mammograms , colonoscopies and other screens can save lives -- not to mention health care dollars. \nSo it's crucial to \"find ways to ensure that workers in smaller companies have access to health care,\" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \"This is a complicated problem, as some smaller businesses cannot afford to provide insurance to their workers due to the rising cost of premiums.\" \nRELATED: Too Many Americans Still Go Without Cancer Screenings \nIn the new report, the ACS team tracked 2010, 2013 and 2015 federal government data. The investigators found that, overall, screening rates for U.S. workers were 84 percent for cervical cancer , about 69 percent for breast cancer and 57 percent for colon cancer. \nBut those numbers fell precipitously for employees at companies with fewer than 25 workers -- they were much less likely be screened than those at companies with 500 or more workers. \nFedewa's team also found that people in food service, construction, production and sales occupations were less likely to be up to date with cervical screening (26 percent less likely), breast screening (28 percent) and colon cancer screening (30 percent) than people working in the health care industry, for example. \nThe differences in cancer screening rates among workers were mostly due to lower income and lack of insurance, the study authors said. \nDr. Cynara Coomer directs the Comprehensive Breast Center at Staten Island University Hospital, in New York City. Reading over the findings, she agreed that a number of factors -- lack of insurance, transportation issues, education -- keep many Americans from cancer screening. \n\"As health care professionals, we need to strive to educate all communities about the importance of screening for certain cancers,\" she said. \"In addition, we need to find a solution to provide people of all socioeconomic levels access to medical care.\" \nThe findings were published Oct. 13 in the journal Preventive Medicine .

Please select a newsletter While reconstruction procedures increased in all insurance groups, the jump was highest for Medicare patients. Getty Images \nOver five years, the proportion of U.S. breast cancer patients opting for breast reconstruction after mastectomy grew by about two-thirds, a new government report shows. \nAn analysis of patient data shows breast reconstruction followed 40 percent of breast-removal surgeries in 2014 -- up from less than one-quarter in 2009, according to the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). \nAmong age groups, women aged 65 and older accounted for the largest increase in breast reconstructive surgery -- 140 percent. \n\"This type of information is essential for policymakers and health systems seeking to keep pace with important trends in clinical care,\" Gopal Khanna, agency director, said in an AHRQ news release. \nThe overall increase during the study period was 65 percent, researchers said. \nWhile reconstruction procedures increased in all insurance groups, the jump was highest for Medicare patients. Even so, the Medicare reconstruction rate was lowest -- 19 reconstructions per 100 mastectomies -- compared to other insurance plans. \nA dramatic rise in reconstruction surgeries also occurred among women without insurance, the data from 22 states revealed. \nRELATED: Many With Breast Cancer Unnecessarily Choose Double Mastectomy: Study \n\"This information suggests that many uninsured women were willing to pay for reconstruction surgery out of pocket,\" said Anne Elixhauser, a senior scientist at the agency. \nMedical, sexual and physical concerns come into play when deciding for or against breast reconstruction, according to the report. \n\"Medical considerations include concerns that breast reconstruction surgery lengthens recovery time and increases the chance for infection and other postoperative complications,\" the authors say. \n\"Sexual considerations involve the impact of the mastectomy on future sexual encounters. Physical features include how breasts may define femininity and sense of self,\" they noted. \nOther notable findings: Most of the growth in reconstructive procedures occurred in hospital-based outpatient surgical centers (150 percent increase). The rate for inpatient reconstructions remained unchanged. In 2014, reconstruction surgery was less common among women in rural areas than among those in cities. Black women were more likely to undergo breast reconstruction surgery in an inpatient setting and along with mastectomy than white and Hispanic women.

Please select a newsletter Many patients seek out medical marijuana for symptom relief. Cameron Zegers/Stocksy \nResearchers know little about how marijuana helps cancer patients, but as many as one-quarter of patients in a recent study said that they used it to relieve physical and psychological symptoms related to their illness, according to a study published in September 2017 in the journal Cance r . \nA survey of 926 patients led by Steven A. Pergam, MD, MPH , an associate professor in the department of medicine at the University of Washington in Seattle, found that 24 percent of the patients had used marijuana in the past year, and 21 percent reported they had used it in the past month. \nPatients also complained that they didn\u2019t know where to go for good information on the possible benefits of marijuana. \u201cThey wanted to get it from physicians, but they were getting it from other places \u2014 because we didn\u2019t have it,\u201d Dr. Pergam said. \nThe study was done at the University of Washington, in a state where marijuana is legal for medical and recreational use, meaning it was easy for patients to get the drug. Patients Report Benefits From Marijuana, Despite Lack of Data \nMany patients say that marijuana \u2014 or cannabis, its scientific name \u2014 can ease many of the side effects of chemotherapy, including loss of appetite, nausea, and pain. It can also, according to patient reports, help combat insomnia and lighten mood. But there is little data to back up those claims, Pergam says. \n\u201cPhysicians don\u2019t know what to tell people when we haven\u2019t much data,\u201d he says. Pergam began his research by looking at the scientific literature to see what had already been reported. \u201cI was surprised that there was so little data. There was not a lot of info on how they used, why they used, and how often they used. We didn\u2019t have any of that.\u201d \nAll the information, he said, seems to come from internet chat rooms and the lay press. Medical marijuana is available in 29 states, Pergam said, so many patients have access to it through their doctors. About half the patients who responded to Pergam\u2019s survey said that legalization increased the likelihood they would use it. Cancer Patients Who Use Marijuana Should Be Aware of Potential Risks \nPergam is an infectious disease specialist with a focus on the risks of infection in cancer patients. Many cancer patients are immunocompromised, meaning their immune systems are impaired either by their cancer or by their treatment. \nMarijuana could pose a special risk of infection for these already weakened patients, Pergam says. \u201cA lot of marijuana has a lot of mold on it.\u201d That could pose a danger of serious infection in weakened patients, he says, including fungal pneumonia. \nAnd there are other questions. \u201cWe\u2019re not always sure how the products are made or what herbicides are used in growing plants. For leukemia and bone-marrow transplants, I don\u2019t recommend it. We don\u2019t know enough about it. When a patient\u2019s white blood cell counts are low, I would actively discourage patients from using it.\u201d \nResearch on marijuana is often done with synthetic versions of the active ingredient, called THC. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d Pergam said. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t understand about the plant is whether it\u2019s the THC that\u2019s doing it, or some other thing in the plant.\u201d \nHe urges all patients to tell their doctors if they are using marijuana. And he also urges oncologists, when examining their patients, to ask.

Jozef Polc/500px.com \nChange your lifestyle, change your life span. \nThat's the claim of a new study that found not smoking, watching your weight and continuing to learn new things could help you live longer. \nAnd genes play a part in the lifestyle choices people make, according to researchers at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. \n\"The power of big data and genetics allow us to compare the effect of different behaviors and diseases in terms of months and years of life lost or gained, and to distinguish between mere association and causal effect,\" researcher Jim Wilson said in a university news release. But this study didn't prove that lifestyle choices cause life span to shorten or lengthen. \nFor the study, scientists analyzed genetic information from more than 600,000 people in North America, Europe and Australia to determine how genes affect life span. \nFor example, certain genes are associated with increased alcohol consumption and addiction , the study authors explained. \nRELATED: Sound the Mosquito Alarm, Across the USA \nSmoking and traits associated with lung cancer had the greatest effect on shortening life expectancy. The researchers determined that smoking a pack of cigarettes each day over a lifetime leads to an average loss of seven years of life. \nBut the good news was that smokers who quit the habit lived as long as people who never smoked, according to the report. \nThe investigators also found that body fat and other factors linked to diabetes reduce life expectancy. For every excess 2.2 pounds a person carries, life expectancy is cut by two months, the findings showed. \nPeople who are open to new experiences and who have higher levels of learning also tend to live longer, the researchers said. Every year spent studying beyond school added almost a year to a person's life span. \nWilson and colleagues also found that differences in a gene that affects blood cholesterol levels can reduce life span by around eight months, and differences in a gene linked to the immune system can add about half a year to life expectancy. \nThe study was published Oct. 13 in the journal Nature Communications .

Please select a newsletter Some parents may be using the ER for common situations that could be handled at home. Rafael Ben-Ari/Alamy \nMany American parents aren't sure when to rush their child to the emergency room, a new survey finds. \n\"When young children experience urgent medical situations, parents have to make decisions about whether to administer first aid at home, call for advice or seek emergency care,\" said Dr. Gary Freed, from the University of Michigan. He is co-director of the C.S. Mott Children's Hospital Poll on Children's Health. \n\"Our report suggests that some parents may be using the ER for common situations that could be handled at home,\" Freed said in a university news release. \"Determining what is in fact an 'emergency' can be a confusing and nerve-wracking experience for parents who want to make the right decision.\" \nResearchers questioned nearly 400 parents with at least one child aged 5 or younger. \nThey found only half would know what to do if their child was choking, 10 percent would take their child to the ER for a minor burn from a hot pan, and nearly one-third would take their child to the ER for swallowed pills. \nBut going to the ER may do more harm than good in certain situations. For example, a child who is choking requires immediate help instead of waiting for treatment at the ER, Freed explained. \nRELATED: All the Facts About Ulcerative Colitis in Children \nThe poll found that 8 percent of parents would go directly to the ER if their child were choking, while 29 percent said they would call 911. \nOthers faced with choking would use methods such as the Heimlich maneuver (69 percent) to try to dislodge the object or try to remove the object with their finger (54 percent). Nearly half said they would hit the child on the back, while one-quarter would turn the child upside down. \nIf their child swallowed medication not meant for them, more than half of parents said they would try to remove any pills from the child's mouth and one-quarter would make the child throw up. Six out of 10 said they would call Poison Control, while one-quarter would call their child's doctor. Twenty-six percent would call 911, and almost one-third would rush the child to the ER. \n\"Generally, calling Poison Control is an excellent first step to take if a parent suspects their child swallowed something harmful,\" Freed said. \n\"Poison Control staff are trained to get important information from parents about the type of medication their child might have swallowed and direct them on the next steps to take,\" he said. \nParents who rush to the ER might forget to bring the source of the possible poisoning, leaving ER providers with limited information to determine the child's treatment, he added. \nThe poll highlights the need for parents to get first aid training. \nThe 43 percent of parents with no first aid training were less confident in making decisions about urgent situations than those with training. Just 10 percent of parents had received first aid training within the past year; 24 percent were trained within the past five years, and 23 percent had training more than five years ago. \n\"In some cases, such as a small burn, parents would likely be able to consult a first aid resource to guide their response. Other situations, like choking, are clearly more time-sensitive and require immediate action. First aid training can help parents stay calm and manage the situation more effectively,\" Freed said.

Please select a newsletter Medicaid patients often lack access to dermatologists and may have trouble getting referrals for specialists. Evgeniy Kalinovskiy/Alamy \nSurgery is the main treatment for melanoma -- a dangerous form of skin cancer -- but a patient's insurance could affect whether or not that cancer is quickly removed, new research suggests. \nAfter reviewing thousands of melanoma cases, researchers at the University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center reported that patients with Medicaid were more likely to face delays in scheduling their surgery than those with private insurance. \nMedicaid is the federally funded health insurance program for poor and needy people. \n\"The primary treatment for most melanoma is surgical excision, which can be curative,\" said study author Dr. Ade Adamson, a clinical instructor in the UNC School of Medicine's department of dermatology. \n\"These delays in care are concerning, particularly if they disproportionately affect those who might be the most vulnerable, such as Medicaid patients,\" he said in a hospital news release. \nResearchers reviewed the records of almost 8,000 patients from North Carolina. All had been diagnosed with melanoma between 2004 and 2011. Patients had private health insurance, Medicaid or Medicare, the health insurance program for those 65 and older. Specifically, the study examined the amount of time between the patients' diagnoses and their surgery. \nRELATED: Start Skin Cancer Prevention Early, Health Experts Say \nThe study showed that the patients with Medicaid were 36 percent more likely than those with private insurance to experience surgical delays. Folks with Medicaid were also more likely to wait more than six weeks for their surgery after being told that they had melanoma. Delays were also more common among patients who were not white. \nThe patients least likely to wait for melanoma surgery were those with private insurance. Those who were diagnosed or operated on by a dermatologist were also less likely to face surgical delays, according to the findings. \nThe researchers noted that Medicaid patients often lack access to dermatologists and may have trouble getting referrals for specialists, which could increase their risk for delays. \n\"We have identified insurance type as a factor associated with timeliness of care delivered to patients with melanoma,\" said Dr. Nancy Thomas, chair of the School of Medicine's department of dermatology. \nThe authors said more research is needed to determine what is causing the delays in melanoma surgery. \n\"Once we figure this out we can think about ways to construct an intervention to make sure patients with this potentially deadly cancer get the timely, appropriate care they deserve,\" Adamson said. \nThe study was published in JAMA Dermatology .

Please select a newsletter In the aftermath of disaster, preserving your emotional reserves helps prevent RA flares. Carol Allegri/Getty Images \nHurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, storms. If you\u2019ve been affected by any of these, you don\u2019t need anyone to tell you how stressful these events are. Even just worrying that a raging wildfire might come your way, or preparing for a hurricane that doesn\u2019t end up giving you a direct hit, puts intense stresses on the body. And the effects can linger for some weeks or months after. Long After They Occur, Traumatic Events Can Worsen RA Symptoms \n\u201cA destabilizing natural disaster throws everyone off their healthy routines, causing imbalances in health, like sleep deprivation and mood change,\u201d says Ashwin Mehta, MD , medical director of integrative medicine at Memorial Healthcare System in Pembroke Pines, Florida. \nAccording to the American Psychological Association , strong emotional reactions are common even after a disaster subsides. These can include feeling anxious or overwhelmed, having trouble concentrating, and having strained relationships with friends or coworkers. Stress Triggers Inflammation, and Inflammation Can Worsen Symptoms \nFor someone with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) , the effects can be especially challenging. \n\u201cPeople with autoimmune conditions have the added response of increased levels of inflammatory mediators that can worsen symptoms,\u201d Dr. Mehta says. \nThat\u2019s because our body responds to stress in predictable ways, including boosting cortisol and other hormones that can trigger inflammation. People with RA often observe that flares worsen during challenging times. 5 Self-Preservation Steps You Can Take to Help Tame Inflammation After Trauma \nThat doesn\u2019t mean a worsening of RA symptoms is inevitable in the aftermath of a disaster. But it does mean you need to take steps to enhance your emotional reserves. \n\u201cIt is incumbent on us to promote healthy habits, such as good sleep hygiene, regular exercise, and sound nutritional choices, to bounce back after a stressful event,\u201d Dr Mehta says. \nHere are five ways to do it: \n1. Limit your intake of sweets and traditional \u201ccomfort foods.\u201d Those creamy, salty, or sweet foods we loved as children can make us momentarily feel better when life feels upside down. But these are exactly the foods that throw a body out of whack, and may trigger a flare. To get the same satiating mouth feel in a healthier way, Mehta recommends foods with almonds, pistachio nuts, avocados, or berries. It\u2019s also important to drink enough water so that your body remains hydrated. \n2. Get your body back to a regular schedule. Daily routines, such as the times you eat meals or go to bed, can be thrown off by a disaster. But re-establishing the rhythm of your regular life is key to feeling normal, the APA says. They also recommend adding new, positive routines to your day, such as taking a walk in a nearby park or reading a good book before bed. It\u2019s also critical that you get enough sleep. It is in the deeper stages of sleep that the body deals with the oxidative damage that stress can cause our cells, Mehta says. \n3. Stretch and move your body \u2014 even a little bit . Exercise is a surefire way to reduce your stress levels and boost your mood. It\u2019s not surprising, though, that during times of stress we often ditch our exercise routines, according to a study published in January 2014 in the journal Sports Medicine . Don\u2019t beat yourself up if you can\u2019t do the CDC-recommended 2 \u00bd hours of moderate-intensity exercise a week. Just do whatever you can, such as taking an occasional brisk walk in your neighborhood. \n4. Put pen to paper and journal your feelings. Writing about a difficult event you've experienced, known in psychology as \u201cfocused expressive writing,\u201d has been shown to lift moods, according to a research article published in the Journal of Clinical Psychology . You can write about what happened or how you feel about it. Don\u2019t worry about grammar or punctuation; the idea is to bring what you\u2019re bottling inside of you out in the light. \n5. Avoid additional stressors and making big changes. Whether it\u2019s switching jobs, having surgery, or even housing friends who\u2019ve been affected by the disaster, adding to your tension level will bring additional flares and problems. That\u2019s why the APA advises waiting until everything is back to normal before you make major life decisions. You\u2019ve got enough stressors with your health and the recovery efforts that might be going on in your community. Appreciate all that you\u2019re doing to combat that stress, while trying not to take on any more.

Hispanic children in immigrant families may have a higher level of resiliency due to strong community networks and a strong sense of cultural identity. Thomas Barwick/Getty Images \nHispanic children from U.S. native families are more likely to face difficult experiences such as parental divorce and exposure to violence than those in immigrant Hispanic families, a new study finds. \nHowever, the analysis of data from more than 12,000 Hispanic children across the United States found that kids from immigrant families were more likely to experience poverty . \nRates of what the researchers called adverse childhood experiences were 56 percent among U.S.-born Hispanic children and 47 percent among those in immigrant families. \nRELATED: Sound the Mosquito Alarm, Across the USA \nAmong Hispanic children in immigrant families, 12 percent experienced parental divorce and 32 percent experienced poverty, while among kids born in the United States, 25.5 percent experienced divorce and nearly 30 percent experienced poverty. \nHispanic children in immigrant families may have a higher level of resiliency due to strong community networks and a strong sense of cultural identity, said senior author Dr. Lisa DeCamp, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. \n\"These findings suggest family and community factors at play that help children in immigrant families buffer the effects of adverse childhood experiences , and that whatever these resiliency factors are, we should work towards protecting and extending them to subsequent nonimmigrant generations,\" DeCamp said in a school news release. \nThe study was published in the October issue of the journal Pediatrics .

Isaac Lane Koval/Getty Images \nDifferences in insurance are a major reason why black women are more likely to die of breast cancer than white women in the United States, a new study contends. \n\"We found that differences in insurance explained one-third of the total excess risk of death in non-elderly black women compared to white women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer , while differences in tumor characteristics explained approximately one-fifth of the excess risk,\" lead study author Ahmedin Jemal, of the American Cancer Society (ACS), and colleagues wrote. \nIn 2014, breast cancer death rates were 41 percent higher among black women than among white women in the United States, the researchers said. \nTo learn more about this disparity, the investigators looked at information on more than 550,000 non-elderly women with early stage breast cancer. \nRELATED: Breast Cancer Screenings Still Best for Early Detection \nBlack women were more likely to be uninsured or have Medicaid coverage than white women (23 percent versus 8 percent), the findings showed. In addition, black women were more likely to have tumors that were larger, more advanced and hormone receptor-negative. \nIf a tumor is hormone receptor-positive, that means its growth is fueled by certain hormones, according to the ACS. There are medications that can lower hormone levels that help keep these cancers at bay. Compared with hormone receptor-positive cancers, hormone receptor-negative cancers tend to grow faster and have fewer treatment options. \nAmong women with hormone receptor-positive tumors, black women were twice as likely to die as white women. Insurance accounted for 37 percent of that increased risk among black women, followed by tumor characteristics (23 percent), other health conditions (11 percent), and treatment (5 percent), the researchers said. \nAmong women with hormone receptor-negative tumors, black women had a 50 percent higher risk of death than white women did.

Thinkstock \nWhen Dorine Harris, now 40, was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2012, she went through a range of emotions, including depression and anger. \n\u201cI stayed at home a lot because I felt very restricted with foods to eat and drink,\u201d says Harris, a client service manager in North Brunswick, New Jersey. \u201cI did not want to answer the infamous question: \u2018Can you have that?\u2019\u201d She felt alienated and frustrated that other people with seemingly unhealthier habits or higher body weights had so far been spared from a diabetes diagnosis. Why It\u2019s Common to Feel Jealous or Envious After a Diabetes Diagnosis \nAmong people with diabetes, Harris isn\u2019t alone in having these feelings of envy and jealousy. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a very common response, and natural,\u201d says Ninoska Peterson, PhD , a psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who did not treat Harris. \u201cThere may be a sense of \u2018why me,\u2019 especially for someone who doesn\u2019t seem to have particular risk factors,\u201d like obesity, a family history of diabetes , or a history of gestational diabetes , she explains. \nIf you have been diagnosed with diabetes, all the lifelong changes \u2014 from dietary restrictions and maintaining an exercise regimen to checking blood sugar and taking medications \u2014 may feel daunting, Dr. Peterson says. These sentiments combined can lead to feelings of jealousy and envy toward others. Considering Mental Health When Managing Diabetes \nBut overcoming negative feelings is crucial for several reasons, not the least of being that doing so will reduce the risk for depression, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes is a common comorbidity with diabetes. By some estimates, having diabetes may increase your risk for depression twofold, according to a review published in June 2014 in Current Diabetes Reports . \n\u201cThe relationship between type 2 diabetes and depression is bidirectional and complex,\u201d Peterson explains. Biologically, that may be because depression and diabetes are both associated with higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can exacerbate depression symptoms and increase insulin resistance, which is the hallmark of diabetes, Peterson explains. Another common underlying thread may be poor self-care \u2014 like inactivity or unhealthy eating habits \u2014 that can contribute to both diseases, she says. \nOf course, emotional hurdles may manifest differently from person to person, says Michelle Riba, MD , a psychiatrist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Instead of feeling jealous and envious, you may feel anxious, worried, or scared \u2014 but the advice is the same: Preventing and treating mental health issues should be a priority in your diabetes management plan. Doing so can ultimately help you manage diabetes better and help you get back to a semblance of the life you knew prediagnosis. \nResearch supports the importance of tending to mental health when you have a chronic disease. According to a review of 22 studies, published in January 2012 in Psychosomatics , markers of emotional well-being such as a positive mood and resilience are linked with better diabetes self-management and overall health. And a later review, published in December 2014 in the World Journal of Diabetes , found that the psychological health of people with diabetes can play a crucial role in how they manage their disease. \nPeterson agrees, noting that people who tend to be successful in managing their physical and mental health are able to take control in a variety of ways, by figuring out what the diagnosis means for their life, making positive changes in diet and medication, and managing stress, she says. \u201cThey have or seek out positive support from family, friends, religious communities, and their healthcare providers,\u201d Peterson explains. \u201cMost important, they are ready and willing to make changes if necessary.\u201d Tips for Overcoming Jealousy and Envy With Diabetes \nGet your friends and family on board. Managing diabetes is a family affair, and in truth, a diabetes diet and lifestyle is a healthy lifestyle for everyone. If friends and family are on board with your new way of life, either by supporting you or adopting new, healthier habits themselves, they\u2019ll be less likely to, say, suggest a food or activity that isn\u2019t diabetes-friendly. Ultimately, this courtesy can help suppress any current or future feelings of jealousy or envy. \nAsk your doctor about mental health resources. Find out what resources are available to you, like support groups or community educational courses, Riba says. Peterson agrees, noting that you can start by asking your primary care physician for guidance, or call your insurance company to see what services are covered in your network. As the aforementioned research suggests, helping prevent or manage mental illness can put you in a better state of mind, helping you enjoy the things you once loved in moderation. \nRecognize that self-care comes in various forms. That includes diet, exercise, attending appointments regularly, checking your blood sugar regularly, and taking your medication, Peterson says. All those little steps are under your control and can make a significant difference in your health. \nReframe negative or unhelpful thoughts. You don't always have to dismiss your fears or look on the bright side, but focusing on what you can change and accepting what you can\u2019t may help instill in you a sense of control, Peterson says. For instance, you may worry that your diagnosis means one day you\u2019ll have to go on dialysis or will lose your eyesight. But if you understand how positive management of your physical and mental health can help reduce these complications, you will be motivated to make healthy changes, rather than obsess over potential negative consequences. \nPractice acceptance. \u201cOne of the things that we talk about with our patients is acceptance,\u201d says Peterson, noting that this milestone doesn\u2019t always happen immediately and doesn\u2019t mean that you have to like what\u2019s happening. However, with acceptance, you\u2019ll come to learn how you can manage the diagnosis day to day \u2014 and get on with your life. \nRealize no one is perfect. \u201cAll you can do is your best, and gather the resources that can help you succeed long term,\u201d Peterson says. \nFor Harris, meeting with a diabetes specialist \u2014 in her case, an endocrinologist \u2014 who understood her needs marked a turning point in her health. She hoped to minimize her number of prescription medications, so he helped her figure out how to eat the right foods to achieve that goal. Having a plan helped her feel purposeful and motivated, thereby minimizing her feelings of frustration and helplessness. \n\u201cOnce I found foods to eat and exercises to do that I enjoy, managing diabetes became easier and my attitude changed,\u201d Harris explains. While it took some time for her to accept her diagnosis, she now has a more positive outlook on her diabetes management. Instead of feeling envious of others who don't have diabetes, she points out there's nothing wrong with her \u2014 joking with friends that she's simply \"too sweet.\u201d Last Updated: Emotions Living With Recommended For You This site complies with the HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here . \u00d7 Advertising Notice \nThis Site and third parties who place advertisements on this Site may collect and use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Some risks of misusing ADHD medications are altered heart rate and blood pressure, insomnia, heightened anxiety, and even hallucinations. Chris Gallagher/Getty Images; Getty Images \nMany college students who abuse ADHD drugs mistakenly believe that doing so will lead to better grades, a new survey suggests. \nPast research has found that college students commonly misuse stimulant medications such as Ritalin and Adderall as \"study aids.\" That's despite the fact that there is no evidence the drugs help kids who do not have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ). \nThe new study said that roughly 29 percent of students at nine U.S. colleges thought that stimulant medications boost school performance. Many others -- 38 percent -- were \"unsure.\" \nAnd that misperception was especially common among students who admitted to abusing the drugs. \nJust over 11 percent said they'd used stimulant medication for \"non-medical\" reasons in the past six months. And of that group, almost two-thirds believed the drugs would improve their grades. \nThe findings came as no surprise to Dr. Jess Shatkin, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City. \nBut they do highlight an ongoing issue, according to Shatkin, who wasn't involved in the study. \n\"When kids do not actually have ADHD, these drugs are not helpful for their school performance,\" Shatkin said. \nMore concerning, he said, are the risks of misusing the medications -- such as altered heart rate and blood pressure, insomnia, heightened anxiety, and even hallucinations. \nRELATED: ADHD Meds May Pose Heart Risks for Some Kids \n\"So no, we do not want students abusing these drugs,\" Shatkin said. \nHow do you stop them? It's possible, according to Shatkin, that if more college kids are aware of the reality -- that their grades will not see a Ritalin-fueled rise -- then fewer will try the drugs. \nBut, he said, the medications are effective at one thing: Helping harried college students stay up later. \n\"So they'll at least finish that paper that's due tomorrow -- even if they won't get better grades,\" Shatkin said. \nIt all points to wider issues, according to Shatkin: Many college students need help with basics like time management, dealing with stress, and knowing how to generally take care of themselves. \nDr. Matthew Lorber is director of child and adolescent psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City. \nHe said stimulant abuse is a common problem not just among college students, but high school kids as well. \nWhen Lorber prescribes stimulants for children with ADHD, he encourages parents to \"hold on\" to the drugs themselves. That will limit the chances of their child sharing the drugs with their friends. \nHe also counsels teens on the risks of medication-sharing once they are on their own at college. \n\"We need to be discussing the dangers of these drugs for people who don't have ADHD,\" said Lorber, who wasn't part of the study team. \nThe findings are based on a survey of almost 7,300 college students. None had ever been diagnosed with ADHD. \nOverall, students who believed that stimulants improve school performance were 2.5 times more likely to abuse the drugs, versus their peers who were \"unsure.\" And students in that unsure group were about twice as likely to misuse stimulants as those who did not believe the medications helped with grades. \nLike Shatkin, Lorber said that trying to disabuse kids of that notion is unlikely to be enough. \n\"But,\" he said, \"it's information they should have -- along with information on the risks of misusing stimulants.\" \nHe encouraged parents to talk to their kids about those dangers, just as they would when it comes to alcohol or illegal drugs. \nShatkin recommended the discussions be even broader than that. \"What do you do when you're depressed? What do you do when you're stressed? We often don't have these conversations with kids,\" he said. \nShatkin also suggested that parents be mindful about how much pressure they put on their kids to succeed at school. \"We don't want them to catastrophize over every grade,\" he said. \nThe study was published earlier this year in the journal Addictive Behaviors .

Although an effective HPV vaccine exists for both boys and girls, the number of boys getting their shots remains low. Getty Images \nEleven million American men are infected with oral human papillomavirus (HPV), which can lead to cancers of the head, neck and throat, a new study reports. \nThat equates to 1 in 9 U.S. males aged 18 to 69. And infection is most likely for those who have had multiple oral sexual partners, are gay or bisexual, or who also have genital HPV infection, a team of U.S. researchers found. \nThe most common cancer caused by the sexually transmitted virus is oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, a head and neck cancer that's far more common in men than women, according to the study. \n\"The incidence of this cancer has increased 300 percent in the last 20 years,\" said lead researcher Ashish Deshmukh. He's a research assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions. \nDeshmukh and colleagues used 2011-2014 data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. \nThey found that nearly 12 percent of men and about 3 percent of women were infected with oral HPV. \nNearly 2 million men had high-risk HPV 16, a strain that causes most of the cancers, Deshmukh said. This type was six times more common in men than women. \nRELATED: Privacy Concerns Keep Some Young Americans From Sexual Health Services \nAlthough an effective HPV vaccine exists for both boys and girls, the number of boys getting their shots remains low. Also, many at-risk males are older than 26 and don't qualify for the vaccine -- or have already been exposed to the virus, the researchers noted. \nThe HPV vaccine is recommended before the start of sexual activity. All kids 11 or 12 should get two shots six to 12 months apart, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. \nIn 2014, about 57 percent of girls but only 35 percent of boys had been vaccinated, according to the CDC. \n\"We've got to vaccinate young boys, because vaccine has the potential to decrease cancer risk,\" Deshmukh said. \nEven if all young boys are vaccinated, however, it will be years before a significant decrease in head and neck cancers is seen, he said. \n\"In the short term, we need to find alternate prevention methods, for example, screening people and identifying precancerous lesions that can be treated,\" Deshmukh said. \nThe report was published online Oct. 16 in the Annals of Internal Medicine . \nAccording to 2013-2014 CDC research, more than 45 percent of men were infected with genital HPV, which is more common than the oral type. At the same time, about 40 percent of women carried genital HPV. \nGenital HPV can cause cancer of the anus, penis and vagina. Vaginal HPV causes about 70 percent of all cases of cervical cancer , the CDC says. \nOne specialist said a lot of unknowns surround oral HPV. \n\"The prevalence of oral HPV is much lower than genital HPV, and we don't understand that,\" said Patti Gravitt, a professor in the department of global health at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. \nIt's also not clear why men have more oral HPV than women, she said. Moreover, rates of oral HPV are higher in younger and older people, and that, too, is not understood, said Gravitt, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study. \nFortunately, we have a very effective vaccine,\" she said. \nUnfortunately, many doctors aren't recommending the vaccine, Gravitt said. \nHPV vaccine prevents cancer, and \"the data are remarkable,\" she said. \"Rarely in a vaccine have you seen such strong effectiveness. ... It's safe,\" Gravitt said. \"We should be doing a better job of protecting people from HPV.\" Last Updated: Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay . All rights reserved.

Shutterstock \nWeight-loss surgery could help some severely obese people reduce their risk for cancer by at least 33 percent, a new study suggests. \nThe researchers examined medical data compiled by health insurance and health care delivery systems in the western United States, including Southern California, Northern California, Oregon, Washington and Colorado. \nThe analysis included data on nearly 22,200 people who had weight-loss surgery between 2005 and 2012, and over 66,400 people who didn't have the surgery. More than 80 percent of the study participants were women. \nWithin 3.5 years after their surgery, about 2,500 people had developed cancer, the findings showed. \nThe study found that patients who'd had weight-loss surgery, compared with those who had not had the surgery, were one-third less likely to have developed cancer, particularly the types of cancer related to obesity . Obesity is associated with up to 40 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the United States, the study authors explained. \nHowever, the study found no significant association between cancer risk and weight-loss surgery among the men in the study. The researchers pointed out that at least two of the cancers found to be affected by weight-loss surgery only affect women -- breast cancer and endometrial cancer. \nRELATED: Weight-Loss Surgery Helps Treat Type 2 Diabetes \n\"We found having bariatric [weight-loss] surgery is associated with a reduced risk of cancer, especially obesity-associated cancers including postmenopausal breast cancer, endometrial cancer , pancreatic cancer and colon cancer,\" said lead researcher Dr. Daniel Schauer. He's an associate professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine's division of general internal medicine. \n\"What's surprising is how great the risk of cancer was reduced,\" he said in a university news release. But the study did not prove that weight-loss surgery caused the chances of certain cancers to drop. \nBut the reduced risk seen was significant. The risk for breast cancer among postmenopausal women dropped by 42 percent. Very obese women's risk for endometrial cancer fell by 50 percent, according to the report. \n\"Cancer risks for postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer are closely related to estrogen levels,\" Schauer said. \"Having weight-loss surgery reduces estrogen level.\" \nOther findings included a 41 percent reduced risk for colon cancer and a 54 percent reduced risk for pancreatic cancer for those who had weight-loss surgery. \nThe surgery helps prevent diabetes and lower insulin levels, which could lead to a lower risk for pancreatic cancer, according to the researchers. \n\"I think considering cancer risk is one small piece of the puzzle when considering bariatric surgery,\" Schauer said, \"but there are many factors to consider. Reductions in diabetes, hypertension and improvements in survival and quality of life are reason enough. The study provides an additional reason to consider bariatric surgery.\" Last Updated: Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay . All rights reserved.

Shutterstock (2) \nMen develop a dangerous type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation a decade earlier than women, a new study suggests. \nAnd while being overweight increased odds for the condition in both sexes, those extra pounds were more troublesome for males, the German researchers found. \n\"It's crucial to better understand modifiable risk factors of atrial fibrillation ,\" said study author Dr. Christina Magnussen. \n\"If prevention strategies succeed in targeting these risk factors , we expect a noticeable decline in new-onset atrial fibrillation,\" added Magnussen, a specialist in internal medicine and cardiology at the University Heart Center in Hamburg. \nA-fib means the upper chambers of the heart, or atria, quiver instead of beat. In the new 13-year study, the condition tripled the odds of dying prematurely. \nAccording to the American Heart Association statistics, as many as 6 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, with those numbers likely doubling by 2030. \nRELATED: 7 Risks for the Irregular Heartbeats of Atrial Fibrillation \nIn this study, researchers examined the medical records of nearly 80,000 people, aged 24 to 97, in Europe who initially did not have atrial fibrillation. Later assessments showed that more than 6 percent of men and over 4 percent of women had been diagnosed with a-fib. \nRisk of diagnosis accelerated sharply in men after 50 and in women after 60. By age 90, nearly one-quarter of men and women were told they had atrial fibrillation, the study found. \nThe researchers also found a link between atrial fibrillation and higher blood levels of an inflammation marker called C-reactive protein. \nIn addition, the association between atrial fibrillation and being overweight or obese was stronger in men (31 percent) than in women (18 percent), they reported. \nThe study was published Oct. 16 in the journal Circulation . \n\"We advise weight reduction for both men and women. As elevated body mass index seems to be more detrimental for men, weight control seems to be essential, particularly in overweight and obese men,\" Magnussen said in a journal news release.

Please select a newsletter The workout \u2014 called the abdominal hypopressive technique \u2014 is a breathing and \"posture-correcting\" approach. Howard Sayer/Alamy \nA commonly promoted exercise purported to help a woman control a leaky bladder probably isn't effective, experts say. \nThe workout -- called the abdominal hypopressive technique -- (AHT) is a breathing and \"posture-correcting\" approach widely known and used in North America, South America and Europe, said a team of European researchers. \nWith AHT, patients breathe in deeply through the diaphragm, contract the abdominal muscles after fully breathing out, and hold their breath before relaxing. \nBut the new review of available research on the technique yielded no proof that it helps urinary incontinence , researchers reported online Oct. 16 in the British Journal of Sports Medicine . \nEven though there's \"a worldwide huge interest\" in AHT among women, \"at present, there is no scientific evidence to recommend its use to patients,\" said Kari Bo, of the Norwegian School of Sport Science in Oslo, and Saul Martin-Rodriguez, from the College of Physical Education in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain. \nRELATED: UTIs and MS: How to Prevent This All-Too-Common Problem \n\"To date, AHT lacks scientific evidence to support its benefits,\" the two experts concluded. \"At this stage, AHT is based on a theory with 20 years of clinical practice.\" \nBo and Martin-Rodriguez noted that AHT is just one of several breathing and posture-correcting methods that claim to prevent or treat leaky bladder and womb prolapse. Others include Pilates and tai chi. \nDr. Elizabeth Kavaler is a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She reviewed the data, and believes there are methods that can help with conditions such as prolapse and urinary incontinence. \n\"Although AHT may not help with preventing prolapse and incontinence, pelvic floor muscle exercises and Kegels do,\" she said. \"There is a body of literature that supports the teaching of Kegels postpartum to women in an effort to prevent prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.\" \nKegel exercises consist of repeatedly contracting the pelvic floor muscles, as if holding back urinating, then relaxing them again. \nAs well, Kavaler said, \"diet, weight control, exercise and Kegel exercises are the best way to avoid needing surgery to treat these conditions.\" \nDr. Farzeen Firoozi directs female pelvic health at Northwell Health's Arthur Smith Institute for Urology in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He agreed that the evidence just isn't there to support the effectiveness of AHT, but a technique known as pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) may help. In PFMT, women work to strengthen certain pelvic muscles. \n\"PFMT remains the standard technique for approaching the treatment of pelvic floor disorders from a physical therapy standpoint,\" he said.

Please select a newsletter Researchers are hoping to incorporate mammography images and pathology slides into the machine learning model. Eric Van Den Brulle/Getty Images \nMachines armed with artificial intelligence may one day help doctors better identify high-risk breast lesions that might turn into cancer, new research suggests. \nHigh-risk breast lesions are abnormal cells found in a breast biopsy . These lesions pose a challenge to doctors and patients. The cells in such lesions aren't normal, but they're not cancerous either. And although they can develop into cancer , many don't. So, which ones need to be removed? \n\"The decision about whether or not to proceed to surgery is challenging, and the tendency is to aggressively treat these lesions [and remove them],\" said study author Dr. Manisha Bahl. \n\"We felt like there must be a better way to risk-stratify these lesions,\" added Bahl, director of the breast imaging fellowship program at Massachusetts General Hospital. \nWorking closely with computer scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, researchers developed a \"machine-learning\" model to distinguish high-risk lesions that need to be surgically removed from those that could just be watched over time. \nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence. The computer model automatically learns and improves based on previous experiences, the researchers explained. \nRELATED: Medicaid Cuts Tied to Delayed Breast Cancer Diagnosis \nThe researchers gave the machine a lot of information about established risk factors , such as the type of lesion and patient age. The researchers also fed it the actual text from the biopsy report. Overall, there were 20,000 data elements included in the model, the researchers said. \nThe test of the machine-learning model included information from slightly more than 1,000 women who had a high-risk lesion. About 96 percent of these women had their lesion surgically removed. Approximately 4 percent of women didn't have their lesions removed, but instead had two years of follow-up imaging tests. \nThe model was trained with two-thirds of the cases, and tested on the remaining third. \nThe test included 335 lesions. The machine correctly identified 37 of the 38 lesions (97 percent) that had developed into cancer, the study said. The model also would have helped women avoid one-third of surgeries on lesions that would have remained benign during the follow-up period. \nIn addition, Bahl said, \"the model picked up on text in the biopsy report -- the words severely and severely atypical conferred a higher risk of upgrade to cancer.\" \nBahl said the researchers are hoping to incorporate mammography images and pathology slides into the machine learning model, with the goal of eventually including this in clinical practice. \n\"Machine learning is a tool that we can use to improve patient care -- whether that means reducing unnecessary surgeries or being able to provide more information to patients so they can make more informed decisions,\" Bahl said. \nDr. Bonnie Litvack is medical director of the women's imaging center at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mt. Kisco, N.Y. \n\"Women should know that there is a new type of machine learning that's helped us identify high-risk lesions at low risk of cancer. And, we may soon have more information for them when they're faced with the decision of whether to have surgery to excise these high-risk lesions or not,\" said Litvak, who wasn't involved in the study. \n\"Artificial intelligence is an exciting field that will help us give women more data and help with shared decision-making,\" Litvack added. \nThe study was published Oct. 17 in Radiology .

Shutterstock \nDiets come and go, but the Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), which originated almost 100 years ago, remains very popular among many people with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although it's challenging to follow \u2014 SCD restricts most carbs \u2014 people with IBD say it can alleviate symptoms and even bring about remission. \nNow, the first ever large-scale controlled study on the diet is about to begin, raising hopes that doctors will start taking it more seriously. \n\u201cThe impetus for the study is that patients have been asking for it,\u201d says James Lewis, MD , associate director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia, and principal investigator on the study. \nThe Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute last year awarded the Crohn\u2019s & Colitis Foundation $2.5 million to assess whether the SCD or the Mediterranean diet can bring about remission in people with Crohn\u2019s. \nThe Foundation\u2019s own patient-powered research network, CCFA Partners , rallied for the study to take place. The network, a research partnership between the foundation and the University of North Carolina School of Medicine , sees patients and researchers collaborate over new research, with patients proposing research ideas. \nSo far, CCFA Partners has 15,419 patients signed up in the research network and more than 300 IBD researchers involved. \u201cThis was the No. 1 question they posed,\u201d says Dr. Lewis. \nOne-hundred ninety-four people with mild to moderate Crohn\u2019s will be enrolled at 30 sites countrywide, where they will follow either SCD or a Mediterranean diet for 12 weeks. For the first six weeks, participants will receive freshly prepared, additive-free meals and recipes from Healthy Chef Creations . Thereafter, they will make their own meals. \nThey will be tested at intervals to measure their inflammation levels. \nThe findings should be available in about two years, says Lewis. Anyone keen to enroll can visit the study's website . All About the Specific Carbohydrate Diet \nSCD eliminates most carbohydrates, including grains, starches, and sugars, as well as processed foods. Some dairy products, such as homemade yogurt, are allowed, as well as some artificial sweeteners and honey. \nThe diet was first developed by Dr. Sidney Haas in the early 1920s to treat celiac disease. In the late 1950s, a few years before Haas died, he treated a child named Judy Gottschall for ulcerative colitis. Her mother, Elaine, a biochemist, spent her life refining Hass's diet and published Breaking the Vicious Cycle: Intestinal Health Through Diet , which has sold well over a million copies and is now in its 15 th print edition. \nGottschall\u2019s theory is that complex carbohydrates are hard to digest and promote the growth of harmful bacteria in the gut. Eliminating these carbohydrates causes the bacteria to die off, giving the intestine the chance to heal. \nDespite the diet\u2019s popularity, most gastrointestinal doctor's have paid it little attention, given the lack of scientific evidence to back it up. There are relatively few studies on the role of diet in IBD generally, partly because, as many doctors state, pharmaceutical companies have nothing to gain by financing them. \nBut Lewis says scientific interest in diet has grown since the Human Genome Project isolated the genetic parts of the genome associated with the risk of developing IBD. \n\u201cIf you look at these genes, many of them are connected to the way our immune system relates to bacteria and other microorganisms. That has led to a huge interest in the microbiome , which in turn is triggering interest in diet and nutrition,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we eat is feeding our microbiome.\u201d \nLewis adds that physicians often struggle with advising Crohn\u2019s patients on what to eat. They want them to follow a healthy diet , but it\u2019s not always clear what that is, he says. \n\u201cNevertheless, most doctors will tell their patients to eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, lean meats, and not a lot of excess fats.\u201d Mediterranean Diet vs. SCD to Treat Crohn\u2019s \nAccording to global research, the Mediterranean diet is the diet most linked with living longest and with other health benefits. It may be a good diet for people with Crohn\u2019s, but the SCD may have even stronger benefits, Lewis adds. \n\u201cIn this study we\u2019ll compare the Mediterranean diet versus the SCD diet head to head. We\u2019ll be asking whether one or the other is more effective in improving symptoms or inflammation. We\u2019re going to learn a lot,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cHopefully by the time we get to the end of the decade, doctors will have something intelligent to say to their patients about diet.\u201d \nColleen Webb, RD , of the center for inflammatory bowel disease at the Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York City, believes the study will be particularly useful because it compares the benefits of two healthy diets. Many of her patients are passionate about the SCD, she says, because \u201cthe fact is, it often works.\u201d Anecdotal information on its merits has been around for years, she says, but now \u201cpatient-reported outcomes are really building. We can no longer ignore it.\u201d \nWebb agrees that emerging knowledge on the connection between what we eat and the gut microbes in our immune system is generating new interest in diet \u2014 and specifically the SCD. \u201cMuch of what the SCD is about is the gut microbiota,\u201d she adds. \nWhile the SCD helps many people, it\u2019s not the answer for everyone, Webb believes. She finds the diet very prescriptive, with \u201ctoo much focus on what to avoid, rather than on what to include.\u201d \nSome allowed foods, like some artificial sweeteners, have been shown to be harmful for gut health. Others, like unlimited amounts of some fruits and honey, can be problematic too, she adds. \nWebb believes in modifying the SCD to suit individual needs and make it more manageable. \n\u201cAs long as you\u2019re eliminating wheat and some grains, I don\u2019t think it needs to be all or nothing.\u201d Last Updated: Nutrition Living With Recommended For You This site complies with the HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here . \u00d7 Advertising Notice \nThis Site and third parties who place advertisements on this Site may collect and use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Getty Images \nHave you tried just about everything to help relieve the pain of rheumatoid arthritis (RA)? For anyone with RA, controlling the chronic pain of the disease is a top priority, if not the top priority, as research published in the journal Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases suggested. While treating the disease itself is one of the best ways to prevent pain \u2014 along with medicines to help reduce the pain, such as NSAIDs , weak opioids, and sometimes antidepressants \u2014 there are nondrug ways to ease discomfort, too. One that is often overlooked is spirituality. The Science of Spirituality, RA Pain Relief, and Self-treatment \nFor some, spirituality is practiced via a specific religion, church attendance, and prayer. For others, it may be meditation, a yoga practice, or simply a walk in the woods. Regardless, science is showing that there are real, feel-better benefits to a spiritual practice. \nA study published in August 2015 in the Journal of Health Psychology looked at migraine sufferers and found that mindfulness helped reduce pain-related stress more than a simple relaxation exercise did. Other research published in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine found that spiritual meditation for 20 minutes a day for two weeks can increase a person\u2019s pain tolerance and decrease pain and anxiety . Mind-Body Practices May Help Soothe RA Symptoms \nA 20-minute a day spiritual practice has also been associated with reduced pain and anxiety following a C-section , according to research published in December 2014 in the journal Acta Medica Iranica . As for RA itself, an article published in The Journal of Pain from research conducted at Duke Medical School found that people with RA who utilized spiritual and religious coping methods, such as prayer and meditation, to control pain were less likely to have joint pain and a negative mood. And people with RA who are spiritual rated themselves as feeling healthier than those who weren\u2019t spiritual, according to a study published in the journal Arthritis Care & Research . Why Does Spirituality Help With RA Chronic Pain? \nThe reasons a spiritual practice is so powerful aren\u2019t fully understood, but the health benefits may have to do with several things: \nSpirituality activates your body\u2019s relaxation response. Stress increases your pain sensitivity, according to research published in December 2015 in The Malaysian Journal of Medical Sciences , so anything that can help decrease stress and induce relaxation \u2014 including meditation or a mindfulness practice , yoga, and prayer \u2014 can also help to reduce your sensitivity to pain. Even walking in nature can be a spiritual experience for some and can produce feelings of well-being. \nSpirituality helps you tap into something bigger than yourself. When you surrender yourself to something larger, you feel as if you\u2019re no longer carrying the burden all by yourself. \u201cYou go from feeling disconnected and alone to feeling connected to something that you can gain healing and help from,\u201d explains Dr. Yusim. \nA spiritual practice may trigger the placebo effect or placebo response. You\u2019ve probably heard the adage \u201cWhether you think you can or you think you can\u2019t, you\u2019re right.\u201d In other words, a person\u2019s belief alone is enough to help with pain relief and healing. \u201cThe placebo effect is a proven, scientific concept, and if a person believes they can heal themselves through prayer or reduce pain through a spiritual practice, there can be real improvement,\u201d says Yusim. \nA spiritual practice cultivates compassion, which can ease suffering. Many spiritual practices have compassion and self-compassion as a central tenet: forgiveness, love, acceptance. And compassion, the perceiving of suffering and wanting to alleviate that suffering, has been linked to reduced pain as well as anger in research published in October 2014 in the Journal of Compassionate Health Care . Researchers are still looking into why compassion can lessen pain, but it may have something to do with increasing positive emotions and moods, which is associated with a higher threshold for pain and other brain changes that can decrease pain. \nSpirituality generates feelings of support from like-minded people. Whether you attend a yoga class with like-minded people or a regular church service with those who share your belief system, the sense of community and the relationships built there may have a positive effect on how you feel. Research published in the Southern Medical Journal found that people who attend church at least once a week are less likely to be hospitalized, and a study published in June 2016 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine found that women who attend church regularly are healthier, having a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease or cancer. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T16:22:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c303a47b95ef9cdf76a35cb8f8c83f4c25eb7658", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2LubsPjVrNR1hWCuNgPU98CsoYBZgb8zZf2SDDMFdmj.NcaOr6_V1t_JIDkOlE1Hp67AtrEeTztjuAPWMTwpRqqKOuJ1SIlZJAN06bqFWlXGHDTqMwVzVEwWGdtUMCDuMrwcw8IeTwKu1mFsLzNvljN8bKZSDDtRd2WfT2q_aUIs403f3er1Tlq7eqoMY8Nf3YFWv7ZF6CG6DOVtAXNmyGsY59vI6hbNWaqd16Gr86xZv21cs3SkR1XTpR1weuW7jR4IweYeNLV.tSM.i20XDXZzBG5yjAwCKtl36O7.nlxxchfHAX18yHw--", "site_full": "www.everydayhealth.com", "site": "everydayhealth.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["arthritis", "health", "ibs_crohns_disease", "diabetes"], "section_title": "", "title": "2 Million Americans May Have Arsenic in Their Well Water | Everyday Health", "title_full": "2 Million Americans May Have Arsenic in Their Well Water | Everyday Health", "published": "2017-10-19T18:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.152, "main_image": "https://images.agoramedia.com/everydayhealth/gcms/2-Million-Americans-May-Have-Arsenic-in-Their-Well-Water-1440x810.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c303a47b95ef9cdf76a35cb8f8c83f4c25eb7658", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTM1QozHOn45tDjFvFMWsK2LubsPjVrNR1hWCuNgPU98CsoYBZgb8zZf2SDDMFdmj.NcaOr6_V1t_JIDkOlE1Hp67AtrEeTztjuAPWMTwpRqqKOuJ1SIlZJAN06bqFWlXGHDTqMwVzVEwWGdtUMCDuMrwcw8IeTwKu1mFsLzNvljN8bKZSDDtRd2WfT2q_aUIs403f3er1Tlq7eqoMY8Nf3YFWv7ZF6CG6DOVtAXNmyGsY59vI6hbNWaqd16Gr86xZv21cs3SkR1XTpR1weuW7jR4IweYeNLV.tSM.i20XDXZzBG5yjAwCKtl36O7.nlxxchfHAX18yHw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alan Mozes", "published": "2017-10-19T18:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "2 Million Americans May Have Arsenic in Their Well Water | Everyday Health", "text": "2 Million Americans May Have Arsenic in Their Well Water Naturally occurring element can raise risk of cancers, other health problems.

Private well owners are left to their own devices when it comes to identifying any arsenic contamination problem. Getty Images \nAs many as 2 million Americans may be drinking well water that contains potentially dangerous amounts of arsenic, a new government study warns. \nThe analysis, conducted by researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, measured arsenic levels in private wells across the United States. \nStudy author Joseph Ayotte described the private well problem as \"widespread.\" \n\"We define 'high arsenic' to mean arsenic [levels] greater than 10 micrograms per liter,\" he said. That mirrors standards used when evaluating public wells, he noted. \nAyotte is a supervisory hydrologist with USGS at the New England Water Science Center. \nAccording to the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), arsenic is an odorless, tasteless and colorless element. In addition to water , it is commonly found in food, air and soil. \nIt is also often added to the ingredient mix of pesticides , wood preservatives and tobacco, NIEHS experts say. \nThe problem: Exposure to high levels of arsenic is known to raise the risk for a broad range of cancers, including skin, lung, bladder, kidney and liver cancers. It can also threaten the nervous system, respiratory function, heart health and the immune system, the NIEHS says. \nRELATED: States That Make You Wait to Buy Guns Have Fewer Deaths: Study \nPregnant women are particularly vulnerable, given recent research that suggests that even low-level exposure may threaten the health of a growing fetus. \nExposure typically occurs via consumption of certain types of food -- such as rice and fish -- and/or contaminated water. In particular, groundwater is often a reservoir for relatively high levels of arsenic, most commonly in rural areas across the Southwest, Midwest and Northeast. \nMunicipal water treatment facilities are able to filter out arsenic when a water source is deemed to be contaminated, according to the study team. (It can't be removed on one's own by either boiling or bleaching.) \nBut municipalities do not monitor the nation's private wells, which are mostly unregulated by either federal or state authorities. Private wells serve roughly 44 million Americans, though well usage is distributed unevenly across the country, the study found. \nThat means that private well owners are left to their own devices when it comes to being aware of or actually identifying any arsenic contamination problem, the researchers said. \nThe new investigation set out to map private well concerns and identify arsenic hotspots by sifting through a wide range of geological information concerning regional rainfall and chemical composition data. \nSome of the data were drawn from samples taken from more than 20,000 private wells at some point between 1970 and 2013, while some of the other data reflected arsenic concentration information sourced from nearly 19,000 private wells. \nIn the end, the team concluded that the lion's share of hotspots -- locations where private well arsenic levels exceeded 10 micrograms per liter -- were located in the New England region, the upper Midwest, the Southwest, and across southern Texas. \nThe investigators calculated that such wells likely serve more than 2 million residents, many of whom probably have no idea that they are routinely exposed to contaminated water. \n\"This study,\" said Ayotte, \"is a first step in understanding the potentially exposed high arsenic domestic well population. It underscores the need for all well owners to test their wells and to take action to reduce exposure, if appropriate.\" \nResidents can try to remove arsenic from their well water with water treatment methods such as reverse osmosis, ultra-filtration or ion exchange, the NIEHS says. Your local health department can recommend the best procedures for your well. \nAyotte and his colleagues reported their findings in the Oct. 18 issue of Environmental Science & Technology . \nThe American Chemical Society declined to offer comment on the findings. \nBut Hans Plugge, a senior toxicologist with Verisk 3E, a consulting firm based in Bethesda, Md., expressed little surprise at the findings. \n\"And if I lived in one of these problem areas, I would definitely think about getting my water tested,\" said Plugge, who wasn't involved with the study. \nStill, the likelihood of discovering that a well is contaminated with high arsenic levels is relatively low, he said. \n\"In the worst case, it's about an 18 percent probability that it's 10 micrograms per liter or more. And the authors point out that that's a conservative estimate, meaning the chances are probably even lower,\" Plugge said. \"But yes, I'd get it tested. And if it's high then it's definitely a good idea to do something about it.\" Last Updated: Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay . All rights reserved.

Masterfile \nWhether oncologists like it or not, many of their patients \u2014 as many as one-quarter of them \u2014 are using marijuana to ease the physical and psychological symptoms of their disease and treatment, according to a study in the September 2017 issue of the journal Cancer . \nSteven A. Pergam, MD , the study\u2019s lead author, says that he and other doctors know too little to say anything certain about the potential benefits and harm of marijuana, and that troubles him. \n\u201cI\u2019m not a marijuana expert,\u201d says Dr. Pergam, who works with cancer patients and recipients of bone-marrow transplants. \u201cAs an infectious disease specialist, I get asked a lot whether it\u2019s safe. And if it\u2019s safe, what are the best modes to use for patients?\u201d \nHe doesn\u2019t always know the answers. \nThe questions, then, become what should cancer patients know about marijuana, and how should they decide whether or not to try it, Pergam says. And that\u2019s tricky because of the lack of good data on so many aspects of marijuana use. 1. Cancer Patients Should Avoid recreational marijuana. \nMedical marijuana is carefully prepared, and the dosage can be monitored. That\u2019s not true for patients smoking marijuana they\u2019ve obtained on their own, says Richard Tempel, MD , an emergency room physician and a member of the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association . Marijuana can contain contaminants and typically has very high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol. \u201cIf you\u2019re not growing it, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting,\u201d he says. 2. Medical marijuana appears to be safe. \nDr. Tempel, who is also the medical director for Aphria Florida, which runs a marijuana dispensary in Florida, says doctors and others widely misunderstand the benefits and risks of medical marijuana. \u201cClearly, alcohol and the opiates are far more dangerous than marijuana,\u201d he says. \u201cI see the opiate epidemic on a nightly basis. I\u2019ve never had to perform CPR on a patient who overdosed on medical marijuana.\u201d 3. The benefits appear to cover a wide range of cancer patients\u2019 needs. \nTempel says that cancer patients can potentially get a double bonus from the use of medical marijuana. It can control pain, reduce inflammation, control nausea and vomiting, and increase appetite. It\u2019s important to know, however, that the evidence behind the benefits comes from small studies. There\u2019s yet to be definitive research supporting marijuana's use in cancer patients. 4. It might be a bad idea if your blood counts are low. \nWhite blood cell counts can dip during chemotherapy, putting patients at risk for infection. In these cases, Pergam counsels against marijuana use. \u201cI\u2019ll tell patients who are using that this is the time to stop,\u201d he says. Marijuana can have a lot of mold on it, which might pose a challenge for an already weakened immune system, he says. 5. Your doctor should know if You're Trying it. \nIt might feel a little weird telling your doctor you\u2019re trying it, but safety trumps social discomfort, says Pergam, who says that one of the goals of his study was to \u201cstart the conversation.\u201d If patients use this and don\u2019t tell their provider, they can put themselves at risk, he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re a cancer patient and you are interested in understanding more, or if you\u2019re considering using marijuana, bring that up and have that discussion with your cancer doctor,\u201d he says.

Please select a newsletter Start by finding a hospital with a great surgical team. Getty Images \nSurgery is still the preferred approach for early stage lung cancer and offers the best chances for a complete recovery. But even malignancies that have spread to the lymph nodes may still be operable. \u201cMost cancer centers will consider surgery for patients with more advanced cancer,\u201d says Jay M. Lee, MD , the chief of the division of thoracic surgery at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California. \nBut once lung cancer has spread outside the chest cavity \u2014 anything beyond stage 3 cancer \u2014 surgery isn\u2019t aimed at cure, he says, but rather to relieve symptoms and open up airways. \nPractice helps, too. A study published in the November 2014 issue of the Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery , using data from the National Cancer database, found that postsurgery 30-day mortality rates were nearly double \u2014 3.7 percent versus 1.7 percent \u2014 at hospitals that did fewer than 10 procedures a year compared with institutions that did more than 30 of these procedures annually. So choose wisely, and pick a hospital with experienced surgical teams. \nWhat are the options? Thoracotomy \nSurgery to remove part of the lung is called a thoracotomy, which involves making a 10-inch incision in the chest. Depending on the size and stage of the cancer, where it\u2019s located, and how well a patient\u2019s lungs are functioning, there are different surgical options. There are different variations of thoracotomy, including: Lobectomy The lungs have five lobes \u2014 three on the right and two on the left. This procedure entails removing an entire lobe that contains the cancerous tumor. This is the preferred type of operation. Wedge resection This involves cutting out only part of a lobe, and is used when patients don\u2019t have adequate lung function. Pneumonectomy This procedure involves removing an entire lung. This is only done when absolutely necessary because it can impair lung function. Sleeve resection This procedure is used when a tumor is in the bronchus, which is a branch of the windpipe. A surgeon will snip out the section that contains the tumor, then sew back together each end of the \u201csleeve\u201d of the airway. This procedure is sometimes done instead of a pneumonectomy in order to preserve lung function. Video-Assisted Thorascopic Surgery (VATS) \nThink of it as laparoscopy for the lungs. This minimally invasive surgery relies on the use of tiny instruments and a fiber-optic video camera threaded through an array of \u00bd inch incisions, rather than one large incision. The camera then transmits images of the internal organs onto a television monitor to guide surgeons. \nIn robotic surgery, surgeons sit in front of a console, away from the operating table, with a magnified 3-D screen. They operate by moving two controllers that manipulate robotic arms equipped with tiny surgical instruments. It\u2019s becoming a popular alternative to thoracotomy because it is less invasive, has fewer complications, and patients recover faster. Most of the surgeries that can be done via thoracotomy can be performed using VATS. However, surgeons often prefer doing open surgery for pneumonectomy or sleeve resection, because the lung may not fit through the tiny incision, and the sleeve resection can be complicated, says Dr. Lee. Cryosurgery \nNot everyone is a good candidate for surgery. Some patients have very advanced disease and are in bad shape, or have poor lung function from the disease or because they are longtime smokers with marginal lung function. These patients may be candidates for cryotherapy, in which the patient is sedated and a bronchoscope is inserted through the trachea and into the lungs. Surgeons thread a probe capable of freezing tissue through the bronchoscope and place it in the tumor. The frozen tissue is then removed. After Surgery, What can Patients Expect? \nStage 1 lung cancer patients in whom surgery has removed all the cancerous cells don\u2019t need to undergo further treatment. In all other cases, patients can expect to undergo radiation, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. Right now, immunotherapy is given only to late-stage patients, some of whom have had a remarkable response, says Lee, who chairs a large clinical trial at 15 sites, including UCLA, which is testing whether using these therapies in conjunction with surgery can prevent recurrences. \nIn the future, immunotherapy may be given to all patients prior to surgery, says Lee. \u201cSome of these early-stage patients are at risk for distant metastases from the spread of microscopic cells we\u2019re not able to visibly see,\u201d says Lee. \u201cThe field is changing and we may soon be using immunotherapies and other targeted treatments before surgery.\u201d Last Updated: Basics Treatment Living With Recommended For You This site complies with the HONcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here . \u00d7 Advertising Notice \nThis Site and third parties who place advertisements on this Site may collect and use information about your visits to this Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Masterfile \nMore than 20 percent of young white women who've been to a tanning salon become addicted to tanning -- even though doing so raises their risk of deadly skin cancer and premature skin aging, a new study reports. \nThese women seem to depend on tanning to feel attractive and often show symptoms of depression , the researchers said. \n\"Indoor tanning remains a public health concern for skin cancer prevention ,\" said lead researcher Darren Mays, an assistant professor of oncology at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, D.C. \n\"Our study indicates a substantial proportion of young women who indoor tan may become dependent, putting this group at especially high risk for skin cancer later in life,\" he said. \nIndoor tanning is dangerous. It increases the risk of melanoma , the most deadly cancer, by 20 percent and increases the risk of other skin cancers as well, Mays said. \nThe researchers found that as beliefs about the importance of appearance grew stronger, young women were 73 percent more likely to be addicted to indoor tanning. \nIn addition, women who were depressed were nearly four times more likely to have a tanning addiction, compared with women who weren't depressed, Mays said. \nIt's not yet clear why some women become addicted to tanning. Some scientists believe that tanning produces a by-product that has an opioid drug-like effect on some people. \nRELATED: A Former 'Tan-oholic' Pays the Price: More Than 81 Skin Cancers \nJoseph Levy is scientific adviser to the American Suntanning Association, which represents the tanning salon industry. He disagreed that tanning can be addictive. \n\"It is imprudent to characterize our natural and intended attraction to sunlight as addictive,\" he said. \"Ultraviolet exposure is a natural attraction, and humans get less regular sunlight today than at any point in human history.\" \nAt least one medical specialist disagreed with Levy. Dr. Doris Day, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said she sees women who are addicted to tanning every day. \n\"Tanning is not safe and it's not healthy,\" she said. Day tells women who are addicted to tanning about the risk for skin cancer and premature skin aging. \nIn addition, she helps them reduce their need to tan and gradually reduce the amount they tan. \nDay advises using sunscreen , and if you absolutely need to have that suntanned look, to use a bronzer instead. \n\"I tell them to perfect their pale or go with their own glow,\" she said. \nMays and his colleagues studied tanning addiction among nearly 400 white women between 18 and 30 years old. White women were chosen for the study because they're the ones most likely to use indoor tanning. \nThe participants completed online questionnaires and had used an indoor tanning device one or more times in the past year. Nearly 47 percent of the women were college students. \nThe researchers measured tanning dependence based on two questionnaires. The participants were considered tanning-dependent if they tested positive for addictive behavior on both questionnaires. \nIn total, nearly 23 percent of the women tested positive for indoor tanning dependence, the researchers found. \nWomen who were dependent were more likely to have begun tanning at an earlier age, to be concerned about their appearance and to have depressive symptoms, compared with women who weren't dependent, Mays said. \nHe said women need to understand not only the risks of tanning but to be on the lookout for signs of tanning addiction, such as symptoms of depression. \nHowever, getting people to change this behavior may be tough, he added. \n\"We do not yet have resources available to help young women who may be tanning-dependent to change their behavior to reduce their risk,\" Mays said. \nThe report was published Oct. 19 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention .

Alamy \nThe longer you refrain from drinking, the lower your risk of a common heart rhythm disorder. \nThat's the message of a new long-range study examining alcohol use and atrial fibrillation , or Afib. This is when electrical impulses in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic and cause an irregular heartbeat, which increases the risk of blood clots that can cause stroke or heart attacks. \nOne in four adults older than 40 is at risk for Afib, and nearly 6 million people in the United States could have the condition by 2050. \nBut the researchers from the University of California, San Francisco found that every decade of non-drinking decreased the risk of Afib by 20 percent, regardless of the type of alcohol. \nRELATED: Less Invasive Procedures to Treat Atrial Fibrillation \nThe study included heart-risk data generated over 25 years on more than 15,000 American adults. \nPast drinkers were at increased risk for Afib , the researchers found.

The laws require athletes with suspected concussions to stop playing until a doctor clears them to return. Sue Harper/Alamy \nState laws aimed at curbing an alarming rise in concussions among student athletes appear to be working. \nSince 2014, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to protect young athletes against traumatic brain injury (TBI). Washington state was the first in 2009. \nMost of the laws require athletes with suspected concussions to stop playing until a doctor clears them to return. Coaches, players and parents must also receive yearly education about concussion . \n\"This movement to get these laws passed has made a huge difference,\" said Kenneth Podell, director of the Houston Methodist Concussion Center, who reviewed a new study assessing the laws. \nLed by Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, researchers examined concussion reports to a nationwide sports injury tracking program before and after the laws were passed. The data covered nine high school sports: football, boys' basketball, soccer, baseball and wrestling as well as girls' basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball. \nThe takeaway: Players were more likely to report a concussion, and the number of repeat injuries fell dramatically after the laws went into effect. \nBetween fall 2005 and spring 2016, student athletes reported about 2.7 million concussions. Of those, 89 percent were new and 11 percent were repeat injuries. \nIn 2005, nearly 135,000 initial concussions were reported. The number jumped to more than 360,000 by 2016. \nPrincipal investigator Ginger Yang attributed the increase in \"new concussions\" to increased awareness of symptoms and reporting. Before the laws, many people simply didn't know how to recognize a concussion, so suspected or actual injuries were never reported, she said. \nYang is with the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital. \nPredictably, football players sustained the most concussions, accounting for about half of those reported. Girls who played soccer had the second-highest rate, according to the study. \nAfter concussion laws were introduced, however, repeat injuries fell dramatically, from about 14 percent of all concussions in 2005 to roughly 7 percent in 2016. \nPodell said the added attention created by the laws has been a game-changer. \n\"More and more, year after year, as time goes on more kids self-report symptoms and pull themselves out of the game,\" he said. \"This will pay dividends down the road.\" \nDespite improvements in reporting and managing concussions, however, Yang said more must be done to protect players. \n\"Our results, along with those of others, can be used as evidence for the need of more public health efforts that focus on preventing concussions in the first place, such as preventing or reducing initial head or body impact,\" she said. Other strategies could include setting limits on heading the ball in soccer and stricter adherence to rules. \nAn estimated 1 million to 2 million people age 18 or younger sustain a concussion in the United States each year during sports or other recreational activities. These injuries can have lasting effects on developing brains, including personality changes and problems with thinking and coordination, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Multiple concussions over an extended period can have cumulative effects. \nThe study was published Oct. 19 in the American Journal of Public Health . Last Updated: Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

The high self-harm rate among teen girls may be due to common mental health problems in females at this age. iStock \nTeen girls are much more likely to self-harm than boys, and the dangerous practice is on the rise. \nThat's the conclusion of a new British study that also found a strong link between self-harm -- practices such as cutting or burning oneself -- and a higher risk of suicide. \nResearchers reviewed information from nearly 650 general practices in the United Kingdom. The records had data on almost 9,000 patients aged 10 to 19 who self-harmed between 2001 and 2014. The investigators compared those children to more than 170,000 kids who didn't self-harm, matched for age and gender. \nThe rate of self-harm was about three times higher among girls than boys. The rate rose 68 percent among girls ages 13 to 16 from 2011 to 2014. \nReferrals to mental health services within 12 months of self-harming were 23 percent less likely for children in the poorest areas, even though the rates of self-harm were higher in these areas. \nRELATED: Americans More Open About Mental Health Issues, But Stigma Lingers \nThe researchers also found that children and teens who self-harmed had a nine times increased risk of death from non-natural causes. The risk from suicide and alcohol/drug poisoning was especially pronounced. \nThe high self-harm rate among teen girls may be due to common mental health problems in females at this age. Biological factors such as puberty and onset of sexual activity may also play a role in self-harm, according to lead researcher Cathy Morgan, from the University of Manchester, and colleagues. \nThe researchers said there is some evidence that common mental health disorders are on the rise among teens. This may be because they \"are living in more stressful times,\" Morgan's team said. \nThe study findings \"emphasize the urgent need for integrated care involving families, schools and health care provision to enhance safety among these distressed young people in the short term, and to help secure their future mental health and well-being,\" the study authors concluded. \nThe study was published Oct. 18 in BMJ .

Please select a newsletter Researchers tested a simple tactic: having patients wear frozen gloves and socks during chemotherapy. Courtesy of A. Hanai \nMany cancer drugs can cause debilitating nerve damage as a side effect. But a small study suggests that simple cold wraps to the hands and feet might prevent it. \nThe side effect, known as peripheral neuropathy , damages nerves in the limbs. This often leads to pain, numbness and tingling, and difficulty with balance and using the hands and fingers. \nThere are treatments for peripheral neuropathy, according to the American Cancer Society. But there are no proven ways to prevent it. \nIn the new study, researchers tested a simple tactic: having patients wear frozen gloves and socks during chemotherapy. \nWith that protection in place, patients were much less likely to develop symptoms of nerve damage , the study found. \nMedical experts said there are reasons to be excited about the findings. \nFor one, the therapy is \"easy and safe,\" said study leader Akiko Hanai, an occupational therapist at Kyoto University, in Japan. \nStill, there are cautions, she said. \nRELATED: 'Cooling Caps' May Halt Chemo-Linked Hair Loss \nBesides its small size, the study looked only at patients being treated with the drug paclitaxel (Taxol). It's not clear, Hanai said, whether cold therapy would have similar benefits for patients on other cancer drugs. \nAnd the tactic is not one for people to try on their own. In this study, the frozen socks and gloves were donned during chemo -- with therapists standing by to make sure the cold was tolerable, Hanai said. \nThe findings are based on 36 women undergoing paclitaxel treatment for breast cancer . The researchers had each patient wear a frozen glove and sock on the dominant side of her body during the chemo sessions, leaving the other hand and foot to serve as the \"control.\" \nThere was no fancy technology involved. The researchers used commercially available cold wraps marketed as Elasto-Gel, by the France-based Akromed. (The company did not fund the study, according to Hanai's team.) \nOverall, the investigators found, the simple 90-minute strategy substantially cut patients' risk of neuropathy symptoms. \nJust under 28 percent of patients developed numbness in the hand that was covered by the frozen glove -- while the unprotected hand was affected 81 percent of the time, the findings showed. \nThe difference was similar when it came to numbness in the feet: Almost 64 percent of patients developed the problem in the unprotected foot, while 25 percent suffered numbness in the sock-clad foot. \nAnd in dexterity tests, the women showed a bigger treatment-related decline in the unprotected hand, versus the glove-protected one. \n\"The results of this study are very exciting,\" said Dr. Dawn Hershman, who wrote an editorial published with the findings. \n\"If they are confirmed, this may be a low-cost and low-risk option for patients,\" said Hershman, who leads the breast cancer program at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. \nBut, she said, the therapy still needs to be tested in larger, \"randomized\" studies -- where patients are randomly assigned to receive cold therapy or not. Those types of trials are considered the gold standard in medicine. \nFiguring out ways to prevent peripheral neuropathy is critical, Hershman said. \nIt not only drains patients' quality of life, she said, but can also cause them to stop treatment early. \nPaclitaxel and similar \"taxane\" drugs -- like docetaxel and cabazitaxel -- are among the common causes of peripheral neuropathy, according to the American Cancer Society. So are \"platinum\" drugs, such as cisplatin and carboplatin, and so-called plant alkaloids, such as vinblastine and vincristine. \nDr. Elizabeth Comen treats breast cancer patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She agreed that more research is needed -- to understand what \"dose\" of cold therapy is best, for example. \nAt the same time, Comen said, there's little downside to the tactic. \n\"If a patient came to me wanting to try it, I'd support it,\" she said. \"I think this is something patients can discuss with their doctors now. It's a reasonable option.\" \nIf cold therapy does thwart peripheral neuropathy, it's not clear why, Hershman said. \nComen agreed that the mechanism is unclear. But, she said, the approach is similar to the \"cold caps\" sometimes used to reduce hair loss from chemo. In theory, that works by restricting blood flow to the scalp, which may limit the amount of chemo that reaches hair follicles. \nThe study was published online Oct. 12 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .

The procedures are nearly as common as liposuction. \nThe new study examines how \"casual observers\" perceive people after they've had a nose job, said Ishii, a plastic surgeon and associate professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. \n\"Patients seeking rhinoplasty do so for two main reasons: to improve their self-perception and to improve how others perceive them,\" she said. \"We wanted to measure the second one.\" \nRELATED: 'Optimal' Facelifts Do Make You Look Younger, Study Finds \nThe researchers recruited 473 people online to evaluate the appearance of 13 rhinoplasty patients. Observers ranged in age from 18 to 73. Most were female and white, and highly educated. \nThe researchers deemed the patients' post-op results \"optimal.\" They showed the observers photos taken before the nose reshaping and at least 6 months after. But they didn't reveal whether they were \"before\" or \"after\" images, and the observers never saw more than one picture of the same patient. \nThe patients were mostly female, with an average age of 34. Most \"had nose problems that were visible to the casual observer and they wanted to look better,\" Ishii said. \nShe added that a prior study showed that the casual observer \"actually picks up on even subtle nasal deformities.\" \nHer team asked the observers to rate patients in terms of attractiveness, success level and overall health based on their photos. \nOn a scale of 1 to 100, the average patient's attractiveness rating improved by 14 points after remodeling, the researchers found. Ratings of success and health rose 9 and 10 points, respectively, after surgery. \nIshii called the degree of improvement significant, and said this gives patients information about how nose jobs may affect them. \n\"More attractive people are more successful,\" she said. \"It's up to patients to decide whether that's worth it to them.\" \nInsurers don't usually cover nose jobs, however. The cost can range from $6,000 to $25,000 \"depending on the complexity of the procedure and the reputation of the surgeon,\" said plastic surgeon Dr. Clinton Humphrey. He's an associate professor with the University of Kansas Health System. \n\"It is important not to misinterpret these study results,\" cautioned Humphrey, co-author of a commentary accompanying the new research. \n\"This study included only patients with what were judged by surgeons to be 'ideal' results. Rhinoplasty continues to be one of the most challenging cosmetic surgical procedures ,\" he said. \n\"While I always strive to achieve the best possible outcome in every one of my rhinoplasty patients, I do not achieve an 'ideal' result every time,\" Humphrey said. \n\"It would be a mistake to read this study and conclude that every patient who undergoes rhinoplasty can expect to be perceived as more successful, healthier, and more attractive,\" he added. \nStill, he said, \"patients should feel reassured that what we as rhinoplasty surgeons consider to be 'ideal' results are also viewed very favorably by the average person,\" Humphrey said. \"As a surgeon, this study tells me that when I execute a successful rhinoplasty, I have an opportunity to positively impact my patient in a really significant way.\" \nThe study appears Oct. 19 in the journal JAMA Facial Plastic Surgery .

Masterfile \nThat evening stroll you take after dinner most nights may be doing you more good than you realize -- new research suggests even a bit of regular walking can reduce your risk of death. \n\" Walking has been described as the 'perfect exercise' because it is simple, free, convenient, doesn't require any special equipment or training, and can be done at any age,\" said study leader Alpa Patel, a cancer epidemiologist from the American Cancer Society. \n\"With the near doubling of adults aged 65 and older expected by 2030, clinicians should encourage patients to walk even if less than the recommended amount, especially as they age, for health and longevity,\" Patel said in a society news release. \nPrevious research has linked regular walking with a lower risk of heart disease , diabetes, and breast and colon cancers . However, many American adults don't get the recommended levels of walking or other types of exercise. The recommended amounts are at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week. \nIn this study, researchers examined data from nearly 140,000 American adults. Of those, 95 percent said they did some walking. Nearly half said walking was their only form of moderate-vigorous physical activity. \nRELATED: Could Too Much Exercise Be Bad for Men's Hearts? \nThe researchers adjusted the data to account for other factors that could affect the risk of death, such as smoking, obesity and chronic health problems . \nAfter those adjustments, the researchers concluded that people whose only exercise was walking less than two hours per week had a lower risk of death from any cause than those who did no physical activity. \nThose who did one to two times the minimum amount of recommended weekly exercise (2.5 to 5 hours) by only walking had a 20 percent lower risk of death. The risk of death was similar among those who exceeded activity recommendations through only walking. \nWalking was most strongly associated with reduced risk of death from respiratory diseases -- about a 35 percent lower risk for those who walked more than six hours a week than those who were least active. \nWalking was also associated with about 20 percent lower risk of death from heart disease. People who only walked also had a 9 percent lower risk of death from cancer , the study authors said. \nHowever, none of the results proved a direct cause-and-effect relationship. The study was only designed to show associations. \nThe findings were published online Oct. 19 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine . Last Updated: Copyright @ 2017 HealthDay .

President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday, Oct. 12, 2017 designed to expand health insurance options for some Americans, in a move that may undermine coverage for those who remain in Obamacare. Getty Images \nMost Americans who buy health insurance through an Affordable Care Act marketplace will not pay significantly more for their coverage in 2018, despite actions by President Donald Trump that have roiled the insurance markets. \nEight out of 10 people buying insurance through ACA (\" Obamacare \") marketplaces qualify for tax credits that lower their premium costs, experts say, and they will not be affected by Trump's decision to halt cost-sharing reimbursements to insurance companies. \nInsurance companies also are required by law to keep providing cost-sharing subsidies to qualifying enrollees, even though the federal government may not pay the companies back for those expenses, the experts say. \n\"There's a lot of confusion or lack of awareness out there among consumers in terms of how this will affect them,\" said Kelley Turek, executive director of exchange operations and policy for America's Health Insurance Plans. \"It will somewhat vary by state but, in general, consumers need to know the marketplaces still exist. There are still plans available to them, and there are still subsidies available to them.\" \nBut that still leaves two out of 10 people in ACA marketplaces who don't qualify for financial assistance. Those are the folks who would feel the full pain of premium increases prompted by Trump's announcement to do away with the cost-sharing reimbursements, said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center. \nHouseholds that earn more than 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level aren't eligible for Obamacare financial assistance. That's $30,150 for a single person, or $61,500 for a family of four. \n\"If they are not eligible for financial assistance, if they're not eligible for the premium tax credits, they may see very large increases in their premiums because of all of the things the administration is doing,\" Blumberg said. \"If you're not protected by premium tax credits, you may very well find a nasty surprise when you see the new rates.\" \nRELATED: Obamacare Widened Access to Cancer Care \nFurther complicating matters, two leading senators -- Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.) -- offered on Tuesday a bipartisan proposal that would fund for two years the threatened subsidies for insurers participating in Affordable Care Act programs. \nHowever, there's no guarantee the proposal would pass a Congress that's sharply split along partisan lines. Conservative Republicans have said they view such a move as a bailout for insurance companies. Consumers urged to review plan options now \nInsurers across the country already are increasing their 2018 premiums in response to Trump's pledge to cut off the cost-sharing reimbursements, but premium tax credits also would increase to match the rising costs, Turek said. \n\"Those consumers who are subsidized who are enrolling in those plans generally will be shielded from those rate increases,\" Turek said. \nTurek and Blumberg urge health insurance customers to visit their ACA marketplace as soon as possible during open enrollment for 2018, punch in their financial information and find out their eligibility for financial assistance. \nOpen enrollment will run from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15. \n\"Every year we say it's really important for consumers to go back to the marketplace, update their eligibility application and shop for the plan that's right for them,\" Turek said. \"That's going to be even more true this year. People need to update their household and income information and see what they're eligible for.\" \nTurek expects that insurance companies will not flee the ACA marketplaces, avoiding a scenario of some counties with no health insurance options for customers. \nCentene, a major insurer that has stepped in to sell coverage in so-called \"bare\" markets, told The New York Times that it expects things to be \"business as usual\" in 2018, and that it will work with state regulators to try and fill any bare counties that emerge in coming weeks. \n\"At this point, consumers in every county have marketplace coverage available to them,\" America's Health Insurance Plans' Turek said. \"There are obviously ongoing discussions with this last-minute decision, but I think our members are committed to participating in the marketplace.\" \nBlumberg is more concerned that insurers will flee the market later in 2018, due to an executive order Trump issued the same day he declared an end to cost-sharing reimbursements. \nTrump ordered federal officials to prepare regulations that would extend the length of short-term health insurance plans. The plans are intended as three-month stopgap coverage for people between jobs, but now could be extended out to a year in length, offering a cheap and bare-bones alternative to marketplace coverage. \n\"These are policies that are not guaranteed issue, they're not guaranteed renewable. They will be medically underwritten, which means premiums will be set based on the expected health care needs of the people who apply. They won't cover essential health benefits,\" Blumberg said. \"They're going to be much narrower kinds of benefit plans, and if somebody who buys one gets sick they're probably not going to be able to buy it the next year.\" \nIf these short-term plans become available mid-year in 2018, people with marketplace plans might drop them in favor of the cheaper option, Blumberg said. \n\"In the middle of a plan year, someone who's perfectly healthy could say 'Hey, I'll just buy that because it's really cheap and hope I don't get sick, and if I do get sick beginning next year I'll come back into the ACA-compliant policies,'\" Blumberg said. \nThat would leave Obamacare plans with an insurance pool increasingly made up of people in poorer health, which could cause premiums to rise even further in 2019, Blumberg said.
