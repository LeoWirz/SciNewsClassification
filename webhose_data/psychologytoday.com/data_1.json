Posted Oct 03, 2017 Please insert your caption here. Source: NBC \n\u200b \nI might be slightly biased , but there aren't a lot of negative things I can say about the NBC hit-series \u00a8This Is Us\u00a8 . It's heartwarming, compassionate, gut-wrenching and a true gem. It taps into our nostalgia and makes us reminisce about our own families, our own memories , and our own history. This is one of those shows that, as a psychologist, I've recommended to both colleagues and loved ones alike. \nWith Season Two premiering a week ago, the hype is back and bigger than ever, which has made me think about what makes this show so appealing. Is it the lovable characters? The complex family relationships? How sensitively it navigates through complicated issues such as adoption , body image , and addiction ? Whatever the reason it may be, it's safe to say a big appeal of this show is how relatable it is. \n\u00a8This Is Us\u00a8 portrays family dynamics and elements that all families can connect with, in a way that hasn't been done before. It teaches us about communication, the intricate dance of marriage and that no family is perfect. The show, besides its entertainment value, shines a light on a variety of characteristics pertinent to all families and their dynamics. \nEach family member plays a special role within the family system \nFamily systems therapy is a special form of family therapy that studies how each individual within the family affects the whole unit. This therapy holds the premise that \u00a8what happens to one member of the family, happens to the whole family\u00a8. \nAuthors like Salvador Minuchin and Virginia Satir have done extensive research regarding family dynamics and what makes each family system unique. Their findings suggest that each member of the family serves a role to keep the family in equilibrium. These roles will change as each individual (or the family as a whole) faces transformative challenges. \n\u00a8This Is Us\u00a8 showcases a family of five and how each member of its family plays a specific role. Jack, for example, is the go-getter patriarch of the family. He makes the big decisions and he's remembered by his children as frequently making the best out of sticky situations. Even though he battles with addiction , we can all agree that he is best known for being the personification of the phrase \u00a8taking the sourest lemon life has to offer and turning it into something resembling lemonade\u00a8. \nAnother great example of how each member serves a role is the fascinating dynamic between the twins, Kate and Kevin. They're each other's go-to person and are blissfully unaware of how deep-rooted their connection is - they even finish each other's sentences. And, while their limit setting abilities might need an extra help, they show us how each family member plays a different role to help maintain the family homeostasis (Jackson, 1981). \nEach family life cycle stage presents a particular challenge for the family \nJust like there are developmental stages for each person (birth, infancy, adolescence , adulthood, etc.), the family has a life cycle as well. And just like each developmental stage has a \u00a8crisis\u00a8 or a challenge the individual needs to overcome (Erikson, 1998), each family is faced with different challenges as it moves through a different stage (R\u00edos, 2005). \nOne of the aspects that make \u00a8This Is Us\u00a8 so special, is that we see the different stages of this family. We get to see Rebecca and Jack in their early years of dating ; as they prepare for the arrival of triplets, and now become young parents ; the family with young kids; the family with teenagers; and so on. We are even fortunate to see how these early models shaped the \u00a8Big Three\u00a8's ability to forge relationships as adults. \nEach stage has its challenges and its crisis to overcome, which makes each stage unique and different. For example, the challenges one might face while starting to plan for a family at the early stages of marriage (organizing their finances and discussing parental expectations) are completely different from the ones a family with teenagers face (re-adjusting limits and allowing children's independence). \nA family's mental health and resilience - as a whole - depends on how well they're able to face both normative and unexpected challenges and obstacles. Resilient families are not the ones that don't face any problems, but the ones who transform those problems into growth opportunities. \nThere is no such thing as a perfect relationship nor a perfect family \nPerfection is an illusion and, unfortunately, social media is partly to blame for perpetuating this myth. While social media has given us a handy tool communication- wise , especially in this global world, it's also a double-edged sword when it comes to human relationships. \nAccording to Simon Sinek , ethnographer and author, social media gives us the opportunity to \u00a8show life is amazing, even though (we can be) depressed\u00a8. According to Sinek, we have become good at putting filters on our daily situations. Today, more than ever, we are at risk of believing that perfection is attainable and we're falling behind because we haven't reached it yet. \nWhile This Is Us is a work of fiction, it shows us that this simply isn't true. The series explores the good, the bad and everything in the middle. We relate to Randall because he's a flawed character, who has thrived from less-than-ideal circumstances; we empathize with Kate, because we know she's an amazing human who is also a work in progress; and, we swoon over Kevin because he shows us that you can have fame and money and also feel incomplete. \nNo family is perfect, and no relationship is perfect, either. But, we need to remember that perfection does not exist. It's about loving each other for who we are - with both our qualities and our demons - and making that choice every single day.

According to a recent article in The Atlantic [1], \"...the amount of money one makes can be roughly predicted by how much money one\u2019s parents made, and that only gets truer as one moves along the earnings spectrum.\" \nWhat's more, according to an article published in August 2017 [2], \"A child's birth circumstances have a large effect on his or her chances in life.\" To wit, children who are born into poverty are likely to have lower academic achievement, lower income as adults, more behavior problems, are more likely to be teen parents, and less likely to attend or graduate from college. Children growing up in families with adequate financial resources are more likely to have jobs, make more money, avoid participation in welfare programs, be healthier, and live longer. \nWhen it comes to school, the income gaps in literacy, math, and language skills, as well as conduct problems and hyperactivity are apparent before school even starts. The impact of poverty on children's futures is less about schools and more about the parenting that impoverished children are likely to experience. \nI can already hear some readers taking offense to this statement. As someone who grew up on Section 8 and welfare, I can understand how what I am arguing may be taken as an elitist insult to the poor. Please, let me keep explaining. \nPolicies that attempt to close the income gap between poor students and their more economically advantaged counterparts tend to focus on changes to curricula, teaching strategies, afterschool programs, and administrative functions. However, a large body of research demonstrates that parents interact with their children less, are less emotionally engaged with their children, ask their children fewer questions, use more punitive discipline , and express a less varied vocabulary. \nAs I have written on my website and in my upcoming book, a key component in the life of a well-adjusted child is parental sensitivity and responsiveness. The degree to which a parent responds to a child's needs, and is sensitive to his concerns is the degree to which he feels like a significant member of a family, whose physical and emotional life is important. When a parent does not respond promptly and sensitivity, a child is more likely to express his frustration with behaviors directed at others (called \"externalizing behaviors\") or toward himself (called \"internalizing behaviors\"). \nSo now, why? If the problems we see from poor children are more about their home life than about their school's effectiveness, then it is important to ask why so that we may be able to help parents overcome the obstacles they are experiencing. Though some people may argue that people are poor because they make bad choices and are somehow inferior, I agree with the author of the paper I cited above. \nIn short, the author explains that parents who are struggling economically have \"behavioral bottlenecks\" which make it harder to use positive parenting strategies. Let's face it: When your child acts inappropriately, it takes less time to spank her than it does to sit her down, discuss why what she did was displeasing, and brainstorm alternative behaviors that she can use in similar situations in the future. Positive parenting is a luxury. \nMeanwhile, poverty is stressful. It takes mental energy to juggle bills, worry about possible evictions, navigate dangerous neighborhoods, and look for extra sources of income. People who have inadequate resources are more likely to battle with depression and anxiety, and to feel constant assaults to their self-esteem as they compare themselves to other people who are more successful. \nAccording to Abraham Maslow [3], people have different needs, which exist along a kind of hierarchy. Until a person satisfies a need at one level of the hierarchy, they are hypothetically unable to focus on any needs above it. At the bottom of the hierarchy are the physiological needs: food, water, shelter. For some parents, these needs are the ones that are on their minds all the time. If Maslow's theory is correct, parents who aren't sure how they are going to put food on the table or a roof over their heads, don't have the mental energy to focus on the higher needs of safety, love and belonging, esteem, or self-actualization (the next higher needs on the hierarchy, in ascending order). \nIt's possible\u2014hear me out\u2014that poverty affects children in numerous and awful ways because the stress , danger, depression, anger , and anxiety are so all-consuming for their parents that there is just little time for teaching children the bigger skills of emotional regulation, executive functioning, positive social skills, or intrinsic academic motivation . \nHowever, I believe, along with the authors of the article we've been following here, that many parents want to raise their children to be successful, competent, and economically comfortable. There are a few pilot programs that the authors discuss, which have managed to improve the outcomes of children living in poverty. \nOne study that they cite provides evidence that giving parents a higher Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) is related to lower levels of child neglect and less involvement with child protective services, especially among low-income single mothers. In essence, providing parents with more money is positively connected to their parenting. \nThis finding reminds me of something Martin Luther King wrote about shortly before he was assassinated. In his book Where do we go from here? [4], King advocated for a guaranteed annual income . In short, he proposed that society should fight the evil of poverty through either a guaranteed job, or if a job could not be provided, a base income that would ensure that all Americans could afford to provide the basic necessities. \nKing went further to argue that the elimination of poverty could simultaneously address other societal ills as a result: \n\"...we are likely to find that the problems of housing and education , instead of preceding the elimination of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished. The poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter housing decay. Negroes who have a double disability will have a greater effect on discrimination when they have the additional weapon of cash to use in their struggle. \nBeyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands when he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts among husbands, wives, and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth on the scale of dollars is eliminated.\" \nPoverty affects children in multiple, undesirable ways. It seems that the primary pathway is the effect of being poor on the resources of parents, who encounter behavioral bottlenecks that lessen their capacity to provide the kind of positive parenting that research encourages. Isn't it time to think through the economic injustices which are hurting our children? Our world has decided posthumously that Martin Luther King, Jr. is a prophet who challenged our policies and called us to a better existence. Yet, his economic message has been largely ignored. \nPerhaps it is time to give King's ideas a second thought. There's nothing to lose in thinking about it. References \n[2] Kalil, A. (2017).

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: Subbotina Anna/Shutterstock \nEngaging in just one hour of leisure-time physical activity per week can reduce your risk of future depression , according to a new study\u2014which is the largest and most extensive of its kind to date. This paper, \u201c Exercise and the Prevention of Depression: Results of the HUNT Cohort Study ,\u201d was published online ahead of print October 3 in The American Journal of Psychiatry . \nThe findings of this study suggest that surprisingly small amounts of low-intensity physical activity (60 minutes of exercise per week, without becoming breathless or sweating) can protect against future depression, regardless of age or gender . \nThis international research team was led by the Black Dog Institute in Australia who conducted an in-depth analysis of the Health Study of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County ( HUNT study ) which is one of the largest and most comprehensive population-based health surveys ever undertaken. HUNT involved 33,908 male and female Norwegian adults who had their levels of exercise and symptoms of depression and anxiety monitored over an 11-year period. \nThe latest findings that just 60 minutes of easy exercise per week can act as a prophylaxis against future depression adds to a growing body of evidence that small doses of physical activity can reap huge psychological and physical health benefits. \nFor example, an August 2017 Tufts-led study found that inactive older adults who added just 48 minutes of moderate physical activity per week (in the form of walking-based exercises) significantly lowered their risk for major mobility disability. Additionally, anything above 48 minutes of moderate exercise per week was a tipping point associated with improvements in overall physical functioning when compared to adults who were sedentary. You Can Gain Benefits from Exercise Without Becoming Breathless or Sweating \nAt the beginning of the HUNT study, all participants were asked to report their frequency of weekly exercise and their degree of aerobic intensity : (1) without becoming breathless or sweating, (2) becoming breathless and sweating, or (3) exhausting themselves. \nDuring the follow-up stage of the study, participants completed a self-report questionnaire (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to indicate any emerging anxiety or depression over the years. Notably, the researchers found that people did not have to become breathless, sweaty, or exhaust themselves to reap psychological benefits from exercise. In fact, the authors observed that low levels of aerobic intensity were just as effective as moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in terms of protecting against future depression. \nThe results of this 'exercise and the prevention of depression' study indicate that relatively minuscule increases in the overall amount of time you spend being physically active each week could significantly reduce your risk of future depression. \nAs the authors state in the summary of their study: \u201cAfter adjustment for confounders, the population attributable fraction suggests that, assuming the relationship is causal, 12 percent of future cases of depression could have been prevented if all participants had engaged in at least one hour of physical activity each week.\u201d \nIn a statement, lead author, Samuel Harvey , added: \"We've known for some time that exercise has a role to play in treating symptoms of depression, but this is the first time we have been able to quantify the preventative potential of physical activity in terms of reducing future levels of depression. These findings are exciting because they show that even relatively small amounts of exercise \u2013 from one hour per week \u2013 can deliver significant protection against depression.\u201d \nThe authors conclude: \u201cGiven that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important, it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling. The results presented in this study provide a strong argument in favor of further exploration of exercise as a strategy for the prevention of depression.\u201d References \nHarvey, Samuel B., Simon \u00d8verland, Stephani L.

We all love to eat and we especially crave rich, calorie-packed foods. Knowing that we \u201cshouldn\u2019t\u201d often makes little difference. How often has your willpower collapsed at the sight of a scrumptious chocolate cake? Our drive to eat goes way beyond basic hunger. \nI think I speak for pretty much everyone when I say that if there were a magic pill that would allow me to eat anything I wanted in unlimited quantities and not suffer any weight gain or health risks, I would eat about six gigantic meals a day. And pecan pie. Lots of pecan pie. Source: Stu Spivack/Flickr \nThere is a drive within all of us to eat, eat, and eat some more. What\u2019s worse is that this drive seems pretty well focused on foods that are horrible for us. When was the last time you had an intense, mouth-watering craving for brussels sprouts? At our most basic level, we are built to crave high-fat, high-sugar, and high-protein foods. Sure, many of us grow into an appetite for more healthy foods and learn to shun the empty calories of milkshakes and soda, but if you believe that is the result of anything other than conditioning and training, you are kidding yourself. \nThe next time you see someone smugly sticking their nose up at dessert or claiming to not enjoy fried foods, you can be satisfied knowing that person is either lying or that this attitude is the result of years of painful self-denial and emotional training. If children exhibit a more basic form of human emotions, their appetite for sweets and aversion to vegetables speaks for itself. Source: Jeremy Vandel/Flickr \nGluttony is a feature we share with pretty much all animals. Anyone with dogs or cats knows how they can gorge themselves on treats, meat, and other rich and savory foods. We have to carefully regulate the diets of our companion animals or else they will become overweight very quickly. The same is true for laboratory animals, be them rats, mice, rabbits, fish, monkeys\u2014you name it. \nZoo animals, too. Great care has to be taken to select their diet\u2014not just to include the diversity of food that they need to be healthy, but to regulate their intake so that they do not become morbidly obese. In sum, all animals, including and especially humans, if left to their own devices, will overeat to the point of extreme obesity . Why on earth is that? \nContrast that with the seemingly contradictory fact that you almost never encounter obese animals in the wild. Animals in their \u201cnatural state,\u201d that is, the environment they are adapted to through thousands of years of evolution, are most often trim or even skinny. When we put them in an artificial habitat, they will immediately balloon up if we\u2019re not careful. Why would this be? Could it be that the artificial nature of the simulated environment just isn\u2019t right for them? \nIndeed, it was previously thought that the stress of captivity caused hormonal changes and nervous overeating. It turns out that that doesn\u2019t seem to be the main issue. You might also guess that the lack of proper physical activity and exercise is the culprit. Nope. Plenty of experiments and anecdotal experience have disproven both of those hypotheses. So why do animals stay skinny in the wild but become obese in captivity? \nAn African Wild Dog Source: Charles J. Sharp \nThe answer is a little disturbing. It turns out that animals in the wild are probably living in a near-constant state of starvation and intense hunger. Life on earth is a pretty difficult experience for most animals. Life has been bustling on our planet for at least 3.5 billion years, and the animal kingdom emerged at least six hundred fifty million years ago. That\u2019s ten times longer than the amount of time that has past since the last dinosaur died. During all this time, the proliferation of animals has allowed them to fill virtually every possible niche, where they experience intense competition with each other. \nIn other words, the great majority of animals in the wild live their lives teetering on a knife\u2019s edge between survival and death. There simply isn\u2019t enough food to go around. The fact that all species tend to produce far more offspring than can possibly survive was one of the first key realizations by Charles Darwin, leading him toward his discovery of natural selection. \nWhat does this have to do with gluttony? Well, because animals are locked in a vicious struggle for survival, they are wired for intense hunger; they seek food essentially all the time and will consume every last bit that they can. After all, who knows how long it will be before they get another chance. Only by gorging on food when it is available do animals get the best chance of surviving to the next meal. A lion will eat fifteen pounds of meat in a single sitting; a snake will eat a meal that can nearly equal its own body weight. US President Teddy Roosevelt told a tale of a school of Amazonian piranhas devouring an entire cow in minutes. Source: Jim G/WikiCommons \nHumans are no different. We have a drive inside us to eat at every opportunity. As soon as our stomach empties, we want to eat again. Fruits and vegetables will do if nothing else is available, but we really want the good stuff: high-fat, high-calorie foods. Those are the foods that are most essential for surviving for days and weeks when food may not be available. The problem is that nowadays, food is available to us constantly. Our bodies aren\u2019t built for that. \nSensible eating decisions and disciplined restraint aren\u2019t part of our inborn psychological toolkit. Nowhere in the animal world is willpower or self-denial important for survival. Today\u2019s era of ready access to rich foods is a new experience for Homo sapiens, and there hasn\u2019t been near enough time to expect a change in our biology because of it. \nIt should be noted that it was previously thought that our relatively sedentary twentieth-century lifestyle was mostly to blame for the recent increase in obesity seen in Western populations. The idea was that, in previous generations, much more of the population earned their living through physical toil, and, prior to electronics, most recreation was physical. While these two phenomena do probably play some role, the idea that decreased physical activity is chiefly responsible for the recent obesity epidemic is now falling out of favor. The availability of rich foods and our resulting calorie-rich diet really seem to be the main culprits. Source: Beurret & Bailly/WikiCommons \nFor the masses, it\u2019s only been a couple hundred years that rich food has been this readily available, and that is only in the developed Western world. Before the industrial revolution, only an elite few could eat rich foods every day, and the poor wretches were not much better off than animals in the wild. Indeed, being stout or plump was a sign of aristocracy and privilege until very recently. \nWe are now surrounded and bombarded with high-calorie foods, which goes against millions of years of evolution that have trained us to overeat whenever possible. Overeating was a great strategy when it was only rarely possible anyway, but now we are able to do it every day, multiple times. For most of us, our feeble willpower is simply no match for our physiology. As far as our bodies are concerned, at every meal, we are pounding on the energy storage, as if for a long winter when we may barely eat at all. \nIt\u2019s even worse than that. In addition to a tendency to eat, eat, eat, and choose energy-rich foods, our bodies are also built to adjust our metabolism and fat deposition patterns in order to gain weight easily and lose weight difficultly. Weeks and weeks of dieting and exercise results in negligible weight loss, while a weekend eating binge can pack on a few pounds just like that. \nThis is not an illusion caused by our cynical human tendency to see the glass half empty. Our bodies really do adjust our baseline metabolic rate in order to prevent weight loss and promote weight gain. This is accomplished by ramping down our \u201cextra\u201d uncoupled thermogenic energy expenditure when calories are being restricted and by immediately capturing any surplus calories in our diet and locking them down as fat deposits. Screw you, human body! In fact, most dieticians agree that exercise alone is ineffective for weight loss and can sometimes do more harm than good. It stimulates our appetites in proportion to any calories burned. \nWhy are our bodies so impossible when it comes to weight management ? Once again, it\u2019s because we are built to withstand a life of famine and starvation. For nearly all of our evolutionary history, obesity, heart disease, and weight-related diabetes were essentially nonexistent, so we didn\u2019t evolve many defenses against them. On the other hand, starvation was a daily threat. Everything about our infrastructure for energy metabolism is reflective of that. In fact, that\u2019s exactly why heart disease and obesity are so common now\u2014our metabolisms are poorly adapted for the food climate that we currently live in. The current Western diet is so mismatched to what our bodies were designed to cope with that most of us are \u201cfat, sick, and nearly dead\u201d (the title of a popular documentary on the subject). Source: Cegoh/Pixabay \nJust to end things on a slightly more uplifting note, I should remind everyone that healthy weight management is still possible, even with bodies that are seemingly built to thwart us. Fad or crash diets never work over the long term. Hundreds of studies have proven that. Instead, healthy and sustainable eating styles must be adopted permanently. Opt for more fruits and vegetables, less desserts and meat. More whole and raw foods, less processed and sweetened ones. Cut out the soda, and trade out fruit juice for vegetable juice. Combine high-protein and high-fat foods with high-fiber and low-density foods. In other words, have your steak or hamburger, but keep it small and have veggies or salad as a side instead of fries or potato. Try to eat more slowly and drink plenty of water as you do. Have whole fruits for dessert instead of cake or ice cream. Treat yourself on occasion, but keep it rare and the portions small. Walk and cycle whenever possible, and take the stairs instead of the elevator every day. Throw in some regular cardiac exercise, and you have a recipe for healthy energy management. It\u2019s not always easy, and sacrifices must be made, but most people find that the resulting \u201chigh\u201d of feeling healthy and energetic makes the new life pattern easier to maintain.

To think how many concert-goers were there, just living their life and innocently having a good time in a place known to be relaxing and enjoyable \u2013 only to be forever changed by the actions of a sole shooter, is incomprehensible. For many of us, it is difficult to find the right words to describe how we are feeling, so instead we turn to logic and we find ourselves wanting to find an answer for why this tragedy happened. \nStill, many are in disbelief \u2013 not understanding how something like this can happen (at all, and perhaps even more, again). Situations like this are hard to comprehend and understand. And as much as we try, there\u2019s a good chance that we will never totally understand the why, especially when there is very little way to make sense of the senseless. \nDespite the fact that what happened in Vegas is now the largest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, this tragic event is only amplified by the number of traumatic events that have preceded it. In the wake of the numerous worldwide traumatic events and mass shootings, it is important that you take care of yourself and your family. This article is written to provide information on how to cope during this difficult time. How to Psychologically Process \nDuring this time, it is incredibly helpful to not avoid how you are feeling and what you are thinking. Find others who you can openly speak with, and discuss what is on your mind. Share your fears, your heartache, anger , disgust, etc. Whatever it is, share it. Repressing your innermost thoughts and emotions does not make them disappear, but instead they are likely to intensify. If you have been personally impacted by the shooting, whether you were present at the concert or know someone who was, it is imperative that you allow yourself the time and emotional space to process what has happened. For many in Florida, the Vegas shooting hits too close to home after the Pulse nightclub shooting that took place in 2016. \nThe key to psychologically processing what has happened is to think about it, talk about it, journal about it, etc. Don\u2019t avoid it. How to Help Others \nYou are not alone in your thoughts and feelings about what has happened, and just as you need support, those around you likely do, as well. If you know someone who was present during the attack, or someone whose loved one perhaps passed away or was injured, it is incredibly important to know how to help them through this difficult time. The best thing you can do is to simply listen and be supportive. Don\u2019t minimize their feelings, reactions, or pain. Everything you or they are going through after a tragedy such as this is both completely normal and healthy (and must occur if effective healing is to happen). Being a good friend or family member means being available and listening with empathy. \nLikewise, perhaps you know someone who has been in a similar situation and the Vegas shooting is a strong trigger for them. The Vegas shooting is only likely to bring up disturbing memories , images, nightmares , anger, emotional pain, etc. If this is you, it is important to acknowledge your thoughts and emotions. If this is someone you know, it is important to be there for them by listening with understanding, being supportive, and letting them share anything they are thinking and feeling. Professional Help \nIf you have been personally impacted by the Las Vegas shooting, or still healing from a past traumatic experience, it is imperative that you seek help sooner rather than later. This is not to say that waiting for treatment reduces its efficacy, but you are likely to experience less pain and suffering the sooner that you reach out. There are excellent therapies that can help you to face what has happened in a safe and healthy manner, process it, and heal from it. Seek out the help of a trauma specialist, who has the training and background necessary to help you heal and regain your life after tragedy strikes. How to Help Your Kids \nSome parents may be wondering how to discuss the Las Vegas shooting with their children. This is an important dialogue as many children have questions about what has happened and why. The key to this discussion is to give them the facts, while also providing reassurance. Be honest with your kids about what has happened. Don\u2019t sugarcoat what happened, don\u2019t make light of it, but also explain it in kid terms (i.e., don\u2019t try to talk with them as if they are adults). It is completely acceptable to say you don\u2019t why this happened, and to remind them that while there are people who do bad things, there are far more good people in this world. \nLet your child share their feelings and what is on their mind. Provide a safe and comfortable space for them to share their fears. Don\u2019t tell them their thoughts and feelings are wrong, but instead express understanding and reassure them that many people want a safer world and are working towards that. Reduce (not eliminate) exposure to news or other media sources that can bombard them with video or images of the shooting. If your child(ren) seems to be struggling with this tragedy despite your best efforts, schedule an appointment with a psychologist to get them professional assistance. Statistically Speaking \nGiven the number of mass shootings that have occurred in recent years, it is not uncommon to have the thought \u201cI\u2019m not safe anywhere.\u201d However, it is important to realize that these events are still very unlikely to happen. If you find yourself avoiding going places, you allow these situations to control you and limit your activities. Staying inside your house will certainly more than likely prevent this from happening to you, but it also prevents you from having any quality of life. Living your life in constant fear is not at all living your life. If you find yourself plagued by these thoughts and changes in your behavior, there are effective treatments that are likely to help.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:49:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a00a829771bc8cfb13516efd8d4e5bd211deaea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LtPvGvRVrCesRaa7PVFHgk7JJrahVOafZiCNe5q7UVfZe5vqzLrAZz1X0r_0d9Wze8ejSQWjTq8KWeTlMTimoITaWznWoquwZq830ONppCZuzha6Fqcccb", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/essentials/feed", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today - Essentials", "title": "Why the Emotionally Intelligent May Earn More Money", "title_full": "Why the Emotionally Intelligent May Earn More Money", "published": "2017-10-03T18:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/emotional_intelligence_jerrykimbrell10.jpg?itok=8Y1yXy1v", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5a00a829771bc8cfb13516efd8d4e5bd211deaea", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LtPvGvRVrCesRaa7PVFHgk7JJrahVOafZiCNe5q7UVfZe5vqzLrAZz1X0r_0d9Wze8ejSQWjTq8KWeTlMTimoITaWznWoquwZq830ONppCZuzha6Fqcccb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Susan Krauss Whitbourne Ph.D.", "published": "2017-10-03T18:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why the Emotionally Intelligent May Earn More Money", "text": "Why the Emotionally Intelligent May Earn More Money New research shows whether or not it pays to have a higher EQ. Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \nWhen psychologists first proposed the concept of emotional intelligence and its related measure, EQ, they claimed that this is the type of intelligence that really matters in order to succeed in life. Also referred to by some as \u201cstreet smarts,\u201d or practical intelligence, EQ was conceived of as an alternative to \u201cbook smarts,\" as assessed by standard intelligence tests (IQ). There was some evidence in support of these claims, which in turn became the basis for what amounted to an EQ revolution. IQ was out, and EQ was in. The jury was still out, however, on just how much of a benefit EQ could provide in helping people become materially, if not psychologically, in their life accomplishments. \nAs Miami University of Ohio\u2019s Joseph Rode and colleagues note (2017), \u201cthere are few systematic studies of the relationship between emotional intelligence and career success, despite strong interest in the popular press.\" The studies that do exist focus on short-term outcomes and didn\u2019t produce very promising results to bolster claims of EQ\u2019s career-boosting potential. Recognizing the need to address more systematically and, over the long haul, the possible benefits of EQ, Rode et al. developed a theoretical model that would account over time for a role of EQ in workplace success. In their model, EQ should be related to the ability to build \u201csocial capital\u201d in the form of social support networks. Specifically, people high in EQ should be able to find mentors who would, in turn, train them in relevant job skills. Possessing these skills, the high-EQ workers should be able, then, to achieve the higher job levels that produce higher salaries. \nThe authors used a \u201cmental abilities\u201d framework in which they defined EQ as representing a cross between traditionally-defined intelligence and emotions. People high in EQ can identify, understand, and regulate their emotions in ways that allow them to communicate well with others, think about the problems they face, form relationships, and maintain those relationships over time. Being able to manage your emotions, as you might expect, is a valuable tool in a variety of contexts, but particularly in the workplace. Regardless of where you work or spend time outside the home, you have to deal with \u201c politics .\u201d In the words of the authors, in any organization, workers must \u201ccompete for scarce resources by proactively balancing power relationships and navigating the organization\u2019s social and political environment .\" You might notice this particularly when you join an existing group of people who work in the same office, shop, or department. From figuring out who will give you keys to telephone and IT support, you need to navigate this new environment and learn how to adapt. The more emotionally sensitive and aware you are of the complex relationships in your new site, you\u2019ll fit in better, quicker, and more effectively. \nPeople who are low in EQ, by contrast, make constant pains out of themselves and you\u2019ll do all you can to avoid them. The overbearing boss, the nosy food service worker, or the intrusive receptionist are no fun to be with, and can even make your life extremely unpleasant if they so choose. The people who talk too long , who are rude in meetings, and who seem to enjoy throwing roadblocks in your way, similarly, will hardly make it to the top of your popularity list. \nWith a person high in EQ, furthermore, you\u2019ll go out of your way to be helpful and supportive. Whether it\u2019s taking the time to show where to grab a snack, make a cup of tea, or find the closest restroom, you won\u2019t mind stopping what you\u2019re doing to show someone new the ropes. Thankful , appreciative, and appropriately friendly, this tutee of yours will make you feel good about yourself and what you\u2019re doing. It was this logic that led Rode and his collaborators to propose that EQ has its beneficial effect on salary via the route of mentoring. Because people high in EQ are so aware of their own needs, you'll enjoy helping them, but they will also reach out for help from those who stand to offer them useful advice and support. They\u2019ll know enough of what they don\u2019t know, in other words, to seek out a senior person to give them guidance. Being good at relationships, furthermore, will make them better able to form strong bonds with their mentors. \nImpressively, Rode et al. were able to test their model using a follow-up, or lagged, design in which participants first provided data while they were still in college. They completed the EQ measure in their junior or senior years. The resulting sample consisted of 126 individuals with data spanning the 11 to 13 years between the two testings. \nAs the authors predicted, EQ in college predicted whether participants had obtained a work mentor. Those who had mentors also earned more. Going beyond salary, because EQ should be associated with the ability to handle complex relationships, manage stress , and make better decisions, the authors tested a model in which the EQ effect was combined with job level (low or high). As it turned out, for people in low job levels, EQ had no impact on salary, but those in higher job levels earned more the higher their EQ scores. As the authors observed, EQ is particularly important for individuals as they ascend the managerial ranks when these more advanced skills are required. You may not think that all bosses are that emotionally savvy, but all other things being equal, it does help to have good leadership skills, ability to influence others, and the capacity to tolerate ambiguity. \nBeing high in EQ may not make you rich, of course, but the findings of the Miami University et al. team suggest that it will position you better for a path to advancement. Once on that path, fulfillment may mean having more than a large paycheck, but it is also likely that you\u2019ll derive more emotional pleasure from your relationships and ability to thrive.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: Efraimstochter / Pixabay \n\u201cThe Neanderthals\u2019 extinction has been, according to modern biological anthropologists, greatly exaggerated.\u201d (Geher et al., 2017). While my students and I who comprise the New Paltz Evolutionary Psychology Lab have many projects that we get excited about, few projects across my career have been as exciting as the New Paltz Neanderthal Project. I\u2019m pleased to say that the results of this project have just been published in Human Ethology Bulletin. \nThis study emerged when we had a visit from the world-renowned biological anthropologist, Todd Disotell, who spoke one day in our campus-wide Evolutionary Studies Seminar Series. Todd talked about his research that documented the fact that ancient Ancestrally Modern Humans (Homo Sapiens) had, at multiple locations and times, \u201chybridized\u201d with ancient Neanderthals. This fact is betrayed by patterns found in modern genomic analyses (see Hodgson, 2010). \nWhat\u2019s more, based on the comparison of one\u2019s particular genome with an estimate of the Neanderthal genome based on a conglomeration of DNA found in three different ancestral specimens, we can approximate the percentage of one\u2019s DNA that overlaps with the genome of our ancient cousins. \nThe Neanderthal Quotient (NQ) \nSome personal genome companies, such as 23AndMe, actually provide an index of how much overlap one has with the DNA of the Neanderthals. The average found in the population of those who have had their genomes mapped, according to research cited by 23AndMe , is about 2.5 percent. And this variable tends to be normally distributed\u2014so a good proportion of folks are near the mean and scores that are very much above or below the mean are rare. \nSo pretty much everyone in the world can be assessed in terms of his or her NQ (Neanderthal Quotient). \nReconstructing the Personality of the Ancient Neanderthals \nSo my students and I, inspired by Todd\u2019s presentation and by an \u201caha\u201d moment by my colleague Alice Andrews, designed a study to explore the personality correlates associated with NQ. In short, this study was designed to see if there were some personality dimensions that tended to be associated with very high versus very low NQ scores. \nBased on past anthropological work on the nature of the Neanderthals (e.g., Wynn & Coolidge, 2004), we have some sense of how the Neanderthals behaved. We know that they lived in relatively small groups compared to the groups of Ancestrally Modern Humans (AMHs). We know that they lived mostly with kin and interacted little with non-kin, or strangers. We have reason to believe, based on their tools, that they were not as creative as AMHs. And it seems like they fought with one another a lot, suggesting a generally aggressive and unstable manner. \nPutting it all together, we predicted that it would be difficult to be a Neanderthal in this day and age. Specifically, we predicted that those high in NQ would score as having certain problems in social interactions and that they might be anxious and depressed. In our study, about 200 participants, including adults from around the world who had had their genomes mapped, reported their NQ and then completed a battery of psychological surveys for us to test these predictions. \nResults \nImportantly, this study truly is the first of its kind, and we hardly claim that the methodology is perfect. Our results should be considered a bit preliminary. This said, here are some of the highlights of what we found: \nPeople who scored high in NQ were found to be significantly high on the dimensions of: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "todd disotell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homo sapiens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hodgson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice andrews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "efraimstochter / pixabay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wynn & coolidge", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:05:38.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "957de37ba688460583e31505267ab715af0fd744", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LmngqtTsE8XlanweUQJLDmqunNhKpdhbRwP3RToMHIdnb4IxjyqLw5ZzVc.cf478SI1iaZeomBfQ--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "", "title": "Love in the Workplace?

The 11 things high-quality addiction treatment programs possess. Posted Oct 03, 2017 Source: Kamchatka/Canva \"How do I know if an addiction treatment program is any good?\" \nWe hear this question all the time. While it may seem like a simple and straightforward question to answer, it is actually quite hard. This question is difficult to answer because overall, there is much more research needed to find out exactly how \u201csuccessful\u201d each individual treatment program is at helping their patient populations improve their health and functioning and, ultimately, sustain long-term recovery. \nThe Joint Commission just recently announced that for accreditation beginning in 2018, they will be requiring substance use disorder treatment facilities to begin employing measurement-based practice . This means that for the first time, addiction treatment programs will have to collect data on their performance and relative \u201ceffectiveness.\u201d \nDespite these gaps in research and credible program evaluation data, there are some important empirically-backed indicators that reflect higher quality treatment that will increase the likelihood of a positive response to treatment. \nSo while we await more empirical research, the list below is a great place to start in evaluating which treatment program would be the best treatment provider for you or your loved one. 11 Indicators of Effective Treatment: Source: jdoms/Adobe Stock \n1. Assessment and Treatment Matching \nFinding effective help for an alcohol or other drug disorder starts with reliable and valid screening for the range of substance use disorders and related conditions, as well as physical and mental health conditions. \nOnce detected, more in-depth comprehensive measurements are needed that assess substance use history and related disorders, as well as medical, psychiatric history and individuals\u2019 family and social networks, and available recovery resources (\u201c recovery capital \u201d). These assessments explore the many interrelated factors affecting the patient\u2019s functioning and life and measure the patient\u2019s readiness to change substance use. Careful and comprehensive assessment can help prevent missing or minimizing important aspects of a person\u2019s life, inattention to which, could compromise the chances of recovery. \n2. Comprehensive, Integrated Treatment Approach \nIn addition to substance use disorders patients in treatment may have co-occurring psychiatric disorders, like depression and anxiety, as well as other medical problems like hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, or sexually transmitted diseases. Programs incorporating comprehensive approaches that directly address these additional concerns, or otherwise assertively link patients to needed services, improves the likelihood of substance use disorder remission. \n3. Emphasis and Assertive Linkage to Subsequent Phases of Treatment and Recovery Support \nContinuing care is essential to provide recovery-specific social support and necessary recovery support services after the patient transitions from the initial phase of care. Programs that strongly emphasize this continuing care aspect and that provide assertive linkages (not just passive referral) to community resources, on-going health care providers, peer-support groups, and recovery residences, tend to produce substantially better outcomes. \n4. A Dignified, Respectful, Environment \nThe treatment program should possess at least the same type of quality environment as one might see in other medical environments (e.g., oncology or diabetes care). It does not need to contain chandeliers and oriental rugs, but should be clean, bright, cheerful, and comfortable. Creating a respectful and dignified environment can help addiction patients, in particular, who often feel as if they\u2019ve lost their own self-respect and dignity, regain it. \n5. Significant Other/Family Involvement in Treatment \nEngaging significant others in the person\u2019s life in treatment increases the likelihood that the patient will stay in treatment and that treatment gains will be sustained after treatment has ended. Techniques to clarify family roles, reframe behavior, teach management skills, encourage interventions, and access community services all help strengthen the entire family system and help family members cope with, and adjust to, the family system changes that occur in recovery. \n6. Employ strategies to Help Engage and Retain Patients in Treatment \nDropout from addiction within the first month of care is around 50% nationally. Because those who dropout tend to have worse outcomes, it is vital to employ strategies to enhance engagement and retention. These include creating an atmosphere of mutual trust through clear communication and transparency of program rules, regulations, and expectations. Also, by providing empathic counseling and motivational incentives that reward patients for continued attendance and abstinence/reductions in substance use. \n7. Use Evidence-based and Evidence-informed Practices \nPrograms that deliver services founded on scientific research and principles and that are delivering the available \u201cbest practices\u201d tend to have better outcomes. In addition to psychological interventions, these should include accessibility to FDA approved medications for addiction (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, naltrexone/depot naltrexone, acomprosate ) as well as psychotropic medication for other types of psychiatric conditions (e.g., SSRIs etc.).This is typically combined with qualified staff (see below). \n8. Qualified Staff, Ongoing Staff Training, and Supervision \nHaving multi-disciplinary staff (e.g., addiction, medicine, psychiatry, spirituality ) can help patients uncover and address a broad array of needs that can aid addiction recovery and improve functioning and psychological well-being. Staff with adequate certification/licensing or board certification in these specialty areas are indicators of higher quality programs. Clinical supervision and team meetings should take place at least once or twice a week for outpatient programs and three to five times a week for residential and inpatient programs. \n9. Personalized Approaches that Include Specialized Populations, Gender and Cultural Competence \nStemming from individualized comprehensive screening and assessment, programs should treat all patients as individuals attending to their needs accordingly, recognizing the potentially different needs of men and women and those from different communities (LGBT) or cultural backgrounds. \n10. Measurement of Program Performance Including During-treatment \u201cOutcomes\u201d \nA further indicator of quality treatment is having reliable, valid measurement systems in place to track patients\u2019 response to treatment. Similar to regular assessment of blood pressure at each point of care in the treatment of hypertension, addiction treatment programs should collect \u201caddiction and mental health vital signs\u201d in order to monitor the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the individualized treatment plan and adjust it accordingly when needed. Without any kind of standardized metrics it is difficult to document and demonstrate patients\u2019 progress. \n11. External Accreditation from Nationally Recognized Quality Monitoring Agencies \nAccreditation from external regulatory organizations such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare organizations (JCAHO; aka \u201cthe Joint Commission\u201d), the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), and the Council on Accreditation (COA); and programs which are licensed by the state tend to have higher quality care as they must contain minimal levels of evidence-based care.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:09:50.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c458fe3aa7a14292e380fe80c784d05724c3da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JZfaXM_TI1d42_AGvKfX5BHO7GeMdb_LvlEz0i5hovHPqf7eMZxjlvGyTnVa4Xm6RzVRWblwJhK1d1LxDVUK4S.mUcYLRyThs.XMDXDg7k6EoJznuv4r9VLFmxUA0p4KM-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "", "title": "Sex and Age Implicated in Autism-Related Diagnoses | Psychology Today", "title_full": "Sex and Age Implicated in Autism-Related Diagnoses | Psychology Today", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.191, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/medical-563427_1280.jpg?itok=RcDikaSi", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6c458fe3aa7a14292e380fe80c784d05724c3da4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JZfaXM_TI1d42_AGvKfX5BHO7GeMdb_LvlEz0i5hovHPqf7eMZxjlvGyTnVa4Xm6RzVRWblwJhK1d1LxDVUK4S.mUcYLRyThs.XMDXDg7k6EoJznuv4r9VLFmxUA0p4KM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sex and Age Implicated in Autism-Related Diagnoses | Psychology Today", "text": "Sex and Age Implicated in Autism-Related Diagnoses A neuroscientist demystifies why findings are critical for precise ASD diagnoses Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \nA new study by Stanford neuroscientists found that sex and age are strongly tied to which diagnoses tend to co-occur with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). It is widely known that individuals diagnosed with ASD tend to carry a slew of other diagnoses as well. Much of ASD research tends to be focused on the causes of ASD itself, which alludes scientists to date, but this is not particularly helpful for families and providers who are trying to tease apart if their loved one carries an ASD diagnosis, another medical diagnosis, or something else entirely. \nIn the study, published in the May 2017 volume of Autism Research , the researchers compared data from 4,790 people with Autism Spectrum Disorder and a whopping 1,842,575 without ASD using the Stanford Translational Research Integrated Database Environment (STRIDE), an online database of all cases treated at Stanford University Medical Center from 1995 to the present. It is the largest study to date comparing comorbidities (co-occuring disorders) in ASD and non-ASD populations. Source: DarkoStojanovic/Pixabay \nFindings indicate that epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, central nervous system disorders, and cranial abnormalities tended to occur at surprisingly large frequency in males (over 19% of the male ASD population endorsed), in females (over 15% of the female ASD population endorsed), and in children and adolescents with ASD of both sexes. Although the prevalence of these co-occuring disorders declined people aged, other disorders arose in their place. Older individuals with ASD (defined as over 35 years and above) were found to have increasing diagnoses of schizophrenia . Approximately 25% of adult males with ASD carry a schizophrenia diagnosis while only 7.7% of adult females with ASD also carry a schizophrenia diagnosis. Bowel disorders were also found to co-occur frequently in ASD in childhood and adulthood. \nCarefully examining how the results and implications of this study can assist in making more precise ASD diagnoses and in creating increasingly efficacious treatments for ASD across the lifespan. Kaustubh Supekar, a neuroscientist and the study\u2019s first author, answered several questions in an interview about the implications of these findings. \nSNB: How do you envision this work evaluating sex & age differences in comorbid conditions in ASD will contribute to the development of more precise diagnostic & treatment methods for ASD? \nKS: Diagnosis: More often than not, an individual may present with symptoms that are indicative of ASD, a comorbid condition, both or none. Our study findings provide insights into the likelihood of a condition co-occurring with ASD in a given age-range and gender grouping, and therefore have important implications for such differential diagnosis \nKS: Treatment: Comorbidity patterns reported by our study provide a comprehensive mapping of conditions that are likely to share etiology in males, females, or both, as a function of age. This map has the potential to not only provide better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying ASD but also inform drug repurposing. For example, our findings suggest that antiepileptic drugs could be more effectively administered to individuals with ASD, particularly children and adolescents with the disorder. \nSNB: Why is this work important for diagnosing medical professionals to be aware of? \nKS: Our findings call for a broad range of assessment instruments be made available to clinicians so that they are less likely to miss a diagnosis. For instance, based on our findings, an older male adult (age > 35 y.o.) receiving ASD treatment should also be screened for schizophrenia and the other way around. This would allow for more accurate diagnosis and better treatment. \nSNB: How does this work directly impact families with concerns for their ASD (or suspected ASD) family member? \nKS: The results described in our manuscript have the potential to assist families with ASD to better assess disease complexity and allocation of resources based on the expected comorbidity burden. Additionally, it will enable better disease management with proactive screening and subsequent treatment of highly-probable comorbid conditions. \nIf you are interested in contributing to this type of research, the Stanford Cognitive and Systems Neuroscience Laboratory at Stanford University is recruiting participants between 7 and 12 years old (both typically developing and with ASD or ADHD).

Even if you believe that you\u2019re with the right person, at the right time and for the right reasons, it\u2019s just not possible to be 100 percent sure. By taking a vow to be true to this man or woman that you love , you are taking a big leap of faith . Here are some things to consider before you take that next step. Have you ever thought about what being in love really means? There are millions of interpretations, but the only one that really matters is your own. That means you have to create the vision of what being in love is for you. Most people simply go with their feelings. They think they are in love and follow what is actually only a temporary feeling. It\u2019s important to search your hearts and ask yourself, is this for real? Will this feeling last? If you both believe the answer is yes, then you know. Does being in this relationship bring out the best in you? If the answer is yes, then clearly this experience is positive, and it is only natural to want more of it. You also need to have both the desire and the ability to take care of this person who is making you want to be the best you can be. Letting your partner down over time has a cumulative negative effect on the relationship. If you don\u2019t believe it\u2019s true that half of all relationships fail, look back at your own life. It\u2019s pretty easy to see how things can go south when couples are not truly connected. Finding your soul mate or what some call a \u201csoul connection\u201d is a great goal, but we live in a world that offers us many options. If you believe there is only one person out there for you, you are putting too many limitations on finding relational happiness . Instead, it\u2019s better to put your energy into making the person you are with your soul mate. What you have to realize is that no matter who you are or how you met or what you have, all relationships take work. Love, no matter how true it is, is just not enough. When it comes to divorce , most are filed because of practical reasons, and money issues are number one. The business side of your relationship needs to be discussed before you take that walk down the aisle strewn with rose petals. Remember too that all things change over time. Hopefully your love will survive, but to make that happen, you both have to be willing to grow. You also need to be willing to say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, and I was wrong.\u201d If you dislike saying that, better get over it. If you can\u2019t apologize, you can\u2019t love, because your empathy chip is broken. Learning to love and being willing to grow are paramount to making relationships work. Doing this takes effort, but it\u2019s well worth it. There is nothing better than a great relationship and nothing worse than a bad one. \nTalk about all of this with the one you love. It will help you know one another on a much deeper level, and isn\u2019t that what true love is all about?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:42:03.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9f0458e2e78b7d3d284d7a597ef508e76a5887c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KTALZ4tl1Xy.JdyZM56MbLlE72_1HU0ngf7LCCMVfJkb4nAAPkLgdM.JzSOLVWUtAzawz20Scl1adEqN4thBpAoMgG4t_e09ypTi9z70_RMffcnpLfDRGtdrWuJXQLdxQ-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Pushing Forward by Not Living in Fear After a Violent Attack", "title_full": "Pushing Forward by Not Living in Fear After a Violent Attack", "published": "2017-10-04T00:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/img_8690.jpg?itok=enwwMNuG", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9f0458e2e78b7d3d284d7a597ef508e76a5887c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KTALZ4tl1Xy.JdyZM56MbLlE72_1HU0ngf7LCCMVfJkb4nAAPkLgdM.JzSOLVWUtAzawz20Scl1adEqN4thBpAoMgG4t_e09ypTi9z70_RMffcnpLfDRGtdrWuJXQLdxQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kfuller", "published": "2017-10-04T00:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pushing Forward by Not Living in Fear After a Violent Attack", "text": "Pushing Forward by Not Living in Fear After a Violent Attack The human reaction to fear and stress and how we are resilient in the end. Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: Kristen Fuller \nAs a human race , we are resilient. We can become broken, beaten, pushed, bombed, and shot, yet still manage to survive physically, emotionally, and mentally. The recent atrocious, violent attacks at a concert in Las Vegas , an outside market in Spain , a nightclub in Orlando , and the Boston marathon left the public fearful , threatened, and with endless questions of \u201cwhy?\u201d It is almost hard to keep up with the mass shootings and bombings that have occurred in the past decade around the world. Sandy Hook, 9/11, and Paris will not be forgotten but what about those that that have been forgotten by many, such as when a train bombing in India killed 33 people in 1996 or when over 200 people were killed and 4,000 injured in the Al-Qaeda bombing in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 or the Madrid train bombing that killed nearly 200 people and left over 2,000 injured in 2004. Tens of thousands of people have been injured and killed and many loved ones have suffered the unimaginable due to acts of mass violence. The victims and survivors of these attacks are not the only individuals affected, but so are their family members, loved ones, and the general public who are exposed to the violent and gruesome images broadcasted on news outlets. It seems these attacks are becoming a way of life and although there is constant talk about gun laws, politics , immigration and safety; can these aggressive events actually be prevented? Does it come down to being in the wrong place at the wrong time? Are these massacres more common today than 50 years ago or do we just have better access to news outlets? Many of these questions are hot topics at the dinner table and among politicians, but I think we as a human race need to look at mental illness and how we, as individuals and as communities, are resilient. \nTerrorism and mass violence are types of mass water torture. You don\u2019t know when the next drop will come. This is a variation of psychological and actual war. It is plugged into the most powerful form of our memory , our emotionally related memory, located mainly in the hippocampus, which sits next to and interacts with the amygdala. As studies have shown with Israeli fighter pilots, each encounter results in greater shrinkage of the hippocampus volume. Yes, it is invisible to our eyes, but the stress from fear chips away at our health and longevity. \"We shall overcome\" is a song, but rather, we accommodate to progressive disability, living in fear, emotionally blunted and learning to survive through the sheer torture of our emotional pasts. \nWhen a city is bombed and people are killed, the ripple effect is felt around the world. This psychological effect of terrorism has become a hot topic since 9/11. With the devastating situation currently occurring in Syria and its surrounding countries, as a human race, it is only natural to be fearful. \nThe role of fear \nFear is an emotion that we experience after the brain processes a threatening stimulus through the amygdala and releases stress hormones , a process known as the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response. \nThe amygdala is a small almond-shaped structure located in the brain\u2019s temporal lobe that works to process arousal, emotional stimulation and threatening signs. It works directly with the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for the release of stress hormones such as norepinephrine and cortisol in response to any type of alarming stimuli. These stress hormones allow the body to prepare for escape in such threatening situations. \nFear is the emotional result after this process has begun. When fear becomes prolonged to the point that it consumes an individual\u2019s mind and daily life, it becomes pathological. Although the majority of victims directly affected by terrorist attacks develop a sense of fear, many are able to cope and move on, whereas a few develop sufficient symptoms to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder . Source: Kristen Fuller \nAcute Stress Disorder \nAcute stress disorder is a constellation of at least nine symptoms from different categories\u2014including intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, arousal, and avoidance\u2014which occur at least for three days and last up to one month after an individual experiences a traumatic event, such as physical violence or a terror attack, or learns that these traumatic events occurred to a loved one. These events must affect an individual to the extent that they cause impairment in at least one area of functioning, such as social or occupational capacities. \nAcute stress disorder is different from PTSD in that it only lasts up to one month, whereas PTSD is diagnosed after having a month of symptoms that include the persistent re-experiencing of the traumatic events with flashbacks and/or nightmares . Source: Kristen Fuller \nResilience Wins \nResearch reveals that, even though acute stress disorder and PTSD do occur for some individuals after a terrorist attack, humans are in fact resilient. As a result, even though terrorist attacks are living nightmares for those who experience them, survivors do move on with their lives. \nAfter witnessing horrific carnage firsthand, including seeing body parts and finding he was covered with blood that wasn\u2019t his own, this 9/11 survivor tells the horrific experiences he lived through when he barely made it out of 1 World Trade Center alive on that infamous day. His riveting story was first published in the January 2002 issue of Esquire. What\u2019s surprising about his story is his resilient human spirit, as told to Cal Fussman in this excerpt: \n\u201cWhen we got back to my place, I collapsed and it all hit me. I cried like I\u2019ve never cried in my life. I finally let loose, and it felt better. My brother helped me pack, and we got to Westchester, where my wife and family had gone.\u2026My mother was there. My dad. My father-in-law. They all hugged me. Then they gave me my son.\u2026I hugged him and sort of started the healing process there. Later, I went to Maine to sit by the ocean for a few days and get my head together. I saw all of my old friends. It was amazing. Everyone I know in my life has called me to tell me they love me. It\u2019s like having your funeral without having to die.\u201d Source: Kristen Fuller \nAlso surprising is that the majority of individuals affected by terrorist attacks are able to overcome fear and the negative connotations associated with these acts of violence. Research even shows that individuals come together as a community to form a stronger bond after a terrorist attack occurs. This can be seen by communities holding a memorial or vigil, or the global reaction to the bombing in Paris when millions of Facebook users changed their profile picture to include the French flag or \u201cPray For Vegas\u201d. These attacks can bolster a sense of closer ties within neighborhoods, cities, states, countries, and even globally, demonstrating that the human race is indeed resilient. \n\u201cIn some respects the evidence is surprisingly optimistic . Even in the wake of catastrophic attacks such as 9/11, American society overall displayed a quick recovery. In the days immediately after the attacks, stress reactions and anxiety were very common, but these symptoms did not persist; they quickly returned to pre-9/11 levels for most. Psychologists found that the American public tended to be remarkably resilient in dealing with terrorism and this has also been the finding in regions which experience terrorist attacks on a frequent and widespread basis,\u201d according to an article in the American Academy of Experts in Traumatic Stress. \nWe live in a terrifying world, but in one that has multiple silver linings. Sometimes it is difficult to work through the fear, but it is important to do the best we can, to come together as a community, to express gratitude for the positive things and to look for the silver linings in situations, even in terrorist attacks. After all, history has shown that human resilience wins over terror.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: Google Images \nMy father died last month at the age of 88\u2014not a tragedy, as it was a life well-lived, and one that was blessedly free of significant health concerns for almost all of those 88 years, right up until his passing. But it is a profound loss for me, nonetheless. \nAs I stumble through the territory of grief and attempt to make sense of his departure, I have found myself thinking about many things. But one theme in particular continues to insist on my consideration\u2014freedom, the entity that all children desperately yearn for and that all parents steadfastly stand in the way of. \nMy father was a formidable man, made all the more formidable by the complicated conglomerate of contradictions that comprised him. As a child, it seemed to me that he was the strongest, most capable man that I could imagine. As I grew up, he at times appeared to be the most anxious, insecure man I had ever met. Like most of us, of course, he resided somewhere in between the extremes conceived of by the people who knew and loved him. \nNevertheless, he dealt with his vulnerabilities in the way that most of us who inhabit the male gender seem to deal with our vulnerabilities\u2014by making believe that he didn\u2019t have any vulnerabilities. \nLike many children in the years prior to adolescence , I did not experience any significant inconsistency between realizing that I needed my family and realizing that I would also one day need to be free of them. But when adolescence arrived on its chariot of smoldering discontent and stormy defiance, and the time came to liberate myself and become my own person, I was stymied in the way that many young men are\u2014who, exactly, was I attempting to liberate myself from? And what did it mean to be free? We often believe that freedom will be found in the successful struggle to be the opposite of our parents\u2014particularly our same- sex parents\u2014and yet development is unavoidably circuitous, and we will all at times find ourselves back where we began, behaving exactly like the forebears whom we vowed to differentiate so completely from. \nWith this in mind, it is no wonder that one of my most vivid memories as a teenager is sitting in my room and listening to the song \u201cLike a Rolling Stone\u201d over and over again. The question that Bob Dylan asked\u2014\u201cHow does it feel? How does it feel ? To be on your own\u2026\u201d was the question that defined my own young adult years, and of course the young adult years of countless others. How does it feel to be on your own? Bob Dylan is our Nobel Laureate for many reasons, but one is because he knew enough not to try to answer that question. How does it feel? It feels like everything\u2026 \nAs a teenager, freedom is delicious\u2014we long for it, hunger for it, thirst for it, fight for it. But freedom is not only delicious, it is dangerous, too. Because with freedom comes responsibility. As political historians constantly remind us, \u201cEternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\u201d \nAnd you can\u2019t achieve freedom without leaving something behind, and without, in some ways, being left behind. Liberation does not occur without pain, without loss. While it is surely better to be free than to be enslaved, freedom unavoidably creates its own challenges and, sometimes, its own prisons. \nThe reality is that I am now freed of my father, just as my children will one day be freed of me. But the problem with this reality is that I don\u2019t want to be free of my father\u2014I want him back. And I cannot have him back. I don\u2019t know where his soul went, but I do know that my heart is empty without him here, even though it is still full with all that he gave me. \nSons sometimes delude themselves into believing that they will finally be free\u2014that they will only be free\u2014once their father has died. And there is a certain emancipation embedded in the death of a parent\u2014indeed, in the death of anyone who has influenced us, in ways that may be good, bad or (as is usually the case) mixed. But at other times a dead parent can exert a hold on a child\u2014even an adult child\u2014that is far stronger than the chains that bound them when both were alive. \nThe maturing young adult rightfully needs to pursue freedom when it comes to his relationship with his parents, but, perhaps just as importantly, he also needs to pursue understanding , because the enterprise of understanding our parents ultimately leads us to understand ourselves. And it is understanding ourselves that most effectively frees us, that liberates us to explore the mysterious nature of our own being, where its true depth, character, and essence reside. \nFreedom is not a simple matter of releasing ourselves from the shackles of restrictive relationships, but of gazing with clarity and compassion upon the nature of those shackles, and allowing them to soften over time under our firm, gentle, interested gaze. Ultimately, we find freedom inside of us, or not at all. \nWhether my father would agree with all of this, I do not know\u2026and now I will never know. But I am going to choose to assume that he approves from afar. Because while I may never find the full truth that explains exactly who my father was, I know that I am free to try. And perhaps that is the greatest, most enduring gift that he imparted, the freedom to pursue freedom, and, through so doing, to return home to who I am, and to simultaneously and ceaselessly depart from that home in search of who I still may be able to become.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:42:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "844b9fca0075907e45c9b1031fe29727414686b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4K_n0Q9acF28la_nNToLRtutXHg_2TEq.S3dMkXKl70DdCeYvUWieMNfEj5CjiR40X98h4agJsi3ss6zouqkb_Vd7sbmXPbqr6EW2DmxlgW9EABK.7_6jVo", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "An Open Letter to Therapists About Your Divorcing Clients", "title_full": "An Open Letter to Therapists About Your Divorcing Clients", "published": "2017-10-03T23:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/abc_conversation_100714_mn.jpg?itok=BMoBBbwi", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "844b9fca0075907e45c9b1031fe29727414686b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4K_n0Q9acF28la_nNToLRtutXHg_2TEq.S3dMkXKl70DdCeYvUWieMNfEj5CjiR40X98h4agJsi3ss6zouqkb_Vd7sbmXPbqr6EW2DmxlgW9EABK.7_6jVo", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "spease", "published": "2017-10-03T23:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "An Open Letter to Therapists About Your Divorcing Clients", "text": "An Open Letter to Therapists About Your Divorcing Clients Do you really know about divorce, or are you learning on the job? Posted Oct 03, 2017 \nDear Mainstream Therapist, \nJanuary is just around the corner. Are you prepared? \nIf you\u2019re like me, you get an onslaught of new referrals after the New Year. Many of these new referrals are men and women who come to see me want out of their marriages. They\u2019ve held out to get through the holidays and now they are ready to have a new lease on life\u2014unhitched. \nFamily Law attorneys experience the same phenomenon. According to one lawyer, there\u2019s approximately a 30 percent increase in the volume of calls in January compared to other times of the year. The first business day in January has actually been dubbed \" Divorce Monday,\" and January overall is known as, \"Divorce Month.\" \nAt the risk of putting you off like a major department store putting holiday decorations out after Labor Day, I am writing this article because I want you to be ready for the post-holiday boom\u2014not just emotionally (our work can be draining sometimes), but intellectually as well. \nSo, I ask you: What do you know about divorce? How do you know it? Is it from your own personal experience, have you learned about it through your clients, or did you take a class? If you took a class, what class did you take? Other than the ones I teach, I know of NO classes on the subject. Whenever I teach a class or give a talk, I ask for a raise of hands of anyone who has taken a divorce education course and, so far, not one hand has gone up. \nWe therapists go through our four years or so of undergrad Psychology (or some social science degree program) and all of our graduate schooling without one class on divorce. How can that be??? \nDivorce is one of the most dysregulating life events our clients will face and we get ZERO education about it? \nI\u2019m no different than you. When I set out to work with the divorcing population, I wasn\u2019t even married yet, never mind experienced with divorce. Fortunately for me (said a little facetiously), I was a child of divorce so I could draw on that experience but, other than that, I was as green as they come. \nI\u2019m happy to say that, 17 years later, I have a hefty list of books and resources that I can share with my clients. I\u2019ve run dozens of groups and programs through the years. I also have a really good sense of what clients need most as they navigate the legal and emotional morass. \nMy clients come in scared out of their minds and many\u2014if not all\u2014have some level of trauma either going into it or coming out of their dissolution. \nAs my friend and colleague, Mark Ressa , says, \u201cdivorce is like throwing a hand grenade into a couple\u2019s life, blowing apart their home and family, their finances and their social lives.\" Sometimes work is impacted, too. In fact, there\u2019s almost no area of a person\u2019s life that isn\u2019t impacted to some degree. \nOthers I know have likened divorce to an earthquake. Either way, divorce is a destructive process that may take years to recover from. On top of that, these poor people have to pay mightily for the experience! And, often, the less they know, the more they pay. \nClients Who Know More Do Better and Spend Less. \nTherapists can play a key role in helping clients feel supported and get educated. Unlike attorneys, who are often biased about what divorce modality they want their clients to use, we therapists have a unique vantage point: We have no agenda whether they go through mediation, collaborative or litigation or what attorney they use. What we look at is how clients handle their emotions. We look at how our clients\u2019 experience of divorce is impacting them and their kids. We look at the level of fallout that is happening and much of our job is to help them clean it up. \nSo, again, I ask, how much can you provide your clients when it comes to resources, information, and support? Do you know what kind of attorney is best for your client (bulldog vs. hand-holder, or collaborative vs. mediator, for example)? Do you have good books to recommend or lend your clients? Do you run a divorce support group to help your clients feel less alone and isolated? \nIf you answered \u201c no \u201d to any of these questions, I urge you to change that, or refer your clients to another therapist who does know more on the topic. \nI\u2019ve actually seen secondary trauma perpetrated on clients by therapists who didn\u2019t know how to help. Don\u2019t be one of those clinicians! \nIf you\u2019re a therapist who is interested in learning how to treat divorcing clients, I\u2019m happy to send you a Suggested Reading list that I give to my clients. I\u2019m happy to help you put together a list of what resources you will need. I\u2019m also happy to include you in any trainings I conduct. Contact me at http://changingmarriage.com . \nPlease understand that divorce is not just a \u201ctough time\u201d that clients must endure. It is a pivotal and sometimes devastating passage. \nI believe you have a responsibility to be as fortified with knowledge as you can be. \nSincerely,", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark ressa", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:42:06.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86d7204875dc3b757834acabd57ef81d3b2872c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3TRm1To_IFC5N7bjclgVzLozrI1mQSGIogEr4iYMwB8HVltSKGYjBRWOhr65sjYNNeMM7DyzpbtgcbivyQF_ZeaVyHbw3Ea0IuW1y9iLA2Z.", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "The Second Most Exciting Method to Help You Get Pregnant", "title_full": "The Second Most Exciting Method to Help You Get Pregnant", "published": "2017-10-03T23:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_images/2017-10/istock-512884778.jpg?itok=5DjMUDAt", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86d7204875dc3b757834acabd57ef81d3b2872c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3TRm1To_IFC5N7bjclgVzLozrI1mQSGIogEr4iYMwB8HVltSKGYjBRWOhr65sjYNNeMM7DyzpbtgcbivyQF_ZeaVyHbw3Ea0IuW1y9iLA2Z.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jnosta", "published": "2017-10-03T23:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Second Most Exciting Method to Help You Get Pregnant", "text": "The Second Most Exciting Method to Help You Get Pregnant Let's face it, the technology around conception isn't very stimulating. Posted Oct 03, 2017 Source: EarlySense \nAre you trying to get pregnant? Science is here to help. \nBut sometimes, science, like a cold and impersonal exam room, can leave you and your partner less-than-inspired. The tools of the fertility trade\u2014thermometers, ovulation detectors, grids, and graphs\u2014certainly offer science, but also offer a level of intrusion that can be counter-productive. Further, information served up as time-sensitive imperatives can drive anxiety and frustration. \nOne of the central promises of advances in technology and health is the shift from active data acquisition and engagement to a more passive style. Technology essentially disappears and lets you live life on your terms. And that can mean anything from exercise to making a baby. Essentially, this is the promise of digital health. Existing technologies and methods rely on \"human technology\" to engage and track. And often times, it's the human component that fails. \nAvailable today, a new approach to fertility is quietly finding its way into the bedroom. Percept , by EarlySense is a sophisticated sensing device that is placed under your mattress and tracks heart rate and breathing to identify ovulation and the optimal window for conception. It]s high science meets optimal convenience. It's uncertain if Percept's more passive data acquisition will be met with consumer approval. In some instances, clinicians and consumers look to have more active engagement to validate a clinical endpoint. Nevertheless, placing a simple sensor under your mattress and following information on your smartphone carries the stamp of logic. From big data to continuous data monitoring, this digital advance is another example of how science is extending into the hand of the consumer. Percept\u2019s multi-parameter and advanced AI algorithm analysis detects the body's internal signals, providing an accurate prediction and detection of ovulation as well as prediction of menses. Percept predicts when a woman is most fertile with 31 percent higher accuracy than standard ovulation estimation processes, and predicts the exact day of ovulation in over 60 percent of cycles within one day, and within two days of ovulation in over 75 percent of cycles. While temperature taking or urine tests provide one data reading, Percept functions during sleep when the body is perfectly at rest, gathering over 50,000 readings over the course of the night. \nToday, we live in a world where technology empowers the consumer. EarlySense puts that powerful data into the palm of your hand without obtrusive sensors.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: Pixabay/NDE \nSelling yourself isn't easy. And that's especially the case at the beginning of your career when you don't even know if you believe your own sales pitch. Many young people stepping into the job market for the first time feel very uncomfortable selling themselves. It can feel really awkward speaking positively about yourself\u2014as if you're pitching a product. But if you're looking for a job\u2026or a promotion\u2026or funding for your start-up, it's essential to find a way past the fear . \nHere are thee tips to make selling yourself just a little more palatable: \n1. Realize you're helping solve a problem. \nCompanies hire for a reason: Because they have a real need. Their social media is broken and they desperately need someone to fix it. Their financials have been mismanaged and they need someone to clean it up. They need a new crop of junior colleagues to reach their ideal scale. So, you're not imposing by selling yourself; you're actually helping a company fill a real need. \n2. Think fit, not flaws. \nYou might not get every position you aspire to. In fact, I guarantee that will be the case. But that's O.K. because you're looking for the right fit between the skills you possess and the problem the organization is looking to solve. So, think fit, not flaws, when you assess opportunities\u2014and, especially, when you need to cope with inevitable rejection. \n3. \"Failure\" is data. \nOf course, it's only human to feel disappointed, but try to think self-improvement instead of self-pity. What can you do next time to make an even better impression? How can you even better position yourself to address the needs of the employer and secure that job? \nIn the end, selling isn't a favorite activity for many of us. But by having a positive attitude and keeping these tips in mind, you'll be in a solid position to step outside your comfort zone and set yourself up for success.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:42:08.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "207e7c253c0d430113f953e1050fcbe0cfef6416", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JMuCiQGwN_wHdXFZPMdYDnFXRft1lMU2deq.XPOyoeYTHsLILhJYr.OP2mgv3AVnWwM4dUJc0KpUGkc5cCPgKY8inRGJvBvC_jDTulGfYazA--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "What Makes an Addiction Treatment Program Good?", "title_full": "What Makes an Addiction Treatment Program Good?", "published": "2017-10-03T21:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/drug_rehab_1.png?itok=eZ1BdI5O", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "207e7c253c0d430113f953e1050fcbe0cfef6416", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JMuCiQGwN_wHdXFZPMdYDnFXRft1lMU2deq.XPOyoeYTHsLILhJYr.OP2mgv3AVnWwM4dUJc0KpUGkc5cCPgKY8inRGJvBvC_jDTulGfYazA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jkelly", "published": "2017-10-03T21:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Makes an Addiction Treatment Program Good?", "text": "What Makes an Addiction Treatment Program Good? The 11 indicators of a high-quality addiction treatment program. Posted Oct 03, 2017 Source: Kamchatka/Canva \"How do I know if an addiction treatment program is any good?\" \nWe hear this question all the time. While it may seem like a simple and straightforward question to answer, it is actually quite hard. This question is difficult to answer because overall, there is much more research needed to find out exactly how \u201csuccessful\u201d each individual treatment program is at helping their patient populations improve their health and functioning and, ultimately, sustain long-term recovery. \nThe Joint Commission just recently announced that for accreditation beginning in 2018, they will be requiring substance use disorder treatment facilities to begin employing measurement-based practice . This means that for the first time, addiction treatment programs will have to collect data on their performance and relative \u201ceffectiveness.\u201d \nDespite these gaps in research and credible program evaluation data, there are some important empirically-backed indicators that reflect higher quality treatment that will increase the likelihood of a positive response to treatment. \nSo while we await more empirical research, the list below is a great place to start in evaluating which treatment program would be the best treatment provider for you or your loved one. 11 Indicators of Effective Treatment: Source: jdoms/Adobe Stock \n1. Assessment and Treatment Matching \nFinding effective help for an alcohol or other drug disorder starts with reliable and valid screening for the range of substance use disorders and related conditions, as well as physical and mental health conditions. \nOnce detected, more in-depth comprehensive measurements are needed that assess substance use history and related disorders, as well as medical, psychiatric history and individuals\u2019 family and social networks, and available recovery resources (\u201c recovery capital \u201d). These assessments explore the many interrelated factors affecting the patient\u2019s functioning and life and measure the patient\u2019s readiness to change substance use. Careful and comprehensive assessment can help prevent missing or minimizing important aspects of a person\u2019s life, inattention to which, could compromise the chances of recovery. \n2. Comprehensive, Integrated Treatment Approach \nIn addition to substance use disorders patients in treatment may have co-occurring psychiatric disorders, like depression and anxiety, as well as other medical problems like hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease, or sexually transmitted diseases. Programs incorporating comprehensive approaches that directly address these additional concerns, or otherwise assertively link patients to needed services, improves the likelihood of substance use disorder remission. \n3. Emphasis and Assertive Linkage to Subsequent Phases of Treatment and Recovery Support \nContinuing care is essential to provide recovery-specific social support and necessary recovery support services after the patient transitions from the initial phase of care. Programs that strongly emphasize this continuing care aspect and that provide assertive linkages (not just passive referral) to community resources, on-going health care providers, peer-support groups, and recovery residences, tend to produce substantially better outcomes. \n4. A Dignified, Respectful, Environment \nThe treatment program should possess at least the same type of quality environment as one might see in other medical environments (e.g., oncology or diabetes care). It does not need to contain chandeliers and oriental rugs, but should be clean, bright, cheerful, and comfortable. Creating a respectful and dignified environment can help addiction patients, in particular, who often feel as if they\u2019ve lost their own self-respect and dignity, regain it. \n5. Significant Other/Family Involvement in Treatment \nEngaging significant others in the person\u2019s life in treatment increases the likelihood that the patient will stay in treatment and that treatment gains will be sustained after treatment has ended. Techniques to clarify family roles, reframe behavior, teach management skills, encourage interventions, and access community services all help strengthen the entire family system and help family members cope with, and adjust to, the family system changes that occur in recovery. \n6. Employ strategies to Help Engage and Retain Patients in Treatment \nDropout from addiction within the first month of care is around 50% nationally. Because those who dropout tend to have worse outcomes, it is vital to employ strategies to enhance engagement and retention. These include creating an atmosphere of mutual trust through clear communication and transparency of program rules, regulations, and expectations. Also, by providing empathic counseling and motivational incentives that reward patients for continued attendance and abstinence/reductions in substance use. \n7. Use Evidence-based and Evidence-informed Practices \nPrograms that deliver services founded on scientific research and principles and that are delivering the available \u201cbest practices\u201d tend to have better outcomes. In addition to psychological interventions, these should include accessibility to FDA approved medications for addiction (e.g., buprenorphine/naloxone, methadone, naltrexone/depot naltrexone, acomprosate ) as well as psychotropic medication for other types of psychiatric conditions (e.g., SSRIs etc.).This is typically combined with qualified staff (see below). \n8. Qualified Staff, Ongoing Staff Training, and Supervision \nHaving multi-disciplinary staff (e.g., addiction, medicine, psychiatry, spirituality ) can help patients uncover and address a broad array of needs that can aid addiction recovery and improve functioning and psychological well-being. Staff with adequate certification/licensing or board certification in these specialty areas are indicators of higher quality programs. Clinical supervision and team meetings should take place at least once or twice a week for outpatient programs and three to five times a week for residential and inpatient programs. \n9. Personalized Approaches that Include Specialized Populations, Gender and Cultural Competence \nStemming from individualized comprehensive screening and assessment, programs should treat all patients as individuals attending to their needs accordingly, recognizing the potentially different needs of men and women and those from different communities (LGBT) or cultural backgrounds. \n10. Measurement of Program Performance Including During-treatment \u201cOutcomes\u201d \nA further indicator of quality treatment is having reliable, valid measurement systems in place to track patients\u2019 response to treatment. Similar to regular assessment of blood pressure at each point of care in the treatment of hypertension, addiction treatment programs should collect \u201caddiction and mental health vital signs\u201d in order to monitor the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of the individualized treatment plan and adjust it accordingly when needed. Without any kind of standardized metrics it is difficult to document and demonstrate patients\u2019 progress. \n11. External Accreditation from Nationally Recognized Quality Monitoring Agencies \nAccreditation from external regulatory organizations such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare organizations (JCAHO; aka \u201cthe Joint Commission\u201d), the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF), and the Council on Accreditation (COA); and programs which are licensed by the state tend to have higher quality care as they must contain minimal levels of evidence-based care.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission on accreditation of rehabilitation facilities", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jcaho", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:42:09.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "579641f35f035063234b8c26b6775040240a290d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4J0gl9rqlAae5MHEKRU.LKQOWT.TYD57GI3NBFfu13f3U6xMfV55biDh9ZwYyD1fZZxtCUvJl1lTqykzj9gG.KW", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Don't Let a Loved One Steal Your Joy", "title_full": "Don't Let a Loved One Steal Your Joy", "published": "2017-10-03T21:13:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "579641f35f035063234b8c26b6775040240a290d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4J0gl9rqlAae5MHEKRU.LKQOWT.TYD57GI3NBFfu13f3U6xMfV55biDh9ZwYyD1fZZxtCUvJl1lTqykzj9gG.KW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "fsimone", "published": "2017-10-03T21:13:00.000+03:00", "title": "Don't Let a Loved One Steal Your Joy", "text": "Don't Let a Loved One Steal Your Joy Try something different. Choose to change. Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \n\u201cYou didn\u2019t cause it, you can\u2019t control it and you can\u2019t cure it.\u201d When I first heard that sentence at a loved one\u2019s meeting, I felt relieved. I didn\u2019t have to blame myself for my son\u2019s addiction ; I didn\u2019t have to try to fix him, and I didn\u2019t have to restore his health (only he could do that). I won\u2019t pretend that it\u2019s been easy to put these three C's into practice. Even after many years in my own recovery program, I backtrack, especially when it comes to control. But, these days, I berate myself less and focus more on progress, not perfection. Faced with the complexity of the disease of addiction, family and friends often falter in their determination to detach, to stop managing, and to mind their own business. Easier said than done. \nChange \nOne way to free ourselves from the burden of a loved one\u2019s addition is to consider two additional Cs: Change and choice. Change occurs when we recognize that our lives had become unmanageable and decide to break the chains of co-dependency. It occurs when we take that first step and attend a loved one\u2019s group , meet with a therapist, and educate ourselves about the disease of addiction and its effect on family and friends . It occurs when we learn how to let go of control, how to stop arguing, manipulating, and nagging, how to set and keep boundaries, and how to take care of ourselves. Change involves making healthy choices to help us better manage this family disease. \nChoice Source: Daniel Lobo/Flickr \nAt a loved one\u2019s meeting, the mother of three teenagers shared that she had expected her ex-husband to remain in town after their recent divorce . However, he decided to leave. As a result, she was faced with the sole responsibility of parenting . She worked two jobs and ran herself ragged chauffeuring the kids to soccer games and other after-school activities. She broke down and cried. Clearly, she was exhausted. \nA few weeks later her attitude changed. \u201cI realized that I had a choice. I could either accept what is or stew over what isn\u2019t. Most likely, my ex isn\u2019t going to change. He\u2019s out of the picture. Maybe permanently. So I have to step up and take care of myself and my kids. I have a choice: Either accept my situation and deal with it or wallow in resentment and anger . I refuse to let him rob me of my joy.\u201d \nThis reminded me of another bit of wisdom I heard at a meeting: \u201cNo expectation, no resentment.\u201d When faced with the disease of addiction, it\u2019s easy to fall into the \u201cpoor me, ain't it awful\u201d trap. \u201cMy life didn\u2019t turn out like it was supposed to.\u201d This thinking leads to the envy of other families who presumably have it a whole lot better than us (and yes, some do) and self-pity which eats away at our self-esteem . It doesn\u2019t endear us to others either.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \nFear can be adaptive, as noticing and avoiding potential dangers in the environment has obvious survival benefits. Yet, for some people, excessive fear and hyper-vigilance for threats can interfere with adaptive functioning, even developing into an anxiety disorder. Emerging research on children who were exposed to deprivation, neglect , or abuse has begun to reveal how early experience shapes the developmental trajectory of the brain \u2019s systems for responding to dangers. While it has long been known that attention to possible threats is sharpened by early trauma\u2014for example , children who experienced physical abuse are faster to detect angry faces in a visual attention task\u2014recent research has helped to illuminate the biological mechanisms of these changes in vigilance. The research findings have raised intriguing questions about whether such patterns should be considered adaptive or maladaptive. Source: Pixabay \nThe stress acceleration hypothesis posits that in children exposed to early trauma, the brain\u2019s threat systems develop at an accelerated pace, potentially at the expense of other developing brain systems. For example, one study examined brain activity during a fear learning task among 89 children who had spent part of their early years in an orphanage and compared them to age-matched children who were never institutionalized. In response to a fear-evoking stimulus, both groups showed increased activity in the amygdala, a small almond-shaped brain structure well-known to respond to dangers. The groups differed, though, in the extent to which other brain regions were activated together with the amygdala in response to signals of danger. For the previously institutionalized children, the amygdala was activated together with the hippocampus, a structure critical in learning and memory , and subregions of the medial frontal lobe, which are thought to help regulate emotions. Interestingly, this broad activation of brain regions in response to threats better matched the typical adult pattern rather than the age-appropriate pattern for typically developing children. The findings, therefore, support the idea that the development of the brain\u2019s threat-response system is accelerated after early-life stress . \nAdditional findings from the same research group have identified a role for stress hormones in these developmental effects. In this study , levels of the stress hormone cortisol partly explained the adult-like pattern of connectivity (co-activation) between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex in response to threats in previously institutionalized children. These children had stronger cortisol release in response to the brain-scanning experiment, compared to the never-institutionalized control group of children. This increased cortisol release statistically explained part of the precocious pattern of brain activation to threatening information in the deprived children. Thus, alterations in the activation of stress hormones following trauma or neglect may be partly responsible for differences in the pattern of brain maturation. (For a fuller discussion of the role of cortisol in early-life stress and deprivation, see here .) \nA key question is whether these developmental differences in early-stressed children\u2019s brains are best interpreted as pathological changes that put them at risk for emotional problems, or whether they should be considered instead as protective, adaptive changes in response to a more dangerous early-life environment. Although children who are exposed to trauma early in life are known to have increased risk of developing anxiety disorders, it may not be these brain mechanisms in particular that account for that increased risk. On this question, findings seem to conflict. One study found that stronger amygdala reactions to pictures of threatening faces predicted higher anxiety symptoms among children who experienced early neglect, but not among typically developing children. This seems to fit with the idea that increased reactivity of this brain region is maladaptive. Yet, other studies suggest that more adult-like connectivity between brain regions during fear learning may actually be protective. Previously institutionalized children who showed such increased connectivity patterns reported less anxiety two years later than those who did not show the patterns. One possibility, then, is that the more adult-like pattern of engaging frontal lobe regions during fear learning reflects an adaptive strategy, perhaps an attempt to regulate lower-level fear systems that are overactive. \nA better understanding of these brain differences in the future may lead to a fuller appreciation of both the direct consequences of early trauma and the biological mechanisms of resilience that help children cope with both typical and adverse environmental conditions. Future research should also focus on better understanding the varied effects of different kinds of early stressors, such as physical abuse, poverty, and parental deprivation, which may have varied intensities and time-courses. In the meantime, there is no doubt that early traumatic experiences leave their mark on brain development. References \nCallaghan, B. L., & Tottenham, N. (2016).

Thus I do not purport to have insights into this specific killer. \nWhat I do know is that in 47 years of evaluating and treating offenders, an \u201cout of character\u201d crime does not exist. We hear it again and again that a perpetrator of a terrible crime had no criminal record, that he was a \u201cnice guy,\u201d that he didn\u2019t cause trouble in his community, that he was employed, and so forth. So the initial appearance is that he must have \u201csnapped\u201d (whatever that means), or for some other reason was driven to engage in behavior that was completely alien to his character. \nA house cannot fly. It is not within its character. A skyscraper cannot swim. It is not within its character. However, when a human being appears to have done something out of character, if we are patient enough and the investigation is sufficiently thorough, a context for the crime eventually comes to light. \nEven people who think they know the perpetrator well are often at a loss when it comes to explaining what he has done. In the case of the Las Vegas shooter, we have already learned that he amassed a large number of weapons and bomb making materials over time. Clearly, the shooting was a planned act . We are hearing about his immersion in the world of high stakes gambling. We also know that he committed the crime when his girlfriend was out of the country, making her unavailable to interfere with what he was doing. She is still abroad and, it is likely, that more information will come to light once she returns and if she speaks candidly. \nPersonalities reveal themselves over time and, eventually, we discover what the context is with respect to the crime at issue. Rarely, if ever, is it a case of a \u201cgood guy\u201d suddenly gone bad. Undoubtedly, as the investigation proceeds, more information will come to light revealing now unknown aspects of the Las Vegas shooter\u2019s personality and motives.

The balance between two hormones may account for why some dogs are aggressive. Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: Steve Garner photo - Creative Content License \nYou are peacefully walking your dog on a leash when you encounter someone else coming toward you also walking a dog on a leash. Suddenly, that other dog begins to bark, growl, and lunge at your dog, who has not acted in a threatening manner or shown any aggressive signals. The dog you have encountered is showing something that behaviorists often referred to as \"leash aggression\". Recently, researchers have started to zoom in on the reasons why some dogs lash out when on a leash and why others do not. \nAn investigative team headed by Evan MacLean, who is a professor of anthropology and director of the Arizona Canine Cognition Center at the University of Arizona, started looking at some possible factors associated with the physiology of dogs. Early researchers had focused on the possible effects of testosterone . High levels of this male hormone have been shown to be associated with aggression in humans and some other species. That is why neutering male dogs has often been recommended by veterinarians as a means of lowering aggressive tendencies. Unfortunately, data has been piling up which suggests that not only does neutering not reduce aggressive tendencies, but it actually may be associated with increased levels of aggression . Furthermore, since this is a male hormone, testosterone is unlikely to explain aggression in female dogs. \nMore success has been had in studies of another hormone, namely serotonin. Specifically, researchers have found that some dogs with a history of aggression also have low levels of serotonin in their blood or in their cerebrospinal fluid. Because higher levels of serotonin seem to lower the aggressive tendencies in dogs, aggressive dogs are often treated with drugs which raise the serotonin level. Particularly, drugs like Prozac, which are technically called \"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\", have been used. \nWhat caught the attention of this research team was the growing body of research which looked at the hormone oxytocin in dogs. Oxytocin is sometimes referred to as the \" love hormone\" since its levels in humans have been shown to increase when we hug or kiss a loved one, or have sex , or when mothers are nursing their infants. The levels of oxytocin have been shown to go up in dogs when they are engaged in friendly social interactions with people as well. \nThe interesting fact is that oxytocin has an evil twin, vasopressin, and researchers sometimes refer to them as \"yin and yang\" hormones . Research has shown that humans who chronically have aggression problems also tend to have high levels of vasopressin. So the Arizona researchers wondered whether this same thing might be going on in dogs. \nIn their first experiment, the researchers looked at the behavior and the hormonal levels of two groups of pet dogs. One group consisted of dogs who have a known history of aggression, especially toward unfamiliar things and toward other dogs, while the second group had no such aggressive history. The dogs were carefully chosen so that for each aggressive dog there was a nonaggressive dog of the same sex, age, and breed which could serve as a comparison. \nThe test for dog-directed aggression involved having each dog held on a leash by its owner. Across the room, there was a curtained area. From behind that curtain, researchers played a sound of a dog barking and then they pulled back the curtain to reveal a lifelike dog model with a human handler. The models resembled a Jack Russell Terrier, a Shetland Sheepdog, or an Old English Sheepdog. To test the reaction of these dogs in situations which did not involve another canine, the dogs were also walked in a room where they could make contact with common control items like a trash bag, a box, or a yoga ball, while random sound effects were being played. The dogs were also exposed to videos of other dogs engaged in miscellaneous activities. \nThe researchers measured the dogs' behavioral responses and also their hormone levels before and after each interaction. None of the dogs reacted aggressively toward the inanimate objects or the videos. However many of the dogs in the leash aggressive group had hostile responses to the model dog. These responses included barking, straining at the leash as though they were trying to attack it, making threatening growling noises and so forth. \nWhen they looked at the hormonal levels they found that the dogs that reacted aggressively showed higher levels of total vasopressin in their systems. This seemed to demonstrate the expected link between vasopressin and aggression in dogs. However, when they looked at the oxytocin levels they didn't find any significant differences. \nWhile the association between vasopressin and aggression appeared to be confirmed, the absence of any differences in the oxytocin levels seemed a bit puzzling, so the research team conducted a second set of measurements comparing the oxytocin levels of the pet dogs in the study to a group of assistance dogs. They used assistance dogs because they are specifically bred and behaviorally screened to be friendly, social, dogs with non-aggressive temperaments. Now the investigators found the expected differences in oxytocin levels, with the assistance dogs showing a larger total oxytocin than the pet dogs. \nLead researcher MacLean believes that these results may be very helpful in dealing with aggressive dogs since vasopressin and oxytocin are antagonistic hormones which tend to neutralize each other in their effects. Current therapies for aggressive behavioral problems in dogs have usually tended to target testosterone or serotonin, but MacLean suggests \"It would be reasonable to think that if vasopressin facilitates aggression, you could develop pharmaceuticals that could target the vasopressin system to help in cases where dogs are really aggressive. Oxytocin and vasopressin are being used extensively as therapeutics in humans right now. Regulation of the oxytocin system has been implicated in things ranging from autism to schizophrenia to posttraumatic stress disorder, and there are clinical trials looking at administering oxytocin as a drug to create some kind of behavioral response. It's interesting to think that maybe some of these same therapies that we are trying with people could be useful in dogs.\" \nCopyright SC Psychological Enterprises Ltd.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: Wikicommons \nAttitudes toward love , sex , and marriage in Ancient Egypt are significant in themselves, and because they may have informed or influenced mores and practices in Ancient Israel (and therefore in the Bible) and as far out as Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. According to the Book of Exodus, Pharaoh gave the order for every son born to the Hebrews to be drowned because he feared being deposed by their growing number\u2014which is how baby Moses ended up in an ark of bulrushes on the Nile, to be rescued by Pharaoh\u2019s daughter. The Ancient Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus, whom Plato (428/427\u2013348/347 BC) regarded as one of the seven sages of Greece, received instruction from Egyptian priests, and, while in Egypt, determined the height of the pyramids by measuring their shadows at the time of day when his own shadow was as long as he was tall. Plato himself travelled to Egypt, and, according to Plutarch, funded his voyage by selling Attic olive oil to the Egyptians. \nWe do not have a complete picture of marriage in Ancient Egypt. The period spans almost 3,000 years, from 3,100 BC to 332 BC, and attitudes may have varied quite considerably across the centuries, or even from one ruler to the next. It seems that men and women were almost equal in status, with the women enjoying more rights, such as the right to dispose of property or initiate divorce , than they would have in Ancient Athens or Ancient Rome. In the art of the period, women are often depicted supporting or clasping their husband, and husband and wife referred to each other as \u2018brother\u2019 or \u2018sister\u2019, again, suggesting a relationship of equals or near-equals. \nThe Egyptians enjoyed sensuous pleasures and, although proper, they were not in the least prudish. Their myths are replete with all kinds of sex. They represented the cosmos with Nut, goddess of the night sky, overarching her ithyphallic (erect) brother Geb, god of the earth. They attached false penises to male mummies and false nipples to female ones, to equip the dead for sex in the afterlife. They did not value chastity, with no word for \u2018virginity\u2019, and illegitimacy carried neither shame nor stigma. The Ebers medical papyrus, which dates back to the middle of the second millennium BC, contains a recipe for a contraceptive pessary, failing which it was possible to contract an abortion. Adultery , on the other hand, was a definite taboo, especially on the part of the wife, and women who strayed out of the marriage bed could be severely punished, including by mutilation, stoning, or burning at the stake. \nIn general, people sought to marry within their social class but had little regard for race or even nationality. They sometimes married a cousin but, except for royals, steered clear from anything closer than a first cousin. Men usually got married at about 16 to 20 years old, or as soon as they had picked up a trade from which to support a wife and eventual children. Women usually got married at a younger age, at around 13-years-old, or just after puberty , and it was not uncommon for an old man (old by the standards of the day) to marry a pubertal girl. \nMarriage was usually contracted between the groom and the bride\u2019s parents , with the groom or his family offering money or gifts to seal the deal and compensate the bride\u2019s family for the loss of a daughter. An agreement was drawn up at the start of marriage to provide for the woman and eventual children in case of divorce, and the items that a woman brought into marriage remained her own. Marriage may have been marked by a celebration, but there was no wedding ritual as such. As soon as the bride moved her belongings into the groom\u2019s house, they were considered married. In some cases, a couple entered into a trial marriage lasting for one year, a so-called \u2018year of eating\u2019, after which the marriage could be either progressed or annulled. \nDivorce was straightforward. Husband or wife could get divorced simply by saying so, even if they had no specific grounds such as adultery or infertility. Unlike in Ancient Athens and Ancient Rome, the children of the marriage belonged to the mother and followed after her. The man paid alimony to the woman, whether or not they had children, until and unless she took another husband. There was no stigma attached to divorce, and divorcees could easily remarry, although such was the emphasis on having children that a woman much beyond the peak of her fertility would have had difficulty in finding a new husband. Despite the relative ease of divorce, people worked hard at their marriages, not least because they believed that it would last for all eternity, with a departed wife able to torment an inequitable husband from beyond the grave. The Egyptians held that, after death, they would stand in judgment before the god Osiris, who, they hoped, would allow them passage into the Field of Reeds where they would be reunited with the people and possessions that they held dear. \nOsiris had married his sister Isis, and royals often followed in that example, partly because they thought of themselves as divine and partly to legitimize their succession. Cleopatra the lover of Caesar and Mark Antony married both of her brothers, Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV. Some pharaohs even married their own daughters, although this may have been an honorary marriage to elevate the status of a princess. Unlike normal Egyptians, for whom it was forbidden, pharaohs often took several wives, enabling them to forge or strengthen domestic and international alliances. That said, one of the wives, often a sister or half-sister, would prime over the others and carry the title of Great Royal Wife. Tutankhamun, who reigned from 1332 to 1323 BC and suffered from numerous deformities, was the son of Akhenaten and one of Akhenaten\u2019s sisters. He took for wife his half-sister Ankhesenamun, daughter of Akhenaten and his Great Royal Wife Nefertiti. Before marrying Tutankhamun, Ankhesenamun had been married to her father Akhenaten. Tutankhamun and Ankhesenamun had two daughters, but both were stillborn owing, no doubt, to the high degree of inbreeding.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "osiris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nefertiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caesar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pharaoh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark antony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ptolemy xiv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ankhesenamun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tutankhamun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akhenaten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ptolemy xiii", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "plutarch", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:44:13.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3a0b0f4ba77e7694310c0cfbfc441439b15b6725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4L5BEIegNe1kFsOA7VMvyQt54EspQbF0hJCaqdOu9otU7m7Pq0LbuXgt7lnMCYnwrOFznUM8NkPpQ--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Romantic Conflict: Part 2", "title_full": "Romantic Conflict: Part 2", "published": "2017-10-04T00:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/romantic_conflict_and_technology_photo.jpg?itok=PvisJpm-", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3a0b0f4ba77e7694310c0cfbfc441439b15b6725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4L5BEIegNe1kFsOA7VMvyQt54EspQbF0hJCaqdOu9otU7m7Pq0LbuXgt7lnMCYnwrOFznUM8NkPpQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ctoma", "published": "2017-10-04T00:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Romantic Conflict: Part 2", "text": "MORE \nIn a previous post , I addressed some basic features of conflict in romantic relationships . Now, let us consider the role played by technology in this context. To what extent do couples use technological devices (e.g., the phone, texting, email) for conflict? What are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of these devices in the management of romantic conflict? \nThese are important questions. Romantic relationships are key to personal happiness and well-being 1 and, as previously discussed, conflict occurs frequently in these relationships and has the potential to disrupt them. Meanwhile, technological devices have become indispensable tools for everyday communication with relational partners. It is therefore likely that these devices will be used for romantic conflict and will play a part in the resolution of these conflicts. Yet there is surprisingly little research on this topic. Here is what we currently know: \n1) Extent of Technology Use for Romantic Conflict. \nWhen it comes to technology, we live in a high-choice environment : We have a multitude of media options for connecting with relational partners in an easy, fairly effortless manner. Two studies 2,3 have investigated the extent to which people had ever used the media for engaging in conflict with a romantic partner, both using convenience samples of college students. In 2010, 61 percent of college students reported using a mediated channel for romantic conflict, specifically texting (51 percent), the phone (25 percent), instant messenger (13 percent), social network sites (8 percent), and email (4 percent) 2 . In 2014, the numbers were higher, especially when it came to social network sites and email. 64 percent of participants used texting, followed by the phone (60 percent), instant messaging (37 percent), social network sites (29 percent), video chat (22 percent) and email (21 percent) for romantic conflict 3 . Note that video chatting (e.g., Skype, FaceTime) also became a novel and fairly popular option for romantic conflict at this time. \nOnly one study has investigated a community sample (i.e., non-college students) in 2011 4 . Results show that, at that time, adults were not as keen as college students on using technology for romantic conflict: Only about one-fourth of couples used the media to broach serious relational topics. \nIn conclusion, the very limited research on this topic indicates that (1) college students are quite likely to engage in romantic conflict using technological devices; (2) older adults are less likely to do so; (3) texting is the most prevalent medium for engaging in romantic conflict; and (4) the use of social network sites, video chatting and email is on the rise. It is likely that the use of technological devices for romantic conflict is on the rise across the board, as more people, across demographics, have adopted these devices for everyday communication. \n2) Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology Use for Romantic Conflict. \nA handful of interview studies 5,6,7 had college students ponder the advantages and disadvantages of using the media for romantic conflict. Here is what they came up with: \nAdvantages: More careful message composition . Face-to-face communication is extemporaneous, meaning that people must think and respond on the spot to their partner\u2019s remarks. This can be challenging, especially when emotions run high\u2014as tends to be the case with conflict. Certain media relax this constraint. Over email or texting, people can take as much time as they want to construct their messages, and they also have the ability to edit them before sending them along (a luxury unavailable to face-to-face communicators, who cannot take back an undesirable statement once it has been uttered). This media feature can be especially advantageous to those who are prone to outbursts or impulsive statements such as threatening to break up the relationship when they don\u2019t really mean it (see my previous post on this topic). Reduced interruptions . Relatedly, when conflict happens face-to-face, people may have a difficult time getting their messages across because of frequent interruptions and question-asking by their partners. Over the media, these interruptions can be reduced and conversational turn-taking can be more equitable. For instance, over email, one partner can only respond once the other has finished saying their piece. Even in more synchronous media like texting and instant messenger, people can still continue typing their messages despite incoming questions from their partner. People who are less outspoken and less vocal than their partner, and hence often feel railroaded in conflict situations, may greatly benefit from this feature. Reduced flooding . Flooding refers to the experience of being overcome by emotion. In the case of conflict, this emotion tends to be negative ( anger , frustration, sadness). When flooded, people tend to act in impulsive and irrational ways and are more likely to escalate conflicts rather than resolve them in an equitable manner. The partner\u2019s embodied presence can increase flooding. That is, people are likely to get more emotional when they can see and hear their partner in real time. This is especially the case when the partner\u2019s gestures, facial expression, and voice, denote negative emotion, because emotion tends to be contagious. Many media make it possible to communicate with one\u2019s partner in the absence of corporeal presence and nonverbal cues (e.g. email, instant messaging, texting), and thus may reduce the likelihood of flooding. People who are highly emotionally reactive or neurotic may benefit from this feature. Expressing negative emotions . Some people feel uncomfortable voicing criticism and dissent to their partner, and, as was the case with emotional flooding, these anxious feelings can be more potent when the partner is physically present. Simply put, some people find themselves tongue-tied having to look their partner in the eye and criticize them or express negative feelings. Yet these negative feelings are important to address, otherwise, the conflict remains unresolved (see my previous post about the pointlessness of avoidance as a conflict management strategy). The media can provide a buffer between oneself and one\u2019s partner. Since the media enables communication in the absence of physical presence, it can increase the comfort level these individuals have in expressing their concerns. \nTo reap these benefits, participants reported engaging in the following media-related strategies: Channel switching . When the conflict got too heated, some participants switched from face-to-face to mediated communication, so they could reduce flooding and increase message control. Incremental introduction . Some participants eased into face-to-face conflict by broaching it over the media first. Once their concerns were laid forth in a mediated message (email or text), they were easier to address face-to-face. Compartmentalize conflict . Some participants were invested in preserving their face-to-face relationship as happy and conflict-free, so they resorted to the media every time they needed to engage in conflict. Thus, conflict was designated to its own unique sphere (i.e., the media), that did not overlap with quality time spent face-to-face. \nDisadvantages: Waiting time . One of the greatest difficulties associated with media-based conflict was waiting for the partner to respond. While the media could be helpful in reducing interruptions in the case of overly vocal partners, waiting for not-so-vocal partners to respond was perceived as torturous. This waiting time was often described as fraught with anxiety (\u201cwhat are they thinking?\u201d \u201cmaybe things are worse than I thought!\u201d etc.) and with escalating anger (\u201cI can\u2019t believe they\u2019re ignoring me!\u201d \u201cThey must not care about me at all!\u201d). These concerns are not entirely unfounded. One study shows that participants were 2.8 times more likely to purposefully delay responding and 3.8 times more likely to ignore their partners when romantic conflict unfolded over texting than face-to-face communication 3 . Emotional disconnect . For some people, the partner\u2019s physical presence produced emotional flooding, such that media with reduced nonverbal cues was preferable. But for other people, the absence of nonverbal cues meant that they couldn\u2019t connect emotionally with their partner, making conflict resolution more difficult. Additionally, the absence of nonverbal cues made it more difficult to \u201cread\u201d one\u2019s partner \u2013 that is, ascertain how they were feeling as the conflict unfolded. Lack of finality . Relatedly, some people reported that conflicts negotiated via the media felt less final, less resolved than those negotiated face-to-face. This was the case because the media left more uncertainty about the partner\u2019s feelings and thoughts, and also because classic resolution behaviors (e.g., a hug, a kiss) could not happen. \nTell me about yourself: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using technology for your own conflict management? What are your experiences using technology for engaging in conflict with a romantic partner? \nIn the next installment in this series, I will discuss the handful of studies on how media use affects conflict resolution. Beyond these perceived advantages and disadvantages, is it constructive or destructive to use technology to engage in conflict with one\u2019s romantic partner? Stay tuned. References \n1. Dush, C.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \nThe warning signals are getting louder. Today\u2019s children are stressed out, unfocused, sleep-deprived, and moody because of over-using video game players, smartphones, tablets, television, and computers. \nIn my office every day, I see kids who are fidgety, inattentive, unfocused, anxious, uncommunicative, naughty, or sad. The corners of their mouths turn down. Source: Shutterstock: used with permission \nMany of these children have been over-exposed to electronic screens, sometimes since they were just 2 years old. They have never played active childhood games with their parents like \u201cSimon says,\u201d \u201chide and seek,\u201d or \u201ctag.\u201d These simple games have survived over the centuries because the physical activity and interaction with parents or peers promotes healthy brain development in children. \nBut today, children by and large lead indoor, sedentary lives in front of smartphones, video game players, and TV. They get just about every kind of electronic gadget they want, but not enough of what they really need for healthy development\u2014that is, consistent face-to-face playful interactions with their parents. As pediatrician and psychiatrist D. W. Winnicott famously observed, babies respond to mirroring\u2014seeing themselves reflected in a parent. Watching their mother doing something on a media screen does not do the job. \nEven technocrat Melinda Gates warns about the negative effects of technology on today\u2019s children. In a recent Washington Post column , she wrote: \n\u201c\u2026as a mother who wants to make sure her children are safe and happy, I worry. And I think back to how I might have done things differently. Parents should decide for themselves what works for their family, but I probably would have waited longer before putting a computer in my children\u2019s pockets.\u201d \nRecently, on the PBS News Hour , Gates said that children need to have real face-to-face conversations with people and learn to empathize with others. Even though technology offers many benefits to kids, it doesn\u2019t teach them critical communication skills. It doesn\u2019t prepare them for social interactions in the real world. \nWeaning children from media screens is not for the faint at heart. It is best done gradually, substituting other activities for screen use. \nClinical psychologist Sabine Duflo suggests a four-step plan to remove or reduce screens from a child\u2019s daily life: 1) No screen use in the morning; 2) No screen use during meal times; 3) No screen use before sleeping ; 4) No screen media in your child\u2019s bedroom. \nBelow, I have some suggestions for parents who want to replace screens with other activities. This list just offers suggestions. I\u2019m sure parents can come up with their own novel ideas. \n1. Take your child to the park. 2. Ride bikes together. 3. Take your child to the public library (and attend \u201cstory time\u201d if your library offers it). Help her pick out books that she is interested in. 4. Read to/with your child. 5. Take your child fishing. 6. Bake cookies together. 7. Make play dough together and then enjoy shaping it (easy recipes for play dough are available online). 8. Take him on a hike or nature walk. 9. Take him to a community pool and teach him to swim. 10. Walk or ride bikes to school with him (if safe and feasible). 11. Take him to the Zoo. 12.

The misplaced conceptual allure MORE Source: Jack Pemment \nI think all of us at one time or another have been fascinated by psychopaths, either from movies and books, or from biographical accounts of the many sadistic personages from history. We still find it hard to reconcile that the actions of some psychopathic killers were also the actions of a sane person, making the psychopath seem like a walking contradiction. This inability to grasp the motivations of the psychopathic has in the past led to many defendants being sent to a mental institution for treatment, rather than to prison or Death Row. \nTrying to make sense of the actions of a psychopath is fraught with difficulty. The irony is that we apply our empathy to understand an individual who consistently fails to understand and feel different points of view. Inevitably, our empathy fails to recreate anything, and we are left with nothing more than the cliched person suit before us. This subjective black hole leaves the psychopath to some extent undefinable, and like black holes will continue to suck us in as we philosophize over the nature of emptiness. It is this very quality that makes the psychopath a commodity for authors, and a delight for readers. \nI am often wary of the admiration some have for the psychopathic, and have sometimes pondered the reasons behind such admiration. I\u2019m the first to admit that I\u2019m academically beguiled by psychopathy . The fact that mental health experts can use any validated psychopathy diagnostic tool to go on and find structural differences in the brains of psychopaths is mind blowing. However, I am also the first to admit how abhorred and repulsed I am when it comes to the behavior of psychopaths, especially when reading the testimony of victims. This push-pull of intrigue and repulsion commands that a good deal of human thought time is dedicated to the conundrum of psychopathy. And to add another layer, it is not uncommon to see a history of abuse towards a child who later grows up to become a despicable monster \u2013 leaving us wanting to save the child, but condemn the adult. \nI think psychopaths also represent a freedom to act . There are times when many of us become angry or frustrated with ourselves because we somehow failed to act during a defining or critical moment in our lives. The reason for inaction doesn\u2019t really matter, if we are left feeling frustrated; this is made worse if it has been a continuation of precedent, where we have failed to speak up for most of our lives, and this most recent time was yet another reminder. Psychopaths are not bound by a conscience or a super ego, and so they usually have the motivation to act when they feel appropriate. Psychopaths are seen to get the job done, even if it (probably) means getting your hands dirty. This is a defining characteristic of many folklore and literary heroes. \nIn a weird way, I also think psychopaths are admired because they have a strong potential to do nasty things to other people. This isn\u2019t to say that we all want to do nasty things to other people and we admire them for that, but being assured in ourselves that we could if we needed to, in a perverse way might reinforce our confidence ; this feeds back into the satisfying idea that we could get our hands dirty if needed, within the right moral confines, of course. \nWe must remind ourselves, though, that it\u2019s dangerous to preserve the psychopathic as a symbol, as a last ditch savior of the human race who can act without emotion. Acting without emotion is not by default a stronger or wiser position, in fact sometimes it\u2019s quite the contrary. \nThis shows us another reason that people tend to admire the pathologically emotionless. Everyone has been hurt from a relationship, and during those times we have felt weak or humiliated, or just wished to become numb. However, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that emotions also make the world a very colorful and amazing place to live. Part of growing up is learning to take the rough with the smooth, and we must realize that without emotion life would be extremely dull. It is for this reason that I genuinely pity the psychopath because their disorder has robbed them of the richness and diversity of human experience. \nHumans will always allow psychopaths to live on the border between reality and imagination, and it is for this reason they will remain an ever-alluring shadow to the human spirit.

That\u2019s the question addressed in a new study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior[i], titled \u201cOnce a Cheater, Always a Cheater? Serial Infidelity Across Subsequent Relationships.\u201d The researchers found that those who were unfaithful in one relationship had three times the odds of being unfaithful in the next, compared to those who had not been unfaithful in the first relationship. Let\u2019s look deeper. \nThis research was conducted by a team from our lab at the University of Denver; the study was headed up by Kayla Knopp along with colleagues Shelby Scott, Lane Ritchie, Galena Rhoades, Howard Markman, and yours truly. It used our national sample of individuals first recruited when aged 18 to 34, who were in unmarried, serious, romantic relationships .[ii] Thus, while most of the literature on infidelity focuses on marriage , this new study focused on those mostly at pre-marriage stages of life. That is one of the advances from this work but not the only one. The other is that the sample and methods allowed for assessing infidelity across two relationships within the context of this longitudinal sample that followed individuals for five years, focusing on their romantic relationships. \nHistorical Findings \nThere is an extensive literature on infidelity in married relationships with a growing literature on what is often called extra-dyadic sexual involvement (ESI) in unmarried relationships. The literature on infidelity inside and outside of marriage is well summarized in the new paper. I will describe a few highlights here.[iii] \nAn overwhelming majority of people have the expectation of fidelity of sexual and, often, emotional connection in monogamous relationships. That is especially obvious in marriage, but it\u2019s also true in serious, unmarried relationships. Sure, there have always been some who seek \u201copen\u201d relationships, where partners agree that it is okay to have sex outside the relationship under some conditions, but that is not very common. \nWhile the lifetime risks for infidelity in marriage have generally run around 20 percent,[iv] rates of sex with someone outside a current relationship are much higher among those who are unmarried.[v] This should not be shocking since both the norms about fidelity as well as average commitment levels are higher for marriage than other relationships, on average. The possibility of fidelity is simply not as high for those who have not settled down to make a long-term (or life-time) commitment to a particular partner. Nevertheless, while people may not have settled down to committing to another for the long haul, they tend to expect faithfulness.[vi] \nKnopp and colleagues note some of the most common risk factors for infidelity based on prior research. Those include: Low commitment to the present relationship Low or declining relationship satisfaction Accepting attitudes about sexual relations outside the relationship Attachment insecurity: both avoidant and anxious Differences in individual levels of sexual inhibition and excitement Being a man versus a woman, though this may be changing. \nThose findings are mostly from the literature on marriage with some findings from unmarried relationships. If you want a deeper review of factors associated with greater odds of cheating in unmarried relationships, I wrote about that subject here and here based on an earlier study drawing from the same project sample as the new study. \nThe new study does not focus on predictors of infidelity but on the likelihood that it will be repeated, and it uses particularly strong methods for doing so. \nFollowing People Through Two Relationships \nMost studies of infidelity are retrospective and cross-sectional, focusing at single points while asking about present and past relationships.[vii] To my knowledge, this new study is unique because people were followed in real time (or close to it) from one relationship into the next, completing comprehensive surveys about their relationships at each time point during the longitudinal method. Contrast that with a method where, for example, you asked a sample of middle-aged people if they had ever had sex outside of one or more relationships in their past. That would be a different study, and, while interesting, would be subject to retrospective bias. People are believed to remember things better\u2014and typically to report them more accurately\u2014when asked closer in time to when those events occurred. That\u2019s what Knopp and colleagues did. \nFor the new study, the overall national sample from the project started with 1,294 individuals. However, the analyses for this new study had to be based on those who were surveyed across two relationships over the course of the five years that the sample was followed. That means that only those who had broken up from one relationship and then entered another during that period would be analyzed. That left 484 individuals. If you are used to studies in sociology with thousands of people, that may seem like a smallish sample, but for the questions addressed here, it\u2019s large and more than sufficient. \nThe average duration of the first relationships was 38.8 months while the average duration of the second was 29.6 months. Thus, the relationships studied were mostly serious and of substantial duration. No one was married at the start of the project but some would have married that first partner or the second during the time frame of the study. For the most part, however, it is best to think about these findings in the context of the stage of life where people are often seriously involved but not yet married\u2014a stage of life that has grown substantially in the past few decades. \nAt each time point (which tended to be every 4 to 6 months), participants were asked, \u201cHave you had sexual relations with someone other than your partner since you began seriously dating ?\u201d In this project, participants were also asked if they had either known or suspected their present partner of having sex with someone else. Obviously, there are biases when people are self-reporting such behavior. That\u2019s a problem for the whole literature. Further, the specific questions used in this study may exclude emotional affairs as well as some online affairs where there is some sexual aspect but the respondent tells themselves they are not actually having sex. Also, in such a sample there would be some small percentage of people who would have been in some sort of consensual non-monogamous arrangement, where having sex with someone outside the relationship would be the same thing as cheating because there was some agreement about this. Knopp and colleagues note that there is no way with this data set to isolate such relationships, but there are strong reasons to believe that such open relationships are a very small percentage in the overall sample. \nKnopp and colleagues controlled for some of the variables known to be associated with greater and lower risk of being unfaithful, net of other factors like relationship quality and commitment to one\u2019s partner. That is, the study controlled for age, gender , socioeconomic status, and race . \nThen and Again \nForty-four percent (44 percent) of this sample reported having had sex with someone other than their present partner in one or both of the relationships studied. Further, 30 percent reported that they knew at least one of the partners in the two relationships had cheated on them. That seems to me like quite a bit of infidelity in these unmarried relationships. Nevertheless, keep in mind that this is not a good estimate of the odds that someone will be unfaithful in an unmarried relationship. To be in this sample, a person would have had to have broken up in at least one serious relationship and entered another. Thus, this result does not mean that 44 percent of those under 40 in the U. S. have been unfaithful to a partner, and it certainly does not mean that such a high percent who are married in a similar age range have or will be been unfaithful. Getting that percentage measured correctly would require a different type of sample and method to yield the best estimate of how likely it is that people will have cheated on any partner before eventually settling down in marriage among those who have married. Closely related to that question, Galena Rhoades and I found in a previous study that 16 percent of those followed into marriage in the study\u2019s parent project described here reported that they had cheated on their eventual spouse sometime before marriage.[viii] \nIn this new study, 45 percent who reported cheating on their partner in the first relationship reported also doing so in the second. Among those who had not cheated in the first, far less, 18 percent, cheated in the second. While the odds of cheating on a partner were far greater if one had done so in the past, it is also true that a person cheating in one relationship was not destined to do so in the next relationship. In fact, slightly more people who had cheated in the first relationship studied did not report cheating in the second. \nThe study also found that those who were certain that their partner in the first relationship had cheated were twice as likely as those not reporting this to experience a cheating partner in the second relationship. Again, history was not destiny, but history did speak to greater odds of a repeat experience. \nImplications \nIt would be incorrect to assume that one is destined to endlessly repeat painful relationship patterns. And yet, some people are at much greater risk than others for negative outcomes in romantic relationships (and marriage), and they are at greater risk for repeat experiences. Some people are simply more likely than others to cheat on their partners and more likely to choose partners who cheat on them, and to do so in more than one relationship. This touches on the complex subject of selection into risk, which Galena Rhoades and I have written about more than a few times (for example, here and here ). \nThe study described here was not designed to address complicated questions such as how the risk of infidelity might be lowered in relationships and marriage, or how it could be prevented from happening again. Future research could examine what predicts whether or not someone who cheated on one partner does so again; however, most of the same predictors of ever cheating will predict repeatedly cheating quite well. Among all of the factors associated with cheating, some are surely more amenable to change than others. Variables that are biological (e.g., differences in proneness to sexual excitement) or cultural (and thus impacting individual values) are in the mix, but so are other factors, like commitment, that I believe people have some control over. \nGalena Rhoades and I have described how relationship histories may play an important and causal role in eventual relationship quality in marriage (or not in marriage, for that matter). Specifically, while having more experience in various aspects of life is usually a good thing, having more experience in relationships may not be so good when those experiences include serious involvements that alter one\u2019s odds of succeeding in finding and keeping lasting love. Nevertheless, behaviors of the past do not have to be the definition of one\u2019s future. \nFollow me on Twitter : @DecideOrSlide \nI first released this piece at the blog at the Institute for Family Studie on 9-26-2017. \n[i] Knopp, K., Scott, S.B., Ritchie, L.L., Rhoades, G.K., Markman, H.J., & Stanley (2017).

Where to go to feel good, safe, entertained, and surrounded by beauty. Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \nWhen you\u2019re a travel journalist, folks always ask you about the best place to go. I always ask a question in return: what is it you are looking for? Recently, a woman said she wanted a place that was the antidote to all the turmoil in the world and where she could find inner peace without going on a retreat. I thought about it for a minute or two, and the answer was: Switzerland. And here are the reasons I gave her: \n1) The physical act of traveling is stressful, and the modes of transportation can be uncomfortable, unreliable and offer constricted space and poor service. Connections may be inconvenient. \nNot so in Switzerland. I was dazzled by the way their transportation system works. Virtually everything in the country is reachable by train, bus, or boat. And all of them connect seamlessly to each other. All of them are on time. You hop off a train, board a boat from the same station or pier, get off the boat, take another train, take a bus, and all the timetables are compatible. You can buy a SwissPass for, let\u2019s say, 8 days. It comes in first and second classes. Whichever one you buy, it includes all public trains, boats, buses, and museums, and offers serious discounts on funiculars and cable cars; you don\u2019t even have to buy separate tickets or wait in line\u2026 and of course it saves you money. Source: paul ross, with permission \n2) Clean counts. In Switzerland you can feel safe eating, drinking the water, breathing the air, walking by yourself. Cleanliness is next to godliness in Switzerland, and I even witnessed streets being thoroughly cleaned within two hours after a huge festival and parade. \n3) Beauty . Nothing erases the darkness within like the beauty without. Whether it\u2019s a towering, snow-covered Alp, or a pristine, glacial lake, Switzerland has cornered the market on spectacular natural scenery. Source: paul ross, used with permission \n4) Edibles. Switzerland prides itself on its local and regional foods and wines. If you think you have eaten \u201cSwiss cheese,\u201d believe me that you haven\u2019t even touched the tip of tip of the tip of the cheese iceberg. Artisanal cheeses abound, and you will never tire of sampling the cheeses made from milk that comes from cows which graze on grass and flowers all summer long on mountain tops. \n5) Chocolate. Need I say more? \n6) Laughter . In Vevey, a museum opened last year in the home of Charlie Chaplin. Everything is interactive; you can even try on Charlie\u2019s clothes and twirl his cane as you watch film clips from his most ingenious and hilarious films. Every visitor, no matter how young or old, was a child. They giggled and laughed and it has been a long time since I saw such sheer joy anywhere. Source: paul ross with permisssion \n7) Giving \u201cmental patients\u201d respect, admiration, and deep appreciation. In l976, Jean Dubuffet founded the Museum of Art Brut (Outsider Art) in Lausanne. Not all of the artists suffer from biochemical and emotional illness, but many do. They, like the other artists, are not products of art schools, and their creations are not driven by market concerns. Today Outsider Art is a recognized, worldwide art genre, and it all started in Lausanne. Going into the museum is a life-changing experience for anyone who has not encountered the vibrant, brilliant, wild, expansive works of art. How about the room that is covered with intricate maps of a mythical place where people are happy? Of you suffer from anxiety or depression , bipolar disorder or schizophrenia , you will feel the stigma attached to it float away and relax into the pleasure of creation. Source: paul ross, with permission \n8) Being in a rootless world where only NOW matters and pop culture rules can be\u2026well\u2026a little empty. In Switzerland, where four languages are spoken and each region has its own customs and culture, heritage is celebrated in costumes, events, parties, food, drink, yodeling, Alphorns, and parades. If you are anywhere in Switzerland where cultural events are happening, you will be welcomed to watch, photograph, or even join in. Source: paul ross, with permission \n9) Politics are not nasty and depressing and toxic. Seven Federal Counselors share power, yes, you read it right, and they rotate who is President. Many people do not even know who the current President is. And in Appenzell, I met a local who told me they vote on issues with open debate and a show of hands. \n10) Swiss people walk a lot. In flat cities and hilly cities. In the Alps. On the prairies. Alongside the lakes. On trails. It is not uncommon to see elderly people with backpacks, heading off for the mountains, or coming down from the mountains. People are fit. They value exercise. It makes you want to walk when you are there. And when you walk, you move your muscles and your mind and you feel better. \nAnd that is why I recommended Switzerland to her, and to you.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \nWhat is the TARGET model? \nThe following steps for regaining equilibrium when in a state of emotional alarm are drawn from the TARGET (Trauma Affect Regulation: Guide for Education and Therapy ) model, developed by Ford and colleagues (2015). Based on a neuroscientific and clinically-grounded understanding of how traumatic experience leads to dysregulated emotional activity, they have developed a straightforward approach to re-establishing balance and reorienting one's inner compass when distress becomes overwhelming. This approach was developed to work with post-traumatic distress, but might also be useful for re-orienting when everyday distress threatens to overwhelm our usual coping mechanisms. \nWhen distress overwhelms development \nIn people with PTSD , especially those raised in an abusive and neglectful environment , the necessary skills required to maintain emotional equilibrium and clear-headed thoughtfulness may never have had the chance to develop fully. Basic survival takes priority, getting in the way of rounding out personal and interpersonal developmen t. \nIn studies of brain networks, researchers (Teicher et al., 2014) have found that the dominant brain regions in adults with significant childhood mistreatment were different from those without significant mistreatment. Notably, maltreatment was associated with decreased involvement of areas related to emotion regulation , self-awareness, self-referential thinking, and the ability to correctly attribute motives and internal states to others. Along with other models to address dysregulated emotional states (e.g., DBT , STAIRS), the TARGET model is evidence-based, having been studied across different populations with a focus on treating PTSD, including in people suffering from developmental trauma. Among other things, the TARGET model has been shown to reduce violent and punitive behavior, improve self-perception, and foster active coping leading to greater self-efficacy . These are also factors associated with increased resilience . \nThe foundations of the TARGET model \nThe TARGET model draws upon approaches known as \u201cfocusing\u201d and \u201cmentalization,\u201d in which people harness higher brain functions to recognize what is happening when they are caught in traumatic experiences. Over-learning a more adaptive response to distress leads to replacing old automatic habits with new flexible strategies grounded in one's core values and based on thoughtful consideration of choices. The approach is designed to be relatively simple to learn and practice, and has been used effectively with groups and individuals. The formal training is typically conducted over the course of several sessions, but the basic approach is easily grasped. \nIn providing education about how trauma affects our ability to remain calm and thoughtful, they describe the brain as having three basic areas, using metaphors for complex brain functions: the \u201calarm center,\u201d the \u201cfiling center,\u201d and the \u201cthinking center\u201d When we are caught up in traumatic experiences or high enough levels of distress that our coping mechanisms are overwhelmed, the alarm center takes over from the thinking center, and we go from normal function, or main mode, into survival mode. In survival mode, present experience is too overwhelming for the usual retrieval and processing of what is happening, and memories and response patterns developed in reaction to prior stressful experiences can hijack us and lead us into behaviors which do not fit the current situation. \nThe FREEDOM Mnemonic \nThe TARGET model uses seven steps to move from high levels of distress to calm, clear thinking, using the acronym \u201cFREEDOM\u201d: F ocusing: Concentrating on a single idea grounded in our core values and sense of authentic self. R ecognizing: Paying attention to identifying what is triggering the alarm reaction, even small things which we ordinarily wouldn\u2019t notice. E motions: Differentiating alarm-driven emotions from main, adaptive emotions. E valuations: Noticing the differences between ways of making sense of reality which are alarm-driven, versus more adaptive goals associated with main mode. D efining: Identifying which goals come out of thoughtful consideration, and separating them from alarm-based goals. O ptions: Identifying and pursuing adaptive choices, and separating them from alarm-based behaviors. M aking: Noting that we are making a proactive, positive contribution by getting out of alarm mode and back into main mode. \nThese seven steps, starting with a basic grounding in what is most important to us, with practice may replace old habits with new. Being reminded of who we are and what is important to us can help to snap us out of the storm of distressing emotions, enough to consider alternatives. Noticing what is triggering us helps to further add context and a sense of self-efficacy, and moves us further away from the state of alarm, which at the time often seems to be our only reality. Taking stock of our emotions, and seeing which are related to alarm and which are not helps us to develop greater emotional awareness, and is additionally grounding. The additional steps further refine decision-making by identifying goals and options available, which are usually much broader than we initially thought. Finally, going through this process again and again until it becomes second nature goes a long way toward creating an overall positive sense of what we can do for ourselves, very different from the helplessness of being caught in traumatic triggers.

It's a wonderful time to carefully assess how nonhuman animals (animals) are faring in a human dominated world and to celebrate successes in reducing and abolishing pain, suffering and death \"in the name of humans.\" And, coincidentally, although I don't really believe in coincidences, this is my 1000th essay on this site . I was wondering what I might write on this occasion, and I am thrilled to see the unplanned convergence of this special day for animals and my writing for Psychology Today . I couldn't have planned it better if I tried. \nWorld Animal day is a global event , and throughout the world there are celebrations of successes and hope. One of the themes of this special day is offered in this poster, namely, everyone can make a difference in the lives of other animals. Source: Courtesy World Animal Day UK \nAnd, along with celebrations of what has been accomplished to protect other animals from wanton and horrific abuse and death, it's necessary to look ahead so as to make life better and better for the billions of nonhumans who still suffer and die at the hands of humans. \nThe science of animal well-being \nOne topic about which I've written concerns how the science of animal welfare fails other animals because it patronizes them \"in the name of humans.\" To this end, in our book The Animals' Agenda: Freedom, Compassion, and Coexistence in the Human Age , Jessica Pierce and I have argued that we need to replace the science of animal welfare with the science of animal well-being in which the life of every single individual matters. Our view is consistent with the goals of the rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of compassionate conservation in which the guiding principles are \"First, do not harm\" and every individual counts. \nOur book took root out of a shared sense of frustration with science\u2014and with a particular kind of science. We had both assumed, earlier in our careers, that the scientific study of the emotional and cognitive lives of animals would lead to major changes in how humans treat other animals\u2014how could it not? Once people see that animals are intelligent and feeling creatures, just like us, they won\u2019t be able, in good conscience , to inflict suffering and deprivations. It seemed, as we looked around, that the accumulating research into the inner lives of animals had done nothing to help their situation\u2014more animals are being raised and slaughtered for food, more are being held captive in entertainment venues, invasive laboratory research is expanding, and so forth. We had many discussions where we puzzled over this seeming paradox: the more we know, the worse things are getting for animals. \nThe Animals\u2019 Agenda was our attempt to figure out why science is failing animals. The answer, in brief, is that the study of animal emotion and cognition has been channeled into animal welfare science. And \u201cwelfare science\u201d is not science in the service of animals, but rather science in the service of industry. \nThe science of animal well-being that we develop focuses on individual animals and would not allow animals to be used and abused in the way that welfarism allows. Welfarism puts human needs first, and tries to accommodate animals within the \u201chuman needs first\u201d framework. Well-being broadens the question of \u201cwhat do animals want and need\u201d beyond the welfare box, and tries to understand animal preferences from the animals\u2019 point of view. For example, welfarism asks whether mink on a fur farm would prefer taller or shorter cages; well-being challenges the idea mink should be in battery cages on a fur farm in the first place, because they cannot have true well-being or \u201cgood lives\u201d under such conditions\u2014no matter how many welfare modifications we make. \nSo, the bottom line for welfarists is that they\u2019re trying to make life marginally better for animals in the arenas in which animals are exploited, leaving unquestioned the human practices that cause tremendous animal suffering. Welfarism is a salve for our conscience. \nBridging the knowledge translation gap \nWe also argue that in the future we must use what we know on behalf of other animals. We write about the knowledge translation gap, referring to the practice of ignoring tons of science showing that other animals are sentient beings and going ahead and causing intentional harm in human-oriented arenas. On the broad scale, it means that what we now know about animal cognition and emotion has not yet been translated into an evolution in human attitudes and practices. A great example of the knowledge translation gap is found in the wording of the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA), which explicitly excludes rats and mice from kingdom Animalia (even though a first grader knows that rats and mice are animals). In post-election parlance, we could also call the AWA\u2019s slip up an \u201calternative fact.\u201d \nThe state and future of other animals \nWe need another and a wiser and perhaps a more mystical concept of animals. Remote from universal nature , and living by complicated artifice, man in civilization surveys the creature through the glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion. We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate of having taken form so far below ourselves. And therein we err, and greatly err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world older and more complete than ours they move finished and complete, gifted with extensions of the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth. Henry Beston, The Outermost House \nThis quote from Henry Beston's lovely book is one of my all-time favorites. I go to it constantly because it says so much about who other animals are and about our relationships with them. First, we do indeed view others through our own senses, and as we have clearly seen, dogs don\u2019t sense the world how we do. So our views are, indeed, distorted. We also patronize them for not being like us, for what we perceive as their incompleteness, as if we are complete. This misrepresentation allows some people to place other animals below us on some mythical evolutionary scale. They\u2019re referred to as \u201clower\u201d beings, a move that results in rampant mistreatment and egregious abuse. As Beston asserts, \u201cAnd therein we err,\u201d for we should not be the template against which we measure other animals. \nI also like how he views other animals as \u201cother nations,\u201d since this asks us to view them as the beings they are, not as what we want them to be. And surely, other animals are caught up in the \u201ctravail of the earth,\u201d captive to whatever we want them to do and whoever we want them to be. As we\u2019ve seen, this makes for a good deal of stress in their lives as they try to adapt to a human-dominated world. \nEcocentrism, rewilding, and hope \n\u201cThat the universe is a communion of subjects rather than a collection of objects is the central commitment of the Ecozoic. Existence itself is derived from and sustained by this intimacy of each being with every other being of the universe.\u201d (Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry, 1994, The Universe Story: From the Primordial Flaring Forth to the Ecozoic Era--A Celebration of the Unfolding of the Cosmos , p. 243). \nI'm a card-carrying optimist and I fully believe that with a lot of hard work we can continue to make the lives of other animals much better as time goes on. In an essay called \" A Journey to Ecocentrism: Earth Jurisprudence and Rewilding \" I argue that if we adopt ecocentrism in our hearts and in our actions there is hope. Ecocentrism recognizes that a nature-centered, rather than a human-centered, view of nature, will mean that humans will have to change their values if they favor humans over nature as a whole, including nonhuman animals and their homes. \nThe idea that all of Earth's residents are part of an interconnected community forms the basis of my ideas about personal \u2018rewilding\u2019 that are outlined Rewilding Our Hearts: Building Pathways of Compassion and Coexistence . The ideas are novel and call for personal (and some might say individual) spiritual transformations that serve to reconnect people to nature and to embrace the magnificence of our planet. All individuals are seen as stakeholders who must work together. \nIn Rewilding Our Hearts I argued that by personally rewilding, by undoing the unwilding and by reconnecting and becoming re-enchanted with nature, including other animals, we can overcome negativity and see the world in more positive ways. What I call \u2018the ethology of rewilding\u2019 entails focusing on what we know about who other animals truly are and using this information to come to a deeper appreciation of the similarities and differences among nonhuman animals and between nonhuman and human animals. \nIn this book I also offer what I has morphed into the '12 P's of rewilding\u2019 -- being proactive, positive, persistent, patient, peaceful, practical, powerful, passionate, playful, present, principled, and proud . During the past 3 years the list has grown from 8 P's to 12, and I hope that it will continue to expand over time. \nThe Charter for Animal Compassion \nLet's also keep in mind and heart the Charter for Animal Compassion (please see \" The Charter for Animal Compassion for Non-Humans and Humans \" for an interview I conducted with Rob Percival, its founder and director). Many of the goals of this charter are in line with my Universal Declaration on Animal Sentience (for more discussion please see \" A Universal Declaration on Animal Sentience: No Pretending \") and blend in nicely with the goals of Animal Sentience: An Interdisciplinary Journal on Animal Feeling . \nThe importance of working with youngsters Source: Marc Bekoff \nIt's also essential to work with youngsters. They are the hope for the future and we need to do all we can to help them keep their hopes and their dreams alive. In a project in which youngsters were asked what they're thankful for and what their dreams are, Jane Goodall and I learned that there really is a lot of hope already brewing in youngsters around the world. Drawings by the youngsters and statements about what they're thankful for and what they dream can be seen in Kids and Animals , a book that is available online for free. A wonderful example was provided by Anisa, at a Roots & Shoots program in Barcelona, Spain. Source: Marc Bekoff \nKlara, who lives in Romania, wrote, \"I have a dream: dogs and cats to be free. Happy Birthday to them. I love you!\" Conner, from Denver, Colorado, was thankful for trees, and Claudia, in Italy, wanted all animals to have a lovely and happy family. Kids and Animals is full of inspirational statements and drawings, and I find myself constantly going back to it to rekindle hope and to keep my dreams alive. Source: Marc Bekoff Source: Marc Bekoff \nWorld Animal Day calls on all people to do something for other animals. As Gretchen Wyler famously said, \" Cruelty can't stand the spotlight .\" And, there's no reason that it should. \nWe're most fortunate to have other animals in our lives, and we must work for the day when all of them feel most fortunate to have us in their lives. Everyone who can so something must do something. \nOther animals need all the help they can get. In the long run, we\u2019ll all be better off, nonhuman and human alike, when we work as a united community to make the world a better place for everyone. \nLet's commemorate World Animal Day and make it a global celebration for hope and for better futures for all beings. In fact, I would like to see everyday be World Animal Day. There's really no reason why this can't be so. \nMarc Bekoff\u2019s latest books are Jasper\u2019s Story: Saving Moon Bears (with Jill Robinson); Ignoring Nature No More: The Case for Compassionate Conservation; Why Dogs Hump and Bees Get Depressed: The Fascinating Science of Animal Intelligence , Emotions, Friendship , and Conservation; Rewilding Our Hearts: Building Pathways of Compassion and Coexistence; The Jane Effect: Celebrating Jane Goodall (edited with Dale Peterson); and The Animals\u2019 Agenda: Freedom, Compassion, and Coexistence in the Human Age (with Jessica Pierce).

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE \nIn the last blog, we asked you to evaluate yourself in five areas. The first area had to do with being able to communicate well with other people and being able to talk to other people. A second area had to do with being able to make and maintain friendships and relationships with others. The third had to do with being able to make changes in your life when you need to, e.g., being able to be flexible. The fourth area had to do with how you feel about yourself and your ability to feel positively about yourself and give yourself credit for the accomplishments in your life. The last area had to do with controlling your emotions, especially very strong ones, and especially emotions that other people might perceive as negative, e.g., be anger . \nIn this blog we are again going to present areas of skill or attitude and ask you to look at yourself and ask others how they see you. We're going to pick up where we left off with the issue of being able to manage and control strong emotions. So, I would ask you to look at how good you are at controlling what you do and say when you're upset. Now, this may relate to the previous area, being angry, but it also may relate to simply being hurt or feeling anxious or having other feelings that may be difficult to manage and contain. Dealing with strong feelings. Again, we would like for you to rate yourself on the 5-point scale: Being bad at it. Not so good at it. Okay. Good at it. Very good at it. \nThe seventh area that we would ask you to look at is your ability to be a problem solver .How good you are at solving problems in your life. Again, think about this. Think about challenges and problems that you have dealt with recently and how well you feel you've managed them and been able to find solutions to them and how you've done this. So, look at yourself as a problem solver. Are you: Bad at that? Not so good at it? Okay? Good at it? Very good at it -- meaning that you see yourself as being someone who is very good at managing and solving problems in your own life and perhaps in giving direction and advice to others. \nNumber eight relates to an attitude that we discussed earlier in the previous blog, feeling good about yourself, but this has to do with being able to think positively about your future and being able to be optimistic rather than pessimistic. How do you see yourself? Are you an optimist or are you a pessimist ? Again, ask for some feedback from others and then rate yourself on this scale from 1 to 5. Being bad at thinking positively about myself. Not so good. Okay. Good at it. I'm very good at it, meaning that you see yourself as being an optimistic person most of the time. \nAgain, no one falls into the category of pessimist or optimist all of the time. \nNumber nine has to do with what you tell others you are going to do and your ability to follow through with it. So, do you do what you say? Again, you may want to get some feedback from others about this and how they see you. Do they feel that you keep your commitments to yourself and to other people? Do you follow through? Again, rate yourself on this after you think about it some and after you get some feedback from others.

Posted Oct 03, 2017 MORE Source: pinterest \nEver since I started blogging for Psychology Today, I have used this space to raise new questions or new possibilities for my fellow psychologists and, no less, for psychologists-to-be. I have speculated about such things as why our own poops may not smell , why very gentle touch may provide a new means of rehabilitating stroke victims, and why we might be able to functionally extend our lives by deliberately choosing highly interesting activities that take a long time recall. \nI want to introduce another new possibility here, but as prelude, I want to say that on the day I am writing this (October 3, 2017) I am turning 65. That's an old age by traditional standards, but by today's standards, at least in the part of the world I am privileged to inhabit, the age of 65 is not so old. Rather, it is \"young old\" -- not so old as to be decrepit, but young enough in form and function to let one mingle with folks who are much younger. University students are the main group who help keep me young in this sense, not to mention my daughters, their spouses, and their children, plus, of course, my wife, who, though she is is 4 years older than I, keeps me hopping. \nWhy share these personal remarks? Turning 65, I wonder how I managed to survive this long. Certainly, it was being lucky about my genes , eating well, sleeping well, and so on. But I think there is another reason, a reason that is not generally thought of when one reaches age-related milestones. That other reason is, of all things, my shoes. \nThink about your grandparents when they were 65 or so. In my case, my grandfather always wore a suit and tie and black leather shoes and thin leather soles. My grandmother always wore a heavy dress and thick, rigid \"clod hoppers.\" Her shoes were dowdy and looked like they were designed to be as uncomfortable as possible. \nThe clothes my grandparents wore befitted their station in New York City, where they ran a small business. Ironically, however, they were imprisoned by their clothes. What they could never do was go for long walks with the outfits they had on. Their shoes, in particular, tied them down. I know this because I used to wear leather shoes myself. Sneakers had been around for a while, but they were worn for athletic events only. Hence their name: gym shoes or tennis shoes. Over time it became acceptable to wear sneakers outside the gym. Then \"track shoes\" came along, as did \"walking shoes.\" The latter are soft-sole shoes, often in black leather or some similar-looking material. Walking shoes eschew any pretense of being for jogging. You wear them just to be able to walk, and walk, and walk. \nI honestly think my soft-sole walking shoes played a major role in my reaching the age of 65. With my walking shoes, I can, and typically do, walk about 10,000 steps a day, as confirmed on the activity monitor on my iPhone. Having the activity monitor is helpful, but if my feet ached after walking once around the block, the number of steps would remain low. The pain from my arches would overwhelm whatever sense of guilt or shame I might feel if I saw a paltry number on my iPhone bespeaking loafing rather than locomoting. \nShoes may be more important than we have understood, and likewise for other aspects of our wardrobes, like the light textiles we wear nowadays that keep out rain and cold. Trapesing through the cold while wearing a ponderous pelt weighs you down. Gliding along in a synthetic fabric is so much easier. \nIt is tempting in psychology to explains things in terms of the mind. Our mental states do matter mightily, but so do our environments, as everyone in the field of environmental psychology knows. An aspect of our environment may have more to do with our health than most of us have acknowledged. That aspect is the clothes on our backs and the shoes on our feet. \"Clothes make the man (and woman),\" as the old saying goes. A hypothesis for future research is that clothes conducive to active lifestyles have made our lives more active and also longer.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T07:02:05.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "759d1d478a52e2b1626311e7164f0bd8ac4c3c37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I45oiT.6yq6UNszKupBQID_4JqKw5vHIxK5Eibp9OMXBcghEsAZg98", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Your Healthy Child", "title_full": "Your Healthy Child", "published": "2017-10-04T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/collection_large/public/field_collection_image/kidjumpnpelusi-645x344-0_53-786_420.jpg?itok=BVyzg6gO", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "759d1d478a52e2b1626311e7164f0bd8ac4c3c37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I45oiT.6yq6UNszKupBQID_4JqKw5vHIxK5Eibp9OMXBcghEsAZg98", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "lybi", "published": "2017-10-04T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Your Healthy Child", "text": "Therapists: Log In | Sign Up Your Healthy Child With modern-day worries like nuclear threat and climate change, we worry most about our future generation.

Source: freeimages \nOn March 28, 1979, nuclear reactor number 2 at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania experienced a partial meltdown of its uranium fuel rods. Fortunately the containment vessel was not compromised. Nevertheless, as a result of this meltdown, radioactive gases were released into the atmosphere. This was my first professional response to a disaster. I\u2019m not an engineer nor am I a nuclear physicist. I\u2019m a psychologist. Authorities in Pennsylvania asked me to travel to Three Mile Island to assist those in the Three Mile Island community cope with the psychological impact of the disaster. This was over a decade before the field of disaster mental health would be largely founded. The idea of sending a psychologist to assist a community in its recovery was a novel, if not, seminal thought. Sadly, not everyone was thrilled about my being there. After all, what was all the fuss? No one died, and no one was even injured. It seemed to me, and later research would confirm, there was significant stress and anxiety amongst the people who lived close to the reactors. There was also significant denial. \nIn 1992, Following the seminal work of the International Critical Incident Stress Foundation (a United Nations-affiliated agency created to support the acute psychological health of emergency workers) the American Red Cross fostered the development of a nationwide network of psychological crisis intervention teams which would be deployed along with traditional Red Cross disaster response personnel. These teams were to provide acute psychological support to Red Cross workers, as well as civilian disaster survivors who might be experiencing acute psychological distress. And so the field of disaster psychology was born. I served as founding co-chair of the Central Maryland Red Cross disaster mental health committee. Source: George S. Everly, Jr. \nFrom 1995 to 2001, I was Senior Advisor to the Office of His Highness the Amir of Kuwait. I was appointed to this position to develop programs to foster resiliency in the community of Kuwaiti citizens who lived through the invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraqi forces during the first Gulf War. At that time, there was not a widespread acceptance of the need for mental health services in general, but the adverse psychological consequences of the occupation, such as reactive depression , grief, and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ), were so apparent the need for psychological interventions throughout the Kuwaiti community was self-evident. Source: George S. Everly, Jr. \nBy September 11th, 2001, attitudes had progressed even further. The attacks on the World Trade Center underscored the importance of providing acute psychological support (psychological crisis intervention) to not only civilians, but to emergency workers, as well. I worked in New York City and New Jersey for over a year primarily assisting law enforcement personnel. \nWhat lessons did these early experiences teach me? \n1) With every physical disaster, there will be a psychological disaster. 2) Psychological casualties will always far outnumber physical casualties. 3) Common reactions will include reactive depression, bereavement and grief, profuse generalized anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. 4) While those reactions are relatively common and will usually fade with time, those trained in psychological crisis intervention (think psychological first aid) can help communities, as well as emergency workers, accelerate natural resilience and help people bounce back from the pain associated with disasters more rapidly than might otherwise occur. 5) Communities never truly recover from disasters until a psychological infrastructure of resilience has been fostered (Everly & Lating, 2017) \nAs I left Kuwait in 2001 for the final time, I addressed the Kuwaiti Parliament and asserted that communities impacted by disaster will not recover until the spirit of resilience is nurtured. This is the job of the disaster psychologist. \n(c) George S. Everly, Jr, PhD, 2017. References \nEverly, G.S. & Lating, J.M. (2017). The Johns Hopkins guide to psychological first aid .

Other than acts of terrorism and cruel deliberate violence, I believe floods may be the most psychologically toxic disaster one may encounter. Source: wikicommons \nThis post is being written roughly two weeks after Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico. While the storms destroyed most of the physical infrastructure of the island, I believe with time that will be rebuilt. That with which I am most concerned, however, is the impact the storm has had upon the psychological infrastructure. i.e., humanity. I think of the damage caused to psychological health of those impacted as the \u201chidden wounds of disaster.\u201d \nWhy is flooding so psychologically toxic? Consider the following: \n1) Few places are safe from the ravages of water. The concrete wall that easily withstands 100mph winds will crumble and collapse when water seeps through cracks and seams. 2) So called \u201cstorm cellars\u201d that are built below the ground as protection become easy prey for torrents of water that obey the laws of gravity and follow the paths of least resistance. This will be tragically recalled from the Fukushima Daiichi radiation disaster in the wake of the tsunami and flooding of March 2011. 3) Water attacks power grids. Prolonged loss of power has been shown to be psychologically toxic as it breeds a sense of isolation. Isolation interferes with the single most important factor fostering resilience \u2026staying connected to others. 4) Flood waters interfere with transportation, Transportation is a key to physical recovery. Flood waters are slow to recede so physical as well as psychological recovery is delayed. It is not uncommon to see relief supplies such as water, food, and clothing sitting in staging areas at docks and airports unable to be dsitributed because of the lack of reliable transportation. This often infuriates observers as well as potential recipients who do not understand the problems associated with transportation. 5) Flood waters bring contamination and disease\u2026nothing is truly safe. Even when the waters recede toxic mold is its legacy. \nFrom my experience over 35 years, the net result of all of these factors interacting, is a toxic constellation of frustration, desperation, social disconnection, depression , grief , helplessness, and anger (people often take their sense of hopelessness and turn it into anger and blame toward others, especially the government or even weather forecasters). \nSo how do communities recover from the unique psychological toxicity of flooding? From my experience, the answer resides in communication, patience, tolerance, and connectedness. \n1) Communication is a key to resilience and recovery. When I teach crisis leadership classes, I emphasize there is no such thing as an information vacuum. If leaders are not communicating then someone else is; usually the most angry in the community. This is especially true in the age of social media. Leaders should refrain from using crisis communications to further political agenda. Such actions are divisive, not healing. 2) People must be patient. Flood waters will not be rushed to recede, nor will their filth be quick to be sanitized. 3) People must be tolerant and even forgiving . No recovery process is perfect, nor is it a straight line to resolution. There will be progress and setbacks, more so than other disasters. 4) Lastly, communities must strive to build cohesion. Research suggests cohesion and interpersonal connectedness are the most powerful factors which foster human resilience (Everly, Strouse, & McCormack, 2015).

Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE Source: K. Bialasiewicz/123RF \nUnfolding like terrifying fiction, the horrific scene in Las Vegas likely left millions of children and adults traumatized. Sadly, mass shootings are becoming part of a new world reality that can create emotional scars for years to come unless we are able to heal from them. At these times of senseless tragedy, words of comfort are not enough. \nWhether you witnessed the gunfire personally, acted as a first responder, knew or loved people at the concert, or watched the news coverage on television, your autonomic nervous system was shaken by this traumatic event. According to trauma specialist, Dr. Sharon Stanley, these events trigger memories that reside in our bodies from prior life traumas, hijacking the vagal circuits of our brains. The result? We experience fear and terror throughout our body-mind system. \nAdults and children have stories of trauma that are held in their physical memories. Three months ago, I experienced semi-automatic gunfire for the first time. A deranged shooter, on a sailboat a few feet from my condo window, fired hundreds of rounds across our quiet marina in Puget Sound, WA. After five hours of sheltering in place next to my dying husband, and a standoff with law enforcement, the shooter was killed before he took innocent lives. While this shooting didn\u2019t make the national news, the trauma was real for the hundreds of boaters, property owners, and first responders who experienced the event. \nAs I watched the news coverage of the largest mass shooting in U.S. history, and heard the same sound of automatic gunfire, I was overcome with grief . I held my little spaniel in my arms and melted into a pool of tears. Initially, I cried for the victims and the senseless horror of it all. But then, as Dr. Stanley suggested, this shooting triggered memories of my own trauma and of the day my husband died of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease. I was immobilized with fear, barely able to move for several moments. \nMy reaction to the shooting in Las Vegas was an example of the autonomic nervous system at work during times of stress . In Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst (2017), Dr. Robert Sapolsky, suggests that the autonomic nervous system is more powerful than our thoughts and emotions. It\u2019s a part of the brain that is not changed through logic, words, or avoidance. \nOur reactions to trauma create persistent patterns in our autonomic nervous systems that can live on throughout our lives, and can even be transmitted to the next generation, according to Dr. Stephen Porges in The Pocket Guide to the Polyvagal Theory: The Transformative Power of Feeling Safe . These universal neural processes are why the victims of mass shootings, and survivors of many types of trauma, relive their experiences in their bodies each time a new tragic event occurs. Embodied trauma causes feelings of anxiety, panic , abandonment, worthlessness, and other core emotional experiences. \nAmidst this background of neuroscientific evidence that all of us have embodied trauma, there is positive news. When we attend to the effects of trauma on our brain, research suggests we and our children can build and strengthen our abilities to adapt to the many adversities of modern life. \nAn empathetic and safe relationship with a skilled person can regulate the effects of trauma on the brain. Dr. Sharon Stanley, author of Relational and Body-Centered Practices for Healing Trauma: Lifting the Burdens of the Past, suggests that specific interventions can restore the autonomic nervous system. 8 Steps to Help a Child or Adult Heal from Trauma \nI reached out to Dr. Stanley to find out how parents , teachers, counselors, and other helpers can be most effective in helping children and adults feel safe and heal from trauma after a tragedy such as the shooting in Las Vegas. She provided the following brain-based intervention, grounded in the latest neuroscientific research. \nThis step-by-step process for calming and restoring the autonomic nervous system can help transform fear and terror into resilience . It is designed to be used by an empathetic, compassionate adult, working with another adult or child to help that person process trauma. To heal from past, unresolved traumas, Dr. Stanley recommends working with a professional in the field of trauma and body-based therapies. Prepare yourself . To be helpful to a person who has experienced a traumatic event, you need to be calm and attuned to the person you are helping. Begin this process by bringing awareness to your own body and breath, and by connecting to your compassionate heart. Familiarize yourself with all the next steps and imagine supporting another person in this way. Establish safety . Assure the person that you will stay with them. Use language that reflects the age and ability of the other to understand and feel connected to you. \u201cI want to help you, and I am going to stay with you as long as you need me.\u201d Educate . Let the person know how you can help them. \u201cBrain science teaches us that getting beyond terrifying events has more to do with calming our nervous system than any particular words we speak. This event has likely caused trauma in your body; and it doesn\u2019t yet know that you are safe. I would like to help you, if that feels okay with you.\u201d Explain that you can guide them in some simple exercises that can help them feel safe, calm, and in control again. Tell them that you will be doing these exercises with them and that you will pause to ask how they are doing, and that they can say \u201cstop\u201d at any time. Start slowly. Your voice should be soft, calming, and slow. Ask \u201cWhat happened that you would like me to know about?\u201d Listen to the story and watch the person until you notice changes in their body or agitation, like a sudden change in skin tone (grey, pale, redness), tone of voice, eyes, posture, or tears. As soon as you notice one of these changes, ask them to pause the story. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to tune into what your body is telling us.\u201d Establish somatic empathy . Make sure the person is comfortable with both feet on the ground. Feel into the experience of the other as you watch their face, eyes, and body posture. Tune into their body\u2019s story. \u201cTell me what\u2019s happening in your body right now?\u201d (heart hurts, jaw is tight, nauseous, etc.) Notice what is happening in your own body. This is called somatic empathy, your ability to feel what another person feels in their body. Sense gravity. Both the helper and the person being helped are now in a relationship to release trauma and calm the autonomic nervous system. Invite the person to feel the ground with their feet. When you sense they can feel the ground, invite them to see if they can feel how gravity pulls their feet to the earth. You can ask them to lift one leg and let it drop. What\u2019s important is to allow the person to sense gravity and how it pulls our bodies to the earth. Continue to notice your own body\u2019s sensations. Engage with gravity . When we can feel gravity, we can release tension from trauma into the earth. Return to what the person is experiencing in their body. \u201cWhen you notice the tightness in your heart, imagine gravity pulling the tension down into the earth.\u201d Invite the person to make slow, small movements in their facial and neck muscles. This encourages healing neural activity. Then return to other areas that feel tension and repeat the process of letting go. A release of tension may be accompanied by a sigh, deep breath, or movement. As this process evolves, you are watching the person become more calm and restful. You will notice this in their face and posture. What enables the nervous system to recover its natural vitality is twofold: 1) somatic empathy between the helper and the person being helped, and 2) the physical release of tension into the earth. Reflect and rest .

Posted Oct 04, 2017 This post is in response to Green Tea May Ameliorate Brain Drain Linked to Western Diets by Christopher Bergland Source: Pixabay/Creative Commons \nFor the first time, researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), have identified that the polyphenols in black tea alter gut microbiome profiles in a way that inhibited weight gain for mice who were being fed a high-fat/high-sucrose \"obesogenic\" diet. \nBy changing gut metabolites and intestinal microflora, it appears that black tea alters energy metabolism in the liver of mice in ways that promote weight loss. Green tea was also found to have anti-obesogenic effects but via a different molecular alteration of gut microbiota. These findings were published online, September 30, in the European Journal of Nutrition . \nEach of us has trillions of microorganisms and diverse bacterial communities\u2014commonly referred to as microbiome or gut microbiota \u2014residing in our gastrointestinal tract at any given time. Microbiota is a diverse ecological community of microorganisms that are generally a combination of both beneficial \u201cgood bacteria\u201d and potentially harmful bacteria. The human gut is similar to that of a mouse and generally harbors over 100 trillion microorganisms. Microbiome colonies begin to reside within our intestines immediately after birth and are vital to the healthy development of your immune system and are associated with various important neurobiological and physiological functions. Use Common Sense: Consuming Synthesized Tea Extracts Can Be Dangerous \nBefore jumping to any conclusions about the human implications of this study, there is an important disclaimer: The fact that scientists have identified a correlative link between green/black tea polyphenols, changes in gut microbiome, and decreased weight gain in mice being fed an obesogenic diet does not mean that anyone should begin taking tea extracts in a pill form or drinking excessive amounts of tea in attempt to lose weight. Highly concentrated or synthesized components found in tea can be toxic. Please use common sense and consult with your primary care physician before making any dramatic changes to your diet or taking over-the-counter supplements . \nThat said, these new UCLA findings shed light on the extremely complex but exciting possibilities that green and black tea might potentially have on our gut microbiome communities and the molecular ripple effect that changes in microflora can create throughout our minds and bodies. Source: arloo/Shutterstock \nMore specifically, the researchers found that both green tea (GT) and black tea (BT) resulted in a decrease of Firmicutes gut bacteria and an increase of Bacteroidetes . Additionally, the relative proportions of Blautia , Bryantella , Collinsella , Lactobacillus , Marvinbryantia , Turicibacter , Barnesiella , and Parabacteroides were correlated with weight loss in mice on an obesogenic diet who consumed GT or BT extracts. Basically, this means that green and black tea decreased the percentage of microbiota associated with obesity while increasing gut bacteria associated with lean body mass. \nNotably, only mice that consumed black tea extract displayed an increase in the Pseudobutyrivibrio bacteria, which might explain the difference between how black tea and green tea change energy metabolism. \nThe UCLA research team was able to pinpoint that black tea polyphenols\u2014which are too large to be absorbed in the small intestines\u2014stimulated the growth of gut bacterium and the formation of short-chain fatty acids, which are a type of bacterial metabolites previously found to alter energy metabolism in the liver. \nIn a statement, Susanne Henning , the study's lead author and adjunct professor at the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition , said: \"It was known that green tea polyphenols are more effective and offer more health benefits than black tea polyphenols since green tea chemicals are absorbed into the blood and tissue. Our new findings suggest that black tea, through a specific mechanism through the gut microbiome, may also contribute to good health and weight loss in humans.\" \nZhaoping Li , director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, chief of the UCLA Division of Clinical Nutrition and the study's senior author, added: \"The findings suggest that the health benefits of both green tea and black tea go beyond their antioxidant benefits and that both teas have a strong impact on the gut microbiome.\" \nHenning summed up the main takeaway of her team's findings: \"The results suggest that both green and black teas are prebiotics, substances that induce the growth of good microorganisms that contribute to a person's well-being. For black tea lovers, there may be a new reason to keep drinking it.\u201d \nAgain, please use common sense when making any significant changes to your diet . These laboratory findings on mice being fed an obesogenic diet offer exciting insights into how polyphenols in black and green tea alter gut microbiome profiles in animals, but should not be misconstrued as a reason to drink copious amounts of tea or to take synthesized tea extracts in an attempt to lose weight while still eating a high-fat/high-sugar diet.

Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE Source: AntonioGiullem/iStockPhoto \nAlexis hugs a pillow to her chest as she swallows hard. \u201cDoc, I know you want me to tell him how I feel, but...It\u2019s like there\u2019s a block in my throat.\u201d She seems to choke on her words when she senses conflict. She describes a fight she had with her boyfriend over dinner last night, and how it ended with her crying while he asked, \u201cWhat did I do? Just tell me!\u201d as he watched her withdraw into herself. Alexis knows that her voice hasn't been the same since high school when a supposed friend violated her space and left scars deep within her psyche. Even though many years have passed, she still freezes when she feels threatened, hiding behind a curtain of long brown hair and silence. \nIf you\u2019ve ever loved someone who has been through the burning flames of physical or emotional abuse, there is a possibility that he or she has developed a complex posttraumatic stress disorder. In short, once an individual has been forced to endure the prolonged and repeated infliction of pain at the hands of someone they trust, they may have a hard time trusting anyone again. They may experience symptoms of complex trauma such as problems with emotion regulation , impulse control , focus, dissociation, and interpersonal relationships (van der Kolk, 2014). And the very nature of those symptoms means that it is often impossible for the sufferer to speak about what they are experiencing. Instead, they may shut down or react in defensive anger . \nWhat they may actually be trying to communicate is: \n1. When I feel threatened, it is hard for me to speak. The key word in that sentence is \u201cfeel.\u201d You may not have actually lifted your hand or said something hurtful, and yet you may have triggered a fear that is mired in his or her past. Survivors of trauma often have overactive adrenal responses to threat, which means that when they register a threat to their emotional or physical safety, the blood rushes from their brains down to their extremities, readying their bodies to fight or flee. These involuntary protective mechanisms place a very real limitation on the biological functions necessary to communicate (Perry, 2009). \n2. When I do speak up and tell you how I feel, know that this was a Herculean effort. Steven Porges (2011) identified as a dorsal vagal complex to severe threat, during which the brain shuts down non-essential functions like speech, and lowers metabolism throughout the body, leading to an internal collapse in a state known as \u201cfreeze.\u201d This often appears as complete shut down: silence, lack of facial expression or interaction. Therefore, when your beloved survivor does try and speak in moments of conflict, be sure to listen, validate, and honor those words. As Alexis said to me during one tearful session, \u201cjust\u2026just treat my words like little butterflies. If you crush them, they\u2019ll die forever.\u201d \n3. I might have sudden extreme reactions that only make perfect sense if you understand how they happen. Imagine being plunged into a boiling hot bathtub; you would most likely scream, \u201cOuch!\u201d Now imagine that the pain receptors in your body have been damaged, and you are in the tub, watching time pass by for a while before you notice third-degree burns on your body. Your scream may be sudden, and loud, and disproportionate to your seeming relaxation just moments before. This actually makes perfect sense if you factor in those damaged nerves. \nMRI studies show that adult women who have been abused as children have hippocampal regions that are 18 percent smaller than those of a control group (Vythilingam et al., 2002). This means that the part of the brain responsible for regulating emotions is compromised. The survivor may not know how to read her own internal signals that tell her she is starting to feel hurt or upset. This makes sense because she has learned to ignore her own gut instincts. Therefore, when she finally realizes, with a jolt, that she feels afraid or hurt, she may react impulsively in a manner that seems extreme for a given situation. \n4. I might blame myself for things that I have not caused. There are times when I will deny my own needs to reduce or avoid conflict. Object relations theory is an organized way of understanding relationship dynamics (Klein, M. as cited by Kernberg, 1988). The theory posits that infants use projective identification to cope with neglect or abuse. If babies could string sentences together, it might sound like this, \u201cWell my mother is ignoring my cries. It is too dangerous and painful for me, being so tiny and helpless, to believe she doesn\u2019t care about me. So instead I\u2019m going to decide that I\u2019m a bad baby and she is a wonderful, loving mother.\u201d The self-blame is a way for the infant to maintain the necessary illusion of a safe and loving caregiver . \nObject relations theory begins in early childhood , but without intervention, those patterns of belief can last way into adulthood. In real time, this means that you may see your loved one blame himself for any conflict in your relationship, even when you are the one at fault. As the concerned wife of one trauma survivor described, \u201cWhen I get home from work in a bad mood, and he feels the stress radiating off my body, he darts around the house cleaning everything in sight. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d Well, that\u2019s because on a completely unconscious level he might blame himself for your mood. \n5. Please do not diagnose or label me. You may think you know what your partner has been through as a child, or you may recognize that s/he has some of these symptoms. Remember that trauma can only be diagnosed by a qualified mental health professional that has performed a comprehensive clinical evaluation. It is possible for children and adults to survive unthinkable conditions without developing trauma diagnoses. It is also possible for people to develop trauma symptomology from incidents you may not think are \u201cthat bad.\u201d \n6. If you are not up to the task, gently let me go. It is not uncommon for trauma survivors to unconsciously replay the past by choosing partners who have their own relational challenges. This creates the potential for cycles of abuse to continue on and on, hurting both partners in the process. You might feel yourself beginning to fray at the seams and act in ways that do not make you feel proud. You may realize that you are increasingly sacrificing your priorities and needs and feeling resentful as a result. These are signs that it may be time to let go or take a break so that each of you may pursue individual paths to healing. \nAll those among us who try to open their hearts following abuse: they are true heroes. We can honor the bravery of complex trauma survivors by tuning into their needs and creating a space for connection and trust. Within that secure space, we may get to see incredible strength, the kind that can inspire us to be better versions of ourselves. And when we embrace those who have survived the worst sorts of mistreatment, we can ensure that hate will not win in the world around us. References \nKernberg, O. F. (1988).

Posted Oct 04, 2017 \nBad things happen. \nAnd this was one of the worst. \nIf you somehow haven't heard yet, a gunman opened fire on a crowd in Las Vegas, killed at least 59 people, and injured hundreds more before killing himself. As a magician, I've got a lot of friends in Las Vegas, and I spend a lot of time on the strip (I'll be there next week, in fact.) So add that to the list of why the news horrified me. First and foremost though, was the fact that something like this could even happen. I mean...what are we doing? \nMore importantly, what can we do to stop it from happening? \nWell, I don't have all the answers. I'm just as blown away by this as I hope you are. (Complacency is a bad sign...watch out for it.) \nDo we blame the usual suspects? TV? Violent video games? Religious or political extremism? Lack of gun control? Pharmaceutical companies pushing their mood-altering pills? The news media? The Insane Clown Posse??? \nI recently read some compelling research on wartime PTSD ( post-traumatic stress disorder ). The researchers found that it isn't the constant risk or threat of dying that does all the damage to the brain . It's the killing that does it. \nEven drone pilots, who are far away from the battlefield and in almost zero danger themselves, suffer from PTSD at the same rates as soldiers who are in the thick of battle. But yet, medics and sailors working right alongside those soldiers in the high-risk areas suffered low rates of psychiatric breakdown. It seems that trying to kill people messes you up more than having people trying to kill you. Killin' Ain't Easy \nAfter the Battle of Gettysburg, something interesting was discovered. Out of the 27,000 single-load muskets recovered, nearly 24,000 of them were loaded, but unfired. Out of those, half were loaded multiple times, but still...unfired. \nThat's a lot of soldiers thinking about killing, but never doing so - even with the other guys trying to kill them. \"Nah, I'll just re-load again while they shoot at me.\" (Most deaths at Gettysburg were caused by artillery, not infantry.) \nThere was a similar pattern in WWII. Only 15-20 percent of riflemen ever fired their guns. Thankfully, looking at another human being through the crosshairs and pulling the trigger ain't easy. Unfortunately, We've Gotten Better At It. \nMilitaries train their soldiers better now and technology makes it possible to kill at greater and greater distances. Wartime propaganda also helps to make killing easier. They all aim to do one thing... \nDehumanize the enemy. \nThe Rwandan genocide killed people at five times the rate of the Nazi Holocaust. One out of every seven Rwandans died. Worse, they were not killed with bombs or tanks, but sticks and machetes. Close-range. Personal. \nIn order to make that happen, some serious dehumanization needed to take place. It was beyond \"Us\" vs. \"Them\" for the Hutus. It was \"They are not even human, and every Tutsi must die.\" \nThe Hutus didn't call them Tutsis though. They called them only \" cockroaches .\" Cockroaches that must be \"stamped out.\" \nThat's the essential ingredient to killing. Looking at your victims as less than human. That kind of dehumanization is undoubtedly what allowed Stephen Paddock to massacre dozens of people, and then immediately massacre dozens more. The Single Greatest Threat to Us...And a Solution \nI believe dehumanization is the single greatest threat to our way of life. It can show up in a big way on the Las Vegas strip, or it can show up in small ways every single day. Some tiny examples of dehumanization: Someone says, \"I hate lawyers\". You nod. Someone tells a racist joke. You laugh . An NFL player kneels during the anthem. You want them off your planet. The lunch table at work erupts in complaints about the boss. You get fired up. \"Damn the man!\" \nIt's a slow killer, but a killer nonetheless. \nThe solution is to \"rehumanize.\" Strive to understand their core values - family, freedom, desire for survival, etc. Note the similarities to your own. Imagine what a day is like for \"one of them\" - start to finish. Consider each person you meet as an individual and not as a member of a group. Engage one or more of \"them\" in conversation. Ask lots of questions and try not to turn it into a debate. \nNo, we can't remove every violent video game from the world or censor every hip hop artist we don't like or take away everyone's mobile device or eliminate all the guns, etc. etc. \nBut we can focus on finding more human connection in our own lives. We can search for opportunities to create small moments of connection at work, or in our families, or in our communities. We can try to find another human buried somewhere in our mind's \"THEM\" pile. \nIf there's one thing we've lost, it's the small spaces (and the permission) to create connection. Everyone is busy. Everyone is staring at their phone. Everyone is so laser-focused on the bottom line. There is so much content to consume that every waking moment is filled to the brim with hyper-stimulation and nothing is left over for those small moments of connection. \nAgain, I don't have all the answers.

Predictably, the parental response was, \u201cIf all the kids jumped off the Empire State Building, would you jump, too?\u201d \nParents : 1, Kids: 0. Down in flaming defeat. Source: Pexels / Marianna \nFlash forward to adulthood, and our desire for being part of the crowd hasn\u2019t abandoned our psyche, especially when it comes to making financial decisions. \nRegardless of the crush of popular items out there, we generally move in lockstep. We want to buy the hot stock, the popular hedge fund, the cryptocurrency, rental real estate\u2014or wherever the herd is heading. We watch cable news, buy subscriptions to newsletters that promise success. It\u2019s ingrained in our brains to follow the group in hopes for success. Standing alone and apart is not cool\u2014rather it\u2019s lonely and requires a level of courage and self-knowledge; two characteristics that go and hand in hand. \nSocrates said, \u201cKnow thyself\u201d hailing anyone to stop and understand three important things: Who you are What motivates you Why you make the decisions you do. \nIn other words, \u201cbecause\u201d just doesn\u2019t cut it. \u201cBecause everyone\u2019s doing it\u201d is irrelevant and unwise. But let\u2019s face it\u2014we live in a society where FOMO is prevalent, where we typically lack a deep understanding of topics beyond our specialty or our interests (except where we\u2019ve devoted time and effort to learn and master). \nHere are some common beliefs I have heard: You cannot lose money buying rental real estate. I don\u2019t need life insurance, if I die, my wife will get remarried. Hedge funds are a slam dunk, they protect your money from loss. My kids will go to college on sports scholarships. It\u2019s stupid to buy anything other than US stocks. It\u2019s important to load up on stock in the company I work for. Social security will cover my needs in retirement . Keeping cash in an emergency fund is dumb; better to invest the funds and allow your money to grow. \nThese examples come from the mouths of intelligent and successful people who firmly believe their statements are true. The reality is, they are shrieking statements of either magical thinking , misinformation, or a mental dam that for some reason has inserted itself into their belief system. In any event, they are great examples of the antithesis of \u201cknow thyself.\u201d \nIn order to move closer to Socrates\u2019 exhortation, begin by examining the data, as follows: What do I believe? Why do I believe it? Is it objective fact or just an opinion that I\u2019ve adopted as my own? What do I really know about the topic and more importantly, what don\u2019t I know \nThere are so many decisions to make in navigating your financial life\u2014and many are not qualified to make the mandatory decisions involved in financial planning. Trying to make all the right choices for yourself and your family is onerous at best. There are many DIYer\u2019s who believe they are best equipped to make the right choices. Becoming sufficiently knowledgeable in all areas of financial matters requires ample time and education . While some may have this time and education, very few have the objectivity necessary to consistently make the right decisions. \nThere are many who work with stockbrokers and insurance salespeople who believe that their recommendations are made without prejudice or self-interest. Sadly, too few question the motivations of those who earn their living from the products you purchase. Somehow, most consumers believe they are suitably knowledgeable and objective. \nRather than look inside to lay bare the lack of experience and knowledge, following the crowd is easier and more comfortable. Remember, there is no shame in not having the knowledge or experience\u2014if it\u2019s not your occupation or something in which you\u2019ve studied or been trained, why would you be an expert? [Hint: if you didn\u2019t go to medical school but you look at WebMD, you\u2019re not a doctor!] \nThe challenge is to carve a path to your success by knowing what you know and what you don\u2019t know; without blame or shame. Align yourself with experts who will help you navigate the many decisions in an objective manner. Do not align yourself with those who profit by selling you a product. Continue to explore the \u201cwhy\u201d of your decisions and what exactly impacts your thinking. \nSocrates had it right in that real self-knowledge was bedrock to living authentically and with meaning.

And I imagine you as a playful soul, always open to the possibility of even a bigger playground, even more amazing things to play with. And have I got some good news for you! \nThose most infinite of all playgrounds, as well as the most infinite of playthings, are playgrounds and playthings of imagination, itself. Imaginary playgrounds. Imaginary playthings. \nSo I decided to imagine you. And then write this whole thing as if this it were written only for you, my imagined you. And maybe, from time to time, imagine us writing it together. \nReally. Together. \nLet me explain: \nLet\u2019s pretend that maybe there is no difference, no distance between what you read and what I write. And despite the delight, the brilliance, the sheer magnitude of what I find words for - you also are also finding words for. You assemble these words together, imagine them into being, make them make sense, vision, sound. You give them voice, even. \nSo, really, we are the writers of this article. As you read it, you write it. It becomes yours. You put the words together into a vision. It is your book, too. \nMay we both learn from it. May we both find delight and meaning and deep, deep fun. \nAnd let\u2019s build marvels of fun in our imaginary playgrounds - so marvelous and so marvelously powerful that, though they don\u2019t rely on any tool or object or anything we think of as \u201creal,\u201d they can become part of reality, they can change reality. \nIt is in these infinite playgrounds, in the very nature of infinite playthings, in the things we make up, pretend, imagine; that we play with the powers of the soul. We can pretend that we, ourselves, are infinite, both individually and collectively, infinitely. \nBecause, as you know so well, we playful beings have a lot of different playgrounds. Give us a bunch of marbles, packaged or pretend, and we create a marble-ous playground where everything is a target or a ramp or a tunnel - something to roll over or under or through or into. Give us an imaginary whistle (I mean the best imaginary whistle we can imagine) and everything is about how long and how loud and how many different ways we can make it sound. Better yet, give everybody a whistle. And an imaginary playground for sound (every, any sound), played on the ultimate instrument of our imaginary voice. \nEvery toy, by its very toyness, a door to yet another playground. We grown-ups call these playgrounds \u201chobbies.\u201d We professional grown-ups call them work. We whittle. We carve. We sculpt. And each opens its own world that exists for us only as long as we keep whittling and carving, blowing and rolling, working and making. As soon as we stop playing, as we must eventually do, the play becomes finite, formed, fixed, a \u201cwork.\u201d \nAll these playgrounds, even the one this article is in, involve what we call \u201cimagination.\u201d \nImagination is \u201cthe infinite playground.\u201d \nThe power of imagination makes us infinite. -John Muir", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john muir", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T17:41:27.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16e2498478eb4df1bfe3e85ca6f07bb9e7e1f66f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KhUqtmTUuOjCerBrCkMtVYut5zed8PY9KYAQL3u6W.1QylvKYS6QwjS_29_fhOlRME1d2F1Yonfd_bjZ7f_i96", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/essentials/feed", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today - Essentials", "title": "Mass Killings: An Evolutionary Perspective", "title_full": "Mass Killings: An Evolutionary Perspective", "published": "2017-10-04T17:36:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/stock-photo-red-rose-on-a-grave-338967872.jpg?itok=zHyLtRdR", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16e2498478eb4df1bfe3e85ca6f07bb9e7e1f66f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KhUqtmTUuOjCerBrCkMtVYut5zed8PY9KYAQL3u6W.1QylvKYS6QwjS_29_fhOlRME1d2F1Yonfd_bjZ7f_i96", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robert J King Ph.D.", "published": "2017-10-04T17:36:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mass Killings: An Evolutionary Perspective", "text": "This post is in response to Running Amok: Why Are Virtually All Spree Killers Men? by Michael Mills \n(Typically, I wait until our work has gone through peer review before blogging about it. This work is technically in review at the moment, but several people (including journalists) have asked about it for reasons that will shortly become obvious.) Mass Killing \nMass killings are unusual events but devastating when they occur. Although the absolute risk of dying at the hands of such a killer is low, people stubbornly refuse statisticians\u2019 earnest assurances of relative safety. This should not surprise us. Mass killings are, among many other things, a deliberate attempt to drive a wedge into the existing social order. That is why they are public, and why the killer seeks to maximise attention, and rarely seeks to escape. Some of these motives are obviously political\u2014the intent is to sow fear and destabilize government --and I am not going to have anything much to say about those. What about people with more individual motives? \nAttention to our evolved natures can cast some light on this. (1) Notice I say some light. The evolutionary perspective adds depth to existing accounts\u2014it is an \u201cadded value\u201d aspect of psychology, not a replacement for other\u2014more local\u2014explanations such as individual pathology, or why a location or victim was chosen. \nI\u2019ve likened the evolutionary account of a trait , to knowing the etymology of a word. For instance, knowing that the origin of the word \u201clemur\u201d (those beautiful dark-eyed primates) comes from the Latin for \u201cspirits of the dead\u201d adds something to our understanding of the word. Not everything. Something . Sorry to have to keep saying this but, well, apparently I have to keep saying this. Let\u2019s move on. Status \nMale humans swim in worlds of status like trout swim in complex currents of water. Anyone who is not aware of this (or in denial about it) finds things like the high rates of male suicide or the fact that males are massively over-represented in apparently senseless crimes, utterly baffling. (2) Glib talk of \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d barely scratches the surface of what is going on. (3) \u201cToxic\u201d does not explain the half of it, and it is worth noting that even the most toxic of masculinity does not put off all possible sexual partners. As Ogas and Gaddam (2012) note \u201cIt turns out that killing people is an effective way to elicit the attention of many women: virtually every serial killer, including Ted Bundy, Charles Manson, and David Berkowitz, has received love letters from large numbers of female fans\u201d (p. 98). (4) \nRemember\u2014we have done the genetic analysis and most males (60 percent) do not reproduce. Status is exquisitely linked to male reproductive success, and males who were blind to its ups and downs have simply not had descendants. Call it \u201cface\u201d; call it \u201chonor\u201d; call it \u201cstatus\u201d or call it \u201cprestige\u201d. We are all descended from men who cared about it. (5) \nWe might have tamed it somewhat in modern society. We give it useful outlets. Sport. Awards at work. Elaborate rituals where we show that a person has so much status to spare, that they can even survive being roasted by professional comedians. Sometimes, in some individuals, and for reasons that we still do not understand, this pressure to value status can go very badly awry. \nThis has happened across time and space. There is even a Malay word, \u201cAmok\u201d which has passed into the language as \u201crunning amok\u201d. Young (usually) Malay men would, for reasons unknown, attack innocent bystanders, usually with knives, sometimes with grenades. We used to think that this was what was called a \u201cculture bound syndrome\u201d, but we know better now. Indeed, \u201camok\u201d has been dropped from the current DSM-5. Instead, we have \u201crampage\u201d or \u201cspree\u201d killers. For simplicity sake I shall group all these together as \u201cmass\u201d killings\u2014where five or more people, often unknown to the perpetrator, are killed\u2014sometimes in multiple locations. (6) Data Gathering \nWe carried out an archival study of seventy mass killers going back nearly a hundred years. Our methodology was highly conservative. We relied on only using archival accounts where we could double (or triple) up on the independent corroboration of details. Media tends to get highly speculative (and often political) about these events, and we did not want to get taken down any garden paths. In addition, we restricted the search to North America\u2014for a couple of interesting reasons. \nOne\u2014the ready presence of firearms makes the expression of such murderous desires much easier to compare between events. For instance, once we started to search we found a host of mass killing attempts across the world. But many of these used knives, or vehicles, and thus tended to injure rather than kill. We have little doubt that these people had exactly the same murderous intents\u2014but they could not carry them out as effectively. \nTwo, America has an efficient (some would say intrusive) media. It was comparatively easy to obtain a decent level of archival detail. Analysis \nLatent Class Analysis is a great statistical technique that allows you to feed a bunch of different types of data in at one end, and crank out otherwise hard to notice patterns at the other. So that\u2019s what we did. We fed in as much data as we could get\u2014age, numbers of victims, type of clothing worn, personal history, recent personal events, and so on, turned the statistical handle, and saw what patterns emerged. \nWhat we found was very interesting, and a reminder that averages can often be highly misleading. Although the average age for the mass killers in our sample was 33, this number was highly unrepresentative of the population. The range of ages was from 11 (yes, really) to 66\u2014which is pretty broad in and of itself. Even more interesting was that the distribution of ages had two peaks (what is technically called a \u201cbimodal\u201d distribution). And\u2014this is the really surprising part, the two groups that clustered around these age peaks could not have been more different from one another. Figure 1. Bimodal distribution of age of spree killers in American population. Source: Source: Author \nThe younger group (average age 23) tended to have been in trouble with the law, they were more likely to have had mental illness. In other words\u2014at the age where young men are acquiring status, and the skills and abilities that will enable them to do so\u2014they were, in fact, acquiring signs that they were on a fast track to reproductive oblivion. In ancestral times\u2014times without highly trained and equipped SWAT teams --a \u201cHail Mary\u201d attempt to attract attention and make \u2018them\u2019 take you seriously might (just might) have worked. This age group also tended to be less likely to be killed during their killing spree, and follow-up work we are doing suggests that many of this type do attract a significant amount of female attention when in prison. (7) \nThe older group (average age 41) were much more likely to be married, and maybe have families. They were less likely to have had prior signs of legal issues or of mental illness. But a peek into their personal details (so far as we were able) revealed that they had a pattern of recent status loss--or threat of same. A job. A relationship. Custody battles. A looming scandal. These older guys were not so much trying to acquire status, their actions looked more like a highly pathological attempt to not lose it. No more rational than the desperate \u201cIf I cannot have you then no-one can\u201d actions of a jealous murderer, the role of status possibly sheds some light on their final act . \nThese age clusters map pretty closely onto the curves for male reproductive fitness. As men acquire status they fit the first type, as they potentially lose it, they fit the second. \nMale and female reproductive value compared Source: Source: Michael Lowry (with permission) \nA lot of things did overlap between the groups. Reputational slights are, especially when we are talking about paranoid and unstable individuals, somewhat in the eye of the beholder. We might never be able to see all of these events coming. Specifically, we have no insight into what particular actions and victim selection means to the perpetrator. But, without the realization that status is likely to always be a component of that meaning, we will not have a complete picture. (8) References \n1) Buss, D. M. (2005).

Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE Source: DepositPhotos/VIA Institute \nGrowing up Catholic I was always fascinated by St. Francis of Assisi. My mom would say this is because I loved his love for animals. He is often depicted in paintings and sculptures as being surrounded by small animals. There are stories of how he saved a village by taming a vicious wolf and how he preached to flocks of birds. Also, I\u2019m high in the strength referred to as \u201cappreciation of beauty \u201d and no doubt I was enjoying learning about someone who shared this strength. \nI\u2019ve had the opportunity to counsel many Franciscan priests, friars, and leaders over the years, and as a whole, there are a number of positive qualities I would use to describe them. One in particular stands out: gentleness. \nPerhaps these men and women are following in the footsteps of their cherished saint? More on this later. \nToday, October 4th, is the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi. Feast days are times to remember and celebrate the benefits that the saint brought forth to the world. St. Francis is regarded as the patron saint of animals and of the environment, therefore, people tend to pray in his name when they have a wounded or sick animal or around issues of climate change . \nIn his short life (about 44 years), St. Francis founded religious communities for both men and women. Despite being an influential leader, he emphasized and lived a humble life of poverty. He was not afraid to connect with people of other faiths and was deeply caring for the environment and all living beings. He was so dedicated to living life in a Christ-like way \u2013 some say more than any other human being \u2013 that he is sometimes remembered as alter Christus (\u201canother Christ\u201d). \nWhen the average person hears the word \u201csaint,\u201d one of the first to usually come to mind is St. Francis. Stories of his life abound in works of art, movies, music, and writings. Despite his fame, no one seems to say much about his character strengths - who he was at his core. \nLet\u2019s examine St. Francis through the lens of his core character. To do this, a Franciscan scholar, someone who knows more about the details, nuances, and psyche of St. Francis than 99.99% of people, Jean Francois Godet-Calogeras, took on a unique project. Jean Francois took the gold-standard test for measuring character strengths, the VIA Survey , as if, he were St. Francis of Assisi. The results are very interesting. Here are some of the details that shed light on the character of this fascinating saint. \n1.) Lots of high strengths! \nFirst, there are so many highly rated character strengths it poses challenges to those interpreting the results. There are several potential meanings for this but the one that\u2019s most likely in this situation is that St. Francis was a character-driven person. He lived and preached goodness. He insisted on living in poverty which kept him balanced and grounded. This helped him to simultaneously achieve many things and maintain a focus on spirituality and living a life of many strengths. \n2.) Signature strengths \nIt has been found in scientific studies that those strengths highest in one\u2019s VIA Survey profile are signature strengths \u2013 those most essential to who you are. St. Francis\u2019 5 highest strengths, all tied for #1, slightly beating out the others, are (in no particular order): appreciation of beauty/excellence, love, gratitude , spirituality, and zest. \nThis returns me to my observation of Franciscans I made earlier on gentleness. While gentleness is not a specific character strength, it might be best described as a \u201ccompound strength\u201d \u2013 a combination of several character strengths. Perhaps many of these top strengths of St. Francis \u2013 when brought together \u2013 reflect gentleness? Someone who is grounded in gratitude yet looks outside themselves to connect with the sacred (spirituality) and with the \u201clittle things\u201d in nature (appreciation of beauty) while maintaining a high level of warmth and care in how they treat others (love)? \nAnother observation is that these 5 strengths strongly represent heart-oriented strengths. Heart strengths are those character strengths that are more emotion-based and easily felt in our bodies. They tend to be humanity oriented and important for connecting with others. \n3.) More signature strengths \nClosely following the top 5 strengths is another cluster of 5 strengths that perhaps round out the unique character of St. Francis. These are bravery, curiosity, humor , judgment/critical thinking, and kindness. These strengths show St. Francis was not afraid to take risks and to face opposition. At the same time, he had strong capacities for connecting with others, as well as offering support and care for them. He was able to balance his expression of heart with expression of mind, logic, and analysis. \nMaking it Practical \nWe know that one of the most important ways to enable character strengths is through role modeling. Many people \u2013 Christians and non-Christians alike \u2013 uphold St. Francis of Assisi as a role model. Having a greater sense of the signature strengths of St. Francis can give us something substantive (and realistic) to pursue. Rather than trying to \"be him,\" try to be more like his best qualities. \nHow might you be like St. Francis and bring forth more gratitude or appreciation of beauty in your life? How about enabling your love, spirituality, or zest? It just might make you more gentle. \nWith gratitude \nSpecial thanks to Jean-Francois Godet-Calogeras for engaging in this project several years ago.

When 59 people can be killed and over 500 injured by a single man in less than 12 minutes, those who are already anxious begin to feel all the more out of control of their lives. Even those who do not have any kind of anxiety disorder may feel a deep sense that life is somehow untrustworthy. And when the people who have the power to do something about this, do nothing, we feel all the more afraid. \nWhat can we do with such fear ? Well, fear, like every other emotion, comes to give us a message about our lives. Generally, we think that our fears are telling us to avoid the things that frighten us. And on its face, fear does seem to be telling us this. However, it is impossible, in many cases, to avoid what frightens us. \nBut when we listen to our fears we can learn far more. First, there are two kinds of fears. One is based absolutely in reality and is giving us information about that reality. The other is based in our upbringing, our life experiences, and may be giving us false information about a current reality. In the case of the latter, fear might, for example be telling us that all men cheat, so our current husband must be cheating, because\u2014well, all men cheat. When those kinds of fears come up, we might need to seek professional help to finish resolving old unresolved issues\u2014of which we have been informed by the fact of this fear. That is why those fears come up\u2014to tell us that we have some unresolved issues that need resolution. \nOn the other hand, we may have some very realistic fears based in reality\u2014that seem to hang around, just sit in the pit of the stomach all day every day. They make us jumpy, irritable and can even lead to depression . Many Americans have experienced this kind of fear relative to these mass murders that continue to happen, even as our politicians keep telling us not to talk about it. These fears are there to tell us something about life. But they are not there to tell us to build an impenetrable shelter to move into and begin to live an ascetic life. Rather they are there to give us some direction about what we can do to protect our lives and our vision of life. \nFor example, one thing that we can do to protect our lives and our vision of life is to get busy contacting Senators and Representatives to ask for sensible gun control legislation. To speak to this issue again and again until something is done. To not give up until something is done. Fear can give us just such motivation . Source: Andrea Mathews \nBut if fear refuses to let up even when we are addressing it in such a fashion, we can develop a list of self-soothing activities. One of the things fear wants to give us is a sense that we have some say-so about our lives. Learning self-soothing skills can give us that. I generally recommend that, through experimentation, we find and set to regular practice a list of at least ten different self-soothing activities. \nExperimentation means that we try something to see if it soothes us. When it does, we add it to the list and begin to put it into practice. The reason we need ten is because when one of them doesn\u2019t work, we want another one to try. Very commonly I ask people what calms them, what soothes them, and they either have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, or they have only one go-to for self-soothing. They may know, for example, that exercising calms them down\u2014but that\u2019s the only thing that they can do. What this means is that when they can\u2019t get to the gym, they just have to live with the anxiety. That\u2019s why we need a list of ten. \nThe next thing is that we need to take responsibility for such anxiety. If you have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, which requires medication \u2014take the medication as prescribed. And whether or not you are on meds, taking responsibility means being regularly involved with your anxiety by paying attention to when it starts, what triggers it, and what it is trying to tell you. That also means really utilizing self-soothing skills on a regular basis to maintain a sense that you can manage your anxiety. Just knowing that we can manage it, makes it ease off considerably. \nFear and anxiety are not our enemies, they are meant to wake us up to personal responsibility for our lives. Sometimes fear can even save our lives, by telling us of a real and imminent danger so that we must react to protect our lives. Fear can be our friend\u2014we need to embrace it and it will lead us to a more empowered life.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrea mathews", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:54:04.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2594e61d3e94844ae07964d6ceee5c908985952d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KyeNyoj6VwvZ.tvMisAo6US317d2M1aK3k3OeTWhDDdDLXI.HexDf7", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Big Shot", "title_full": "Big Shot", "published": "2017-10-04T17:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/egypt-beautiful-nile-river-629610.jpg?itok=VHkn_91A", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2594e61d3e94844ae07964d6ceee5c908985952d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KyeNyoj6VwvZ.tvMisAo6US317d2M1aK3k3OeTWhDDdDLXI.HexDf7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "kfarrell", "published": "2017-10-04T17:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Big Shot", "text": "MORE \nA \u201cloner\u201d totes an arsenal of 27 guns into a casino hotel and kills 59 people at a nearby outdoor concert, wounding hundreds. How we interpret his action shapes the nature of the event, but also who we think we are. \nIn the October 3rd New Yorker, Adam Gopnik wisely editorialized that \u201cGun control acts on gun violence the way antibiotics act on infections\u2014imperfectly but with massive efficacy.\u201d His language (\u201cgun violence\u201d) suggests the action is impersonal, like a storm. He goes on to question \u201cthe strange American fixation on the right to own military-style firearms. They don\u2019t have a reason for this fixation\u2014no reason can be found. There\u2019s no argument for it.\u201d \nWhat Mr. Gopnik overlooks or denies is that humans enact or commit \u201cgun violence.\u201d Why? For one thing, humans are uniquely haunted by awareness that we are doomed to die and vanish forever. Guns are tools for killing. They magnify your body\u2019s power and allow you to feel in control of weakness and death. Religious symbols and flags can pump up the illusion of power too. But guns are solid in your hand. A gun can demonstrate your power over life and death at any moment. \nThe truth is, that any human can fall under the spell of death and power. Culture usually regulates access to killing power, and most Americans favor controls. But those who fall under the spell of guns protest vehemently against controls. Killing power is like a drug or religious ecstasy. It pumps up the brain and body. Without it, you can feel anxious. For a few humans, the thrill of potency is irresistible. They feel bigger, indomitable. The potency feels like more life\u2014more self\u2014and they want more. In a few cases, they can\u2019t get enough. \nThe nation\u2019s leader classified the killer, as \u201ca sick man, a demented man,\u201d adding \u201ca very, very sick individual.\u201d The leader was groping for words, repeating them to make them sound convincing. The killer appeared to be a \u201cnormal\u201d retiree, age 64, a loner, rich from real estate deals, who had turned his bankroll into a life of high-stakes gambling. \nHow did he come to massacre people? \nAs a gambler and speculator, Mr. Paddock was used to the intense excitement of risking all. His father had been a criminal , so there may have been inherited susceptibility to that heightened state. But gambling and gun culture in the US are also seductive. They advertise psychic rewards of glamor, power, righteousness, and superiority. Las Vegas flaunts treasure and dreams . Symbols such as the pyramid promise to overcome time and death. \nRampage killing has also become a subculture. Most rampage killers have military training or cheap access to military-style weapons. And there is an element of copycat behavior. Killers seek to break records and command the world\u2019s attention\u2014which in an age of electronic and social media they can do. \nAt 64, Mr. Paddock\u2019s \u201chigh-flying\u201d life was coming to an end and he must have known that conventional stimulation\u2014money, sex , even gambling\u2014would go flat. \nOf the 33,626 gun deaths in 2013, 11,208 were homicides, while 21,386 were suicides . \nIn copycat fashion, Mr. Paddock amassed a huge arsenal of weapons, including explosives (at home), making it clear that like other rampage killers, he wanted to gain maximum attention. Doctoring his weapons to give them military killing-power, he planned out a spectacular death for himself and others. He planned carefully, showing ordinary humans that he could fool them. In hunting and killing them, he showed the world that he was special. Superior. \nOn MSNBC, a retired ATF agent suggested that Paddock may have been reacting to big gambling losses. While this may turn out to be true, it\u2019s more probable that Paddock became obsessed with\u2014feared, hated\u2014the certainty of his own death. The ATF agent proposed that Paddock \u201chated\u201d Las Vegas for ruining him. Maybe. It\u2019s likely that Paddock chose to kill Las Vegas concert-goers because they were young, with lots of life ahead of them, and they were plainly enjoying it. \nPart of the thrill of gambling is the way it intensifies your sense of self. As slang has it, your fate lies in the roll of dice. Intensely alone, the \u201chigh-flying\u201d killer wanted to build himself up as his life waned. The dream is that a big shot can make a big shot. He wanted the world\u2019s attention as he left life, taking some subjects with him as ancient kings went to the tomb with servants killed for company. In place of the Chinese emperor\u2019s ceramic army, Mr. Paddock fortified himself with a military arsenal to magnify his impact. He fired down on his victims, killing them from a great height. His plan was visionary, for an act of supreme daring that would \u201clive forever\u201d in the world\u2019s memory . \nThe gun is a tool for killing , and since everybody knows that, just carrying a gun commands attention. It intimidates. At bottom, this is what the Second Amendment hysteria is all about. The power to command others creates an aristocracy. In history, it was a warrior aristocracy. And you don\u2019t need flaunt your weapon. Just knowing you can kill anybody on the street whenever you want can make you feel potent and dominant. \nGambling mixes expertise, role-playing, and the ability to imagine what opponents are thinking. It\u2019s stressful. Sooner or later gamblers are tempted by the prospect of a blowout. Think of the movies and books built around fantasies of double-or-nothing, do-or-die, betting the farm. Like Nicholas Cage the romantically suicidal alcoholic in \u201cLeaving Las Vegas,\u201d Mr. Paddock could throw over the card table and wipe out the players. And by killing himself, he would get away with it. \nA gambler such as Paddock may have craved the thrill of risking his life over and over, feeling pumped up larger than life. But alas, the game and personal life eventually began to lose intensity, and the man, like so many Americans, turned to war games, buying tools for killing, one after another, and bullets cheap as poker chips. It\u2019s a big world. You can never have too much power. \nResources used in this essay: \nErnest Becker, Escape from Evil (Free Press, 1972) \nKirby Farrell, The Psychology of Abandon (Leveller's Press, 2015) \nKaren Horney, Neurosis and Human Growth (Norton, 1950)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gopnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernest becker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam gopnik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholas cage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen horney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirby farrell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:54:06.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4ce56aa3e6003337b60c0a16511032222ff269a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JlTnXCQOCccWs8CAp8ozZTRx6kQedYxHDjWNlXKN_8VgPLZMAAkKj8JP1Zf.tus7T0plX3LOGd_A--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Whose Job Is It Anyway?", "title_full": "Whose Job Is It Anyway?", "published": "2017-10-04T17:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4ce56aa3e6003337b60c0a16511032222ff269a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JlTnXCQOCccWs8CAp8ozZTRx6kQedYxHDjWNlXKN_8VgPLZMAAkKj8JP1Zf.tus7T0plX3LOGd_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "evintiadis", "published": "2017-10-04T17:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Whose Job Is It Anyway?", "text": "Whose Job Is It Anyway? Why mental health professionals need to do more in the fight against stigma. Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE \nIn discussions of mental health stigma one thing that is often left out is that mental health stigma is not just a clinical or a social issue, it is also an ethical issue. \nIt is well known that stigma affects people\u2019s mental health, increases their suffering and denies them opportunities in life. But denying a group of people the possibility to pursue life goals because they are unwell goes against the values of equality, respect for human dignity and non- discrimination . This makes the question of stigma an ethical question that needs to be addressed. \nSo, one question to pose is on whose shoulders does the ethical responsibility lie? \nStigma has many causes that can be found in how people think of people belonging to stigmatized groups. Such causes include the belief that people with mental disorders are violent or irrational, the belief that they are to blame for their condition and could snap out of it if they really wanted to, the belief that mental disorders are ultimately untreatable and incapacitating and so on. \nBecause of the complexity of stigma the effort necessary to address it requires action from different parties. Governments and different social institutions have to be involved (including for funding research on stigma), and individuals, including the people affected, need to take action. In addition to this though, a large part of the burden falls on mental health professionals\u2014not only because of their professional ethics but, also, because they are in a privileged position to make a difference. \nPhysicians are bound by an ethical code that requires of them beneficence, non-maleficence, and respect for patient autonomy and justice. The same holds for other mental health professionals, such as nurses, social workers and mental health counselors whose professional codes of ethics explicitly set these requirements as priorities. \nThe focus is usually given to the first three of these. However, since the aim of mental health care is to help patients overcome the difficulties associated with their disorders that prevent them from pursuing their life goals, the work of mental health professionals commits them to things that go beyond just clinical work\u2014i.e. taking active action to overcome the injustices that interfere with these aims. Indeed, some mental health professionals have been active in forming initiatives to fight stigma, such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists\u2019 Changing Minds campaign and the World Psychiatric Association\u2019s Global Programme against Stigma and Discrimination because of Schizophrenia . Yet more can and ought to be done. \nPublic health campaigns that aim to educate the public are common in the fight against stigma. For educational campaigns to be effective as much as possible though the information disseminated must be targeted, given by people that the public trusts and delivered in a manner that is meaningful and relevant to the group addressed. This is one reason why the involvement of mental health professionals in the fight against stigma is pivotal: because they are experts that the public trusts. This allows them to play a significant role in bringing about change by correcting false and commonly held stereotypes. For instance, in the media which for many people are a major, or the only, source of information about mental illness. \nThe media typically portray people with mental disorders as violent, inept or homeless thus fuelling, or sustaining, both the public\u2019s negative attitudes to mental disorders and the self-stigmatizing attitudes of people suffering from them. But the power of the media coupled with the expert status of mental health professionals can contribute to the fight against stigma. Mental health professionals can use the media to challenge hurtful misrepresentations about the level of ability of people with mental disorders\u2014something which is currently primarily done by grassroots movements and organized protest groups like NAMI\u2019s Stigmabusters email alert program. To be fair, some mental health professionals already do this by occasionally appearing in the media. But more can be achieved by a continuous cooperation between them and different media outlets, for instance, serving as advisors for media content that relates to mental illness. \nMental health professionals can also serve as advocates for the rights of the disadvantaged group at a political level. Because stigma is also a political matter, the fact of stigma and discrimination and the harm they do must be acknowledged at an institutional level in order for a more inclusive legal framework to be put into place that will protect the rights of people living with mental disorders. Since mental health professionals know how the system works, they know the needs of patients, they can address and communicate those needs, and can collaborate with other (health) professionals to promote them , they are in a unique position to advocate for political change. \nBut the responsibility of mental health professionals does not stop at their patients. Studies show that a large number of mental health professionals hold stigmatizing beliefs and share many of the attitudes of the public when it comes to psychiatric disorders. These attitudes need to be acknowledged as the problem that they are. Mental health professionals need to be educated about them and be helped to identify them because such biases affect therapy and the general medical attention that patients receive. \nIn general, since mental health professionals are the experts that people suffering from mental illness will turn to first, often at their most vulnerable, their approach and advice must be well-informed on the question of stigma. This need creates the requirement for improving their training. Education about stigmatizing attitudes within and beyond clinical practice, as well as their causes and their effects as social determinants of health should be incorporated into the curriculum of mental health-related studies and training programs. \nThis highlights that, beyond the central role that mental health professionals need to play in the fight against mental health stigma, a lot more needs to be done if we hope to effectively address it. And, since the ways stigma arises and is sustained are multiple and often not well-understood an interdisciplinary approach seems necessary. Psychologists, psychiatrists, philosophers, sociologists are just some of the researchers from different disciplines that can work together to study the different mechanisms that give rise to stigma and to find ways to mitigate it. \nAn instance of such work is the Perfect Project at the University of Birmingham where philosophers and psychologists are working on challenging the common association of mental illness to irrationality\u2014an association that has ethical and social ramifications for the people living with mental disorders. Work of this kind on associations frequently made that result in, often unconscious , biases can challenge the alleged grounds that exist for stigma and thus help in the fight against it. \nTo conclude this very wordy post, if our aim is to create a more inclusive moral framework in which the rights and needs of people living with mental disorders are respected, the people whose job it is to take care of people with mental disorders ought to be at the center of the effort to change stigmatizing attitudes. They need to actively take up the injustice faced by their patients, act as their advocates and promote self-care and independence.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "university of birmingham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world psychiatric association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal college of psychiatrists", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:54:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bc0a0725ccc771d07357b7113f7d1dc321dd3384", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3bsmIN1Y32AD.D.TBmpIEaeMePc7GSz430m8ylgE5ziACb_QWmwTMC6nYSI4uESkEslPl4vcA9TVcK9M7Pcitohq8017gYZE8ZVMCRmqwoEe3V4gnFR_a80-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Why Have We Made Such Little Philosophical Progress?", "title_full": "Why Have We Made Such Little Philosophical Progress?", "published": "2017-10-04T17:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bc0a0725ccc771d07357b7113f7d1dc321dd3384", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3bsmIN1Y32AD.D.TBmpIEaeMePc7GSz430m8ylgE5ziACb_QWmwTMC6nYSI4uESkEslPl4vcA9TVcK9M7Pcitohq8017gYZE8ZVMCRmqwoEe3V4gnFR_a80-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gcollier", "published": "2017-10-04T17:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Have We Made Such Little Philosophical Progress?", "text": "Why Have We Made Such Little Philosophical Progress? A question which crops up when discussing the political and environmental crisis Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE \nA persistent question which nowadays often crops up when discussing the most recent political and environmental crisis is why we have not, in this age of advanced scientific and technological progress, made but little philosophical progress in determining why things are the way they are both cosmologically and terrestrially on our little planet, especially when it comes to regarding our human presence with all our racist attitudes and warring tendencies. And this despite the worldwide range of religious faiths and practices which, after all, emphasize the power of some non-biological force known as the human spirit. \nJust the other day while waiting in an unusually long check-out line in the local grocery store, the man behind me struck up a conversation in the course of which he asked what I did for a living. I told him that I was long retired, but had been a university professor and still did a little writing, generally of a philosophical nature . \u201cYou mean about religion?\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re a religious person?\u201d \nI told him you can be a philosopher without being conventionally religious, at which he looked somewhat puzzled. And I went on to say that there was enough mystery and wonder about the incredible complexity of the universe itself, not to mention the whys and wherefores of our little time bound place in it, to evoke the intuitive feeling that there is something seemingly metaphysical underlying the existence of everything in a state of being (without involving the conventional God image). From the smallest microbe to the largest elephant, the smallest star to the largest planet. And when it comes to our own existence, to our own complex psychological nature having both creative and destructive sides, we have men and women who risk their lives working to save lives for organizations like Doctors without Borders and others who take lives for religious causes such as Isis. \n\u201cWell, there you are,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re both acting from \u2018religious\u2019 motivations.\u201d \nBy now we\u2019d moved up two spaces closer to the cash register, with not much time left to conclude this discussion. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, with a touch of professorial authority, \u201cThe doctors and nurses are inspired by two psychological motivations known as morality and love . These are states of mind which, nowadays, neither all human beings, nor all religions (such as Isis) recognize as the prime spiritual aspects of human consciousness. Yet they are sensibilities long thought to represent the innermost authority of a psychic power historically known as the soul.\u201d \nI don\u2019t think he was very impressed by this statement. I tried again. \u201cWhat I am trying to say is that when science recognizes an element of mystery in a situation, be it physical or psychological, then they and the rest of us are justified in using the word religious because of its spirit-like connotations. Spirit seen as a non-biological, metaphysical force at work that is neither scientifically nor sensorially explainable, and which does not necessarily have religious connotations.\u201d \nAnyhow, re-reading all this, I should just have left it to Einstein: \nEveryone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, one that is vastly superior to that of man. In this way the pursuit of science leads to a religious feeling of a special sort, which is indeed quite different from the religiosity of someone more na\u00efve.

Perhaps the most famous portrayal of this was on the September 16, 1993 episode of Seinfeld : \u201cJerry gets a shocking revelation when Elaine reveals that she faked every orgasm while they were dating . Jerry then pleads with Elaine to get a second chance in bed.\u201d \nOthers in the mass media were quick to suggest \u201cskills\u201d for those who felt the need to fake their orgasms. Most targeted women\u2014in part, to give them a sense of sexual power. One example is Kat George, who created a six-part, tongue-in-cheek list of instructions : Baby, Arch Your Back: Writhe around, push your hips up (or down if you're on top) Pout: Your lips, half close your eyes, and maybe flip your hair Flex Your Vocal Chords: Yelp, \u201cI'm coming, I'm coming!\u201d in a husky tone Shake It Like a Polaroid Picture: Heave your bosom dramatically, maybe rubbing them as well Punch Him in the Face: An accident, of course, in the heat of the moment Pant: Slap your forehead and say \u201cWow!\u201d and \u201cOh my God!\u201d and breathe deeply \nNot to be outdone, Gareth May offered a list of instructions for men : Very important to use a condom so that you can whip away the evidence before your partner inspects it A little moaning (don\u2019t overdo it) Say something like, \u201cI\u2019m coming!\u201d and escalate the moaning Don\u2019t do the missionary position because then you\u2019ll have to do an \u201corgasm face\u201d and that\u2019s difficult \nHowever, as clinicians and researchers, we have a greater interest in the reasons individuals attempt to fake an orgasm, and how common this behavior is. Although a fair amount of research has been conducted on fake orgasms, we don\u2019t really know how prevalent it is among women and men. \nPrevalence is, in part, determined by whether our question asks \u201cever,\u201d \u201coccasionally,\u201d \u201cfrequently,\u201d or \u201calways.\u201d We usually assume that women fake it more than men because (choose your best guess) men come too quickly, men have more difficulty hiding it, or women are less interested in sex . Many others explanations have been proposed. \nOne study by Muehlenhard, about a decade ago, concluded the following regarding prevalence: \n\u201c18% of the men and 48% of the women checked \u2026 that they had pretended orgasm. Another 16% of the men and 23% of the women checked \u2026 that they had not pretended orgasm but had done something similar.\u201d This is the \u201cever\u201d pretend option. \nA 2017 study by Goodman et al. concluded, after reviewing the literature, that \u201c25\u201360% of both men and women (higher frequency among women) report pretending an orgasm at least once in their life.\u201d \nIn terms of the \u201cwhy\u201d question\u2014their primary goal was to develop a measure of pretend orgasms\u2014various factors and reasons \u201caffect a person\u2019s decision to pretend an orgasm.\u201d They found six primary reasons: \n1. Feels good: \u201cIt is exciting and satisfying.\u201d \n2. For the partner: \u201cI do not want to hurt my partner\u2019s feelings\u201d and \u201cI want my partner to have an orgasm.\u201d \n3. Not into sex: \u201cSex is taking too long and I want to be finished\u201d and \"Sex is not enjoyable.\" \n4. Manipulation and power: \u201cIt is a powerful tool I can use to get other things I want from my partner.\u201d \n5. Insecurity: \u201cDon\u2019t want my partner to think I am a bad sex partner.\u201d \n6. Reassurance and feel loved: \u201cIt is a way to express love to my partner\u201d and \u201cImportant way of feeling close to him or her.\u201d \nThese reasons make realistic and expedient sense when considering casual sex but are more difficult for me to fathom within the context of an honest and loving relationship. Of course, I realize that committed relationships vary in their dynamics and there may well be times when it is prudent to fake it. I would hope, however, that this would be minimized as the relationship develops greater trust and honesty. References \nGoodman, D. L., Gillath, O., & Haj-Mohamadi, P. (2017).

Prior to becoming a mother, she considered herself to be educated and aware of the challenges facing people of color in America.

From the particular challenges facing white mothers of biracial children, to generational differences between multiracial Millennials and the Boomers who paved the way, to interracial adoptions and the experiences within these families, I will be examining how living outside of the racial binary has shaped the worldview of biracial individuals and those around them. \nStories like Jessica, introduced at the beginning of this article, whose life has been fundamentally altered by becoming the mother of a multiracial son. \n\u201cI thought I understood where I had white privilege,\" She said, reflecting on her experience. \"Clearly I did not.\" \nIn an increasingly polarized political environment , where a black and white, us-vs.-them mentality prevails, Americans who - by virtue of their very existence - cannot be separated into such distinct categories, have a valuable perspective to offer.

For each of us, the metrics are, of course, different. When we are in love , time either feels like it stands still, or it passes all too quickly. Economists measure our productivity , and determine it by the output of each hour we spend doing something. For philosophers, time, like almost everything, is a state of mind. Does time even exist, outside of the human consciousness? Is it an invention of the human brain ? For children, the only time is now. \nToday, the question has a new urgency, thanks to Artificial Intelligence . Why? Because advanced technologies in computer science are automating almost everything a human being can do. That raises the question: \u201cWhat can humans do that computers can\u2019t?\u201d \nWhat will be the best and highest value use of our time? \nHow do we think about this question? For centuries, we have thought about time as a physical quantity. Because it is measureable, we can relate that to other things we can see, touch and feel. In an hour, how many peas can you pick? How many shoes can you manufacture? How many legal documents can you draft? What do these activities have in common? Our time is valued by the output of physical goods. This is the basis for our accounting system. A farm worker is typically paid minimum wage, often less (around $12/hour). A factory worker will earn a bit more per hour, perhaps twice as much ($15-20/hour). A young lawyer might earn five times as much. The top star athletes and actors earn between $50-100 million per year, much of that through endorsements ( advertising ). What does this say about what we value? \nClearly, we value the pleasure of being entertained more highly than anything else. Is pleasure more highly valued than other feelings, accomplishments, or tangible assets? Isn\u2019t pleasure, by definition, fleeting, not to mention relatively superficial? Is this a sound, long-term basis for growing our economy and for society? \nOne of the most prominent features of our mobile economy and ecommerce is the convenience of having an interface that is (almost) always in our hands, literally, that eliminates the need for physically going to stores, bank branches, etc. We continue to develop technologies that simplify our lives by creating more efficient infrastructures so less human effort is required to complete everyday tasks. From the traditional perspective, our economy is becoming ever more productive. We are able to do more while using less resources. \nThis kind of productivity is certainly an important and valuable objective, especially in an industrial context. But, remember that the Industrial Economy is based on extraction of natural resources and of human labor. One of the dramatic shifts of the Knowledge and Relationship Economy is that knowledge itself, e.g., insights derived through Artificial Intelligence, is perceived to have great value, often before practical applications can be implemented. We are only at the very earliest days of an accelerating explosion of knowledge, not just data, the amount of which is increasing exponentially. What are we going to do with this new source of self-perpetuating, intangible assets? \nThis raises the issue of valuing knowledge. If we, as humans, aspire to be valued for more than physically measureable output, what else can we offer? Creativity , fresh ideas, artistic inventions\u2026 human relationships\u2026time? \nWhatever you may think of all the hype about digital currencies (cryptocurrencies) and blockchain technology, real communities of people, mostly tech enthusiasts, are coming together where the medium of exchange is the sharing of bold new ideas and facilitated through exchange of proprietary tokens (\u201ccoins\u201d). People can be rewarded for their participation as human beings engaging with other humans and for their contribution toward further development of the technology. Isn\u2019t it entirely appropriate that a digital economy, based on photonic communications, that enables real transactions in digital format, can also encourage a shared belief in the value of simply being part of an online community? \nIsn\u2019t this a way to define a community? \nWhat about the concept of time in this context? In a digital economy, activities are self-referencing. Relative time is more important than time charted in the Gregorian Calendar. Value will be defined more by the content of the contribution than by \u201cownership\u201d or by the amount of time and effort required to produce work. \nThis has revolutionary ramifications for all of society because fundamental assumptions are being redefined because of technology. What is productive work? How will we measure productivity? How will we learn how to be happier (long-term)? How will these tech tools enable us to feel more empowered, not just to survive, but to create and share what others can value? \nHow do we want to value ourselves, our time? How will we define meaning of our lives?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:11:33.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4a34541a27dd0fea434cf2623f83c2479d41eca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4Lk0ehpbpi0eCW9orXWpAwEdNR8c0jHBSBDSnIj02SHNWMclSsLvpZS6CdJbHq4hi7uGBtvxCmi8qYxs0WJ1ricM0uNtw7RRGLlX79mj6Q.pir560cz.dc10_6YOaO2VFTwKxd_1nD0.g--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Las Vegas Massacre: Why This Hurts So Much", "title_full": "Las Vegas Massacre: Why This Hurts So Much", "published": "2017-10-04T18:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_images/2017-10/las_vegas_pexels-photo-165799.jpeg?itok=lQ9lVKcZ", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4a34541a27dd0fea434cf2623f83c2479d41eca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4Lk0ehpbpi0eCW9orXWpAwEdNR8c0jHBSBDSnIj02SHNWMclSsLvpZS6CdJbHq4hi7uGBtvxCmi8qYxs0WJ1ricM0uNtw7RRGLlX79mj6Q.pir560cz.dc10_6YOaO2VFTwKxd_1nD0.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "geverly", "published": "2017-10-04T18:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Las Vegas Massacre: Why This Hurts So Much", "text": "MORE Source: pexels photo \nLas Vegas is usually a place of fun, great entertainment, and even escape; and it will be again. But as a reminder to us all that nowhere is immune to tragedy, and further, that we must be prepared for the unthinkable, tragedy struck Las Vegas. \nAs of this post, at least 59 people were killed and 527 were injured in Las Vegas on October 1. Using an illegally altered rifle, a gunman opened fire on a country music festival crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort. The carnage lasted until the gunman apparently took his own life. The physical toll was devastating. It is the deadliest mass shooting in modern history. But the psychological toll will be worse. \nLas Vegas is not the first mass shooting in somewhat recent memory . Source: wikimedia commons \nThe first mass shooting that gained international attention, and its own docudrama, was the 1966 Texas Tower Shooting. On August 1, 1966, Charles Whitman went to the University of Texas at Austin Tower, where he ultimately shot and killed 17 victims while wounding 31. On April 16, 2007, Seun-Hui Cho went to Virginia Tech University where he shot and killed 32 students, wounding 17. On December 14, 2012, Adam Lanza went to the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut and murdered 20 children. On June 12, 2016, Omar Mateen went to the Pulse nightclub in Orlando and murdered almost 50 people, wounding 58. With the exception of the Texas Tower Shooting, these attacks were the four deadliest shootings in modern American history. \nWhat makes shootings like these so psychologically devastating? Factors that increase psychological \u201ctoxicity\u201d are numerous, but here are some of the most important: Source: pexels photo \n1) Obviously, the sheer number of victims increases psychological distress. Gruesomeness increases toxicity. \n2) The fact that these murders were not expected is traumatizing. The fact that there was no real warning increases distress. This leaves us all feeling vulnerable. To be fair, security experts have been warning us that such an attack was possible, but we choose to deny the risks, or we simply refuse to change our ways of living. Nevertheless, no one at the concert believed they were at risk. \n3) Innocent people were victims. Innocent concertgoers did not deserve to die we say to ourselves. It is especially distressing when children are victims\u2026they deserve better. They deserve a chance to grow up. \n4) In the cases of Whitman, Lanza, and Cho, mental illness was an apparent contributing factor. In the case of Mateen, hate seemed to be a motivating factor, In the case of the person reported to be the Las Vegas shooter, Stephen Paddock, the motive is currently unknown. All of these factors seem vague and they are out of our control. Feeling out of control increases distress. This is especially true for emergency services professionals who are trained take control of chaotic situations. What happens when their training or resources prove inadequate? \n5) Perhaps the most devastating aspect of the Las Vegas massacre and similar shootings is the destruction of a core human need\u2026the need to feel safe. All of the shooting I enumerated above occurred in places most of us assumed would be safe places. Schools and places of fun, joy, and entertainment. We expect tragedy on the battlefield. We don\u2019t expect it our \u201csafe\u201d places. \nDr. Jeff Lating and I have written extensively on the factors which increase psychological toxicity in the aftermath of disasters and terrorism (Everly & Lating, 2004; Everly & Lating, 2013; Everly & Lating, 2017). The destruction of fundamental beliefs sometimes called \u201cassumptive worldviews\u201d seem to be at the core. The two most important core psychological assumptions that allow us to otherwise navigate a world that can sometimes be dangerous, are the beliefs that it is basically a just and fair world, and then we are safe most of the time. The Las Vegas massacre, the shootings in Newtown, Virginia Tech, Orlando, and Austin reveal our core assumptions may be illusions. Such a psychological injury can leave lasting scars. But such doesn\u2019t have to be the case. With the rise of the field of disaster psychology, we have learned that there are ways to mitigate the pain of trauma , disaster, and yes, even terrorism. \n\u00a9 George S.

Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE \nEveryone is alarmed by the deadly opioid epidemic sweeping our country. But most of the discussion about causes and cures misses the most fundamental issue. \nPharma is the main culprit in starting and maintaining the problem. And it should be held responsible for cleaning it up. \nDuring the past two decades, US drug companies have been only marginally less ruthless than Mexican drug cartels in pushing opioid drugs and addicting millions of Americans to them . \nI have previously described the hypocritical role of the highly esteemed Sackler family. Much of their famous philanthropy has been financed by blood money earned from their Purdue Pharma\u2014a leader in the fraudulent marketing that triggered and maintained the prescription opioid epidemic . \nDrug companies and drug company executives must be exposed and punished. They have been responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and deserve massive fines needed now to help those who are currently addicted. \nI have asked Art Levine to provide insights on what has happened and what needs to be done. He is an award-winning investigative journalist and author of the new book, Mental Health , Inc.: How Corruption, Lax Oversight and Failed Reforms Endanger Our Most Vulnerable Citizens . \nArt writes: \u201cIt's hard to remember, amid all the daily outrages committed by President Trump , that he actually promised to do something in late August about what he declared to be a \"national emergency\" created by the opioid crisis that is driving most of the 64,000 drug overdose deaths a year. \nAs usual with Trump, nothing happened as a result of his comments. His administration hasn't gotten around to actually taking the necessary actions to invoke federal emergency powers that could allow the government to better help substance abusers. \nWhat you don't see under serious consideration by the Trump administration is any meaningful crackdown on drug industry fraud or its corruption of researchers and government officials that fueled the opioid crisis in the first place. \nAnd the recently established federal interagency pain advisory panel has many members with financial conflicts of interest connecting them to the drug industry that our government should be investigating\u2014not obeying it like lapdogs. \nOpioids have become the new corporate gold rush, with over a third of Americans being prescribed the drugs, mostly for short-term use. \nStarting in the 1990s, Purdue Pharma used grants, subsidies and artful fakery to spread the notion among leading medical organizations that opioids- especially its new long-lasting, abuse -proof narcotic, OxyContin\u2014weren't addictive for chronic pain patients. \nFlush with drug industry money, non-profits such as The Joint Commission, the leading regulator of hospitals, and industry front-groups parading as \"pain specialists\" led the drive to evaluate hospitals and doctors on how aggressively they were treating patients to relieve pain; they promoted the unfounded, opioid-pushing view of pain as the \"Fifth Vital Sign.\" \nAll this was boosted by the exaggerated claim that less than one percent of chronic pain patients become addicted, ostensibly justifying a nearly 300 percent increase in nationwide opioid prescriptions from 76 million to 207 million between 1991 and 2013. \nFor some states, such as West Virginia with the highest overdose rate in the country, it's become a modern-day plague. Over a six-year span through 2012, this year's Pulitzer Prize-winner Eric Eyre reported, \"Drug wholesalers showered the state with 780 million hydrocodone and oxycodone pills, while 1,728 West Virginians fatally overdosed on those two painkillers.\" \nIn mid-September, 41 states announced they would band together to investigate drug companies and wholesalers for potential civil and criminal fraud violations. \nThat's on top of dozens of states and localities already suing the pharmaceutical industry for the opioid epidemic. \nJurisdictions in hard-hit states such as Kentucky and West Virginia are also contending that wholesalers knowingly broke the law by flooding the market with millions of needless opioid pills- while apparently complicit DEA officials looked the other way, thanks in part to the drug companies and distributors luring dozens of regulators with lucrative jobs. \nIn 2007, Purdue Pharma was fined a mere $600 million for the \u201cmisbranding\u201d of OxyContin as only modestly addictive. That is just \"chump change,\" critics say, compared to $35 billion in revenues these fraudsters earned. \nWhile its three top executives did plead guilty as individuals, no one served prison time. Until drug industry executives actually serve time in a prison, don't expect any change at all in drug industry behavior. \nIndeed, Purdue's deadly crimes just reflect broader patterns of corruption and lax enforcement throughout the pharmaceutical industry\u2014standard business practice for decades. \nDuring the last 25 years, Pharma has paid in fraud settlements only a tiny fraction of earnings\u2014$35 billion out of$711 billion in worldwide net revenues. Fines for illegal marketing are treated as a cost of doing business. \nThe 20 percent reduction in opioid prescribing since 2010 and slow-moving sanctions imposed on drug companies are too little, too late. \nAnd the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction: The risk of suicide is already mounting steadily for those addicted and/or with chronic pain who are abruptly cut off from opioids in a drastic way that focuses narrowly on arbitrary opioid dosage limits rather than on patient well-being. \nIt turns out that drug industry fraud, joined by insurance restrictions on time-consuming counseling , has fueled the irresponsible, rushed care that plays a major role on both sides of the deadly opioid pendulum.\" \n*** \nThanks so much, Art, for this and for your tireless crusading against the evil of Pharma corruption. \nHow does Pharma get away with this and all its other many outrages against patients and taxpayers? \nFollow the money. The drug industry spends about $250 billion a year lobbying politicians. This is the equivalent of bribes or hush money\u2014allowing it to go almost completely unregulated and unpunished. \nThe hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by Pharma-initiated opioid addiction far exceed all the deaths suffered from war or terrorism since World War II. \nIf a foreign enemy were inflicting this carnage, our government would respond urgently and aggressively. But this enemy is within and has paralyzed out government through regulatory capture. \nPharma owes us a cure to the national disease it has created. The template is clear. Big Tobacco was tamed by a combination of massive public outrage that turned politicians against it and lawsuits that funded a massive and successful anti- smoking campaign. Pharma deserves the same treatment. \nThe addicted victims of Pharma should receive free lifetime treatment using clawed-back Pharma money. \nThere will be no one size fits all. Some will choose gradual detox and extended rehab. Some will choose medicine-assisted treatment. Some may require lifelong maintenance. \nAnd we must immediately stop the practice of carelessly prescribing risky opioids. Doctors and patients must be re-educated about the risks and very narrow indications. Practice habits must be monitored to ensure that conservative guidelines are followed with chronic pain patients already on opioids that balances the benefit and harm of taking them away. \nThe more general lesson\u2014Pharma is not ever to be trusted. Its power over Washington must be busted. No industry requires closer regulation. It cannot be allowed free rein to prey on the American public.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sackler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "art levine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric eyre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pharma corruption started the opioid epidemic pharma corruption started", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mental health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joint commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "purdue pharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "purdue", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:11:37.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4b4c9224f646efb0cd90777499baee5149543d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3YkyiNBAekH.9HKkMR.z1B8PlI5B7LT1AUrUqI15twt2EmWTQZ4Ou1YB0sW199Ss3ghKkR3x_KKnhCm3GthfPsY-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Senseless Killing and the Need to Know Why", "title_full": "Senseless Killing and the Need to Know Why", "published": "2017-10-04T20:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/chloemand15.jpg?itok=2E5Fxc6k", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4b4c9224f646efb0cd90777499baee5149543d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3YkyiNBAekH.9HKkMR.z1B8PlI5B7LT1AUrUqI15twt2EmWTQZ4Ou1YB0sW199Ss3ghKkR3x_KKnhCm3GthfPsY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cbarron", "published": "2017-10-04T20:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "Senseless Killing and the Need to Know Why", "text": "Senseless Killing and the Need to Know Why Craving answers for a cold-blooded crime. Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE \nOn October 1, 2017, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, murdered 59 people at a country music festival, wounded over 500 others and shot himself. Why? \nHe planned it. A seemingly ordinary guy with a comfortable life, no criminal record who called his brother to say, \u201cHow\u2019s mom?\u201d after Hurricane Irma. He sent her a walker. His father, whom he did not know, was a bank robber on the FBI\u2019s Ten Most Wanted list. Stephen Paddock was an accountant and a high stakes gambler. His girlfriend, Marilou Danley, was traveling in the Philippines during what is now titled the biggest mass murder in modern history. She has flown back for questioning. Paddock wired $100,000 to the Philippines last month. One report says he doted on her and another says he berated her. \nWho was this guy? Why did he do it? A few things went through my mind. They are not diagnoses, just ponderings. Did he have a brain tumor like the UT Austin Tower Shooter, Charles Whitman? I looked up how many mass murderers have brain tumors. Not a theme. Could he have had an undiagnosed or poorly understood brain condition that led to unpredictable, violent behavior? An encephalopathy? An autoimmune disease? Maybe he had intrusive violent thoughts and/or an impulse control issue? Intrusive thoughts can be part of a compulsive condition. Might he have been hallucinating? Using substances? Was this a masked psychotic or paranoid disorder? Was he retaliating against an imagined enemy? Was he a psychopath? The feelings of others did not register or matter? Was it exciting to see innocent people suffer? Perhaps it was some kind of rush? A shooting orgy? A titillating build to a final thrill? What about a grievance, loss or a despair? Anger and a trigger that led to the plan? Did he just detest happy people? The original plan was to murder those at the Life is Beautiful Festival the week before. My daughter was at that one. Psychoanalytically speaking, was there a need to conjure the absent, powerful, demonic father and identify with him in some twisted way? Father hunger gone awry? Did he possess the physiological make-up of a psychopath? Research below. \nWhy do we need to know why? There are many reasons, but here are a few. Uncertainty creates anxiety It might prevent future attacks A world that runs on reason feels better to live in Enlightenment leads to better control \nCan we find a why via physiology? Where do psychopathic tendencies come from? \nThe work of University of Pennsylvania psychologist Dr. Adrian Raine suggests that there is a physiologic basis for psychopathy . In this Atlantic Monthly article by Barbara Bradley Hagerty, Raine discusses callous and unemotional children who evolve into psychopaths. https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/when-your-child-is-a-psychopath/524502/, Raine says that a low resting heart rate in children may be a predictor of future violence. Low heart rate can suggest a lack of fear . If one is not easily fazed, it may require intense stimulation to get a rise, create a feeling, race the heart or even feel alive. Criminal behaviors and violent acts feed the cravings of the \u201ccallous or unemotional\u201d person in this way. \nIn the same article, Dr. Kent Kiehl, a psychologist at the University of New Mexico cites two abnormalities as an explanation for cruel and criminal acts. One is in the limbic system, the emotional processing area. Less gray matter and a small or underactive amygdala are a common finding. The second abnormality of is that of an overactive reward system. The brain of a psychopath, primed for drugs , sex , gambling, shooting, or cruelty drives him or her to commit unthinkable acts. \nPaddock was a high-stakes gambler.

How Can You Tell?", "text": "Do You Have an Inner Taskmaster? How Can You Tell? Might you have a work ethic that makes it difficult for you to relax?   Source: Hustle and Bustle/Max Pixel Free Photo \nThe designation \u201ctaskmaster\u201d is rife with negative connotations. Consider its definition in merriam-webster.com: \"One that imposes a task or burdens another with labor.\" It\u2019s hardy surprising that synonyms for the term include \u201ctyrant, bully , despot, drill sergeant\u201d\u2014and even \u201cslavedriver.\u201d \nWhat I\u2019d like to suggest is that, in its implications, the phrase inner taskmaster is paradoxically ambiguous. For having a powerful work ethic can actually be an asset, providing you with various gratifications, rewards, and advantages. But on the other hand, it can also be a repressive\u2014and oppressive\u2014force that controls your life and prohibits you from experiencing many of life\u2019s joys. \nSo before discussing what\u2019s harmful about having such a rigid, unrelenting ruler inside you, let\u2019s look at this driving energy from a more positive perspective. And this will serve as a caveat when I go on to describe the negatives of such a compulsion, since it can become habitual, excessive, and self-defeating. However adaptive it might have been originally, you may now need to learn how to put it back in its proper place\u2014before, that is, it completely takes over your life. \nGenetics , Biochemistry, and Your Work Ethic \nAs regards personality measurements, the Big Five scale (heavily researched and presently considered the standard) includes Conscientiousness as one of its five key factors. And, as characterized by biophysicist Brett Olsen ( Quora , Mar. 12, 2013), this trait\u2014seen as the most reliable barometer of one\u2019s work ethic\u2014 comprises such complementary elements as \u201c self-discipline , desire for achievement, ability to plan actions, organization, and dependability.\u201d One research/review study, specifically on the Big Five (J.C. Loehlin, 1992), estimates that about half the total variation in personality is genetic. So scientific findings offer convincing evidence that the strength of your work ethic cannot be attributed solely to environment . \nA second, even more popular, personality index is the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). And in this instrument one of the four personality factors is \u201cJudging\u201d (J)\u2014vs. its opposite, \u201cPerceiving\u201d (P). Here are some descriptors of the Judging individual: \u201cscheduled, organized, systematic, methodical, and planning.\u201d And here, too, is an excerpt from an overall characterization of this behavioral style: \u201c[Judging people] tend to live in a planned, orderly way, wanting to regulate and control life. . . . Their lifestyle is structured and organized. . . . They enjoy their ability to get things done\u201d (1993, I. B. Myers, Introduction to type, 5 th ed.). \nBut the simplest summation of the Judging individual\u2019s natural predilections comes from a book on the MBTI (2000, P.D. & B.B. Tieger, Just your type), which contrasts industrious J\u2019s with more easygoing P\u2019s in this fashion: J\u2019s \u201chave a strong work ethic: work, then play\u201d\u2014vs. P\u2019s, who \u201chave a strong play ethic: play, then work.\u201d \nActually attempting to account for the great divide between \u201cgo-getters\u201d and \u201cslackers\u201d (cf. MBTI\u2019s J\u2019s & P\u2019s) has long remained a scientific mystery. But an article in dailyhap (06/20/2012, Is your work ethic genetically pre-determined?) cites a study done by researchers at Vanderbilt that sheds new light on this intriguing topic. For this research team , utilizing positron emission tomography (PET scan) on their subjects, concluded: \nPeople who are willing to work hard for rewards\u2014go-getters\u2014had a higher release of the neurotransmitter dopamine in areas of the brain known to play an important role in reward and motivation [namely, the striatum, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the anterior insula], whereas those . . . less willing to work hard for a reward\u2014slackers\u2014had high dopamine levels in the brain area that plays a role in emotion and risk perception. (And for a much more technically detailed explanation, see M. T. Treadway et al. in Journal of Neuroscience , 2 May 2012, 32 (18) 6170-6176; or go to DOI: https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.6459-11.2012 .) \nIn short, those with a pronounced work orientation may be biochemically different from those without one. Put simply, work is more gratifying to them. (And what could be a better reason to not blame, or shame , people\u2014including yourself\u2014who are less work-inclined than others?) \nEnvironmental Influences on One 's Work Ethic \nIf about half of what determines your work orientation is inherited, what about the other half? Let me present two possible scenarios here: \n(1) Needing, as does every child, to feel that your parents value you\u2014that you\u2019re cared for, comforted, respected, and loved\u2014you\u2019re acutely sensitive to just about everything governing their reactions toward you. After all, what could be more important than experiencing your so-vital attachment bond to them as steady and secure? \nIdeally, you\u2019d feel your parents unconditionally accepted you for who, by nature, you are \u2014vs. how well, in this or that instance, you behaved. But the reality is that many (if not most) families prize their children on the basis of how much they meet their standards and expectations. \nSo if, say, you get positive recognition from your parents only when you bring home A\u2019s, and you receive either not-so-benign neglect , or even harsh judgment, when your report card displays mostly B\u2019s and C\u2019s, you\u2019ll get the clear message that to feel emotionally safe in your relationship you need to excel academically. And a similar \u201cadjustment\u201d would feel required if you experienced being valued in your household only when you were performing a task, or foregoing a pleasure to help them with something. Conversely, they may have frowned at you and made you feel lazy, selfish, stupid, or guilty when they discovered you resting, playing, or just goofing off. \nIf you grew up in a family where only productively \u201cdoing\u201d\u2014rather than merely \u201cbeing\u201d\u2014was favorably responded to, you\u2019d likely be driven, adaptively, to cultivate a strong work ethic. For unless you outright rebelled against your parents\u2019 dictates (even if they were more implied than explicitly stated), this \u201cconditioned\u201d work ethic would have felt almost compulsory to you. \nToo young and vulnerable to comfortably resist such external pressure, you may have concluded that such a habit of nearly masochistic self-discipline was essential to be assured that your behavior protected your parental bond. And once you internalized this sense that your family well-being was inextricably bound to your (largely self-denying) performance\u2014as well as threatened when you weren\u2019t doing what they wanted\u2014it\u2019s virtually inevitable that you\u2019d develop a powerful work orientation. And one that would persist even after you\u2019d left home. \n(2) It could be that in growing up, and mostly independent of your family, you saw yourself as acceptable only by compensating\u2014or over -compensating\u2014for certain perceived deficits. In which case you\u2019d strive to compete with other children in ways you believed might make you more equal to them, or possibly even superior to them. You may not have been as physically coordinated as they were, or you may have had difficulty making friends, or\u2014for a multitude of reasons\u2014you may have felt compelled to demonstrate to yourself and others that you were as good as, or better than, them. If so, you might have developed a habit of putting forth great effort to excel at something , so you could convince yourself that, despite any painfully recognized limitations, you were still okay, or \u201cgood enough.\u201d \nAnd by working harder\u2014whether in school or in doing odd jobs that other kids weren\u2019t interested in\u2014your world did seem to grant you approval. So your reinforcement history would actually have \u201cprogrammed\u201d you to become almost abnormally self-disciplined. And, however unconsciously, if applying yourself diligently to any task at hand made you feel good about yourself, then becoming your own \u201cslavedriver\u201d would have felt not just necessary but downright rewarding. You\u2019d have learned to work hard\u2014but without playing hard as well (if at all). In fact, at its extreme, letting yourself go, acting spontaneously, and simply enjoying yourself would actually induce anxiety. So transitioning into a more relaxed state of mind and feeling could become practically impossible for you. \nIt\u2019s easy to imagine how living a life of such unbalance, or dis-equilibrium, could negatively affect your relationships. For, really, how could anyone be there for another when they can\u2019t be there for themselves? Consequently, your well-rehearsed, \u201csuccessful\u201d program of rigorously applying yourself can turn out to be not just dysfunctional but pretty joyless, too\u2014despite its becoming over the years involuntary and automatic. \nCountering the \u201cAuthority\u201d of Your Inner Task Master \nObviously, if you\u2019re to attain some equivalence between work and play, activity and rest, personal achievement and interpersonal affiliation, you\u2019ll want to revisit why you committed yourself to such a self-sacrificial behavioral pattern in the first place. Either on your own or with professional assistance, you\u2019ll need to review your child self\u2019s earlier decision to continually prove him/her self. And you\u2019ll need to find ways of convincing that younger you that it\u2019s now safe to modify that decision\u2014that you no longer must prove your value, that you\u2019ve already established it and it\u2019s time to \"kick back\" or \"chill out.\" That, finally, you're no longer obliged to estimate your value in terms of eternal doing . \nSo, if you couldn\u2019t unconditionally accept yourself in the past, can you now diligently \"apply\" yourself to accepting the premise that everyone has not just the right, but a core need, to see themselves as \u201cgood enough\u201d\u2014independent of outward accomplishments? \n\u00a9 2017 Leon F.

These young men don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening to themselves. There\u2019s no community. Sometimes if a boy who is beaten up by schoolyard bullies because he is perceived to be a sissy, goes to his dad to tell about getting beaten up on the playground, he risks also being beaten up by his dad.\u201d \nClearly, there is real harm from the messages gay boys receive telling them they are somehow not normal, maybe not even fully human\u2014from churches claiming the attraction they may feel to other boys, the exact same way straight boys feel toward girls, is an \u201cobjective disorder\u201d that inclines them \u201ctoward an intrinsic moral evil,\u201d as the Catholic church has put it , to their government telling them they are second-class citizens. \nBut it has become equally clear that positive messages and role models can bolster younger gay men\u2019s self-esteem and thereby reduce their risk for substance abuse , HIV, and other self-destructive behaviors that disproportionately afflict gay men. \nThis new awareness is driving an entirely new approach to gay men\u2019s health. Instead of focusing on our \u201cdeficits,\u201d it builds on the resilience and strength virtually all gay men demonstrate simply by surviving to adulthood. It uses our strengths as its starting point, rather than assuming weaknesses simply because we\u2019re gay. And it offers examples of gay men who are successfully managing their challenges\u2014whether it\u2019s grieving a loss, or anxiety, living with HIV, or any of a myriad of large and small traumas that can upset our balance and maybe even lead us to do something we could regret later. \n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it make more sense,\u201d Ron Stall asked, \u201cto look at the people who have thrived, who are resilient, and learn not from what went wrong but what went right? Look at the guys who went through horrible situations and learned and grew. Learn from them rather than holding up the guys who exemplify the societal stereotype of gay men as failures.\u201d \nStall and his colleagues in their research have identified four interconnected \u201cepidemics\u201d of psychosocial health conditions that disproportionately afflict gay and bisexual men, each one making the others worse: childhood sexual abuse , partner violence, depression, and drug use. Together, their insidious effects are referred to as \u201csyndemics.\u201d \nMen who are most strongly affected by any one of these tend to be at high risk for HIV and substance abuse . Those of us from lower income or culturally marginalized ethnic groups are especially vulnerable to syndemic effects. \nIn one study, Stall found that 11 percent of 812 men who reported one problem\u2014depression, for instance\u2014had engaged in high-risk sex (defined as unprotected anal intercourse). Of 129 men who reported three or four problems, 23 percent said they had high-risk sex. \nThe usual reaction to such numbers is a comment about \u201creckless\u201d gay men. But look again. \nFramed another way, the numbers tell us something quite astonishing that can\u2019t be ignored: 89 percent of the men reporting one problem did not engage in high-risk sex. Likewise, more than three-quarters of the men with three or four problems did not engage in high-risk sex. \nThe numbers make it abundantly clear: the overwhelming majority of gay men\u2014 even those of us dealing with multiple mental health challenges, when only one is enough to undermine us\u2014actually do take care of, protect, and value ourselves. \nHow can it be? In the face of overwhelming pressures and struggles that can give gay men all the reasons we might want to harm or medicate ourselves, or worse, how is it that most of us don\u2019t? \nRon Stall attributes the surprising findings to gay men\u2019s resilience. \u201cWe\u2019re so focused on risk factors to the point that we forget about resilience,\u201d he said. \nStall believes \u201ca smarter way to go\u201d in thinking about HIV prevention, for example, would be to look at the guys who are thriving in spite of their adversities, how they pulled that off, see what lessons their experience offers, and apply it to the interventions aimed at supporting gay and bisexual men\u2019s health and mental health. \nStall and his colleagues describe gay men\u2019s resilience as \u201can untapped resource\u201d in addressing the high rates of psychosocial health problems\u2014such as depression, substance abuse, and victimization\u2014 that also drive HIV risk. \n\u201cHarnessing these natural strengths and resiliencies,\u201d they write, \u201cmay enhance HIV prevention and intervention programs, thereby providing the additional effectiveness needed to reverse the trends in HIV infection among men who have sex with men.\u201d \nResearch suggests our journey toward being resilient gay men begins by accepting our sexual orientation. As Ron Stall put it in our interv Source: John-Manuel Andriote/photo \niew, \u201cGuys who do the best job of resolving internalized homophobia are the least likely to have current victimization, substance abuse, and compulsive sex.\u201d \nPut a bit differently, Stall said, \u201cGetting a population of people not to hate themselves is good for their health.

It cost the Minnesota Health Department more than $900,000 and Hennepin County about $400,000 to contain and control the outbreak. \nWhile some might think the end of the outbreak is cause for immediate celebration, others of us, still feeling uneasy, are left thinking \u201cso now what?\u201d \nThis is not to say that the containment of the outbreak isn\u2019t good news. Of course the fact that the state can now declare an outbreak of a virulent infectious disease over is always wonderful news. But those of us who have been watching these types of outbreaks pop in and out of the news cycle increasingly over the past few years know what generally happens next and know that it\u2019s not the right response. \nWhat happens next is that we walk away, pat ourselves on the back, and immediately become consumed by something else, because there\u2019s always another crisis. Meanwhile, vaccine hesitancy is still rampant across the country and around the world, and, as we saw in the case of the Somali-American community in Minnesota, devoted anti-vaxxers are undoubtedly already on their way to seize on other vulnerable communities with their conspiracy theories. If you don\u2019t believe us, you might want to follow the national tour of the recent \u201cdocumentary\u201d Vaxxed, which involves a bus full of devoted anti-vaxxers driving around the country and spreading dangerous misinformation about life-saving vaccines. \nThe fact of the matter is, it will only be a matter of time before we have a repeat of what happened in Minnesota. While 79 cases of measles might not seem like a lot to some, when you consider the fact that that number can and should be zero and when you understand that the cost of containing an outbreak like this is actually quite high, suddenly 79 cases is a very big deal. When the outbreak started, it quickly became clear that this situation was brewing in Somali-American communities in Minnesota for years. The beginnings of the distrust of vaccination go all the way back to 2008. So the real question is: How did we go 9 whole years without realizing that something was going on in this community? Couldn\u2019t we have prevented this entire situation? If so, how? \nVaccine Fears Spread in India \nBefore we tackle these difficult but important questions, it\u2019s important to understand something about vaccine hesitancy: it\u2019s not just a developed world phenomenon. Many people assume that hesitancy and fear about vaccines exists only among highly wealthy individuals in developed countries such as the U.S. and many countries in Europe. In reality, we see varying degrees of vaccine hesitancy and public distrust of vaccines everywhere. The misperception seems to come from the idea that vaccine hesitancy is caused by people perceiving less risk of infectious diseases that are very rare in developed contexts. This view tends to lead to a sense that vaccine hesitancy cannot exist in developing countries, where many of the infectious diseases that are rare in places like the U.S. are still relatively common. \nWe have always thought that this is an over-simplified view of vaccine hesitancy, which is actually a complex social and psychological phenomenon that cannot be reduced to one cause. In fact, when surveys such as the Vaccine Confidence Survey are done in a variety of countries with a variety of income levels, we do see that vaccine hesitancy is in fact a global phenomenon that cuts across both developed and developing countries. \nA relatively recent example of the global nature of vaccine hesitancy comes from India. Earlier this year, India launched a campaign to vaccinate 35 million children against measles and rubella. A few weeks into the campaign, the effort was already struggling. Misinformation and conspiracy theories had gone \u201cviral\u201d on social media, causing a backlash against the vaccine. The content of the conspiracy theories and false safety concerns spanned from the notion that the vaccine was being used to sterilize children to concerns over autism to a claim that the vaccine had been taken off the market in the U.S. due to safety concerns. Source: Shutterstock \nWhile unpacking the conspiracy and false safety claims is essential and could easily become the topic of an entire dissertation, what\u2019s important to note here is that, as Heidi Larson astutely points out , the \u201csignal\u201d of this widespread hesitancy and fear was already there. As Larson explains, there had been clues in a survey done a year earlier in India that clearly showed dwindling levels of confidence in vaccines among residents of the same state (Tamil Nadu) in which there was the most resistance to the vaccine. In other words, health officials in India knew there was a problem on the horizon, but they didn\u2019t act on the signal immediately. Instead, they tried to simply operate as if that hesitancy and distrust weren\u2019t a factor and they ended up being thwarted by the very thing they were essentially trying to ignore. \nThere\u2019s a common saying in statistics and data analysis about the importance of separating the \u201csignal\u201d from the \u201cnoise.\u201d This refers to the fact that surveys like the one conducted by the Indian health authorities and other forms of research return heaps of data, much of which looks like it\u2019s communicating something significant but really is just random variation rather than actual evidence of a trend or change. It is common in medicine and public health to mistake pure noise for a signal. Sometimes we see these errors getting swept up in press releases and headlines that are nothing short of hyperbolic. So we are taught to guard against this and remain skeptical at all times. \nBut sometimes we have a different problem. Sometimes a signal really is a signal, but we fail to pay attention to it because perhaps it\u2019s not the most urgent matter at the moment, perhaps we don\u2019t have funding to pursue it, or perhaps we simply don\u2019t know what to do about it. It\u2019s difficult to fully understand all of the motivations and factors behind a failure to take action when a warning signal such as flagging vaccine confidence in parts of India or growing unease about vaccines among Somali-Americans becomes apparent. But failure to act in these cases is really not an option. And this brings us back to our initial questions: what can we do to ensure that the recognition of the signal turns into real action. \nDetecting Vaccine Fears Early and Taking Action \nWhen the Indian government undertook the survey that told them that vaccine rates were falling in various parts of their country, it would have been wise to follow up with a more detailed assessment of why this was happening. If they had done so, they most likely would have found that a number of people were becoming suspicious of routine vaccines and were spreading their suspicions via social media. They would also have discovered more about the content of these suspicions and which ones were most prominent. \nUnfortunately, we tend not to fund or spend much time on assessments like the one I described above. Despite the creation of the vaccine confidence index, for example, we don\u2019t use this excellent tool nearly enough to get an early read on vaccine hesitancy issues cropping up in different populations. Even when we do inquiries like this, we have a tendency to ignore the results. \nA good example of this comes from Ukraine. In 2014, the Global Polio Eradication\u2019s International Monitoring Board (IMB) sounded the alarm bell about a potential situation in Ukraine. The IMB noted that there was a strong anti-vaccination sentiment in Ukraine and that those attitudes combined with vaccine shortages and armed conflict might result in what they called the \u201cperfect storm.\u201d This 2014 warning was largely ignored, and sure enough, in 2015 several children were paralyzed by polio, creating widespread fear that the virus could re-emerge in Ukraine. The fact of the matter is, as with the situation in Minnesota, we should have seen this coming. Not only that but we should have done something about it immediately. \nBut what needs to be in place to ensure that we can be much more proactive in these situations? A lot is needed, but we\u2019ll leave you with what we think is at least the bare minimum here. We need much more global and local commitment to the overall issue of confidence in modern medicine and public health. We need to invest more in not just picking up the signals but knowing what to do about them and being prepared to act both early and immediately in case of a crisis. It took far too long for local Minnesota health officials to finally come around to the fact that talking to imams would help convince Somali-Americans to get their children vaccinated. Far too many people had already gotten measles at that point, even though this strategy did work eventually. \nThese strategies need to be readily accessible to everyone, and we need to invest much more money in testing other new strategies. Psychological resistance to vaccines and other medical technologies is a complex phenomenon, and it\u2019s not always obvious what to do about it. Our approach to this issue needs to be rigorous, scientific, and adequately resourced and prioritized. Our only other option is to watch more people become sickened and even die from diseases we know we could have prevented.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T22:47:14.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a8c1696e6edd87d410d2fa105876ef5feb0412e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LESJFxFMBdTiuYeypMcPGf6GzL56kMz2fp0osa44hbH1t6AnFOTPq_yle1tSlD_Bo-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Getting to Know New People", "title_full": "Getting to Know New People", "published": "2017-10-04T21:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_images/2017-10/omar-lopez-355586.jpg?itok=NxxiC1i1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8a8c1696e6edd87d410d2fa105876ef5feb0412e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LESJFxFMBdTiuYeypMcPGf6GzL56kMz2fp0osa44hbH1t6AnFOTPq_yle1tSlD_Bo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sfader", "published": "2017-10-04T21:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Getting to Know New People", "text": "Getting to Know New People Making friends through empathy and humor Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE \nGetting to know a new person can feel extremely daunting. You want to make a new lasting connection but maybe you're afraid. The standard \" get to know you questions \" might seem cliche. Here's a strategy I use sometimes to make the other person feel comfortable: I reveal random things about myself that you wouldn't necessarily ask. This is the litmus test to determine whether they will feel like they can share with me too. \nFor example, I might say something like: \"I'm anxious about the harsh winters in Portland, but then again I have anxiety so I am anxious about a lot of things.\" See? I revealed something about me that you might not know and now it makes the other person feel more comfortable about opening up and sharing parts about themselves. People tend to feel safer when they see that the other person is nonjudgmental. Falling on your proverbial sword will make your new friend feel like they can share more with you. \nHumor is your friend \nMake a joke about something that actually bothers you. Sarcasm is a great way to break the ice and invite other people to be real about what bothers them. Who doesn't like to complain about random life annoyances? Caution: try not to gossip . When you talk badly about another person, it reflects poorly on you. You want people to see you as someone they can trust. Gossiping will make you appear untrustworthy. Stick to complaints about public places, institutions or common societal issues like paying the phone bill or going to the DMV or Costco. \nEmpathy Helps \nSometimes during the course of getting to know someone, your new friend might reveal something personal that happened to them that was traumatic . That's normal and a part of life, but it's important to keep in mind that when your friend does this, put on your empathy hat. Ask them how they feel about what happened. They may or may not want to talk about it, but you offered to listen and that's what counts. \nFind something in common \nMaybe you both like sushi or the same Netflix series. Finding a common ground will make you both feel more comfortable. Talk about something you like and then see what the other person offers up. Maybe they like that thing too or they share with you another thing they are into. And when they do that, you can ask more questions about what they reveal. \nGetting to know people is an adventure \nGetting to know someone doesn't have to be scary. Think about it as an adventure. Be curious and ask questions. Imagine yourself as a detective who wants to learn more. Your curiosity will help you fortify some solid bonds in the future. You'll learn more about the person and find ways to connect. We've gone over some strategies that will help you get to know people and make long-lasting friendships. Getting to know people takes time; be patient with yourself and the person you're learning more about.

It\u2019s our job as the adults in their lives to protect them from themselves when they\u2019re engaging in behavior that will get them in trouble now, or in another context in their lives. But everything we know about child development suggests that angry punishments don\u2019t work very well in the long run. You may get a child to comply for the moment, but it will come at the cost of their self-esteem or lead to simmering resentment. In the long run, this won\u2019t go well for you or the child. \nWhat are logical consequences? \nNatural consequences\u2014the painful results of one\u2019s actions\u2014are the best teachers of all. When a child refuses to wear a coat on a rainy day, the natural consequence of allowing the child to go out without a coat is that the child will get wet and uncomfortable. When it\u2019s an option, a natural consequence is a great teaching tool. The child has no one but himself to blame for his misery, and will probably wear a coat next time it rains. \nLogical consequences are also the result of a person\u2019s actions but are imposed by someone else. In both cases, the child is experiencing some type of trouble because of their behavior. (In this article, I use the term \u201clogical consequences\u201d to include natural as well as logical consequences.) \nImposing logical consequences: What can you do when children are doing bad things? \nWhat\u2019s the best way to respond when toddlers and young children (up to age seven or so) are doing something they shouldn\u2019t do? It depends on the nature of the child and the problem, of course, but here are some ideas for addressing misbehavior in toddlers and children under seven or eight: Dial it down. Step back, take a deep breath, and rein in any impulses you might have to yell or punish. Don\u2019t be a bully . Remember they are much smaller than you. As with any situation where one person has a lot more power or strength than another, your anger carries an implicit threat of violence. The evil monster in the fairy tales, that\u2019s you. Stay present and connected . The last thing a young child needs when they\u2019re out of control or misbehaving badly is to be banished from your presence. Timeouts may appear benign and useful, but they don\u2019t work in the long run . See it as a learning opportunity. Try to put the child\u2019s bad behavior into positive perspective, as a great opportunity for you to help the child learn something. Sometimes the child\u2014especially if they\u2019re under four\u2014is genuinely ignorant about the \u201cbadness\u201d inherent in their actions. Sometimes all the child needs is a strong but loving conversation about why you don\u2019t want them doing what they\u2019re doing. Look for what else is wrong. Sometimes kids know exactly what they\u2019re doing, and are trying to get you angry enough to pay attention. Whether the bad behavior is intentional or not (and it is hard to know someone else\u2019s intentions with any certainty), bad behavior is always a message. The child has real needs that aren\u2019t being met, and they don\u2019t yet know how to communicate it so you will hear them. They might be needing some loving attention from you, something to eat or drink, sleep , exercise, fresh air, or quiet. Be private . Deal with the situation, but do it privately. Even young children feel humiliated when they\u2019re publicly corrected or punished. Look for a logical consequence . When you think a consequence is required for the child to learn what you want them to, remember that children (like adults!) learn best when they feel respected, valued, and listened to. Think about the 3 R\u2019s (plus H) . Jane Nelsen suggests that consequences for misbehavior should be (a) Related to the behavior, (b) Respectfully administered (no blame, shame, or pain), (c) Reasonable relative to the crime, and (d) Helpful in moving the child toward better behavior. Ask the child for help. If you can\u2019t think of a good logical consequence, ask the misbehaving child. Kids are almost always brilliant at thinking up appropriate consequences, although they can be a bit draconian. You may have to tone down their ideas before implementation. Move on . Once the child has done their time, you might ask (with a gentle smile) if they\u2019ve learned anything from the experience, but don\u2019t belabor it. \nLogical consequences: some examples \nFour-year-old Sammy spills his milk, as he\u2019s trying to pour it from one glass to another after you have asked him not to do that. \nDo not ask Sammy why he\u2019s so clumsy. Do not remind him you\u2019d asked him not to pour from one glass to the other. Do not tell him he can\u2019t have any more milk. Do not send him for a timeout. \nInstead, say something like, \u201cWhoops. What do we do next?\u201d \nHe will almost certainly know that he needs to get a cloth and clean it up and probably won\u2019t mind doing that if you treat him with good-natured respect. If he doesn\u2019t know what to do next, it may be because you haven\u2019t invested the time in teaching him. \nThree-year-old Lauren hits her brother because he\u2019s using the toy she wants to play with. \nDo not hit Lauren or tell her to go to a timeout. Look at her as if you can\u2019t quite believe she has done this, and say something like, \u201cYou know we don\u2019t hit people in our family. What happens next?\u201d \nIf little Lauren doesn\u2019t seem to know she needs to apologize, help her get there. Do some role-playing with what an apology looks like, with you and Lauren taking turns playing the role of her and her brother. Once she has told him she\u2019s sorry and told you that she knows she shouldn\u2019t hit people, consider what else might be going on. Is she hungry, tired, thirsty, needing a snuggle? Use her behavior as a message to attend to what\u2019s happening with her. \nSix-year-old Polly has made a big mess. There are blocks and books and toys strewn all around the living room. \nDon\u2019t yell. Don\u2019t tell Polly you\u2019ve told her a million times she has to put her things away as she finishes using them. And don\u2019t give her a timeout. More than anything, Polly needs a time-in right now. \nSay something like, \u201cMy goodness. You have a big job ahead of you. You know what\u2019s next, right?\u201d \nShe may grumble but stay with her on this. She\u2019s trying to tell you something with this mess, and you want to hear it. She may be feeling overwhelmed, worried, or something else. Ask her if she wants to clean it up by herself, or if she\u2019d like some help. If she\u2019s unwilling to start the clean-up, start it yourself, telling her what you\u2019re doing, and asking for her help. \u201cHow about we start with the books? Let\u2019s put them back in the bookcase.\u201d \nIf she moves out of the room, let her know you need her to come back and do the clean-up. You might give her a few minutes grace period before you get her to bring her back, just to allow her to retain her self-respect. \nIf she still resists cleaning up, tell her that you\u2019ll clean it all up, but that you\u2019ll put everything into a box that she won\u2019t have access to for a day or more (depending on the situation). \nWhy do logical consequences work? Obvious connection to the crime . The consequence provides an obvious result of their behavior. This is a much more effective way of showing a child why they should behave better than a punishment that has no connection to the crime. No humiliation . By focusing on the deed as bad, and not the perpetrator, logical consequences don\u2019t shame or punish the child. With children\u2014like most adults\u2014humiliation is more likely to breed resentment and retaliation than learning. Encourages responsibility for behavior. Punishments, including timeouts, show that the adult is the boss, no matter what the adult might tell the child about reaping the punishment they earned. Logical consequences, on the other hand, show the child how to take responsibility for their behavior. Calm and connected. Unlike most punishments, including spanking and timeouts, logical consequences can be imposed in ways that make a child feel safe and secure. \nWhat are the problems with logical consequences? Not always appropriate . They provide one way of handling misbehavior and aren\u2019t always the best way. Sometimes a child needs only a hug and conversation about the behavior. Sometimes\u2014with bigger or persistent problems\u2014the child and parent need professional help. Imagination necessary. The adult has to be able to think up an appropriate logical consequence. If there isn\u2019t an obvious one, the child can often help generate something good and inventive. Temptation to save the child . Depending on the consequence, the adult might have a hard time not saving the child from the consequence. For example, nobody wants to see a child get cold and wet because they refused to wear a raincoat. Take time to sink in . Logical consequences don\u2019t always work the first time. Over time, kids who experience logical consequences increasingly take responsibility for their actions, but they won\u2019t get it all at once. \nFor more ideas about using logical consequences with children: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "greg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "polly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sammy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lauren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane nelsen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T01:38:12.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f526430065cb4f2a6c7963e5d0cf47f8b5dc065", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I45oiT.6yq6UNszKupBQIDqlKV4qxfwlTL3.Efp7NO1E3qXDKxtyuM", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Time in a Bottle", "title_full": "Time in a Bottle", "published": "2017-10-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/collection_large/public/field_collection_image/trainfabrizioverrecchiapexels-298018-645x344-0_65-940_501.jpg?itok=a0_JHThn", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f526430065cb4f2a6c7963e5d0cf47f8b5dc065", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I45oiT.6yq6UNszKupBQIDqlKV4qxfwlTL3.Efp7NO1E3qXDKxtyuM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dsills", "published": "2017-10-05T07:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Time in a Bottle", "text": "  Time in a Bottle Is your time well spent?

Sometimes this takes the form of the patient claiming to have \"alters\" or \"multiple personalities.\" Sometimes it is vaguer and the patient is said to have \"detached from reality,\" supposedly losing volitional control of her conduct. All of these claims are a ruse, a game played by the patient\u2014with or without conscious intent\u2014to absolve oneself of responsibility for her own actions. The history of dissociative identity disorder is marked by recurrent false epidemics triggered by popular books and movies like Sybil (1973). Source: Fair use \nI have seen a number of patients claiming to have a dissociative disorder, some self-diagnosed and some diagnosed by other psychotherapists or psychiatrists. One patient would claim to dissociate each time she relapsed on drugs . Another claimed to have dissociated when she broke up with a boyfriend and \"came out\" of her dissociation when she realized that she still loved him and wanted to get back with him. Yet another said that he would dissociate each time he cheated on his wife. I didn't believe a single one of them. Whether they believed themselves is a different question. \nI am in agreement with Allen Frances, M.D., professor emeritus of psychiatry at Duke University and chairman of the DSM-IV Task Force. In his well-written article here on Psychology Today , Frances argues that the diagnosis of dissociation is almost always a fake, although the patients said to have it may not be consciously attempting to deceive . \nWhat is the appeal of the diagnosis of dissociation? Like Frances, I contend that the diagnosis offers a useful and dramatic metaphor for patients to relay their internal conflicts and moral -existential dilemmas. These conflicts between moral and immoral, ego and id, good and evil become symbolically dramatized in a fashionable label of dissociation. But the diagnosis becomes too real to the patient, usually under the influence of an enthusiastic but misguided therapist or online chat group, and the patient comes to translate an abstract metaphor into a concrete psychiatric disease. The result is a patient who claims not to be responsible for the things said and done during the dissociated mental state. \nIn order to appreciate the absurdity that is the psychiatric diagnosis of dissociation, one must have an understanding of the history of the disorder. Fads in psychiatry come and go, and dissociation\u2014and its most well-known variant, multiple personality disorder or dissociate identity disorder\u2014is no exception. The history of the disorder is one marked by recurrent false epidemics driven largely by popular books and movies, such as, most famously, The Three Faces of Eve and Sybil . This folly is highlighted by the fact that the real \"Sybil\" has admitted that her multiple personalities were faked, the story a ruse and a lie. \nI occasionally meet a fellow mental health professional who believes in the diagnosis of dissociation as a legitimate condition, but most seem to be in agreement that the diagnosis is a sham. Sometimes these patients are said to be suffering from a different type of condition, such as borderline personality disorder or psychosis , but most are diagnosed as malingering , a conscious and deliberate attempt to feign illness for secondary gain. Why, then, does the diagnosis remain? The answer lies in the fact that the proponents of the concept, the so-called experts in dissociation as a psychiatric condition, have vested interest in the legitimacy of the disorder. Many of them have devoted the entirety of their careers to the \"study\" and \"treatment\" of this mythical condition. And the patients find good use in the disorder as a means of escaping personal responsibility. \nHopefully one day in the not-so-distant future the diagnosis of dissociation will be thrown into the trash heap of history and recognized for what it is\u2014a clever but mythical attempt to fool others\u2014and sometimes the self\u2014into believing that people are not always in control of their conduct and responsible for everything they do.

Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE Source: Luca Mascaro, CC 2.0 \nAs an alternative to the how-to article, I occasionally offer a short-short story embedding a how-to lesson or two. \nEven in kindergarten, Jeremy displayed his tendency to be passive, bookish, and eager to please. So he was largely invisible to teacher and classmates. He wanted friends but wasn\u2019t the type to reach out. So despite urgings from his assertive dad, Jeremy became more and more reclusive. \nBut when his mother's new job relocated the family to a new city, Jeremy decided that, with his fresh start, he\u2019d try to be more assertive. But he overreacted. He was demanding of his teacher and showing off to would-be friends. No surprise, that was received more poorly than his passivity. As a result, not only did he retreat to his former self, he moved further inward by becoming fastidious: he\u2019d continually clean out and re-organize everything from his notebook binder to his socks drawer. He'd go to the nearby high school\u2019s baseball games by himself, even doubleheaders, not only watching but keeping score, all the way down to how many pitches each pitcher had thrown. \nWhen Jeremy was in 8th grade, his mom got another promotion requiring a move and while she was reluctant to move the family again, she got convinced when the employer allowed her to wait until Jeremy had finished junior high school. \nAttending high school in yet another city, Jeremy decided to aim for moderation in interactivity and, instead of just watching baseball, he\u2019d try out for the high school junior varsity. And he made the team although only because few people tried out, and even so, he spent most of the time on the bench, yes, keeping score, this time for the team\u2019s benefit. \nPersonally, Jeremy had now hit a reasonable sweet spot: still basically introspective but outgoing enough to have a small circle of friends, even his first girlfriend. Alas, drenched in teenage hormones , he was a bit too persistent in trying to convince her to \u201cgo all the way,\u201d and when she finally acceded, within a month, she was pregnant, and unfortunate for him, she was against abortion\u2014He would be a father at age 16. \nJeremy couldn\u2019t deal with that and so ran away from home and neither his parents the girl, nor her parents could ever find him. The case grew cold and law enforcement stopped looking for him. Jeremy was able to remain undetected largely because in leaving, he stole the $5,000 emergency money his dad had kept under the bed and used it to pay for a nose job that, with a different haircut and dye, made him unrecognizable. Also, he got fake ID including a Social Security card associated with a common name of someone who died but for whom no death certificate was filed. So Jeremy was undetectable. He could get another fresh start. \nWithout a high school diploma, Jeremy was limited to low-level jobs and got one selling cotton candy at the minor league baseball team stadium but soon got promoted to peanuts and when he turned 18, beer. On days he wasn\u2019t selling, he\u2019d still go to the game, score them, and between innings study for a GED, the equivalent of a high-school diploma. \nJeremy had little money and less interest in going to college so he decided he\u2019d try to land a more substantive job with that baseball team by walking into the clubhouse. He wasn\u2019t allowed to but because he worked at the stadium, the security guard let him in. In that way, he managed to land a job as \u201cequipment technician,\u201d a fancy way of saying he\u2019d collect the dirty uniforms and towels and put them in the laundry bin and, when he was lucky, clean the baseball bats. Jeremy's quietness was appreciated by the athletes who often were bombastic in winning, belly-aching in losing. \nDuring games, Jeremy wasn't allowed on the bench nor to have a second job selling beer in the stands, so he\u2019d sit in the clubhouse watching the games on closed-circuit TV (Most minor-league games aren\u2019t telecast.) keeping score, with ever more nuance. He had learned what the team\u2019s statistician does and Jeremy noted valuable things that the statistician didn\u2019t have time to record. \nOne day, the statistician asked to see what Jeremy was recording. Impressed, he asked if Jeremy want to trade his sweaty-laundry gig for a job as assistant statistician. He\u2019d even get a pay raise. Not surprising, he was grateful for that next fresh start. \nJeremy\u2019s career continued to evolve. Next it was statistician for a C-level minor league team, then B level, then right up to the majors and, in the ultimate victory, for Major League Baseball. \nJeremy's next big fresh start was as a husband and father. His natural passivity and adolescent fervidity had given way to moderation. That enabled him to meet and marry a fine woman and they were good parents to two children. \nThat almost brings us up to date except that Jeremy had a cancer scare, which turned out to be a misdiagnosis. He was already counting his days and so he considers the doctor\u2019s mea culpa to be his ultimate fresh start. \nThe takeaway \nHave you had fresh starts? Have you taken advantage of them? Want to do anything different now, with or without having had a fresh start? \nDo you need a fresh start now? How likely would a change of job, romantic partner, living situation, or geographic location help? Would an internal change be of greater value, for example, a new skill or attitude?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeremy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luca mascaro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "major league baseball", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T08:25:21.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67888f3a2c434bea7977172d1c8afc18e840b1b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LmngqtTsE8XvmQkzO6ftMYqVIG4CEfh_rz2nUcQXSpHHbqgS9ZUGu8hzDo2nXtcqf95eAOvoYwyeS6L8wv4h2dmnHsfn1xvQFSk6R2RI238DN2f74vQf4Qc1yHwonqVk4-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "7 Reasons It's Tough to Raise Mentally Strong Kids", "title_full": "7 Reasons It's Tough to Raise Mentally Strong Kids", "published": "2017-10-05T02:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/fotolia_66312155_s.jpg?itok=wjpYKOjt", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67888f3a2c434bea7977172d1c8afc18e840b1b1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LmngqtTsE8XvmQkzO6ftMYqVIG4CEfh_rz2nUcQXSpHHbqgS9ZUGu8hzDo2nXtcqf95eAOvoYwyeS6L8wv4h2dmnHsfn1xvQFSk6R2RI238DN2f74vQf4Qc1yHwonqVk4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "amorin", "published": "2017-10-05T02:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "7 Reasons It's Tough to Raise Mentally Strong Kids", "text": "7 Reasons It's Tough to Raise Mentally Strong Kids Today's world isn't exactly conducive to building mental muscle. Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE Source: Fotolia \nOn the surface, it might look like today's parents have it easier than ever. After all, you don't have to go down to the river to do your laundry anymore. \nClearly, modern-day society offers advantages that make it easier to keep your kids healthy. But at the same time, the digital world may actually make it more difficult to raise capable kids who are equipped to tackle the challenges of adulthood . \nIt takes mental strength to raise kids who will become responsible adults. Here are seven reasons why it's harder than ever to be a mentally strong parent in today's world: 1. Happiness is all the rage . \nYou don't have to look very far to find books or articles that talk about the steps you can take to raise happy kids. And while happiness is a great byproduct, it shouldn't be the goal. \nLetting your child eat endless amounts of ice cream and playing video games 24 hours a day will make him happy right now. But over the long haul, he'll be miserable. \nIt's important to focus a fair amount of your effort on teaching kids skills that won't necessarily make them happy in the moment. Self-discipline , impulse control, and emotional regulation are essential for long-term happiness. 2. Social media fuels parenting competition . \nMost parents want to share images of their children enjoying family vacations, participating in sports, and receiving awards on Facebook and Instagram. But rather than revel in your joy, looking at other happy families can spark competition among parents who want to show how amazing their children are too. \nIt's hard to share an image of your child \"being grateful \" or \"overcoming self-doubt.\" So even if your child is kind and caring, you might fall into the trap of thinking you have to brag about his latest tangible achievement. \nAnd suddenly, your online activity may become a competition to prove who is raising the \"best\" kids. But raising mentally strong kids is about helping them become the best versions of themselves, not better than other people. 3. Parents weren't taught mental strength building skills. \nWhether you were a latchkey kid growing up in the 80s or you are a millennial raised by someone who believed kids should be seen and not heard, there's a good chance your parents weren't sitting around talking about your feelings. \nSome households stressed obedience\u2014and the kids' opinions didn't matter. And other parents just didn't have the knowledge of mental strength to pass it along. If no one taught you how to develop healthy self-talk and how to regulate your emotions, it's hard to teach those skills to kids. 4. Too many helicopter parents make it hard to let kids fail. \nIf a child forgot to do his homework 25 years ago, it wasn't a big deal. All kids forgot their homework sometimes. \nBut once helicopter parents entered the scene, kids stopped making mistakes because their parents wouldn't let them fail. So now a missed homework assignment or forgotten basketball sneakers mean your kid might fall behind. \nBut natural consequences can be life's greatest teacher. It's important to let kids experience failure and setbacks so they can learn how to bounce back. 5. Parent shaming incites fear . \nPeople are quick to pass judgment about one another's parenting choices these days. Whether someone shames a Facebook \"friend\" who doesn't feed her children organic fruit or a reader leaves a comment that says a celebrity's divorce will scar the children for life, parent shaming is a real problem. \nAnd no one wants to face that kind of scrutiny. So in an attempt to avoid looking like a \"bad\" parent, many parents are changing their habits. \nRather than let their preschooler throw a tantrum when she's told she can't have candy, parents are giving in to make the crying stop. Or, instead of letting a child get a bad grade, parents are correcting their kids' homework. And those little parenting choices make a big difference on kids' ability to develop resilience . 6. Marketing companies prey on parents' guilt. \nAdvertisements will tell you that you're a good Mom\u2014as long as you buy your child certain toys. And that you're an awesome Dad as long as you take your kids to a certain theme park. \nCompanies know that parents feel guilty about not spending enough time with kids, not giving them every competitive advantage possible, and not giving them all the things they need to be happy. And they prey on that guilt to sell you stuff you don't need. \nWhether it's too much food, too many toys, or too much time on their electronics, many parents are over indulging kids. Giving kids more temporarily relieves them of their guilt, but kids are the ones who are ultimately losing out. 7. Technology prevents mental muscle building opportunities. \nKids used to have to deal with uncomfortable emotions, like boredom and frustration. But now, most of them use their digital devices to escape their feelings. \nBeing glued to their screens means they don't have to calm themselves down or privately deal with their anxiety. Instead, they can play games or use social media to regulate their feelings for them. \nParents have to be more proactive than ever to ensure kids are learning the social, emotional, and cognitive skills they need to succeed in life. Build Your Mental Muscles \nThe extra challenges of today's world make it more important than ever for parents to become mentally strong. That means developing healthy habits that build your mental muscle, while also giving up the bad habits that can hold you back. \nBecoming mentally stronger has an added bonus\u2014it increases the likelihood that your kids will be mentally strong . After all, they learn how to manage stress , how to solve problems, and how to tackle challenges by watching you.

It is attributed to Kent Keith. \nPeople are often unreasonable, illogical, and self- centered: \nIf you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives: \nBe kind anyway. \nIf you are successful, you will win some false friends and some true enemies \nSucceed anyway. \nIf you are honest and frank, people may cheat you; \nBe honest and frank anyway. \nWhat you spend years building, someone could destroy overnight: \nBuild anyway. \nIf you find serenity and happiness , they may be jealous ; \nBe happy anyway. \nThe good you do today, people will often forget tomorrow; \nDo good anyway. \nGive the world the best you have, and it may never be enough; \nGive the world the best you\u2019re got anyway. \nYou see, in the final analysis, it is between you and your God; \nIt was never between you and them anyway. \nEquanimity is an essential practice for our troubled and chaotic times. Meditation teacher Sharon Salzberg calls it the \u201csecret ingredient\u201d in mindfulness as it leads to wisdom . It is about meeting life, no matter what arises, with an open and responsive heart. Equanimity is frequently taught in meditation centers. In fact, in the Tibetan tradition, it is the first practice that is taught. However, it is rarely discussed in the psychological literature. Yet it has immense value not only for clinicians, as it helps us be present with all that arises in our consulting rooms, but also for those who seek to find balance in their lives. It helps us not get overwhelmed and to meet challenging events without being shattered. It is a steadiness of mind and a calm understanding that allows us to be with the constantly changing and shifting landscape of our world. \nBuddhist scholar Andrew Olendzki writes that classical mindfulness, unlike popular mindfulness, \u201cis all about the cultivation of equanimity. One is able to experience both pleasure and pain without clinging to anything in the world. One can be aware of what is gratifying and distressing, not needing things to be other than they are.\u201d \nThe Buddha\u2019s teaching is that what we think about and dwell upon becomes the shape of our mind. The shape of our mind shapes our world of experience. So, if we dwell on fear , ill will, worry, or obsession we get even better at fear, worry, obsession and ill will. The neuroscientist Donald Hebb noted that \u201cneurons that fire together wire together.\u201d However, if we train the mind to make kindness, compassion, and equanimity what we practice, these qualities can become the shape of our mind. \nThe word is translated from the Pali Upekkha which means \u201cto look over,\u201d and refers to the ability to see with patience or to see with understanding. It is a spacious stillness of heart that creates room for all things. \nThe following practice will give you a taste of equanimity: Sitting comfortably, give yourself a moment to arrive. Let yourself stop. Be here, in your body, in this room. Listening to this recording, the sounds around you. Perhaps let out a sigh, aaaa Let go of your day. Let yourself relax fully. Releasing any unnecessary tension\u2014in your eyes, your jaw, chest, belly, buttocks, legs, feet. Edit any narrative in your head. Drop into now Rest For the moment, stop the conversation in your head, stop any arguments you are having with yourself or others. Let the stories fall away. Just this, just this moment. Touching, even for a moment, this stillness, this quiet. Nothing to do, no one to be. Feeling some space around you. Right here, right now. Not judging the way things are. Inviting space into your life, your body, your mind. Don\u2019t create tension with what is arising in your life. Relax with it. Don\u2019t try to fix it. Leave your mind alone. Resting in this quiet, this equanimity, this awareness. Letting yourself be held by this stillness. \nLike the skills of concentration , mindfulness, and compassion, it can be trained and cultivated. Equanimity develops as we learn to stay in the moment and keep our hearts open. No matter how painful or pleasant, we learn to greet each moment fully, to greet it as a friend. We\u2019re not trying to force anything, but to develop an intention to be with everything that arises, and to hold it with patience and understanding. \nThe good news is that equanimity is not developed in sublime and peaceful times, or on a mountain retreat far, far away. This is a practice for times like ours\u2014full of chaos, agitation, and uncertainty--difficult times. There is an African saying that puts it well, \u201ccalm seas do not create skillful sailors.\u201d Equanimity helps us work skillfully with the high winds, severe storm, hurricanes, earthquakes, and tragedies of our lives. \nThe German writer Goethe\u2019s words echo those of the Budha\u2019s: \nI have come to the frightening conclusion that \nI am the decisive element \nIt is my personal approach that creates the climate. \nIt is my daily mood that makes the weather. \nI possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous \nI can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration. \nI can humiliate or humor , hurt or heal. \nIn all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated and a person humanized or dehumanized \nIn the past few weeks, I have become fascinated by Goya\u2019s \u201cBlack Paintings,\u201d a series of 14 works created during 1819-1823. They are nightmarish images of men killing each other, of massive destruction and violence. Historians have claimed that no modern art is as essential to our understanding of the human condition. \nDeaf and ill, at the end of his life, Goya looked into hell. Are we, one wonders, also looking into hell when we watch the news? Times like this are why we need, all the more, to practice mindfulness, compassion, and equanimity. For ourselves, our children, and our planet. \nPsychologist Susan Pollak, MTS, Ed.D., co-author of the book Sitting Together : Essential Skills for Mindfulness-Based Psychotherapy , (Guilford Press) is co-founder of the Center for Mindfulness and Compassion at Cambridge Health Alliance, Harvard Medical School, where she has taught and supervised for over twenty years.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mother teresa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kent keith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew olendzki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buddha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goethe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald hebb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharon salzberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan pollak", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "guilford press", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buddhist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for mindfulness and compassion at cambridge health alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mts", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "calcutta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pali upekkha", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T08:25:24.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "036c21df2cdd6503ac3fe240788fec4b3d316d4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3W6l7kkDdJvuXVY9wsNUZ.UH7aj6RjnGBtnoNwnKjwcBz8ZjreFwSV0DP4OhYRTSLZgX.kb8XDVXR0wamB4HqvNGp.oplQH3AA--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "5 Tips on Getting Your Aspie/Autie Husband to Talk More", "title_full": "5 Tips on Getting Your Aspie/Autie Husband to Talk More", "published": "2017-10-05T01:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/couple-walking1.jpg?itok=Gx65ilm1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "036c21df2cdd6503ac3fe240788fec4b3d316d4f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3W6l7kkDdJvuXVY9wsNUZ.UH7aj6RjnGBtnoNwnKjwcBz8ZjreFwSV0DP4OhYRTSLZgX.kb8XDVXR0wamB4HqvNGp.oplQH3AA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "emendes", "published": "2017-10-05T01:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 Tips on Getting Your Aspie/Autie Husband to Talk More", "text": "5 Tips on Getting Your Aspie/Autie Husband to Talk More Help for Marriage with Asperger's Syndrome and Autism Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE \nI recently received the following query from a non-spectrum or neurotypical (NT) wife of a man with Asperger \u2019s Syndrome ( Autism Spectrum Disorder). \nQuestion: I would love to understand why an aspie can be social, lively, humorous and talkative in a group, but it all goes away within the walls of home. My husband is very involved in martial arts. It is his special interest, he runs classes, and his Facebook has many posts. At home he is more uptight, silent and rarely begins conversation. I pay attention to his love language I must agree love and commitment is solid. How do you have a conversation about this? \n\u2014 NC, wife of a man with undiagnosed Asperger Syndrome \nAnswer: 5 Tips on Getting Your Aspie Husband to Talk More \nAround his special interest, an aspie or a person with Asperger Syndrome (AS) or autism (ASD) will often be lively, humorous, and talkative. He will often enjoy speaking about his special interest to others, encourage their interest, and even go out of his way to expand his network around his special endeavors. \nFor a person with ASD, his job can often be his special interest as well. Even when it is not his special interest, he will like to use his skills, and intellect to engage and thrive at his job. Working is something that individuals with ASD inherently enjoy\u2026maybe even more so than their non-spectrum counterparts. In addition, work provides financial security and a sense of accomplishment. Therefore, he will make the effort to be \u2018lively, humorous and talkative at work.\u2019 \nEspecially after marriage , the husband with Asperger Syndrome might relax and be more himself\u2026he will behave more like he does when he\u2019s alone, which can mean being silent. Even if he has been talkative during the dating phase of the relationship, he will come to relax into what\u2019s more natural for him. Often this may be because, he\u2019s content to just be in the same room with his wife and not feel the need to make conversation with her, or in some instances, this is because he just doesn\u2019t know what to say. \n1. Phone conversations: Investigate whether your husband is more likely to speak to you in person or over the phone. A couple I work with talk to each other on the phone rather than in person as the husband has a hard time with face-to-face conversation. The husband got home from work earlier than his wife, so on the evenings that she wanted to talk to him, she stayed late at the office and called him and had a 20 minute phone conversation with him. This helped her to feel more connected to her husband and she would go home ready to have dinner and be intimate with him. So, if your husband is better at speaking on the phone, then call him when he might be available to talk. \n2. Text or chat conversations: The same goes for conversations over text messaging or chat. Many people with ASD prefer conversations via text or chat and can cover a lot of ground via this medium. Texting and chat also allows the husband with ASD time to process things at his own pace and be more precise in communicating what\u2019s on his mind. \n3. Email: Communicating via email can also be a good way for many couples to communicate the things that are on their mind. Similar to texting and chat, email can also help the aspie partner to have more complete conversations and dialogue over issues that might be otherwise hard to address in person. \n4. Walks: For many aspies, talking while looking at their partner or having to focus on their partner\u2019s eyes can make conversation more difficult. Walking side by side on a quiet street or a walking path and talking might be a good strategy to get around the eye-contact challenge. \n5. ASD-Specific Couple\u2019s Counseling : If you feel like you need to further address the issue, couples counseling can be a useful forum to do so. A professional with a neutral perspective is often more able to convince the husband with ASD that conversation is important and a crucial part of being in a relationship, especially for the non-spectrum or neurotypical (NT) wife. \nThe key is to know what works for your husband with ASD and you, and then come up with strategies around that.

How comics handle their job when tragedy strikes. Posted Oct 04, 2017 \nThe horrible tragedy in Las Vegas. As a standup comic, our community has to ask, \"How do we comedians make people laugh with when we are blasted with such tragedy such as what happened in Vegas?\" Source: Judy Carter \nI learned a lesson about this when my book, The Comedy Bible was first published 2001 and I went on tour to promote it with comedy concerts\u2014 on Sept. 13, 2001. That's right, 48 hours after 9/11. \nMy friends told me to cancel as they said, \"Nobody was in the mood to laugh.\" And, believe it or not, I was starting my tour in, you guessed it, New York City. \nWhen I got on stage in New York, in front of 200 people at a show at the Gotham Comedy Club, we had a moment of silence and then I went into my material. There was that moment that all comics know about; the silence before the joke hits the audience. That night, the gap seemed excruciatingly long. And then, people laughed. They didn't just laugh, they erupted. It was loud and deafening as acts of rebellion usually are. It was as if the audience was saying, \"Terrorists have taken away a part of our city, our community, and our sense of security, but we will be damned if they take away our sense of humor .\" \nIt was in that room, with wall-to-wall, defiant, convulsive laughter , that I realized that it was a perfect birth date for a new comedy book; as what is the purpose of humor but to spin tragedy into comedy? Humor is healing. \nIsn't that why we comics do comedy; to turn our own problems into punch lines and heal ourselves? Life doesn't show up funny, it shows up messy, troubling, humiliating, painful, confusing, ugly, happy, scary, disturbing, and then we all die (sorry to deliver the news). \nIt is up to us funny people to remind others and ourselves to see the humor of it all; to feel and see the pain and choose to laugh in its face. \nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), 350 million people worldwide suffer from depression . If we can take anything away from that, it's that we're needed, even if only to make someone laugh at one joke. So, funny people, let's get busy! The world needs us, now more than ever.

There were 119 others at the Crown and Anchor in Provincetown, Mass., spending \u201cAn Evening With Armistead Maupin.\u201d He read to us from his newest memoir, Logical Family . His book was just released in stores and online. \nMy good fortune was not only that I got to see Mr. Maupin in such an intimate venue, but that I was seated in the second row, just about 20 feet from him, and it was as if he were speaking to only me. In the bits and pieces he selected from his memoir, he focused on his relationship with his grandmother. As a gay psychotherapist obsessed with how people grow strong while being diminished by societal norms, I am touched by how this gay man had early on figured much of this out and throughout the years has shared what he learned with the rest of us in his writing. \nOn this evening, Mr. Maupin was particularly gracious and inspiring. He mesmerized us by his mere presence, and it was clear that everybody could feel it. He sat on a tall wingback chair with a lamp next to him, nothing fancy, like sitting in an older relative\u2019s living room and simply being bathed in love . Yes, we were sitting around a hearth, and hearing about history, appreciating where we have come from, just like a grandparent or an aunt or uncle who connects the dots for us regarding our lineage. In this room, we could make sense of where we came from, a big chunk of it anyway, especially the way things unfolded decades ago in San Francisco. The room had a special glow that night, not the usual glow of the cabaret that is commonly associated with this space. This man seemed to reach each one of us. \nAn important aspect of the stories that were shared were inspirational, reminding me that in life there is always a little more in front of us than we realize. Not only is there the content of what people tell us, but there are more significant lessons that we can extrapolate from these relational moments. We can choose to take what we hear and see at face value or to look just a little deeper for larger meanings and metaphors. Whether they are about life in general, or just about us, Mr Maupin provided several invitations to make our own meaning, to co-create in a way. \nSince one of my projects involves exploring the relationships of gay sons and their mothers (GaySonsandMothers.com), I was delighted to hear him talk in some depth about his grandmother, and what she meant to him. He made several references to special times they had, the ways in which she profoundly impacted him, and the intensity of saying goodbye to her on her deathbed. \nHe spoke about the importance of a gay child having an eccentric aunt or grandmother. \u201cWe all have eccentric relatives to inspire us like Auntie Mame.\u201d She would be the one who noticed us or whose odd presence encouraged us to flourish outside the box, making the struggle of being gay that much easier. Yes, anyone lucky enough to have such a figure in their life could receive the nourishment and permission he alluded to\u2014and yet here he was, right in front of us, exactly that person! \nLooking around the room, most of us were of an age that we had grown up under his influence, having read his books and articles, especially Tales of the CIty. He is the one who taught us about gay life, the importance of community, and the power of being accepted by chosen family. And it was so wonderful to move into present time with him as he welcomed questions from the audience and spontaneously responded about his experiences and beliefs. \nAs he read about his grandmother and spoke about his family, he became tearful. He was self-conscious about his tears and tried to hide them, but it was touching to see, a reminder that it is okay for us to cry and to appreciate our own families. He, our mentor and teacher, showed how love and reliance on family is important. Despite the silence of his own Southern family, he let us understand that despite the frailties of most families, especially in being able to support gay children, their love for us, and our love in return, is crucial to our wellbeing. He showed how compassion and acceptance are preferable to resentment and bitterness. \nI asked him about his relationship with his mother. He described his coming out process to her in 1977, and how he wished it would have been different. The letter he had written was the actual letter that was used in Tales of the City , and it set the backdrop of the entire story. \nOne couple in the audience asked for advice about growing older: \u201cWe are turning 50 this fall, any tips on this?\u201d He hesitated for a moment, and the audience waited patiently for his response. \u201cChicken!\u201d he announced. Of course, we laughed, but it was an honest nudge about holding to a good perspective. \nI write about this evening not only because it was such a delightful experience but because it is so important to find our mentors, and then to keep finding them\u2014to remind ourselves about the importance of community, about the emergence of grace in unexpected moments, and about taking time to appreciate the people and places that we have visited along the way. Mr. Maupin\u2019s time with us was a trance-like experience that continues to stay with me, and undoubtedly the others who were there. \nPerhaps you can take a moment now to step back in time and to remember someone special, someone who embraced you without question or judgment, with whom you felt permitted to be you, and to appreciate what or who has shaped you and all the ways in which you were encouraged to flourish, to become the person that you are today.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maupin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armistead maupin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "mass.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "provincetown", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T08:25:27.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e526366a0dcf904e0a2cb312d2518c3fa38c1cb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4IlEFKWN1k2QEoafxO.rOlwWJsDl772uxbMNP6VOergRwETZjybaq6D6FvxTO_eVRYy3dvyFHMxVyiAoh99gsjD", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Seeking Redemption: The Rage of Alzheimer\u2019s", "title_full": "Seeking Redemption: The Rage of Alzheimer\u2019s", "published": "2017-10-05T00:06:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/alzheimers.jpg?itok=IXFZsdLD", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e526366a0dcf904e0a2cb312d2518c3fa38c1cb0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4IlEFKWN1k2QEoafxO.rOlwWJsDl772uxbMNP6VOergRwETZjybaq6D6FvxTO_eVRYy3dvyFHMxVyiAoh99gsjD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "gobrien", "published": "2017-10-05T00:06:00.000+03:00", "title": "Seeking Redemption: The Rage of Alzheimer\u2019s", "text": "\u2014Dylan Thomas Source: Greg O'Brien \nI rage today against the dying light. The iconic Welsh poet, Dylan Marlais Thomas, with his forceful lyricism and assailing passion, lit a flame in me years ago about the struggle to survive. Alzheimer\u2019s is a dry wick. The spark of the disease that took many of my family members has now ignited me. \nSo it is with Alzheimer\u2019s: The light ignites, then it fades. \nLight is slowly starting to fade now in the wake of the fall equinox when the sun shines directly above the equator, and hours of day and night are almost equal, as the sun crosses the celestial equator, an imagined line above the Earth\u2019s midriff, as it inches toward the shortest day of the year. \nWhile much has been written about the \u201cLongest Day,\u201d June\u2019s summer solstice, which has become a metaphor for Alzheimer\u2019s, for many in this disease, the winter solstice is a far more powerful allegory for dementia . The darkness can be numbing; isolation warps the mind. \nIn months to come, the tilt of the Earth 23.5 degrees from the sun will summon the solstice when the sun is lowest in the sky, reflecting a scant nine hours and 32 minutes of daylight, a time of inner reflection for all of us. \nThe darkness can also be a time of greater confusion, anger , and explosive rage in this journey as \u201csundowning\u201d takes over, a neurological phenomenon of Alzheimer\u2019s. I call it the \u201clight switch\u201d effect in the brain : the light is on, the light is off, the light flickers, then goes dark again. This also occurs often when neurons are not connecting properly, and those of us in the disease lash out unexpectedly, often far outside the traits of our personalities\u2014cursing, screaming, hurling insults, even throwing objects without warning, like cellphones, utensils, shoes, and other things, as I have more and more. The rage fuels paranoia like a rocket booster. Those of us on this journey, are not stupid, callous, uncaring, or intentionally unhinged; we just have a disease we can\u2019t control. Such behavior can be initiated by loud, throbbing noises, penetrating confusion, excruciating stress , primal fear, cerebral numbness, paranoia, or all of the above. \nI don\u2019t worry, at this point, that I would hurt anyone; yet I worry that I might hurt myself in moments of overpowering anger, as I\u2019ve been tempted to do in the past. There is a medical term for uncontrollable rage and cursing; it\u2019s called Coprolalia, the involuntary and repetitive use of obscene language, as a symptom of organic brain disease or mental illness. \nTo the observing family, the caregivers, and close friends, the rage of Alzheimer\u2019s, can be chilling, even over the simplest of things. \nThere was a time recently when I had misplaced my cell phone a score of times on a particular day. Regrettably, I started yelling, no screaming, at my loving 28-year-old son Conor; not sure why, but I just wanted to strike out. Conor instinctively understood that the rage was over memory loss, and suggested that I check the Jeep, that doctors now don\u2019t allow me to drive anymore, to see if my cell phone had fallen between the seats. I then raced outside while Conor called my phone. I could hear the cell phone ringing in the Jeep, the usual iPhone ring, but I could not in my disease discern where the sound was coming from. My brain could not pinpoint the source of the noise; the ringing appeared randomly throughout the car\u2014on the floor, in the front seat, in the back seat, then in the storage compartment. It was a cacophony of disconnected sounds. \nLike a blind man, I began checking the floor of the car for phone vibrations. Finally, I found my lost phone; I felt the shuddering. You would think I\u2019d be pleased. Yet I was in a gut rage about losing my phone so many times that I needed to destroy something, or I would hurt myself. So I grabbed a coffee cup on the floor of the car, a souvenir of a memorable weekend trip to Manhattan with my daughter Colleen. It had become my favorite. In rank anger, I hurled the cup against a nearby stone wall, a perfect strike against granite, a left-handed fastball, though I\u2019m right-handed. Rage can up your game. The cup exploded upon collision. Hearing the rage, my wife bolted out of the house, as I looked up to the sky, fist raised, and spewed expletives: \u201cIf you want me, Alzheimer\u2019s, you can (expletive) take me now,\u201d I yelled. Then I stormed passed my wife, no eye contact, back into the house, slamming the door behind her. Seconds later, I realized what had just happened; the light was back on in the brain. I opened the door. My wife stood there in tears, reached out her arms, and hugged me, saying, \u201cI know it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s the disease!\u201d \nSometimes in Alzheimer\u2019s, rage translates to a loss of a filter. Close friends have suggested now that I\u2019m drinking from Larry David\u2019s cup. David is a paradigm for loss of filter; yet the Emmy-winning comedian, actor, playwright, producer, and the genius behind Seinfeld and HBO\u2019s Curb Your Enthusiasm is refreshing and invigorating in his brusqueness. He says what we all want to say, but often can\u2019t, until the prefrontal cortex goes awry. The prefrontal cortex, doctors say, is the section of the brain that filters, and mostly keeping at bay inappropriate thoughts, comments, or actions. \nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania have proven that inhibiting this filter can boost unfiltered, creative thinking. While the creative genius in David can turn the switch on and off, many of us in Alzheimer\u2019s play the role daily without premeditation or a script, a common manifestation\u2014often blunt, rude, and crude in our language and advances, discarding social norms. Words, images, and actions that otherwise would be caught in the prefrontal cortex flow freely in the sewer of this disease. Many think of Alzheimer\u2019s as just a loss of cognitive abilities, poor judgment, short-term memory loss, depression , disorientation, rage, and delusions at times. The \u201cfilter thing,\u201d as we call it our family, the personality shift, caused by changes in the brain, now has climbed into the front seat, grabbing for the wheel. \nNot long after, neurons in my head misfired again; this time in public at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport on a trip to Los Angeles with my wife\u2014blanks in the brain due mostly to the shrill noise and seizing confusion of the terminal. I wasn\u2019t acting \u201cfirst classy,\u201d in the moment, and was suffering from the isolation of feeling somewhat useless (as I now often do). Yet there was a time when airlines actually offered customer service: you go to the counter, flash a license, drop off a bag, and then head to the gate, maybe with some extra time for coffee and a bagel. \nNo longer. \nThe ticket counters now are flush with kiosks that look like the George Lucas robot R2-D2 in Star Wars. Out of body, overwhelmed, I felt like I needed the nuclear code just to get a boarding pass. Hey, I used to be the guy \u2013 you know, the guy, the husband, the father, the guy who fixed things. I wanted to be the guy! Now I was reduced to an agitated state of disarray, no longer the star quarterback of the family. That position now fell to my wife, Mary Catherine. I was benched. \n\u201cIt\u2019s broken,\u201d I yelled, the only thing I could think of, saying, as my wife fidgeted with R2-D2 to get the boarding pass and bag tags. But that train, to mix a metaphor, has left the station. \n\u201cSee, it\u2019s broken,\u201d I yelled again, as the brain cells continued to short-circuit. \nAt airports now, one is supposed to have their quiet voice. I was raising my voice like a wave about to crash on the shoreline. \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d Mary Catherine shot back, clearly stressed that I was in a launch countdown, as she tried frantically to engage R2-D2. \n\u201cThe damn thing is broken!\u201d I replied in a voice that was attracting the attention of other travelers, airline representatives, and nearby TSA. \nWithin seconds, a stern, stout woman approached me. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d she quipped, attempting to back me down. \nDon\u2019t go there, I thought! \n\u201cIt\u2019s broken. The damn thing is just broken.\u201d \n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d \n\u201cYes, it is\u2026\u201d \nStretching the definition of polite, the woman bumped my wife over to the right and worked the robot, her fingers hitting keystrokes like a master pianist. \nInstantly, R2-D2 spit out boarding passes and bag tags. \nWith an air of smugness, she handed the bag tags to me. \nIn full gait confusion, I replied in a booming voice, \u201cWhat the hell am I supposed to do with this?\u201d \n\u201cYou put them on your bags,\u201d the woman said in a voice that drew out that second word with the greatest of sarcasm. \nChallenged and not to be outdone, I stepped toward the woman, looked her directly in her eyes, violating the private zone space, and said with annunciation: \n\u201cWell, am I supposed to fly the f-", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T08:25:27.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5ae7a596f20cf53cb6b7fd88e50e5294b1a6a0cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JP2L4.8W_OeaB44r8IqXQqRksPt_l2dIjJbTI1K6UyZUrlnVIG3vDElkYyYtSpqiEvAYxurv4zBw--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Why You Need a CyberBuddy", "title_full": "Why You Need a CyberBuddy", "published": "2017-10-04T23:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/hands-2802891_960_720.jpg?itok=mPtp71TD", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5ae7a596f20cf53cb6b7fd88e50e5294b1a6a0cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JP2L4.8W_OeaB44r8IqXQqRksPt_l2dIjJbTI1K6UyZUrlnVIG3vDElkYyYtSpqiEvAYxurv4zBw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dley", "published": "2017-10-04T23:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why You Need a CyberBuddy", "text": "Why You Need a CyberBuddy Finding safety online involves overcoming isolation. Posted Oct 04, 2017 MORE Source: Pixabay \nWhen we send elementary-age kids on field trips, we assign them a \u201cbuddy.\u201d We tell kids to stay with their buddy all day. We tell them to not even go to the bathroom without their buddy, mostly because we are afraid the child might be snatched from the bathroom, by a sexual offender, even though we know (and ignore) the fact that over 90 percent of sexual abuse happens at home. \nBut, we send kids online alone. \nWhile the Internet and modern technology such as smartphones and social media have overcome tremendous social barriers and led to the creation of countless online communities of like-minded people, it can also be incredibly isolating. When we foray out into the wilds of the Internet, pursuing our unique interests, we can quickly end up in far corners of the electronic world, in \u201cneighborhoods\u201d unknown to our family, friends, and loved ones. We might be exploring issues related to our personal interests in all sorts of things, ranging from politics to sex , to guns, to comic books. As we follow the threads of these connections, we can go down rabbit holes where other people share our interests but have their own personal demons of obsession, anger and a desire to lash out. \nWhen anyone, whether child or adult, finds themselves under attack online, we feel terribly alone. Many of us now have the experience of watching a mild disagreement or misunderstanding online, spiral into a storm of fury and rage. Before we know it, we are receiving death threats, raging emails, and wild accusations. The typical response is to initially try to apologize for the misunderstanding, try to reason or rationalize our way through what seems to be a simple miscommunication. But, we often find that we\u2019ve inadvertently poked a hornet\u2019s nest, and an army of stinging attacks comes boiling out. Source: Pixabay \nOnline, people don\u2019t seem driven to follow the same rules of polite engagement, de-escalation, or conflict avoidance that we employ in physical or verbal interactions. Behind that seeming anonymity and distance online, there\u2019s lots of room for people to escalate quickly to behaviors they wouldn\u2019t consider, with a person they were face to face with. The online world favors, reinforces, and incentivizes (through attention, likes and response) strong, vitriolic, and extremist reactions and posts. \nIt is the isolation that best predicts catastrophic consequences, such as suicide , violence or the \u201cextremification\u201d of people into engaging in public acts of devastation, inspired by their online interactions. It is when teens are alone, facing an onslaught of jeering, threatening, verbal assaults and slanders, that they may consider suicide. It\u2019s when young men are online, increasingly isolated from their family and friends in the physical world, that these individuals can follow extremist ideals into acts that harm and inspire terror. Source: Pixabay \nNote: I don\u2019t typically use the term \u201cIn Real Life,\u201d for the simple reason that I believe that we must accept the world of online interactions as just as \u201creal\u201d as our face to face ones. When we perceive those online experiences as less real, or less substantial or valid, we increase the resistance in people to seek help for them. It\u2019s easy to end up with the thoughts that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be this bothered by these conflicts or threats, it\u2019s \u2018just\u2019 online and not real,\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t really get help for this, because people will think I\u2019m ridiculous for needing help with people sending me angry messages.\u201d \nAs a clinician, a citizen of the online world, and as a father, I\u2019ve been watching this frightening trend grow. There were three examples I witnessed and experienced, which have informed my thinking: \nIn 2016, the recent remake of Ghostbusters was released. African American actress Leslie Jones was horrifically savaged and attacked by racist, misogynist trolls online, who pursued her aggressively on Twitter and social media. Leslie Jones fought back. And, in a fascinating interview on NPR, people discussed the ways that other people, normal citizens of the online world, stepped up to defend Jones, saying that it simply wasn\u2019t right, what people were doing. \nI\u2019m Facebook friends with teenage family members, and I once noticed an interesting event, where one posted a comment that one of her friends misunderstand, and overreacted to in an attacking manner. But, another adult, a mutual friend, noticed the exchange and stepped in quickly with a comment that shut down the escalating exchange and made clear that attacks and threats weren\u2019t tolerated. Source: David Ley \nEarlier this year, I experienced social media attacks related to an interview I conducted of Laci Green, Youtube star sex educator. Laci is questioning and challenging some of the politics and social values she\u2019s supported and is now being excluded, attacked, and isolated by people who were once her allies. When I conducted an interview of Laci about the experience, for my #NoMoreSexShame video series, I was attacked for giving her a platform, and immediately labeled a racist, transphobic, and sexist; merely for interviewing her. It was only because of the many friends who reached out to me, sharing their own experiences of such attacks, and offering emotional support, that I weathered that frightening flurry of hatred and accusations. \nSo, I now recommend that patients, children, and basically everyone, needs a \u201cCyberBuddy.\u201d What\u2019s a CyberBuddy? It\u2019s a person who you can reach out to when you\u2019re afraid or feeling online alone. It\u2019s a person who is on the same media platforms as you, who shares some of your values and beliefs. Who can stand up for you, or with you, and make sure you\u2019re not alone and isolated. It\u2019s a person who can offer you advice on how to respond, how to manage, how to step away safely. A CyberBuddy is a person who can complain with you and for you, to the site administrators or the media monitors, who enforce policies on Twitter and Facebook. It\u2019s a person who can tell you when it\u2019s time to contact authorities, whether it\u2019s law enforcement or school officials. A CyberBuddy is a person who helps you when you feel alone and under attack. \nFor kids, I tell them and the parents that often, parents don\u2019t make good CyberBuddies for their kids, just because it can feel too invasive of the teen\u2019s privacy. But, I do tell parents that their best way to protect their child from online problems is NOT to monitor or check on them, but to create an ongoing, open-door conversation around the online world so that when the kid experiences problems, they can ask their parent for help. Source: Pixabay \nA grown-up CyberBuddy is important too. Look at your online relationships and friends. Who are the people you interact with, across various platforms? Who seems level-headed, kind, and share your values? Across own history of online conflicts, who were the people who helped? Would they be interested in developing an informal \u201cmutual protection\u201d relationship? Do you feel comfortable with them knowing some things about you, that you like to keep private from people in your physical life? This last is important, because it\u2019s often those secrets, and those private interests, that keep us silent and alone. \nThere is increasing dialogue and attention towards making the online world a safer place. Twitter and Facebook are reforming their policies and approaches to harassment, bullying , threats, and abuse. The risks and dangers in the \u201cdark web,\u201d that secret, encrypted electronic underbelly world, are gaining increased attention. All of these changes are important. But, we have to do our part, to protect ourselves. One of the first and most important steps we can make is to decrease the chances that we, and the people we care about, will be alone and hurting in the online world. When we start talking about these problems, these pains, and these challenges, and we start identifying the need to be strong together, we open doors that can prevent future tragedies.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leslie jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david ley  earlier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laci green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laci", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pixabay  online", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T08:25:28.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f5f9986fd7298db3820b5d1ec970a2fb0637dc3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4IjenMVIrl1OZrrVvr9xTKkfKzPUObBKcXHvMVMrXzsfid7mhn7AGq_mRlHciN3QdFetVrZhepX4ps8vEeW8HrdfUx6svD5.mNnPGAlmL8kXjX7yTNurT9o", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "9 Time Honored Tips for Taming Unruly Bosses", "title_full": "9 Time Honored Tips for Taming Unruly Bosses", "published": "2017-10-05T08:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/great_parents_managers_pic.jpg?itok=EnEafiMq", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5f9986fd7298db3820b5d1ec970a2fb0637dc3b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4IjenMVIrl1OZrrVvr9xTKkfKzPUObBKcXHvMVMrXzsfid7mhn7AGq_mRlHciN3QdFetVrZhepX4ps8vEeW8HrdfUx6svD5.mNnPGAlmL8kXjX7yTNurT9o", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ltaylor", "published": "2017-10-05T08:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "9 Time Honored Tips for Taming Unruly Bosses", "text": "9 Time Honored Tips for Taming Unruly Bosses When Good Parenting Skills Help at Work Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \n\u201cNooo! That\u2019s not how I like it\u2026you did it wrong!\u201d \u201cBut you said you wanted\u2026\u201d Anyone who\u2019s been around young children will recognize that battle. Unfortunately, so do many workers struggling with super-sized infants or tots running amok at work, a.k.a. bad bosses. \nWhen we think of analogies between family and workplace dynamics, it\u2019s usually the boss who\u2019s the authority figure. But enter the Terrible Office Tyrant (TOT) and suddenly it\u2019s the subordinate that must assume the leadership role; the one who manages up (without letting on, of course). I also refer to this as \" parenting up without patronizing.\" Source: Lynn Taylor Consulting \nWhether you\u2019re a parent or have simply witnessed one in action, you know that there are discipline approaches that work; and those that don\u2019t. And since TOTs often resemble their much younger namesakes behaviorally \u2013 it\u2019s not so surprising that those same practices work when managing a difficult boss \u2013 or coworker. \nParents inherently know that if they allow their kids to get away with bad behavior once, the actions will soon be repeated. The outcome is not quite as forgiving when you let things slide with a manager. If a boss exhibits ongoing poor behavior, such as belittling you or being territorial , it can mean prolonged periods of distress. \nHere are some time-honored parental strategies that can help anyone manage up effectively: \nStay calm . Don\u2019t get caught up in your manager\u2019s dramatic behavior, or things will escalate. If your boss is on the floor throwing a tantrum \u2013 okay, maybe not literally \u2013 what should you do? Now is the time to stay even-keeled, the way skilled parents instinctively do during a child\u2019s meltdown. \nAnticipate problems . Children like routine; they want to know what to expect and when, and the same is true with managers. If you have a fickle boss, set up a process for your projects, and give micro-managers plenty of updates. Give advance notice, e.g., a reminder email that you must leave early Thursday, so you\u2019re not inundated with work two minutes before you depart. \nUse levity to your advantage . Humor diffuses tension with kids and managers, alike. Maybe your boss is about to lose it over problems with that buggy new app your team is using. You might be able to \u201cjam the system\u201d by saying something like, \u201cI think my first car in high school was more reliable than that app. And I was usually stranded waiting for a tow truck.\" Use clever humor that is apropos to the situation. You don\u2019t have to become a standup comedian to put people at ease; just be yourself. \nGive choices . Avoid asking \"yes\" or \"no\" questions. People of all ages like to be given choices and that\u2019s particularly true with a controlling boss. Rather than saying, \u201cAre you okay with holding Maria\u2019s retirement party at The Grill?\u201d try: \u201cWould you rather hold Maria\u2019s retirement party at The Grill, or the XYZ hotel banquet room?\" \nOffer praise . Who doesn\u2019t want to be told they\u2019re great? Just think of that beaming child who\u2019s earned a sticker for good behavior. If your boss takes the time to thoroughly explain a project to you rather than avoiding you at all costs, reinforce it: \u201cThanks for preparing me for that discussion yesterday. Your advice really made a difference in closing the deal.\u201d Countering negativity goes a long way with everyone in the workplace. \nModel good behavior . Manage up by example. Take an honest look at your own behavior to ensure you\u2019re not a TOT. If coworkers race for the exit doors the second they see you\u2019re stressed out, take note. You can\u2019t expect your boss to be calm, cool and collected if you\u2019re not. \nKeep it brief . Young kids have the attention span of\u2026 slightly longer than flies. Same for a significant number of managers. Let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re busy. But many are easily distracted, too. B.A.D.D. (Boss Attention Deficit Disorder) just seems to go with the territory. When sharing information, get to the point: quickly and clearly. \nGive the full picture . In the same way telling a child, \u201cWe may not be able to go to the park today\u201d without offering the full story can lead to a tailspin - so can telling a boss, \u201cWe may not meet our financial projections.\u201d When you need to share important information, make sure you can provide context and rationale. \nSet boundaries . Know what you\u2019re willing to tolerate - and when behavior requires stronger corrective action. For example, if faced with a chronic bully , you may need join forces with other employees and approach senior management or human resources. If the behavior is untenable or all else fails, it may be time to seek greener pastures . \nThe next time your boss appears ready to morph into a languid, lifeless lump on the carpet in defiance \u2013 resist the temptation to yell, \u201cTime Out!\u201d Instead, use the many other proven, parental management tools at your disposal.

Posted Oct 05, 2017 Source: eKBS at DeviantArt, Creative Commons \n\u201cI have stage 3 cancer; my friend has stage 1\u2014which is like a pimple.\u201d \nOn her personal blog, Debbie Woodbury, a woman diagnosed with stage 0 cancer, references this comment by a fellow cancer patient. While she considers the comment hurtful, she is not particularly surprised. \nCancer prognoses vary, and there is a large variation in survival between types and degrees of illness. Some are fortunate to survive without the sickening effects of chemotherapy, the fear of losing hair, or surgeries that leave patients bedridden for weeks. But people may also minimize their cancer journey, or are made to view their experiences as \u2018lesser'. \nWoodbury explains: \n\u201cWithout a tumor and with a stage 0 cancer diagnosis, I started this journey not even sure I was qualified to call myself a cancer patient.\u201d \nSimilarly, Lesley Miller writes of her husband: \n\u201cI bought him a bold yellow shirt that said \u2018survivor\u2019 across the front. \u2018Survivor,\u2019 in his mind, is nothing to tell the world about. He didn\u2019t do anything to claim survivor status; his body just had a treatable cancer that happened to respond to drugs .\u201d \nJust like that, degrees of illness become a competition , belittle personal struggles, and create segregation among patients and those in remission. \nIn January 2015, cancer survivor Cindy Finch posted an article in the Huffington Post entitled \u201cThe 6 Injustices of Cancer.\u201d The article received a great deal of backlash for suggesting that certain cancer patients \u201cget off really easy.\u201d She claimed: \n\u201cI\u2019ve heard it a hundred times, \u2018I\u2019m a cancer survivor, too.\u2019 \u2018Oh, really? What type of cancer did you have and what was your treatment?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I had thyroid cancer and had to take a radioactive pill for 30 days. Then I was all better.\u2019\u201d \nFinch talks about individuals with \u2018worse\u2019 diagnoses: \n\u201cThese folks represent the worst among us. If you\u2019re not one of these folks, perhaps you should be quiet and sit down, and let someone else tell their war story.\u201d \nAs if some cancer patients just aren\u2019t macho enough. Attitudes like these have negative consequences on patient mental health . \nCancer patients often report feelings of guilt for surviving the illness. Survivor guilt is common among people who have gone through traumatic experiences, such as war, accidents, natural disasters, and interpersonal abuse . For Woodbury, not suffering enough throughout her cancer experience elicited guilt feelings. \nSome individuals also consider themselves less deserving. Ann Silberman, a breast cancer survivor, writes on her personal blog: \n\u201cIt was my belief that others deserved to live more than I did. Better people than me are now gone; people who were funnier, who were kinder, who had more to give.\u201d \nAnd then, of course, there are expectations people have of cancer patients: The image of the strong, inspirational individual, filled with gratitude for a second chance at life. \nSilberman continues: \n\u201cI am still trudging along, bitching about how cold I am and slamming pain meds for my aches and pains.\u201d \nAccording to Crystal Park and colleagues at the University of Connecticut at Storrs, living through cancer results in the development of new identities that can define people for the rest of their lives. For those still in active treatment, the identity of patient or victim can develop, carrying the connotation of severe suffering inflicted on them. But for those who have survived such adversity, the most common identity was survivor, which carries the connotation of cure. \nAs cancer becomes an ingrained aspect of an individual\u2019s identity, it may be natural for those who suffered greatly to take pride in how much they overcame, indeed to try to silence others who have not experienced the same level of adversity. \nBut Woodbury takes umbrage at this view, noting: \n\u201cThe truth is that cancer is not a competition and, just as I am enough, so is my cancer. I certainly did go through less than someone else might have gone through. Thank God for that. For that, I should be grateful, not made to feel, by myself or anyone else, that I am guilty of not suffering enough to qualify in the cancer games.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T16:31:08.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d3f6b999a424c16ef185260a69934ca9faadbd75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4J7bHWS6HU0Z_Rd5jgyUWK5oVyF9NLSSoY9__xH3AGzXrjA8kq0Nf3JSG57Gg.NRBEd1cAmKP2EJHqHXuPIlQ_K", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "More Boys Admit to Cyberbullying Than Girls", "title_full": "More Boys Admit to Cyberbullying Than Girls", "published": "2017-10-05T15:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/pixabayboysoncell.jpg?itok=jsxWZKev", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d3f6b999a424c16ef185260a69934ca9faadbd75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4J7bHWS6HU0Z_Rd5jgyUWK5oVyF9NLSSoY9__xH3AGzXrjA8kq0Nf3JSG57Gg.NRBEd1cAmKP2EJHqHXuPIlQ_K", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sscheff", "published": "2017-10-05T15:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "More Boys Admit to Cyberbullying Than Girls", "text": "More Boys Admit to Cyberbullying than Girls New study: How empathic teens are curbing cyberbullying and the gender factor. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE Source: Pixabay \nBullying has been amplified with technology. Teens today are digitally connected with their peers nearly 24 hours a day. If a cruel comment or mean meme is posted about them, the emotional pain is magnified by a million as they feel the whole world is reading it. Most will continuously check-in to count the likes and continue reading vicious comments. \nResearch from the think tank Demos found that boys are significantly more likely to have bullied someone online than girls, but young people with \u201c stronger traits of empathy and self-control \u201d are less likely to cyberbully. \nDemos surveyed 16- to 18-year-olds over Facebook on their online behavior and responses to various social media scenarios. \nThe survey reported a \u201c shockingly high incidence of hostile behavior to peers ,\u201d with 26 percent of those surveyed admitting to having \u201c bullied or insulted someone else \u201d online. \nFifteen percent of the teens surveyed said they \"joined in with other people to 'troll' a celebrity or public figure.\" The gender factor \nDemos found that boys are significantly more likely to say they have bullied or insulted someone online than girls, with 32 percent of boys saying they have, compared to 22 percent of girls. \nInterestingly, the same applies for trolling a public figure, which 22 percent of boys but 10 percent of girls admitted they had done. Monkey see, monkey do \nThe Demos' focus groups found that the teens were drawn into cyberbullying situations by witnessing their friends being bullied or insulted online and felt compelled to respond aggressively. \nSadly , 93 percent of those who said they had insulted or bullied someone else online said that they had themselves experienced some form of cyberbullying or abuse . The positive side \nThe majority, 88 percent of teenagers surveyed said they had given emotional support to a friend on social networking sites. \nYoung people rely on friends more than adults, according to studies , when they are being harassed online. \nThis is where parents need to do a better job at connecting offline with their teenager about their online life. Many teen's fear that their parent will take away their digital device or possibly judge or blame them for their online issues. With open lines of communication you can constantly remind them that no matter what, you are always there for them. Understanding that the cyber-world can be a difficult one at times. After all, not everyone is who they pretend to be online. Dealing with cyberbullying \nSocial media savvy police office, Mike Bires frequently speaks with parents and schools about online safety and reporting cyberbullying including sextortion. \nOfficer Bires reminds parents : Be empathetic, honest, and transparent. Discuss the incident with school administrators (if applicable). Preserve the evidence. Do not delete any communication with the offender. Report the incident to law enforcement. Seek professional counseling for both you and your child to manage the incident. \nOfficer Bires's advice for youth: Do not engage, however difficult it may be. When you participate, the bully\u2019s desired reaction will not occur, and the bully will end up looking worse among his peers. The bully will find that those he thought would support his actions will turn away from him. Speak positively online and never show your frustration or anger . It\u2019s easier said than done, but do your best. Block, restrict, or limit the offender\u2019s access to your conversations. For example, on Facebook, you can block users in your settings area. Many platforms allow you to block people to eliminate them from engaging with you on social media. Reach out to your parents or a trusted, responsible adult. Seek their assistance in dealing with the issues. There is nothing wrong with getting help from others who might have experienced similar situations. Report the offenders to the social media platform where they are committing their acts. Those platforms have conduct rules established for users of their platform, and they will take action if necessary to alleviate a person\u2019s frustration with using their platform. If it persists, seek the assistance of law enforcement.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T16:31:09.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "32211da931cdb68f719abbd78d5f987aa9b88942", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KLg.Q1vvxBqaVB3WWGqZcg9Z0Sy8qfclP4oW3fJ6DPfTMBHV9ST1KvItUjmLKhc2YeulqA.UgL6LsdPd1OyOiPJnuzci2M1CFUcIrMd4fClSIsBhqOWt8o", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "How Can You Tell If You're Okay?

And Why it Matters Creating harmony and contentment in your life Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nReaders of my column over the last few years will know that I am very keen on feeling okay. This concept was first introduced to the public by Thomas Harris in 1969 and most therapies are now based on getting to an okay place \u2013 not a perfect place and certainly not someone else\u2019s view of what\u2019s okay but somewhere you\u2019re comfortable and is good enough for you. \nFeeling okay about what exactly? About yourself, primarily and then feeling content with most aspects of your life. Are you physically and mentally in good shape? Do you feel comfortable with where you are in life? What are your relationships like, both professionally, socially and personally? Do you have the ability to observe yourself and others compassionately, with humour and kindness? \nThese are very important questions and I suggest that if you \u201cdon\u2019t know\u201d then the likelihood is that you are not feeling okay in relation to some aspects of your life. Signs to be aware of are that you are irritable or short tempered, judgemental or feeling judged, righteous, angry, sad, sick at heart or unwell for long periods with no discernible cause. Headaches, stomach aches, fatigue, insomnia , rashes and crankiness are all signs that something is definitely not okay. Add to the list being cynical or disengaged, fed up or bored, pugnacious or discontent or just plain sad and weary. Any or all of these are red flags and you need to do something about it. \nThe first thing you can do which will take care of 50% of the symptoms is to exercise. Exercise regulates mood and appetite , it regulates sleeping and wards off depression . Information released in the last few weeks by The American Journal of Psychiatry who has just finished an 11 year study of 22,000 Norwegians, concluded that people who did not exercise were 44% more likely to become depressed than those who did exercise for as little as 1-2 hours a week. So get moving. It costs nothing and you could save money by either walking to work/school/college/the shops and by doing your own housework and, if you have one, gardening. This is the most important intervention to make time for; any and all activities will improve your mood. \nBe kind to yourself and others. Be compassionate; life is hard enough for many folks without being judgemental or blaming. When things go wrong, see this as an opportunity to learn. How could you/or others have done things differently \u2013 what worked? What didn\u2019t? If you are one of life\u2019s perfectionists , please, give it up! It\u2019s exhausting being a perfectionist and holding yourself and others to account and, additionally, you will find that most people don\u2019t like you \u2013 that\u2019s seriously good grounds for not feeling okay. Fine to have high standards but realise that these are not always necessary and that not everyone will share your view of their importance. In the word of Elsa \u201cLet it go!\u201d \nIf you think most people are doing better than you, are liked more than you and have an easier life than you, then you, too, will feel not okay whilst feeling that others are okay. Action is the only cure. What can you do about your situation? One simple step is \u201clearned optimism \u201d. Martin Seligman studied the differences between people who were fatalistic and people who were active in their own lives and the only difference was one of attitude. The people who felt they could impact their situation, however small, were optimistic realists who saw the best in most people and most situations based on the information to hand. They very rarely used words such as \u201calways\u201d or \u201cnever\u201d when describing their situation. They didn\u2019t say they were \u201conly\u201d mothers, janitors, lawyers, policemen, taxi drivers, doctors etc., they were proud of what they did and took action when things went wrong. \nYou can adopt this attitude for yourself and there\u2019s a pretty big chance that things will improve and by taking action, too, you will empowered. So if you have always wanted to be a chef, find out what qualifications you need and start getting them. If someone is bothering you or bullying you, find support and confront this person. Focus on people you admire who are doing well and start copying their behaviour. I finished my psychology degree at 40 \u2013 it took me 6 years and I was working and bringing up two children by myself. I\u2019m not saying it was easy but it was certainly worthwhile and it\u2019s totally the reason why you are reading this now! \nIt\u2019s not okay not to feel okay! Humans are designed with a great capacity for joy and contentment and most of these feelings are not based on jobs, status and possessions but on good relationships \u2013 firstly with yourself. So be kind to yourself, treat yourself like a beloved child, relation or pet. Do what\u2019s in your best interests, what you know is right for you and what feels good and brings contentment. Secondly be kind and involved with others. You may need very little company and be a natural introvert or conversely be very gregarious. However you are, any positive interaction on your terms is good for you. We know that isolated humans die much earlier than those who are socially connected. Smile, say hello, take an interest in others, suspend judgement and in treating others as okay you will come to feel okay yourself and your capacity to enjoy life will expand and blossom.

Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE Source: used with permission from commons.wikimedia \nMuch has been written and discussed of late regarding the mental health status of President Trump . And controversy exists regarding whether or not mental health professionals should even comment on any speculated diagnoses for Mr. Trump citing the Goldwater Rule (established by the American Psychiatric Association in the 1970\u2019s stating that mental health professional should refrain from offering any speculated diagnoses about people, especially public figures, without personally evaluating them). Yet, in recent months, some leading mental health professionals have argued that the duty to warn provision (excuse the pun) \"trumps\" the Goldwater Rule. In essence, they argue that since the stakes are so high for serious damage to others the need to comment on Mr. Trump\u2019s psychological and behavioral functioning and mental health overrides the long tradition of the Goldwater Rule. \nNow comes a newly released book (i.e., The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump ) co-authored by 27 experts that reflects upon Mr. Trump\u2019s psychiatric status, diagnoses, and mental health functioning. This book is certainly unprecedented in modern psychiatric times. The promotional material for the book is a bit misleading in that it reports that 27 mental health professional experts have signed on as co-authors of the project yet many co-authors are not mental health professionals at all. For example, Professor Noam Chomsky is a leading and famous public intellectual, but he is a professor of linguistics and not a psychiatrist or psychologist. Gail Sheehy is a well-known author and journalist but is also not a mental health professional. And Professor Phil Zimbardo is a well-known psychologist, but he is a social psychologist and not a clinical or counseling psychologist and thus not trained to engage in psychological diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment. \nIn a nutshell, the book suggests that Mr. Trump is a very disturbed, psychiatrically highly compromised, and a very dangerous individual who suffers from severe and diagnostic personality dysfunction. While the book clearly violates the long-standing and generally accepted Goldwater Rule, the authors convincingly argue that the duty to warn the public of their concern is more important. \nCuriously, another very recent book (i.e., Twilight of American Sanity ) was published by a well-known Duke University psychiatrist, Professor Allen Frances , who was the lead author on parts of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM often referred to as \"the psychiatric bible\") that features the very diagnoses that the new Dangerous Case book highlights. Dr. Frances reports that focusing on the psychiatric diagnosis of Mr. Trump is unhelpful and perhaps irrelevant. He suggests that Mr. Trump is, frankly, just a bad human being with or without a psychiatric diagnosis or mental illness. He suggests that focusing on the psychiatric issues and diagnosis of Mr. Trump is a red herring that does an injustice to those who suffer from mental health issues who often function well without danger to anyone. In a nutshell, Professor Frances argues that Mr. Trump is essentially not sick, but rather a jerk. \nRegardless of one\u2019s political or psychiatric perspective, these are unprecedented times, and we seem to be going through completely unchartered waters. The mental health, psychological, and psychiatric communities may offer a wide variety of skills to assist in better understanding these challenging times and in better understanding the behavior of the primary leaders impacting where we might be going. Perhaps they, as well as others with appropriate skills, can help us figure out how best to cope and respond to our current and future challenges. And maybe if we all utilize our skills and talents to help make a better world for everyone with the common good in mind we'd be much better off anyway. Remaining silent, keeping our talents and contributions under wraps, seems to be not an appropriate or even ethical option. In this way, both of these new books completely agree. \nWhat do you think?

In an op-ed shortly after President Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012, LaPierre explained, \u201cNo wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever.\u201d In the same piece, he described the NRA as \u201cthe indispensable shield against the destruction of our nation\u2019s Second Amendment rights\u201d and \u201cthe only chance gun owners have to withstand the coming siege.\u201d That same year, a week after the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy, LaPierre called for armed security guards in every U.S. school, arguing \u201cthe only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun.\u201d And in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, he listed \u201chome invaders, drug cartels, carjackers, knockout gamers, and rapers, and haters, and campus killers, airport killers, shopping mall killers\u201d among the threats that only assault-style rifles and other guns can stop. \nThe NRA and gun lobby aggressively push these psychologically-potent appeals because they know nothing sells guns like fear \u2014 including the fear of not having a gun. Indeed, in the aftermath of massacres, worries about gun restrictions often lead to sharp increases in handgun purchases. Sure enough, gun stocks rose on Wall Street in the days immediately following the Las Vegas attack. The bottom-line here is simple: easy access to deadly weapons means greater profits for gun manufacturers and dealers. At the same time, let\u2019s remember that our country\u2019s far-too-frequent mass shootings actually account for only a small part of the bloodshed. The number of deaths from gun violence in the U.S. this year \u2014 including homicides and suicides \u2014 is again likely to exceed 30,000. That figure is comparable to the number of Americans who are killed in automobile accidents. \nTo help give their \u201cwe\u2019ll all be helpless\u201d scare tactics the sheen of academic respectability, the gun industry has eagerly turned to the likes of economist John Lott, the high-profile promoter of the widely discredited thesis that more guns lead to less crime. Lott has argued that gun reform \u201cwill leave individuals more vulnerable and helpless\u201d and that \u201cinstead of making places safer, disarming law-abiding citizens leaves them as sitting ducks.\u201d But his claims have collapsed under careful scholarly scrutiny. The prestigious National Research Council dismissed Lott\u2019s findings and his methodology, and researchers at Stanford and Harvard have shown that higher rates of household gun ownership are associated with higher, not lower, homicide rates, both nationally and in state-by-state comparisons. \nOf course, scientific evidence regarding gun violence isn\u2019t popular with many beholden members of Congress. For them, propaganda is just fine. In fact, thanks to NRA lobbying, Congress prohibits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even conducting research related to guns and public health . And let\u2019s not forget who\u2019s in the White House. Benefiting from millions of dollars of support from the NRA during his presidential campaign, self-proclaimed \u201ctrue friend and champion\u201d Donald Trump has opined , \u201cYou take the guns away from the good people, and the bad ones are going to have target practice.\u201d \nMaking matters still worse, the NRA\u2019s messaging machine has been winning over large segments of the public as well. For the first time in decades, recent national polls have shown there\u2019s greater support for \u201cgun rights\u201d than for \u201cgun control.\u201d This support is especially strong among those white Americans who mistakenly believe crime rates are rising. And whereas people used to report that hunting was their primary reason for owning a gun, now they say it\u2019s for personal safety. \nA fearful country is exactly what the NRA and gun industry want. But to protect their turf and profits even more, they also want us to believe there\u2019s yet another terrifying monster under our collective bed: the prospect of a future in which we\u2019re all disarmed and helpless to keep our loved ones safe. How can we resist these fearmongering ploys?

Pain, inflammation, and sleep. MORE Source: 1graphicstock \nWe all want to wake up feeling rested and refreshed with our mind and body ready to dive into the day. Unfortunately, for many people, that\u2019s not how mornings begin. I see patients every day who are frustrated by waking with pain, stiffness, and fatigue. \u201cWhy do I feel so physically uncomfortable when I get out of bed?\u201d is the question I hear again and again. \nThe truth is, there could be a number of sources of soreness, stiffness, and discomfort first thing in the morning. It may involve the sleep equipment you\u2019re using, i.e., your bed and pillow. It also may be related to inflammation , coming from one source or another. \nLet\u2019s take a look at what can cause morning pain and fatigue\u2014and what you can do to improve it. \nCheck In With Your Sleep Gear \nWhen you\u2019re feeling sore, stiff, or in pain upon waking, the first place to look for answers is your sleep equipment\u2014specifically, your mattress and pillow. Remember: Sleep is a performance activity. If you hiked a mountain in shoes that don't fit, you\u2019d probably finish the climb in some pain. The same idea applies to sleep. To do it as well as you can, you need the right equipment, and you need to replace that equipment when it\u2019s worn out. \nOnly you can be the judge of what sort of mattress is comfortable to you. Nevertheless, here are a couple of things to keep in mind when assessing the viability of your mattress: \nYour mattress needs to supply you with both support and comfort . A supportive mattress holds your entire body without sinking at the hips; allows relief and comfort at pressure points, including the knees, hips, shoulders, and head; and lets your muscles relax throughout the body, especially at your back. \nLess expensive mattresses have shorter lives. Mattresses are expensive. They\u2019re also an essential investment in your sleep and health . It\u2019s a good idea to spend as much as you can afford to invest in a high-quality bed. If you went with a less-expensive mattress four or five years ago, it may no longer be able to provide you the support and comfort you need. \nNeeds for support and comfort change as we age. Throughout our lives, our bodies undergo changes that affect what we need from our mattresses. Weight loss and weight gain , changes in fitness levels, pregnancy , and conditions such as back pain or neck pain are all factors that can mean it is time for a new mattress. With age, many people need a supportive mattress that is softer to achieve comfort throughout the night. \nIt\u2019s not just about your mattress, though. Your pillow is also important to your ability to sleep. The right pillow can make the difference between waking sore and stiff and waking relaxed and rested. \nWhat does your pillow do for you? It aligns your cervical spine (that\u2019s the part of the spine that\u2019s in your neck), so there is no bend or muscle tightness in your neck while you sleep. A pillow that is too thick or too thin will put your cervical spine out of alignment. That\u2019s likely to lead to neck pain and upper back pain. \nThe easiest way to tell if a pillow is providing you support is to lie down in your sleeping position and have a friend or partner see if your head and neck are in alignment. A pillow also needs to provide comfort, a subjective measurement that is yours to determine. \nPillows don\u2019t last forever\u2014far from it. I recommend replacing pillows every 18 months to ensure you\u2019re getting the most support and comfort. Memory foam pillows may last longer, up to three years. \nInflammation and sleep problems \nYou\u2019re probably getting used to hearing about inflammation and health issues. There\u2019s good reason for that: Chronic and excessive inflammation is recognized as a cause of illness and disease, diminished physical function, and accelerated aging . As a result of several possible factors, inflammation can be a reason for waking up feeling uncomfortable and unrested. \nWhat is Inflammation? \nInflammation is an important element of the body\u2019s immune system. Inflammation is a response to the body\u2019s perception of illness, injury, disease, and pathogens that might cause harm. Among the most common symptoms of inflammation are swelling, pain, and stiffness. Inflammation is part of the body\u2019s healing process, it\u2019s way of repairing damaged cells and tissues. So, not all inflammation is bad; there is some inflammation that is good and necessary for health. Chronic and systemic inflammation, however, is harmful to health over the long term. Both \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d inflammation can lead to sleep problems. \nLet\u2019s take a look at several factors that can trigger inflammation and may contribute to stiffness, soreness, and pain at the end of a night\u2019s sleep: \nInjury and illness. When sick or injured , the body responds with inflammation. This can lead to pain and discomfort that may interfere with how well you sleep and create physical pain and stiffness upon waking. This is the case if you are fighting off a cold or if you\u2019ve twisted your ankle running around with your kids on the playground. It\u2019s also the case with more serious illnesses and chronic conditions, including arthritis. For many conditions, symptoms tend to be worse at night, which can lead to feeling a lot of discomfort in the morning. What\u2019s more, pain and sleep have a bi-directional relationship: They each influence the other. Poor sleep makes us more sensitive to pain, and the presence of pain makes it harder to sleep. \nWhat you can do: Treating your condition, and managing pain as a part of treatment, can help you sleep better and feel less uncomfortable and tired when you wake. \nAging. Aging appears to be both a result of inflammation and a contributor to it. Systemic, low-grade inflammation becomes more common with age. So do morning stiffness, soreness, pain, and unrefreshing sleep. Levels of C-reactive protein, a key inflammatory marker, tend to rise with age in many people. \nWhat you can do: Take care of yourself, physically and mentally. Manage stress , maintain a healthy weight, and be physically active. Stay on top of your health with regular visits to your physician, including blood work that screens C-reactive protein and other inflammatory markers. \nAutoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakes the body\u2019s own healthy cells for harmful invader cells. The immune system mounts an attack on those healthy cells, and that includes an inflammatory response. We don\u2019t know how many people have autoimmune conditions \u2014the National Institutes of Health estimates 23.5 million, while the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association's estimate is 50 million. The prevalence of autoimmune diseases has been rising in the U.S. and in other Western countries for decades. There are more than 80 autoimmune disorders identified, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and celiac disease. Inflammation, and with it physical pain and poor sleep that can extend through the night to early morning, are common symptoms of these disorders. \nWhat you can do: If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, follow your treatment protocol. If you\u2019re experiencing chronic or unusual fatigue, stiffness, or pain first thing in the morning or at any time of day, see your doctor for a check in\u2014and be sure to talk about your sleep issues while you\u2019re there. \nDiet . The foods we eat can contribute to escalating inflammation \u2014or they can help reduce and control it. Foods that trigger inflammation include ones laden with unhealthful fats and sugar, including fried foods, red and processed meats, refined carbohydrates like white bread, cookies, and cakes, and soda. An anti-inflammatory diet is full of vegetables, fruits, nuts fiber-rich whole grains, and wild-caught fish. The Mediterranean diet is a model for eating to limit inflammation. \nWhat you can do: If you\u2019re experiencing unrefreshing sleep, pain, stiffness, and discomfort in the morning, take a fresh look at your diet. Swap out pro-inflammatory foods for anti-inflammatory ones, and keep your intake of processed foods and sweets to a minimum. \nToo little\u2014or too much\u2014exercise. We still have a lot to learn about the relationship between physical activity and inflammation. Regular exercise appears to limit inflammation , especially as we age. A sedentary lifestyle can result in more pain and stiffness in the morning, and throughout the day. Research shows exercise improves sleep quality across the adult lifetime, as well as reducing some physical pain during sleep and lowering levels of daytime fatigue. \nOvertraining is an increasingly common problem I see among my patients who exercise\u2014a problem that can lead to sleep issues and discomfort. Insomnia is one of the first symptoms of overtraining, according to research. Exercising too much or too intensely can lead to injury, and inflammation and pain that interfere with sleep. Overuse injuries related to exercise become more common with age. Exercise is great for the body, great for health, and great for sleep\u2014but if you work out too hard or too often, you\u2019re likely to feel some negative effects, including sleep and pain in the morning, and during the day. \nWhat you can do: The National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association recommend at least 150 minutes of exercise a week for healthy adults\u2014that\u2019s 30 minutes a day, five days a week. To improve sleep, research suggests a consistent exercise routine has the greatest benefits, especially for people who experience difficulty sleeping. \nDon\u2019t resign yourself to uncomfortable, stiff-limbed mornings of rising from bed feeling tired and sore. Use the right sleep equipment, pay attention to your daily habits and routines, and seek medical help for symptoms that are interfering with your rest.

Regionalizing a time change to reverse seasonal affective disorder. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nSeveral days ago, Boston newspapers reported that Massachusetts is considering staying on Daylight Saving Time permanently. Doing so would move the state into the Atlantic Time Zone. The decision depends on the responses of other New England states, and even New York state. Were this switch to occur, we would be balancing the advantages of a later sunset to the disadvantage of prolonged morning darkness. Delaying the start of the school day so children would not have to travel in the dark is already being discussed if the proposal goes through. However, the benefits of a delayed sunset are compelling, according to one proponent of the plan. Darkness would not arrive by 4 p.m., or even earlier as it does now during the shortest days of the year. People would supposedly engage in after-work activities and possibly bring more business to restaurants, stores, and entertainment venues because of the delayed darkness. \nOne advantage not mentioned in the proposal was eliminating the brief but annoying adjustment everyone has to make when we move the clock an hour backward in the fall and then one hour forward in the spring. This seems to cause national jet lag , and while many people feel sleepy and disoriented for a couple of days, some are plunged into unwelcome periods of anxiety and depression because of the shift in time. Mental health professionals are well aware of the intensification of mood disorders in the weeks following the switch in time. \nLate fall and winter darkness in the northern hemisphere and its opposite in the southern hemisphere are now known to have a well-characterized impact on mood, energy, sociability, sleep , and weight. The most extreme examples come from personal accounts and studies of people living in research stations in Antarctica, when weeks of total darkness can exert a devastating toll on people\u2019s emotional well-being. But one does not have to move to the bottom of the world to experience the deterioration in mood brought about by a significant reduction in light. Studies on seasonal changes in mood among people who move from a lower latitude to a country with a higher one (e.g., from Japan to England), have found a higher rate of depression among those who moved to the seasonally darker country than their compatriots back home. Many in our country who live in the northern tier of states seek out winter vacations or longer seasonal residences in the southern states to bring relief not just from miserable weather, but from miserable moods as well. And when those who made the migration south permanent talk about never \"going back north\" because of the winter cold, they may also recoil against ever again experiencing winter depression. \nBut there are many places in the world in addition to the tips of the globe where daylight is missing entirely for two or three months of the year, and the remedy for the severe seasonal mood changes is not moving the clock ahead or behind, or keeping it the same. One such place is Tromso, Norway, a tiny island similar in size as Manhattan. It is north of the Arctic Circle and has a population of about 70,000. A few years ago, a then-graduate student at Stanford, Kari Leibowitz moved to this very northerly city to study the mental attitudes and moods of a population unable to escape the total darkness of late fall and early winter. Using a test she developed to measure the attitudes of the residents toward winter, the \u201cWintertime Mindset Scale,\u201d she asked the residents about their view of winter . For example, do they disagree or agree with a statement that, \u201cThey enjoy many things about the winter\u2019 or \u2018They find winter months dark and depressing.\u201d This second question would probably have many New Englanders' answering, \u201cYes, I agree,\u201d but not so with the Norwegians. The consensus among the inhabitants was that they found the winter agreeable because it had the right combination of winter outside activities and inside coziness. Despite the severe cold, they claimed that only inadequate clothing, not temperature, caused discomfort. \nIt is possible of course that inhabitants, the ones who still live there, are pre-selected for their happy tolerance of the winter. Those who found the winters intolerably depressing may have moved to southern Italy or Ecuador, and never put on snow boots again. But it could also be that the logistical discomforts of winter: poorly plowed roads, unshoveled sidewalks, clothing not warm enough for outside yet stiflingly warm when inside a store or supermarket, lack of time and money to engage in outside winter sports , high heating bills, and canceled events due to snow emergencies\u2026to name a few New England cultural gripes? These are not problems the people of Tromso experience. \nStaying on daylight saving time may give people an opportunity to engage in outside activities after work, and develop a Tromso mindset toward winter. But it comes with a mental health risk that may not be adequately evaluated by the proponents of this change in time. The increased hour of darkness in the morning resulting from not switching to Standard Time may potentiate symptoms of a winter depression or seasonal affective disorder . In fact, early morning exposure to a light source that mimics sunlight has been a standard therapy for years, and sitting in front of a \u2018sunbox\u2019 for a half an hour or so effectively improves mood within a couple of days. Are we risking the mental health of our residents by moving that hour of light from the morning to the afternoon? Or can we compensate for the lack of morning light by using artificial sunlight in our schools and places of employment? Then we might come close to, \u2018burning the candle at both ends.'

How long after   began shooting did police break into his room? How long after he stopped shooting (presumably because he had killed himself) did the police reach the shooter, Stephen Paddock? \nIt's hard to believe that you'll get the correct answer \u2014 indeed, I doubt that you'll be within an hour of the correct answers ( provided here by the New York Times ). The shooting began at 10:05. The shooting stopped at 10:19 (when presumably Paddock killed himself). A SWAT team broke into Paddock's room at 11:27 The police took 1:22 after the shooting began and 1:08 after it had ended to reach the shooter, long deceased. \nI don't mean to minimize the bravery of police, emergency workers, and plain citizens rescuing people at the site of the shooting. Also, I need to cite the savvy and bravery of a hotel security guard who identified and approached the room from which the shooting was emanating and at whom Paddock fired through his door, wounding the guard. Since Paddock stopped shooting out of his window and killed himself fairly soon afterwards, we could say that this guard \u2014 although he didn't enter and secure the room and restrain Paddock \u2014 WAS responsible for stopping the carnage. \nWHY We Are Deluded \nThere are two answers to this question. The first answer is why we SEEK delusion. Obviously, it is in order to feel secure against the insecurities that confront us \u2014 the police will protect us from random killers! \nNo they won't \u2014 like the Cargo Cults of South Sea Islanders praying to balsa wood constructions to bring back the largesse of the departing American military didn't change actual reality. \nThe second answer involves how we come to these fictions.

Coleman \nMorton Deutsch, eminent psychologist, Columbia University professor, mentor extraordinaire, and one of the founders of the field of conflict resolution, died last March at age 97. In honor of his passing, I have selected a series of ten major scientific contributions that Deutsch made in his efforts to promote a more just, peaceful and sustainable world. 9. Addressing Inequality and Systemic Oppression: How to interrupt the Increasing Gap between the Haves and Have-Nots? \nSomewhat later in his career , Deutsch became particularly concerned about the rapidly increasing gap between the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave-nots\u201d in institutions and societies across the globe. His assessment of scholarship in the area was that it did an excellent job of characterizing the intractability of the phenomenon, but that it offered little utility for interrupting patterns of injustice or sustaining constructive changes when they did occur. \nAs a result, he organized a faculty seminar at Columbia focused on identifying effective strategies for interrupting oppression and sustaining justice. The starting point of the seminar was a discussion of a new paper Deutsch had drafted entitled, \u201cA Framework for Thinking about Oppression and its Change.\u201d The framework outlined his thinking on the nature of oppression, the various forms it takes, and the factors that keep it in place, as well as a series of strategies and tactics for awakening a sense of injustice in victims and victimizers and overcoming systems of oppression. \nThe faculty seminar later led to a two-day working conference which brought together 80 invited participants from a wide variety of disciplines, political and community activists, public intellectuals, philanthropists, and graduate students interested in contributing to scholarly and practical work in this area. Deutsch\u2019s framework for overcoming oppression and various other outstanding contributions to this event were subsequently published in a special issue of Social Justice Research in 2002. It also led to the establishment of the Annual Morton Deutsch Awards for Social Justice, an event honoring distinguished and promising contributions to social justice, which was aimed at stimulating, incentivizing and celebrating both distinguished as well as early career contributions to scholarship, practice and activism for interrupting oppression and sustaining justice. \nSome of the distinguished scholars and practitioners recognized since the establishment of the awards include: Michelle Fine, Distinguished Professor of Psychology at The City University of New York; Geoffrey Canada, President and CEO of Harlem Children\u2019s Zone; Mahzarin Banaji, Professor of Social Ethics in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University; John Jost, Professor of Psychology at NYU and past Editor of Social Justice Research; Janusz Reykowski, Warsaw School of Social Psychology and Janusz Grzelak, University of Warsaw; Sister Elaine Roulet, who founded multiple programs that connected incarcerated parents with their children at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility; Claude Steele, Social Psychologist and Provost of Columbia University; Ervin Staub, Professor Emeritus of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; Gene Sharp, Eminent Activist and Scholar on Non-violence and Senior Scholar at the Albert Einstein Institution; Gretchen Buchenholz, the Founder and Executive Director of the Association to Benefit Children; Abigail Disney, filmaker, philanthropist, and renowned activist for women and peace; The Fortune Society, one of the brightest lights in NYC fighting for and serving formerly incarcerated individuals in critical and innovative ways; Michael Wessells, for his work in child protection worldwide; and most recently Professor Derald Wing Sue of Teachers College, Columbia University for his research on microaggressions. \nThe example set by all these individuals continues to inspire and mobilize new generations of scholars and activists.

Reactions to the news were fast and clich\u00e9d. By and large, they went something like this: \nWilliam Golding, author of Lord of the Flies (pub. 1954), stated that his intention was to write a book about what we, today, would refer to as \u2018toxic masculinities\u2019\u2014a book he himself said could not be written of girls: \n\u201cIf you, as it were, scaled down human beings, scaled down society, if you land with a group of little boys, they are more like a scaled-down version of society than a group of little girls would be.\u2026 I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men; they are far superior and always have been. But one thing you can\u2019t do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down, so to speak, into a set of little girls who would then become a kind of image of civilization, of society.\u201d \nThe rejoinder to Golding\u2019s statement\u2014and to those who place it at the forefront of their critique of Warner Bros\u2019 project--can be summarized by a single question: Have you seen Mean Girls ? Heathers ? Carrie ? ( and the list could go on ). \nWithout a doubt, both perspectives are legitimate. The problem is that at the heart of either position lies a gender stereotype. \nWe rarely recognize, let alone admit, that stereotypes exist for a reason: They are rooted in the cognitive functioning of our brain (c.f. Asch\u2019s \u2018central organizing traits\u2019 or Gergen & Gergen\u2019s \u2018ready intelligibilities\u2019). Moreover, stereo typing , as a process, is enhanced by the Western cultural imperative to order the world through the categorization of 'objective properties' of discrete objects. Only think of Sesame Street\u2019s well-loved song \u201c One of these things is Not like the Other. \u201d) The upshot is, stereotypes\u2014especially gender-stereotypes\u2014are a consequence of that ordering, and should not be dismissed and thrown out with the bathwater. Rather, they should be the start of a lively conversation on human nature (maybe one that can, in 2017, include insights from evolutionary neuro-psychology), or spark a discussion about the interplay between (new) gender norms and current understandings of the process (and neurological depth of) internalization. \nGolding\u2019s famous frame-up of the Nature vs. Nurture debate was penned in the aftermath of WWII. More than anything else it was a cautionary tale, giving voice to secret fears that were not crushed by the horrors of war: the suspicion that the atrocities born of difference were somehow legitimate. \nIf the axis of \u2018 difference\u2019 (rather than some mash-up of primal impulses and toxic masculinity--or the female version thereof) retains primary emphasis,Golding himself might reconsider his position on women. Only consider: \u201c Belonging \u201d is a requirement of survival\u2014for men and for women alike. \u21d2 This is evolutionary neuro-psychology\u2014and the linchpin of Lord of the Flies . Difference sorely threatens group solidarity\u2014for men and for women alike \u21d2 Again, evolutionary neuro-psychology\u2014and the central dynamic in Lord of the Flies. Shame is pre-linguistic, and coded as \u201cpain\u201d into the developing brains* - -of men and women alike \u21d2 Yes, evolutionary neuro-psychology\u2014and the catalyst underlying the formation of ack\u2019s tribe in Lord of the Flies . \nIn other words, evolutionary neuropsychology challenges the idea that our key primal motivations\u2014which come into play in this hypothetical \u2018state of nature\u2019-- are deeply gendered. Rather, \u2018 belonging \u2019 to a tribe is the human strategy for survival\u2014and the need to belong is hardwired into both male and female brains. Shaming is the best-known human strategy to manage difference , which threatens group cohesion. \nIf young women are to follow Golding\u2019s script and be cut adrift from the constraints of society, they might well eschew more \u201cfemininity\u201d than we care to admit. The fact of the matter is, we don\u2019t know\u2014but doesn't 34 seasons of \u201c Survivor \u201d give us some hints? (Several episodes had 3 \u2013 5 all-female finalists) There are undeniably \u201cprimal,\u201d neuro-biological differences in \u2018the tribe\u2019 of men versus \u2018the tribe\u2019 of women. But girl\u2019s and women\u2019s relative powerlessness in society has afforded no opportunity to determine whether the adage \u201cpower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\u201d applies to them equally (power, of course, being equated with the ability to rise above social constraints.) \nWhat we can say is that if it can be successfully argued that Golding\u2019s primal masculinities are aligned with human motivations, then perhaps the means by which girls meet human needs in a \u2018state of nature\u2019 will, in significant ways, mimic the dynamic that sprung up between boys in Lord of the Flies . \nThe question is, is this all the MALE film-makers are trying to say with this movie? The point of grounding gender-stereotypes in evolutionary neuro-psychology is to (hopefully) illustrate that the questions are much bigger than the cultural framework that Lord of the Flies implicitly employs. How would including a Muslim girl, a transgendered boy , a girl suffering from autism \u2014in addition to an overweight, un-cool female \u201cPiggy\u201d-- influence dynamics? \nIf the filmmakers take on the challenge of giving us more than a gendered tit-for-tat, if they explore other dimensions of the breakdown of civilization, they may give us an important mirror through which we can assess, and critique, much more than a gendered 'state of nature.'

This is the important conversation to have. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE Source: 123rf/wavebreak media ltd \nThe decision to have a baby after a previous experience with postpartum depression or anxiety is understandably accompanied by tremendous anxiety. The postpartum pact was created to help couples initiate a productive conversation about their concerns as they develop a plan of action and coping strategies. \nThese are not just statements to be read aloud. They are talking points to be discussed together in order to acknowledge what worked in the past, what didn't work, what needs to be done differently, and how best to proceed given the current concerns and areas of vulnerability. This contact will augment your communication and promote a greater sense of control for you both. \nFind some time when you have no distractions so you can devote total attention to reading this together and review every detail. \n*The \"I\" in this pact can refer to either partner and will be useful regardless of who is at risk for depression/anxiety. \nWe are reading this together because I need your help. \nIt\u2019s possible that after the birth of our baby, I might not feel well. Since I\u2019m at risk of experiencing depression again, we need to be alert for some of the signs so we can take care of things right away. \nI need to trust that you will be observant and candid about what you see and your concerns. \nYou need to trust that I am a good judge of how I am feeling. \nIn the event that my symptoms interfere with my ability to determine how I am feeling or what is best for me, it is crucial that you solicit help from our family, our friends, my doctor, and my therapist. \nWe both know that it is better to be overly cautious than to assume things will get better on their own. \nI need you to tell me now that you understand how important all of this is and that you are prepared to act accordingly. Knowing this will give me great comfort. \nThese are questions that may help you determine how things are going after our baby is born. They may not all apply to us, but they will provide a general outline for us to follow. \nAs we review each point together, we will highlight those that feel particularly relevant to our situation so we don\u2019t miss a thing. \nIf any feeling or experience that we went through has been overlooked, we will discuss that together and add it to the pact. \nAfter our baby comes, I will depend on you to go over these items a number of times at various stages, since things can potentially change. Here\u2019s what I need you to look for Am I acting like myself? Is there anything I am saying or doing that seems out of character to you or not like my usual self? Am I too worried, too withdrawn, too talkative, too euphoric, too exhausted, hyper, too unhappy, too uninterested? Do I seem confused? Am I crying all the time? Am I eating the way I usually do? Am I taking care of myself the way I typically do? Am I spending time with the baby? Am I reacting appropriately to the baby? Do I seem too worried or too detached regarding the baby? Am I less interested in things that used to interest me? Is my anxiety getting in the way of doing what I need to do? Do I seem preoccupied with worry or fear that seems out of proportion to you? Do I resist spending time with people who care about me? Do I seem too attentive or concerned with the baby\u2019s health ? Am I having trouble sleeping , even when the baby is sleeping? Am I overly concerned with things being done perfectly with no room for mistakes? Are you noticing that I am isolating myself though I am fearful of being alone? Am I too angry, too irritable, too anxious, too short-tempered? Am I having panic attacks, where I say I can\u2019t breathe or think clearly? Here\u2019s what I need you to listen for Am I saying anything that scares you? Do I say that I think something is wrong? Do I say I just don\u2019t feel like myself? Am I telling you I can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to do something that surprises you? Am I telling you I want leave or stop all this or hurt myself? Am I asking you for things I don\u2019t usually ask for? Am I saying I\u2019m too scared or too tired or too unable to do what I need to do? Am I asking you to stay home with me all the time? Am I telling you I can\u2019t do this without your help? Am I expressing feelings of inadequacy, failure, or hopelessness? Do I keep asking you for reassurance or ask to you repeat the same thing over and over? Am I complaining a lot about how I feel physically (headaches, stomachaches, chest pains, shortness of breath)? Am I telling you we made a mistake and I don\u2019t want this baby? Am I blaming everything on our marriage ? Am I worried that you\u2019ll leave me? Do I tell you that you and the baby would be better off without me? Am I afraid I will always feel this way? Do I tell you I\u2019m a bad mother (father)? Here\u2019s what I need you to do Check in with me on a regular basis, several times a day Ask me how I\u2019m feeling and ask me what you can do to help. Enlist our friends and family to help whenever possible during the early weeks. Even if I resist, please insist that it\u2019s better for me to accept the help. Remind me that I\u2019ve been through this before and things got better. Help me even if I don\u2019t ask. Insist that I rest even if I\u2019m not able to sleep. Make sure I eat, even if I\u2019m not hungry. Spend as much time caring for the baby as you can. If you are the slightest bit worried, encourage me to contact my doctor and therapist. If I protest, tell me that you will call them for me and come with me to the appointment. Remind me that even if everything\u2019s okay, it may be helpful and reassuring to make an appointment so we know for certain. Take a walk with me. Help with the baby during the night. If you\u2019re not able to, please make sure someone else is there to help out so I don\u2019t get sleep deprived which would make everything worse. Trust your instincts if you are worried or you think something needs to be done differently. Talk to me. Tell me what you\u2019re thinking. Sit with me. Stay close even when there\u2019s nothing to say. Help me get professional help. Help me find the joy. Help me stay present and appreciate the little things. Help me find and feel the butterflies, the giggles, the hugs, the sunshine, the belly laughs, the smiles. Here\u2019s what I need you NOT to do or say Do not assume I am fine because I say I am. Do not leave everything up to me if I am feeling overwhelmed. Do not use this time to work harder or later or longer if Ineed you home during the first few weeks. Do not tell me to snap out of it. I can\u2019t. Do not let my resistance or denial get in the way of what we need to do. Do not tell everyone how well I\u2019m doing if I\u2019m not doing well. Please do not tell me I am strong and can do this without help if I need help. Please do not sabotage any effort I might need to make to seek treatment, such as resisting medication or pressuring me about the financial strain. Do not complain about the cost of treatment. Do not pressure me to have sex while I\u2019m feeling so bad. Please do not do anything behind my back. If you are worried, let me know. If you want to call my doctor, let me know you are doing this. Do not forget to take care of yourself during this time. Make sure you are eating well, resting as much as possible, finding support for yourself from friends and family. Here\u2019s what I need you to say Tell me you will do whatever I need you to do to make sure I feel healthy. Tell me you can tolerate my anxiety, my fears, my irritability, my moodiness. Tell me you are keeping an eye on how I am feeling so things won\u2019t get out of hand. Tell me you love me. Tell me I\u2019m a good mother (father). Tell me its okay if things aren\u2019t perfect all the time. Tell me you are not going to leave me no matter what. Here\u2019s what I need you to remember I\u2019m doing the best I can. Sometimes the big things that seem scary at first aren\u2019t as scary as more subtle things. For instance, if I have an anxiety attack or snap at you, even though it\u2019s upsetting, it may not be as troublesome as if I\u2019m isolating myself in the bedroom and quietly withdrawing. If you\u2019re not sure about something regarding how I am feeling or how I am acting, please ask for help and tell me you will call my doctor or therapist. If I become symptomatic, chances are things will not get better on their own. Do not underestimate how much I appreciate the fact that I know I can count on you during difficult times.

As the film depicted spectators flowing in holding signs proudly proclaiming themselves as \u201cmale chauvinist pigs,\u201d it made me think about the rise in public displays of White Supremacy at Trump rallies, the women\u2019s marches in January of 2017, and where we are now in terms of women\u2019s sports , gender equity, and LGBTQ rights. \nAccording to the film, Billie Jean King agreed to play in the circus created by Bobby Riggs, to stand up for gender equality and to call attention to the importance of equal pay for women on and off the court. I was born in 1971 and remember hearing my parents talk about this match when I was older and started playing tennis myself. My father, a tennis player, had a deep respect and appreciation for both players and admired King\u2019s strength and ability to prevail in that match. This mattered to me as a young female athlete in the 80's. \nBillie Jean King opened the door for many female athletes to earn and achieve more than would have been possible without her strong stance in the early 70\u2019s. In addition to winning the \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d, she was a strong advocate for Title IX. This law has radically changed the athletics opportunities for women in the 40 years since it passed. It hasn\u2019t eradicated gender bias in schools or sports , but it has changed the culture and expectations for participation and resources in high school and college athletics. \nI was pleasantly surprised about how much the film attended to her first relationship with a woman and her internal struggle with this aspect of her identity as she publicly challenged the men\u2019s tennis establishment about equal pay and support for women players. I teared up several times as I felt her struggle to stand up for gender equality and the burden she bore at trying to be the \u201cideal\u201d model of a female athlete. She was deeply aware of the public value placed on being married to a supportive husband, wearing fashionable sportswear, having good hair at her matches, and being a strong athlete who was as \u201cexciting as the men.\u201d \nIn 1981, she was the first female athlete to be outed as a lesbian. This was due to a \u2018palimony\u2019 suit brought by Marilyn, her first female partner who was depicted in the film. She publicly came out on her own terms later and became a strong and vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights. I believe she made it more possible for other women to be more open about their own identities including other trailblazers Martina Navratilova, k.d. lang, Melissa Etheridge, and Ellen Degeneres. These women all had an impact on me and my own coming out and I am grateful for their strength and leadership as we continue to build on the foundation they helped build for gender equity, equal pay, and LGBTQ rights. Role models matter. \nTitle IX is being dismantled . Female athletes still have to fight for fair pay. The US just voted with 12 other countries in the UN against condemning countries who punish homosexuality with the death penalty . The Department of Justice is arguing to allow same- sex discrimination the SCOTUS gay wedding cake case . There is still much work to be done. We will continue striving to create a better world for people of all genders and sexual identities and the \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d was an important moment in this culture shift. \nThank you, Billie Jean.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:33:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b583490d0ffbebf07d0b535ff80047ec0d61a5e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LvzJN1ypRn2g2_6cmddkxu7ESxB396F1auiSdsCE9F7t2NBekZSRePpkSrz4K7BPcv8d9cz2MqvuLneOOv2qKTGYxQ5enSZR4YY5byOuw8SApvJTTJp.Wj", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Four Risk Factors for Burnout\u2014and How to Overcome Them", "title_full": "Four Risk Factors for Burnout\u2014and How to Overcome Them", "published": "2017-10-05T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/break-2297835_1920.jpg?itok=TpLaGPRR", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b583490d0ffbebf07d0b535ff80047ec0d61a5e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LvzJN1ypRn2g2_6cmddkxu7ESxB396F1auiSdsCE9F7t2NBekZSRePpkSrz4K7BPcv8d9cz2MqvuLneOOv2qKTGYxQ5enSZR4YY5byOuw8SApvJTTJp.Wj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "tdavis", "published": "2017-10-05T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Four Risk Factors for Burnout\u2014and How to Overcome Them", "text": "Four Risk Factors for Burnout\u2014and How to Overcome Them Tips for overcoming burnout and building work-life balance Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE Source: Pixabay \nWork-life balance was one of the things I struggle with most when it comes to building my personal happiness . Do you struggle with work-life balance too? \nAs a happiness writer and program development consultant , I really do try to practice what I preach. But if I'm being honest, I have a tendency to be a workaholic . \nI know that I am not the only one that struggles with this because work-life balance is increasingly tough in the age of technology. We are now constantly attached to our work through cellphones and email. And since the great recession, workplaces have been increasingly emphasizing productivity and speeding up. Let's face it - we now live in a burnout culture. \nIn this, my inaugural Psychology Today blog post, I want to talk about four risk factors for burnout that you may not be familiar with and how to overcome them. 1. You're passionate, hard-working, and motivated \nI began to see people struggle a lot more with work-life balance when I entered graduate school, and I\u2019ll tell you why. Universities select grad students who can persevere year after year after year to complete a PhD\u2014a degree that takes an average of 10 years to complete. So they pick students who, as a group, tend to be ambitious, focused, tenacious, and even obsessive about their work. Although some people struggle with setting aside enough time to do work, grad students tend to be the type of people who struggle to set aside enough time not to do work. As a result, they may neglect to eat right, exercise, engage in hobbies, or even see their friends and family. If you \u201clive to work,\u201d forget to schedule time for non-work activities, and see yourself as someone who is highly motivated and persistent, then you may be at risk for burnout. \nWhat to do: If you\u2019re already a hyper-focused, motivated, planner type, then I know you can successfully apply your skills to create better balance. Get out your calendar and schedule time to spend on your health and happiness . Build in systems to prevent backsliding. For example, by scheduling your \"happiness activities\" at a regular time each week, you can build healthy habits. \nScheduling regular \u201cfriend time\u201d is also helpful. My workaholic friends and I have pre-scheduled weekly activities to do together. So we don\u2019t have to make the effort to schedule fun time each week; it just happens. Because we have agreed to meet each other and we hold each other accountable, we help each other succeed in creating balance. The more you can plan, automate, and increase accountability for your behavior, the easier it will be to improve your work-life balance. 2. You compare yourself to others \nAs grad school progressed, the social comparisons started kicking in for me and my peers. I heard things like, \u201cSally has five publications, but I only have two. I need to write more,\u201d or \u201cJohn finished his qualifying exams in his third year, but I won\u2019t do mine until my fourth year. I need to read more,\u201d or \u201cMila gave such an amazing research talk. I should be spending more time honing my presenting skills.\u201d And so on. \nWhen top performers are all gathered together and all asked to do similar tasks, now only one person can be the top performer. Everyone else, who may have been considered a rockstar in a different setting, is now average\u2014or worse. This type of environment leads everyone to work harder and harder to regain that sense of mastery, self-esteem, and respect. But when everyone works harder, no one gets any further ahead. Pretty soon work-life balance is long gone and everyone still feels like a loser. If you are surrounded by people who are amazing at what you are supposed to be amazing at, you may be at risk for burnout. \nWhat to do: It is human nature to compare ourselves to \u201csimilar others.\u201d This isn\u2019t always a bad thing; it helps us work harder and be better. But if you want more balance, you may benefit from working in an environment where most people are doing work that is very different from yours. For example, let\u2019s say you are a chef and you work with a brilliant team of managers, marketers, and waiters at a restaurant. When these colleagues do well, it probably won\u2019t make you feel like you are not doing well yourself. But when you get selected to go on the popular reality show Top Chef, suddenly you are working with brilliant chefs who are at the same skill level as you and know the same cooking methods. In the face of their success, you might feel like a failure. \nIf you feel social comparison is hurting your work-life balance, you may want to shift to working in an environment where everyone has more defined and discrete roles. 3. You don't fit inside the box \nIt wasn\u2019t until I finished my Master\u2019s degree and started my PhD at a top-tier school that my local culture became an additional risk factor for me. At top-tier schools, everyone expects you to be a star. For the sake of argument, let\u2019s say that they define a star as being yellow and having five points. This means that a star is not blue, it is not circular, and it doesn't have 3 points. Of course, every human being is different and has different strengths and weaknesses. So very few of us fit the definition of what it means to be a star, in other people's eyes. \nWhat happens when people feel they are not what they \u201cshould be\u201d? They overwork themselves to become what they should be, sometimes developing issues with sleep , health , or even depression or anxiety. If you are in a culture that expects everyone to be stars, you may be at risk for burnout. \nWhat to do: One thing you can do is build a growth mindset , the belief that people can grow, change, and improve. It means that people are not born stars; they become stars. Be careful, though: A growth mindset alone might just become one more reason to work yourself even harder. So ensure that you also practice self-acceptance and self-compassion . Remember, no one should make you feel bad about who you are . Maybe you are an octagon (and not a star). If so, try to view yourself positively and celebrate your distinct shape (by the way, I'm more of an octagon). 4. You don't stand up for yourself \nUC Berkeley\u2014where I did my PhD\u2014sits right next to San Francisco and Silicon Valley, an area that is often considered a technology mecca. Some of the world\u2019s best-known tech companies, including Facebook and Google, operate here. Tons of small startups operate here, too. If you are sitting at a coffee shop, you are almost guaranteed to overhear someone who is starting, working at, or discussing a startup. \nIt is an inspiring and invigorating culture, but it also prides itself on extra-hard work. You may have heard stories about startup founders forgoing sleep, food, and socializing to build their companies. Indeed, startup culture reinforces the idea that success can only be achieved by working non-stop. If your culture expects you to work all the time, you may be at risk for burnout. \nWhat to do: Try to establish boundaries. You decide: What is an acceptable number of hours for you to work? What life experiences would you regret missing? What are your work-life-balance deal-breakers? Once you establish what is acceptable for you, be assertive in advocating for your own needs - no one else will. What happens if you do burnout? \nWhile pursuing my PhD at Berkeley, I founded my first company. In between teaching and doing research and dissertation writing, I was fundraising, grant writing, and pitching my company. I also took classes in business and technology, picked up a minor in Management of Technology Innovation, and taught myself how to code in R. When my startup started failing (just like 75 percent of the other startups), I just worked harder, and I took on consulting jobs to build skills. At this point, balance was not something I was prioritizing at all. The risk factors added up and got the best of me. \nI started getting migraines, insomnia , and numbness in my hands and back. I stopped valuing and prioritizing the people in my life, even neglecting to spend time with my husband and my friends. My work stopped giving me a sense of purpose . I felt aimless, and I started wondering why I didn\u2019t feel my life had meaning. \nThen the unthinkable happened. Little by little, the quality of my work started to decline. I would schedule meetings at the wrong times, write reports that were missing lots of words, and be unable to answer the simplest of questions. \u201cWhat was happening to me?!\u201d I asked myself, \u201cIf I can\u2019t work, then what else do I have?!\u201d \nWhen I asked myself this question, it stopped me in my tracks. Was I seriously asking myself what else I had? I had an amazing husband, a wonderful family, a great friends. I had so neglected the non-work parts of my life that I didn\u2019t even think they existed anymore. It was only then that I realized something was really wrong with me. \nIt turns out, I was well into the worst phases of burnout. Because burnout builds slowly, you can miss it entirely. Your health, relationships, and well-being start to falter, but you may not know why, or maybe your don't even notice. Eventually, your body and brain start shutting down to prevent you from working - to protect you from what you are doing to yourself. In a frightening case of burnout, Arianna Huffington collapsed and woke up in a pool of her own blood. \nBurnout is serious. And balance is how you stop it. How to recover from burnout \nJust as it takes time to develop burnout, it takes time to recover. Returning to a regular 40-hour workweek is usually not enough to make up for years of overworking yourself. You may need to take long chunks of time off, work part-time for a while, and learn how to better cope with stress . \nWhat did I do? First, I got clear on what was important to me . Yes, I did prioritize spending more time with my family and friends, but if I was going to be able to sustain balance, there was more work to be done. \nSecond, I left academia to start my own well-being consulting business - The Berkeley Well-Being Institute , which focuses on well-being products and tech - and this time, I did it my way. I decided I would not work (or even answer emails) on weekends. I would spend about 20 hours per week helping clients build well-being tech products and whatever energy I had left writing about happiness and well-being . I would work with clients that valued my creativity and respected my boundaries. \nI didn't achieve these goals right away, and I have had to be careful not to lose site of them. But a year and half later, I can happily say my burnout is completely gone. I have learned a lot about myself and a lot about what it really takes to build happiness in the age of technology . I can't wait to share these insights with you.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:33:02.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8de58ce1f3dfc7a323f971c2a2597dfa2cd3a83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I8J9rzLuNDoT5S8eG5ZLt4XUvYSN1m8dj9Yxg0OCEvKx0HTpGDLmmeuEkaUths9HmHdPYe711Eer_8Z0jwzMc3R0mQK4S1LlU-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Ignoring Biological Bases of Senseless Violence", "title_full": "Ignoring Biological Bases of Senseless Violence", "published": "2017-10-05T19:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8de58ce1f3dfc7a323f971c2a2597dfa2cd3a83", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I8J9rzLuNDoT5S8eG5ZLt4XUvYSN1m8dj9Yxg0OCEvKx0HTpGDLmmeuEkaUths9HmHdPYe711Eer_8Z0jwzMc3R0mQK4S1LlU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sgreenspan", "published": "2017-10-05T19:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ignoring Biological Bases of Senseless Violence", "text": "Ignoring Biological Bases of Senseless Violence Did the Las Vegas shooter have a damaged brain? Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nThe Las Vegas shooting tragedy involved a lone shooter who rained bullets from the 32nd floor of a hotel down into a large crowd of people attending an outdoor concert, and killed nearly 60 people and injured many others. It differs from other recent mass killings in the US and elsewhere in that the shooter, a 64-year-old well-off professional gambler and real estate investor named Stephen Paddock, was not part of an organized movement and did not have any apparent political, racial, or religious agenda. Nor did he have a known history of criminal conduct, or serious mental illness. This lack of obvious motive could change as more becomes known (I write this only two days after the tragedy), but it is possible that the Las Vegas incident will continue to defy any search for a likely explanation. \nThere are relatively few historic antecedents to the Las Vegas rampage, but one that has been mentioned by several commentators took place in Texas a half-century earlier, when an engineering student and former marine named Charles Whitman lugged several firearms up to the 28th floor observation deck of the clock tower on the University of Texas campus and, shooting down from the tower, killed over a dozen strangers and injured many others walking or standing far below. One obvious difference is that Whitman had single-shot weapons and picked off his victims individually using sniper scopes, while Paddock had automatic weapons and fired indiscriminately into a tightly packed crowd of concert attendees. But the most obvious similarity (aside from shooting down from a high perch and killing people whom they did not know) is that the motive for Whitman\u2019s deranged action has never become fully known. One difference is that the night before the mass shooting spree, Whitman killed two people who he claimed to love \u2014his wife and mother (both with a knife)\u2014in order, according to notes he left\u2014to spare them the embarrassment and pain of his planned rampage. Paddock\u2019s rampage, for which he left no note, also reflected careful and meticulous planning, although he sent his girlfriend off on a lengthy trip to get her out of the way. \nBefore the deadly incident Whitman did seek professional help from a UT mental health clinic for various symptoms, including killer headaches, but mainly because of this persistent obsession he expressed with shooting people from the tower. (Under current legal rulings, the psychiatrist to whom he expressed this idea likely would have had to notify the police, but in 1961 he probably felt constrained by confidentiality rules, but also by the fact that Whitman\u2019s thoughts may not have yet crystallized into specific details, and so could be interpreted as pure fantasy). As is true of mental health professionals then, and to a large extent still today, speculation after the fact focused on Oedipal or other affective issues, such as Whitman\u2019s hatred of a wife- (and child-) abusing father, and Paddock\u2019s possible resentment of a bank robber father described in a wanted poster as a \u201c psychopath \u201d and who abandoned the family for years when on the run. Charles Whitman did have anger issues, as reflected in being disciplined in the service for assaulting another Marine. He also told a friend of having struck his wife a couple of times and expressed fear that he was becoming like his father. But Whitman had no history of homicidal rage, and there was no reason to think he was capable of anything as heinous as killing his loved ones and then shooting innocent strangers. Similarly, although little is known at this point about Paddock\u2019s history, he was generally described by neighbors and relatives in neutral or positive terms, and he (like Whitman) was seen as someone unlikely to kill anyone. \nA clue into the roots of Whitman\u2019s behavior came during the autopsy (he was killed by multiple shotgun blasts from responding police officers) when a sizeable tumor was found in his brain , near the pituitary gland. Amazingly, the coroner\u2019s report dismissed this finding as having anything to do with causing Whitman\u2019s rampage. That opinion was altered, however, in the report of a commission convened by Texas\u2019 governor to study the incident. The commission\u2019s report noted that while knowledge of brain-behavior relationship was insufficient in 1966 to understand adequately the connection, they were quite certain that Whitman\u2019s brain tumor played a role in explaining why he did what he did. \nAlthough knowledge of the brain has obviously expanded exponentially in the past half century, it is still striking how the search for the roots of Stephen Paddock\u2019s crime has failed to pay much, if any, attention to the possible role of brain or related biological (e.g., endocrine ) conditions. For example, a well-known former FBI profiler opined on TV that based on currently available knowledge, none of the explanations used by profilers can begin to make sense of Stephen Paddock. That may continue to be the case after more becomes known, but to me this admission also tells me that biological factors such as brain tumors are not really part of the training or theoretical frameworks used by FBI profilers or, for that matter, of the psychiatrists who help to develop those frameworks. Interestingly, the most on-point mention of biological factors came from a layperson, Paddock\u2019s distraught and perplexed younger brother Eric, when he stated to reporters, \u201cI hope they find he had a brain tumor.\u201d \nCopyright Stephen Greenspan", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:33:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b6ca39b4b5608f3f30415e5d57a79014ec36d7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KPFBv4zCnXwRL3DIRJcLewWEMEyke9aOZU4or1N.1zJMywWAJq.NsXeIAC2INtKRpfJ9RUSJaUHq9uAxPCmfJChcKm5ceBhkC2YJ3XcCLByg--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Understanding PTSD Due To Chronic Mass Violence", "title_full": "Understanding PTSD Due To Chronic Mass Violence", "published": "2017-10-05T19:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/seal_training.jpg?itok=iORxlHzk", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b6ca39b4b5608f3f30415e5d57a79014ec36d7e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KPFBv4zCnXwRL3DIRJcLewWEMEyke9aOZU4or1N.1zJMywWAJq.NsXeIAC2INtKRpfJ9RUSJaUHq9uAxPCmfJChcKm5ceBhkC2YJ3XcCLByg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GrantHBrenner", "published": "2017-10-05T19:49:00.000+03:00", "title": "Understanding PTSD Due To Chronic Mass Violence", "text": "Understanding PTSD Due To Chronic Mass Violence New research shows how chronic trauma affects civilian populations. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nPerspectives on varieties of traumatic experience \nResearch on PTSD has tended to focus on the impact of single or short-term episodes of trauma, in part because it is easier to acknowledge and study. Let's not review the statistics on trauma here as they are commonly available (e.g. the National Institute of Mental Health ). While we have developed a better understanding of how childhood trauma can show up as complex PTSD (cPTSD) and related issues later in life, there is less clear understanding about PTSD related to chronic exposure to war, terror and political violence in civilian populations \u2014 \"ongoing exposure to political conflict\", or OEPC. Unfortunately, this question is increasingly important because of the accelerating pace of terrorist attacks, mass casualty events, war and the specter of more conflict on the horizon, political violence, and various other forms of exposure to potentially traumatizing material. \nWhile such exposure may lead to PTSD and PTSD-like syndromes (which may not meet full diagnostic criteria for PTSD), most stress responses are normal, and the majority of people do not develop a medical condition in response to trauma exposure. It is important to respond to reactions as normal-until-proven-otherwise and provide supportive measures to maintain or re-establish routines and bolster resilience , while thoughfully monitoring for the emergence of more serious symptoms. There are risks to both over-diagnosing and under-diagnosing, and assessment itself must be done carefully so as not to provoke unnecessary stress. \nExposure to collective trauma \nDespite expert recommendations to limit exposure to traumatic material while using the media appropriately as a source of useful information, and increasing understanding of the effects of media exposure on us , the media continues to broadcast high doses of potentially traumatizing material. In addition, people are likely to discuss disturbing and frightening current events, raising the level of awareness of such potential threats to the safety of oneself and loved ones. \nFurthermore, because OEPC has become the norm and periods of calm are shorter and shorter, the expectation of safety and stability in day-to-day life is undermined. While limiting self-exposure to the media can help to reduce the impact, many people have difficulty restraining themselves. We are therefore more likely to have a sense of ongoing significant threat on many levels, in addition to moral strain . The effect of chronic threat on civilian populations needs to be better understood as a first step toward mitigating the potential negative impact on mental health on a massive scale. If we don't address these concerns early on, there is reason to believe that negative consequences in the future may be even more problematic. \nResearching OEPC as seen by experienced mental health providers \nTo better understand the effect of chronic exposure to collective trauma, researchers (Goral, Lahad, & Aharonson-Daniel, 2017) decided to study Israeli civilians, who unfortunately represent a \"natural laboratory\" for OEPC. In this study, one phase of a broader study, researchers carefully developed a survey for psychotherapists to complete regarding their observed symptoms of single or short-term trauma exposure and OEPC. \nThey sought to learn if there were differences in severity or patterns of symptoms, whether post-traumatic symptoms get better when the source of distress lets up, and to understand whether therapists perceived qualitative differences between single and short-term exposure, and OEPC-related PTSD. Standard PTSD symptoms include: intrusion ( nightmares , flashbacks, re-experiencing, etc.), avoidance (of reminders, places, thoughts, etc.), negative alternations in cognition and mood (difficulty with concentration , memory , depressive symptoms, etc.), and alternations in arousal and reactivity (feeling panicky, physical symptoms of elevated tension, being easily startled, feeling fearful , etc.). \nThe 75-item questionnaire looked at a range of PTSD symptoms included included in both the standard medical definition of PTSD as well as a broader range of possible symptoms based on other familiar post-traumatic characteristics. Therapists rated each category in terms of severity as well as duration, for short-term or single exposure PTSD and OEPC. They defined the duration of OEPC as one month, or longer. \nExamples of broader post-traumatic experiences included items such as \"mental exhaustion\", \"increased morbidity\", \"feeling lack of control about the future\", a \"sense of danger\", and \"low frustration threshold\", and additional items asked about functional impairments at work and in the home, including difficulties in relationships and with children. \nThey surveyed whether therapists observe that symptoms of OEPC are relieved during calm times and when the threat is not nearby, whether OEPC-related PTSD looks different from the standard diagnostic profile for PTSD (in the DSM-5), and whether current assessment tools are a good fit for OEPC. Finally, they collected data on demographics, including age, gender and professional background, as well as geographical location and level of experience working with trauma. Interestingly, they do not appear to have asked therapists about their own exposure to trauma. Therapists who participated in the study did so voluntarily, representing a self-selected sample. \nThe 66 survey participants were 67 percent female, with an average age of 51.4 years. Half were social workers, 30 percent were psychologists, 20 percent were therapists with other backgrounds (e.g. art therapists), and only one was a psychiatrist. Most reported having over 11 years of professional experience and most had recently worked with traumatized patients. \nFor the broader set of post-traumatic symptoms severity was higher to a statistically significant extent for all items. Higher severity symptoms included \"sense of danger/lack of protection\", \"feeling lack of control about the future\", \"difficulty in emotion regulation \", \"mental exhaustion\", \"low frustration threshold\", \"feeling that no one understands me\", \"tendency to get hurt\", \"feelings of betrayal, and \" personality changes\". The only one of these rated as severe in single or short-term PTSD, in contrast, was \"sense of danger/lack of protection\". \nFor the standard diagnostic model of PTSD, OEPC had more severe symptoms to a significant extent for intrusion, negative alternations in cognition and mood, and arousal and reactivity, but not avoidance. For functional impairment, all measures were worse for OEPC except for missing work, and impairment in social/personal function was somewhat worse than for work. \nNearly 60 percent of therapists reported that they expected relief from OEPC symptoms when conflict was not present, and when there was no immediate threat to the individual. A little over a quarter of therapists thought that there would be no relief regardless of whether a threat was present or nearby. There was no difference in these perceptions based on demographics. \nNearly 60 percent of therapists said that OEPC-related PTSD resembled PTSD per the DSM-5 definition. Nearly 25 percent thought that they were different syndromes, and the rest did not have a clear position. Interestingly, therapists in southern Israel were more likely to see them as different syndromes. Most therapists did not think current assessment tools were very appropriate - half said they were \"fairly appropriate\" and over 30 percent said they were not at all appropriate. \nAdditional considerations \nHigher \"doses\" of traumatic experience are typically correlated with more severe and higher rates of PTSD, so it is not surprising from that point of view that OEPC, which is by definition more prolonged exposure , is associated with more severe symptoms in most symptom areas. Interestingly, OEPC is not more strongly associated with avoidant symptoms, perhaps because it is difficult to completely avoid conflict-related trauma, and people who are avoidant of OEPC might be less likely to leave areas of perceived safety to go to a therapist's office. If that is the case, telemedicine might offer help for those who do not want to travel. \nOn the other hand, in addition to severity, the current data suggests a different symptom pattern with OEPC when considering the broader range of post-traumatic symptoms, which notably include greater personality change and shift in outlook on life, emotional regulation difficulty, existential concerns, increased social isolation and mistrust, and symptoms reminsicent of burnout . Similar changes are seen with complex PTSD and other forms of chronic trauma exposure as well. \nThese broader symptoms are not typically assessed with common PTSD screening and assessment rating scales, and require additional attention to properly identify them. Mental exhaustion, a feature of burnout, was more severe with OEPC and is of special note because of the constant onslaught of tragic violent events nowadays and the impact it may have on wellbeing and overall function, as well as on a societal level as collective mental fatigue may increase the challenge of responding resiliently. It isn't clear how best to cope in the face of chronic traumatic events, as short-term adaptations may be harmful in the long run both in terms of individual physical and mental health, and the effects on relationships, family, work and the very fabric of society. \nGiven that Israel has a long history of OEPC, with a decades-long learning curve, the findings from the present study (and subsequent studies by the same research group) will be of interest for America, and other countries, where OEPC is a comparatively new phenomena to which we are still adjusting. Differences in culture and type of OEPC (e.g. domestic mass casualty events as in the USA as contrasted with political violence from nationalistic conflicts) are likely to result in important differences in the impact on civilians and society. It is likely that many of the findings will overlap, and therefore may help to inform us on how we can begin to think about coping with the disturbing potential new-normal of escalating violence in our own country. \nFor guidelines regarding the Las Vegas shooting, please take a moment to review this resource from the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress References \nGoral, A., Lahad, M. and Aharonson-Daniel, L.

Stop the madness! MORE \nJanet prided herself on being a sensitive, caring, mother, and wife. But life these days has been very complicated for her! She's been pulled into intense conflicts between her husband Russ and their son John. \nThe current situation with John, age 24, is that he has been living at home since he failed out of college four years earlier. John has managed to get some jobs over the years but holding on to them has been the challenge. John's job struggles that come from his belief that, \"I hate people telling me what to do.\" \nJohn's friends have fallen by the wayside and he spends most of his time in his room playing video games. He tells Janet and Russ that one day he will go back to college and then become a videogame designer. Russ is fed up with John's \"pipe dreams \". \nJanet feels guilty because John has ADHD and struggles with distractibility and lack of motivation . Medications have only provided marginal improvement. John prefers smoking weed to \"chill out\" and, while he acknowledges it demotivates him, he claims that \"weed makes me far more creative.\" \nRuss describes himself as \"old school\" and insists that John should start paying rent to him and Janet. Russ is also infuriated by \"John's lack of respect for us, who pay the bills!\" \nRuss has become increasingly vocal, complaining to Janet that John SHOULD be washing the dishes. John tells Janet that if he is reminded to wash HIS dishes he is happy to do so. But John also makes it clear to Janet that he SHOULD not have to wash dishes that are not his own. \nChanging The Dynamic \nWhen I saw Janet for counseling (John and Russ both refused to come to counseling, saying it was a waste of time) she was distraught. She reported that she was losing sleep , was constantly stressed out, and that her blood pressure was elevated. \nThrough counseling, Janet learned to stop the madness of being in the middle. She sat John and Russ down together and shared HER need for a calmer, less emotionally reactive home life. Truly seeing Janet's angst, Russ agreed to soften his delivery and John acknowledged that \"Deliberately trying to piss Russ off\" was not a good long-term plan for anyone. \nOther positive changes put in place included: Russ catching John making better choices (e.g., organizing the shoes in the mudroom). John agreeing to hold a job of at least 20 hours a week. John enrolling in a graphic design class at a community college. Russ verbalizing and \"owning his anxiety\" about John's future so that John could be reminded that Russ was coming from a place of caring versus criticism. John agreeing to taper his use of weed from almost daily to once or twice per week. Russ and John planning a father-son camping trip to further reboot their relationship with more positive feelings. Janet agreeing to keep the momentum moving forward by calling out either John or Russ at any utterance of complaints about one another going forward. \nWhen it comes to managing dependent adult children it is common for one parent to feel stuck in the middle. To break free: Be aware of this unhealthy family triangle of conflict. Talk about it, and try new strategies to break the pattern, such as those described above, and... Stay mindful that stopping the madness of being stuck in the middle will help you start getting to better places.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:33:13.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fcf4ec3106be2ada5c7c87341d2c75a717bc07c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I5AvgeTw.hNMtbo1Bsue6DScDW9p1znqOhO.VOyGERm9qWFwdwkchqz8UsDv4FBpSbxsBavogoxLtchJOqC4xPN.TXiSI46p1iXhAbsrWcdg--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "What Attributes Are Key to a Successful Leadership?", "title_full": "What Attributes Are Key to a Successful Leadership?", "published": "2017-10-05T19:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/509919198.jpg?itok=hdJeEfga", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fcf4ec3106be2ada5c7c87341d2c75a717bc07c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4I5AvgeTw.hNMtbo1Bsue6DScDW9p1znqOhO.VOyGERm9qWFwdwkchqz8UsDv4FBpSbxsBavogoxLtchJOqC4xPN.TXiSI46p1iXhAbsrWcdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jdegraff", "published": "2017-10-05T19:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "What Attributes Are Key to a Successful Leadership?", "text": "What Attributes Are Key to a Successful Leadership? Leaders need to know their leadership type. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE Source: iStock \nLeaders need to know their leadership type. My years of research have found that there are four main types: Create: The Artist is clever and creative. They envision change, so their influence is based on anticipating a better future and generating hope in others. Being original is highly prized. They express themselves in spontaneous, creative responses to their surroundings. They are imaginative, able to handle a high degree of ambiguity and are comfortable with abstract ideas. Success for this type is defined by expressing new ideas and prototyping those ideas when possible. Compete: The Athlete is aggressive and decisive. This leader actively pursues goals and targets and is energized by competitive situations. Winning is a dominant objective, and the focus is on external competitors and marketplace position. These leaders are hard drivers and producers, very demanding of themselves and others. Speed, stealth, and discipline are key to their approach. Success for this type is in energizing employees by expanding opportunities for problem-solving and redeploying resources. Power is key. Collaborate : The Sage is caring and empathetic. The Sage is aware of others and cares for the needs of individuals. This leader is skilled at both building a community of people and sharing knowledge between them. They seek interactions among community members and allies and use processes like conflict management and consensus decision-making . Their success is defined by the creation of strong relationships through dialogue, trust, and understanding . Outcomes of these collaborative practices are shared values and commitment. They use their team orientation and cooperative nature to accomplish their goals. Morale and commitment are actively pursued. Control: The Engineer is a well-informed technical expert. They are diligent, meticulous, and function-based. They influence others based on the control and management of information. Improving efficiency through process redesign and the implementation of reliable technology is a hallmark of the Engineer. Success for this type is in improving quality through the use of procedures. This leader is risk-averse and seeks to take variation out of the system, valuing standardization and consistency. Measurement is used as a tool to achieve these values. Source: Jeff DeGraff \nOnce leaders know their leadership type, they need to know where they have strengths and where they don\u2019t. Leaders should know when to use the right tools. A toolkit is not unlike the set of techniques available to leaders: A hammer, a saw, and a wrench are all indispensable when you\u2019re building or repairing something, but they\u2019re not interchangeable. The same occurs when leaders are weighing ideas or possible innovative techniques. \nLeaders should also keep an open mind and know their weaknesses. Everyone has a worldview and therefore a bias towards a particular strategy or perspective. Leaders should partner with others that challenge them. Sages and Engineers challenge each other, as do Engineers and Artists. Great leaders will develop the appropriate culture and competencies in their company to produce the desired value proposition. However, leaders typically favor practices that closely resemble their own preferences instead of changing those practices to fit the situation, to the detriment of the organization. Lacking range and knowledge about when you need to enlist others will not result in the desired outcome. \nThe following video goes more in-depth into the four types of innovators.

Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE Source: Pepe174 CC0 via Wikimedia Commons \nPersonality characteristics reflect key differences between people in their motivations. For example, people who are very open to experiences treat new things as something to be approached and considered, while those on the other end of the spectrum are more likely to shy away from the unfamiliar. \nPersonality characteristics are valuable to understand because they are fairly stable. That means that knowing something about a person\u2019s personality characteristics can help you predict how they are likely to act and react in situations. \nAlthough a lot is known about personality in young adults (because college students are frequently the participants in studies) and in older adults, the development of personality from adolescence to adulthood is less well understood. \nNew insights on what happens to personality during this period of life come from a paper in the October 2017 issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology . The researchers analyzed data from a multi-year study of adolescents and young adults (ages 12 to 22) in the Netherlands. Each participant filled out a personality inventory that measured the Big Five personality traits\u2014Openness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness , and Emotional Stability (often conceptualized as Neuroticism )\u2014and rated their closeness to siblings and friends that they had recruited to join them in the study. \nThe researchers explored how much personality traits tended to change over time. Consistent with the idea that personality stabilizes as people reach adulthood, the degree of change from year to year decreased as children got older. \nThe team was also interested in age-group differences in overall personality change . They looked at this change separately for boys and girls. They found that: The trait of agreeableness, which partly reflects how much people want to be liked by others, tended to increase over time in both boys and girls. Conscientiousness, which reflects how much people tend to complete what they start and to follow rules, increased in girls over time. For boys, there was an initial dip as they entered adolescence and then an increase in as they became young adults, though adolescent and young-adult boys were less conscientious on average than girls in the study. Boys in this sample showed a slight tendency toward more emotional stability over time, reporting decreased ratings on tendencies such as worrying or getting easily upset. Girls showed an initial dip in emotional stability as they reached adolescence, followed by an increase as they reached young adulthood. \nThe last big question addressed in this paper was whether children\u2019s relationships with friends and siblings affects their personality. While there was a tendency for children to choose to hang out with other people who have traits similar to their own, changes in friends\u2019 traits did not predict changes in a child\u2019s traits. That is, the evidence suggests that kids make friends with people who are like them, but that their personalities are not strongly swayed by the personality shifts that unfold in their friends.

Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nIn late August, Warner Bros. announced an all-female remake of Lord of the Flies . Reactions to the news were fast and clich\u00e9d. By and large, they went something like this: \nWilliam Golding, the author of Lord of the Flies , stated that he intended to write a book about what we, today, would refer to as \"toxic masculinities,\" a book he said could not be written of girls: \n\u201cIf you, as it were, scaled down human beings, scaled down society, if you land with a group of little boys, they are more like a scaled-down version of society than a group of little girls would be...I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men; they are far superior and always have been. But one thing you can\u2019t do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down, so to speak, into a set of little girls who would then become a kind of image of civilization, of society.\u201d \nThe rejoinder to Golding\u2019s statement\u2014and to those who place it at the forefront of their critique of Warner Bros\u2019 project\u2014can be summarized by a single question: Have you seen Mean Girls ? Heathers ? Carrie ? ( The list could go on .) \nWithout a doubt, both perspectives are legitimate. The problem is that at the heart of either position lies a gender stereotype. \nWe rarely recognize, let alone admit, that stereotypes exist for a reason: They are rooted in the cognitive functioning of our brain (c.f. Asch\u2019s \u2018central organizing traits\u2019 or Gergen & Gergen\u2019s \u2018ready intelligibilities\u2019). Moreover, stereotyping , as a process, is enhanced by the Western cultural imperative to order the world through the categorization of 'objective properties' of discrete objects. Only think of Sesame Street\u2019s well-loved song \u201c One of these things is Not like the Other. \u201d) \nThe upshot is that stereotypes, especially gender-stereotypes, are a consequence of that ordering, and should not be dismissed and thrown out with the bathwater. \nRather, they should be the start of a lively conversation on human nature (maybe one that can, in 2017, include insights from evolutionary neuro-psychology), or spark a discussion about the interplay between (new) gender norms and current understandings of the process (and neurological depth of) internalization. \nGolding\u2019s famous frame-up of the Nature vs. Nurture debate was penned in the aftermath of WWII. More than anything else, it was a cautionary tale, giving voice to secret fears that were not crushed by the horrors of war; the suspicion that the atrocities born of difference were somehow legitimate. \nIf the axis of difference (rather than some mash-up of primal impulses and toxic masculinity, or the female version thereof) retains primary emphasis, Golding himself might reconsider his position on women. Only consider: \u201c Belonging \u201d is a requirement of survival, for men and for women alike. This is evolutionary neuro-psychology and the linchpin of Lord of the Flies . Difference sorely threatens group solidarity for men and women alike. Again, evolutionary neuro-psychology and the central dynamic in Lord of the Flies. Shame is pre-linguistic and coded as \u201cpain\u201d into the developing brains* of men and women alike. Yes, evolutionary neuro-psychology, and the catalyst underlying the formation of ack\u2019s tribe in Lord of the Flies . \nIn other words, evolutionary neuropsychology challenges the idea that our key primal motivations, which come into play in this hypothetical \"state of nature,\" are deeply gendered. \nRather, \" belonging\" to a tribe is the human strategy for survival, and the need to belong is hardwired into both male and female brains. \nShaming is the best-known human strategy to manage difference , which threatens group cohesion. \nIf young women are to follow Golding\u2019s script and be cut adrift from the constraints of society, they might well eschew more \u201cfemininity\u201d than we care to admit. The fact of the matter is, we don\u2019t know. But doesn't 34 seasons of \u201cSurvivor\u201d give us some hints? (Several episodes had three to five female finalists) \nThere are undeniably \u201cprimal\u201d neuro-biological differences in \"the tribe\" of men versus \"the tribe\" of women. But girl\u2019s and women\u2019s relative powerlessness in society has afforded no opportunity to determine whether the adage \u201cPower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\u201d applies to them equally. (Power, of course, being equated with the ability to rise above social constraints.) \nWhat we can say is that if it can be successfully argued that Golding\u2019s primal masculinities are aligned with human motivations, then perhaps the means by which girls meet human needs in a \"state of nature\" will, in significant ways, mimic the dynamic that sprung up between boys in Lord of the Flies . \nThe question is, is this all the male film-makers are trying to say with this movie? The point of grounding gender-stereotypes in evolutionary neuro-psychology is to (hopefully) illustrate that the questions are much bigger than the cultural framework that Lord of the Flies implicitly employs. \nHow would including a Muslim girl, a transgender boy , a girl suffering from autism , in addition to an overweight, un-cool female \u201cPiggy,\" influence dynamics? \nIf the filmmakers take on the challenge of giving us more than a gendered tit-for-tat and if they explore other dimensions of the breakdown of civilization, they may give us an important mirror through which we can assess, and critique, much more than a gendered 'state of nature.'

That worm is anxiety. However accomplished, happy, and admired, a person might be, the well of anxiety never runs dry. It is the unsolvable problem that gives rise to many others, from addiction and suicide to depression , obesity , and economic failure. \nTo Live is to be Anxious \nWild rabbits nibble nervously with constant alertness to movements in the background, to sounds, and to the odor of predators. Their anxiety is valuable because\u2014as a popular prey species\u2014it keeps them alive. \nSubsistence humans had fewer predators but had to be on constant alert for large cats, poisonous snakes, or biting insects that were a serious threat to adults and children alike. \nOf course, humans were top predators in addition to being prey. Even top predators, such as lions have something to fear and it is not uncommon for lions to be attacked and killed by a herd of water buffalo defending their young. \nThere is some safety in numbers and humans lived in groups of over forty individuals prior to the Agricultural Revolution. That helps explains why our species is so highly social. When we communicate our fears to others, we typically feel that our worry is lessened. \nSocial living minimizes both real dangers in the environment and also imagined ones. Ironically, social interactions are themselves a major source of anxiety because they can affect the social support available for difficult times. \nThe Social Dimension of Anxiety \nSocial interactions mostly contribute to feelings of calm and security. This mood is strengthened by close social contact that stimulates the release of oxytocin (the cuddling hormone) in much the same way as interactions between mothers and offspring (1). So, contact with trusted friends and associates reduces anxiety. \nIn developed countries, families are smaller and we may spend much of our time surrounded by strangers that is potentially anxiety-provoking. \nFranz Kafka described an alienating world where the individual is dwarfed by a totalitarian state that remains distant and unknowable. He was indirectly describing modern life in which the local community has evaporated, leaving us vulnerable to distant and alien authority. \nWhatever one thinks of the paranoid fantasy world of a Kafka novel, he touched a chord by depicting a political landscape where the individual is isolated and powerless. \nAlthough social interaction may relieve anxiety, interacting with large numbers of people may also be a source of anxiety, particularly if many of them are strangers. \nAnti-Anxiety Drugs \nPerhaps that is why social events are so often accompanied by alcohol consumption. Of course, in our society, alcohol is the most popular anti-anxiety drug. Other drugs in the same category exert similar effects on the brain : They suppress activity in the cerebral cortex thereby relieving feelings of anxiety and inhibition. \nGiven the important role that anxiety plays in alerting us to dangers around us\u2014whether physical, or social\u2014it follows that the most popular drugs of abuse are anti-anxiety drugs and medicines (including sedatives , muscle relaxants, and sleeping pills). \nOpiates like heroin and oxycontin are in a different drug category but feature powerful calming effects. Marijuana is also used to help people chill out even though it is classified as a hallucinogen . \nSuffice it to say, if anxiety were not such a prevalent experience, large segments of the population would not be addicted to drugs, whether prescription or recreational. \nHealth Costs of Chronic Anxiet y \nDrug addiction is a huge and growing problem. Untreated anxiety is a threat to health and longevity as well. Some sense of the scale of these problems is derived by looking at the range and scope of its effects on mental disorders and health. \nAlthough treatable by non-chemical interventions, anxiety disorders are the most common ones in the sense that most people experience fears that are out of proportion to the actual threat posed. They may fear flying or dread the number 13. Severe obsessions and compulsions are much less common. \nAnxiety may be a problem in itself but it is even more significant as a contributor to more serious illnesses. \nChronic anxiety contributes to clinical depression and depression may contribute to heart disease in the sense that diseases are biochemically related (2). So if the problem of anxiety disappeared tomorrow, a lot of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists would be out of work. \nThe same is true of many other medical specialists. Beginning with heart disease (still the leading killer in many developed countries) the toll includes common gastrointestinal diseases that are aggravated by stress , and reaches out to the entire metabolic syndrome (i. e., obesity-related disorders) that are the single most important health threat in developed countries. \nUnhealthy eating patterns can be a reaction to anxiety that exacerbates the risk of obesity in sedentary populations\u2014particularly those who are disadvantaged by social inequality (3). \nBecause anxiety is built into us as a mechanism of self-preservation, it is going nowhere. While social occasions are often accompanied by anti-anxiety drugs, chemical solutions to anxiety are not the only ones and mostly yield further health problems. \nAnxiety rises in developed countries compared to agricultural ones and I believe this phenomenon reflects changes in how communities are organized, as I will discuss in a later post.

Choose the right gut bacteria. \nThey\u2019ve already chosen you. \nBut can you select them? \nA recent study in Copenhagen checked the gut bacteria of some overweight people before starting them on a half year diet . Using a crude measure of different bacteria populations (high Prevotella to Bacteroides ratio,) the high ratio group who ate a \u201cNew Nordic Diet\u201d with lots of fruits and vegetables lost lots of body fat and weight, a total of 10.9 pounds. But that was three and a half pounds more than those eating the same diet, but sporting a low bacterial ratio. \nDiet type mattered. Those trying to lose weight on the on the \u201cAverage Danish Diet\u201d lost about half as much body fat. Their bacterial population ratios did not differentiate who lost more or less. \nWhy Should Gut Bacteria Affect Weight? \nBecause they affect so many other things we know about, and far more we don't. Our gut bacteria help digest food, prepare vitamins, and shift mood and our susceptibility to disease while possessing striking immunologic effects that may affect heart disease and stroke. That\u2019s the little that\u2019s known. \nWhy Is So Little Understood? \nRecently, the bacterial census was downgraded from 100 trillion to a 40 trillion cells. There are perhaps 10 trillion human cells. That\u2019s still a lot of bacteria in the four to six pounds they take up in our guts. \nOne complicating factor is that little is understood of how the many thousands of bacterial colonies interact with each other. We also don\u2019t know a whole lot about how they respond to other microbes, like viruses. We don\u2019t know how they pass information to our gut lining cells and other cells in the body. It is often said the gut has so many neural connections it is a \u201csecond brain.\u201d Some of those connections may create the little understood pathways of biological intelligence , determining how gut bacteria get their messages to the brain. \nWhat Changes Gut Bacteria Populations? \nWho your mother was and her lifelong personal microbiological history. Whether you were born through Caesarean section. Where you live. How you move and exercise. How and what you eat. And perhaps probiotics\u2014additions of bacteria to your bacteria. Direct transference of large bacterial populations\u2014loop to loop into the gut \u201ctransplants\u201d\u2013are proving an effective treatment of bacterium clostridium difficile infections, which kills thousands each year. C diff, as it\u2019s commonly called, generally occurs when immunocompromised patients get antibiotics that cause that single bacterial population, among many thousands, to proliferate wildly. \nWhat Are the Best Gut Bacteria to Have? \nThere\u2019s the rub. What may matter most is not your total \u201cpopulation numbers,\u201d but how those thousands of populations interact with each other\u2013and with human immune and nervous function. Trying to get one or another bacterial population up in number to make you \u201chealthy\u201d may be like trying to estimate the strength of the American economy by knowing how many Toyotas were sold in Michigan last March. Useful information, perhaps. But such information requires context. Still, it\u2019s clear that overall health and eating patterns affect the bacterial guys you live with. \nWhat Can You Do to Get \u201cHealthier\u201d Gut Bacteria? \nExpect thousands of ads for probiotics, yogurts, varied \u201csuperfoods\u201d, and fermented products to tell you in detail just what you should believe. Though you may not want to believe them. \nNonetheless, eating lots of very varied foods, especially whole plant foods, is correlated with gut bacteria types seen in healthier, generally leaner people. Which is \u201cchicken and egg\u201d? Like most biological phenomena, it probably does not involve standard linear causality, A leading to B leading to C, but innumerable interactions in many varied directions. What you can know is that nutritional variety is related to long lived, healthy populations throughout the planet. \nBottom Line \nGut bacteria matter. They will have impacts on weight, immunity, disease, longevity, and the pleasures of life. Too little is presently known about which populations are related to better health or how to effectively change them. Yet, doing the same stuff that teaches the body to be healthy, eating many different whole foods and moving around a lot, are at least correlated with bacterial populations, which make it easier to control your weight. \nSomeday we may learn what works best for us from the bacteria themselves. They clearly have their own agenda. It\u2019s going to take new research and new paradigms for understanding information processing in the body to figure out what they really want\u2014and how they might help us.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T21:37:09.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cc4b28c8ad06fb33a6be41e0b037196cae030135", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3WSuDySeJOxFNRLZLhqaIPLDFKaAOtXYHBZaHvt8BVBrjh0P8dl_RtVWfChgZNFzX_lNPZNWPi08", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Is My Mom Punishing Me Too Harshly?", "title_full": "Is My Mom Punishing Me Too Harshly?", "published": "2017-10-05T21:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/a_just_punishment_poster.jpg?itok=TRnujIqu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cc4b28c8ad06fb33a6be41e0b037196cae030135", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3WSuDySeJOxFNRLZLhqaIPLDFKaAOtXYHBZaHvt8BVBrjh0P8dl_RtVWfChgZNFzX_lNPZNWPi08", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "bgreenberg", "published": "2017-10-05T21:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Is My Mom Punishing Me Too Harshly?", "text": "Is My Mom Punishing Me Too Harshly? How to discuss punishments with your mother. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nDear Dr. G., \nI need your help badly. I'm in grade 11. Over the past two years, I feel like my mother and I are growing farther apart. She strives for me to do good in school and I'm trying but more and more it seems that she comes up with outlandish means of punishment /help. It started with the basics of taking my phone away on occasions to now taking my phone away for multiple hours so I can review and even when I tell her I have nothing to review, she'll still make me do it. Now she has faced me with a challenge that I cannot beat. She said to me that I must raise my grades in my classes from 68 percent to 80 percent in one month or I cannot do the play, which is after school. I personally think that her punishments are getting more and more unfair because she told me I'd have to find a job, but she let me do the play instead. So now my question is if I had a job instead of doing the play would she make me quit my job if my grades were low? I don't know what to think anymore or how to put it in words that I don't like all these issues without it getting turned around on me. So if you could please read and respond to this honestly, if you think it is fair or not because I want someone that is out of my family's opinion. \nThank you \nAn Upset Teen Boy \nDear Teen, \nI am very happy that you reached out to me. It is wonderful that you are concerned not only about the conflict that you are having with your mother but also about the quality of the relationship between the two of you. Ultimately, that is what is most important. You state that you feel that you and your mother have been growing apart. In my attempt to help you I will also be attempting to help you repair your relationship with your mother. \nI don't have much history information about your grades and school performance. I also am not aware of how much effort you are putting into your schoolwork. This would be helpful. Nonetheless, I am going to address this issue without a history of your school performance. I can tell that your mother is frustrated with your grades and is attempting to motivate you to get better grades. I am not sure why you are convinced that raising your grades from 68 percent to 80 percent is impossible. Is it hard for you to concentrate? Do you struggle with schoolwork? Is schoolwork not a priority? I will keep these questions in mind as I move forward with my responses. \nYour mother is using a punishment model to motivate you. I am more in favor of a motivational model where you earn rewards for accomplishments. I suggest that you sit down with your mother and set up a contract of expectations. This should focus on effort rather than grades. Perhaps you can earn more screen time if you spend 2 hours per day on your homework. The specifics of what you are expected to do and what you earn should be decided on by you and your mom in a collaborative manner. This will make you feel more empowered and less like you are being coerced into action by your mom. I hope that your mother agrees to this type of plan moving forward. It is especially important for your mom to be aware that rewards generally work better than punishment in terms of producing behavioral change . \nYour question about the play versus the job is very interesting. I don't know if your mother would tell you not to go to your job if you were not earning good grades. That is a good question to ask her. What is more important is that you work with your mother and try to meet the expectations of the contract so that you are able to continue to be in the play. Explain to your mom that the play, like a job, is an important commitment. In addition to setting up a contract of expectations with your mother I also suggest that you work on setting up a schedule for yourself so that you have balance in your life. This might require the input and help of a guidance counselor, your mother or even the school psychologist. I wish you luck as you move forward and onward. \nDr. G.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:00:32.550+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c29ae673f058af73d0ee3fdcdbfc01a26f590ede", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LPe2WXpFDyKUmdniiv1HldzTfcMLx2nFTwcd7GMMfWJzGZiCrV_8lfIQlgp4_YEmW9Rrg9J6tKhFPnO8I44KwOuqMb9qUupzmWSHlbWF41Y3kmCiQZ7i2j", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Aggression in Dogs: The Roles of Oxytocin and Vasopressin", "title_full": "Aggression in Dogs: The Roles of Oxytocin and Vasopressin", "published": "2017-10-05T22:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/preview16.jpg?itok=V6aJC8LI", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c29ae673f058af73d0ee3fdcdbfc01a26f590ede", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LPe2WXpFDyKUmdniiv1HldzTfcMLx2nFTwcd7GMMfWJzGZiCrV_8lfIQlgp4_YEmW9Rrg9J6tKhFPnO8I44KwOuqMb9qUupzmWSHlbWF41Y3kmCiQZ7i2j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "mbekoff", "published": "2017-10-05T22:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "Aggression in Dogs: The Roles of Oxytocin and Vasopressin", "text": "MORE \nA recent study on aggression in dogs by University of Arizona professor Evan MacLean and his colleagues called \" Endogenous Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Aggression in Domestic Dogs \" caught my eye because of my long-standing interest in the social behavior of dogs . Oxytocin is often referred to as the \" love \" hormone, although the case for the extremely close relationship between positive behavior and oxytocin is often overstated. In contrast to oxytocin, vasopressin , also referred to as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), has been linked to heightened aggression in humans, and now, for the first time, in dogs. \nIt might surprise people that we don't really know all that much about the hormonal bases of social behavior in dogs. To wit, as the researchers note, \"Aggressive behavior in dogs poses public health and animal welfare concerns, however the biological mechanisms regulating dog aggression are not well understood.\" In the United States alone there are around 4.5 million dogs bites each year, with about half involving children. The number of dog bites sustained by youngsters has been decreasing in the past decade. For more detailed multidisciplinary information on dog bites please see \" Dog Bites: Comprehensive Data and Interdisciplinary Analyses \". \nThe complete text of \"Endogenous Oxytocin, Vasopressin, and Aggression in Domestic Dogs\" is available for free online, and an excellent summary of this landmark study can be found in an essay by Carrie Arnold titled \" Why Are Some Dogs More Aggressive? \" Basically, Dr. MacLean and his colleagues began studying dogs who showed unprovoked aggression towards dogs and observed how they responded to non-aggressive dogs of the same sex , age, and breed. They measured levels of oxytocin and vasopressin before dogs were exposed to one another. When the dogs were walked by stuffed dogs, they displayed aggression. Ms. Arnold writes, \"the aggressive dogs growled, lunged, and barked more at the stuffed dogs than their non-aggressive counterparts. They also had significantly more vasopressin in their blood.\" \nWhat's very appealing about Dr. MacLean's study is that he and his colleagues also studied service dogs to learn how they behaved in the presence of a threatening unfamiliar human and unfamiliar dog. Overall, these dogs were calmer and showed more oxytocin present in their blood than non-service dogs. Ms. Arnold writes, \"Service dogs, bred for their placid temperament, have significantly higher levels of oxytocin in their blood than the average pooch. Those dogs that were more aggressive towards other dogs, however, had more vasopressin.\" \nTeasing Out Cause and Effect and Understanding Individual Dogs \nStudies such as this have are very interesting in their own right and also have important practical applications. For example, while it's not known if vasopressin causes or is the result of aggressive behavior, we now know something about the underlying bases for this behavior. When cause and effect are sorted out, this might lead to ways to control out-of-control and inappropriate aggression. And, while aggression seems to be much less common than affiliative or positive (prosocial) behaviors in dogs, it still is an adaptive response in certain situations and is clearly expressed in a wide variety of other diverse animals, including humans. \nIt's worth quoting the conclusion to the original research paper because the authors clearly present why their study is so important. They write, \nUltimately, dog aggression is a normal and adaptive social behavior, but expressed in the wrong contexts, or to an extreme extent, its consequences jeopardize the welfare of both humans and dogs in our society. It is likely that dog aggression can be motivated by diverse psychological states, including fear and anger . These emotional processes may be facilitated by, or produce effects on, OT and AVP signaling in the brain . Thus, it is important to consider dog aggression at multiple levels of analysis, addressing both the cognitive processes (e.g., appraisal, learning, inhibition), and underlying physiological mechanisms, which mediate these behaviors. The studies presented here suggest that OT and AVP may play important roles in these socioemotional processes, and set the stage for future work evaluating whether treatments and interventions for aggression can be improved by considering the roles of these neuropeptides. Ultimately, we hope that these investigations will lead to increased knowledge of the biology of social behavior, promote human and animal welfare, and help to preserve the unique and long-standing relationship between humans and dogs. \nPlease stay tuned for more research on all aspects of the social behavior of dogs and other animals. I look forward to research that can disentangle cause and effect in the relationship between hormone levels and aggression, the results of which will make life more pleasant for dogs for whom aggression is a normal response because of who they are as individuals. \nIt's essential to understand dogs as individuals because a dog's own personal experiences surely can play a significant role in how she/he responds to various situations, as can the way they've been trained. What appears to be inappropriate may be fully understandable when the individual dog's point of view is taken into account. \nAll in all, being able to extinguish aggression when it isn't an appropriate response would be a win-win for dogs and humans.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:00:33.710+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1f3411aee15f6534b31773f204f6cadf87d67eca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3VXUHLnVaGURGi_fo_lPIpeab6m0Fs.6x.KO6NVc_Carw.Hq4tQxkk2VqeJvpg5pGPIsppJhakhBxxWMwyYnWdkP7oR8oN4dAvPU6as25PrS", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "How Alienation Manifests in the Public Education System", "title_full": "How Alienation Manifests in the Public Education System", "published": "2017-10-05T22:21:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1f3411aee15f6534b31773f204f6cadf87d67eca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4KX09I_7lzy3VXUHLnVaGURGi_fo_lPIpeab6m0Fs.6x.KO6NVc_Carw.Hq4tQxkk2VqeJvpg5pGPIsppJhakhBxxWMwyYnWdkP7oR8oN4dAvPU6as25PrS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "dhenderson", "published": "2017-10-05T22:21:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Alienation Manifests in the Public Education System", "text": "How Alienation Manifests in the Public Education System Research examines dimensions of alienation in the lives of youth. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nOur identities influence the social groups to which we belong; for instance, an individual who self-identifies as Latino may be inclined to join others who share the same identity or life experiences. Identities can shape whether we belong to the out-group versus in-group. For example, the construction of racial identities aimed to organize people across the world in various groups such as Negroid, Mongoloid, and Caucasoid. Organizing groups of people into a social hierarchy of human beings aimed to promote the racial superiority of those considered Caucasoid and the racial inferiority of other groups\u2014creating an out-group versus in-group dynamic. Consequently, this influenced the organization of people and associated privileges in the United States, as well as places like South Africa, Brazil, etc. through political acts like Jim Crow , Apartheid , and Hispanization . \nThis grouping process and associated privileges are evident in numerous domains of our social life in the United States including the public education system. Consider how the racial composition of a school can influence: The number of teachers certified at the school. The number of AP courses offered at the school. The school's infrastructure and access to resources such as internet, smart technology, etc. The presence of a school resource officer (police officer) or not. The conditions of the school library, sport programs, etc. \nWe can argue that African American and Latino youth encounter cultural and social alienation when they enter the public education system (Christian, 2014; Nieto, 2000). Alienation reflects many aspects of their lived experience and can translate into thinking and feeling as if they do not belong and their complete physical removal from the school environment . Mau (1992) provides a multidimensional perspective of alienation: Powerlessness demonstrates a lack of control over a situation or one\u2019s inability to apply personal power to change a situation. A disproportionate number of African American and Latino students receive suspension for arbitrary offenses (e.g., excessive noise). In some cases, these students commit the same offense as their white peers but receive a more excessive and harsh punishment . More often, without an advocate, they must accept the suspension. Meaninglessness is an evaluation of whether content learned in school provides value or meaning to one\u2019s lived experience and future. The U.S. History curriculum rarely acknowledges the contributions of African American and Latino groups beyond slavery and the civil rights movement. World History usually centers on Europe without the acknowledgment of Indigenous people and people of African descent contributions to science, literature, etc. This curriculum \u201cerases\u201d or constructs an \u201cinvisible\u201d identity of the ancestors of African American and Latino students. Normlessness describes one\u2019s opposition or resistance to the cultural norms and expectations found in school. Public schools will perpetuate Whiteness as the normative culture, where this normative serves as a standard for behavior, language, and curriculum. Schools reflect social norms that are culturally alienating and do not value the cultural expression of racially diverse youth. Behaviors such as wearing a \u201cBlack Power\u201d t-shirt or locks in one\u2019s hair may be perceived as an oppositional act in school, but really rather serve as an expression of cultural resistance. Read the post on students suspended for their hair! Social estrangement is an affective and physical process. Accordingly, young people may display an emotional and physical disconnection from the school environment and are less likely to participate in school activities or other school-related gatherings. Numerous African American and Latino students are placed into remedial, special education programs, or English Language Learner programs that perpetuate basic and sub-par education. \nAlienation can have adverse effects on young people and lead to a sense of disconnectedness from school (Brown et al., 2003). Young people who do not see school as an inclusive space will start to withdraw and disengage from school activities. Moreover, students who feel alienated are also more likely to develop depressive symptoms (Seaton, 2009). \nWe must find ways to redesign our curriculum and school climate in ways that infuse the cultural experiences of young people. Teachers can work to promote an inclusive environment in schools by empowering racially diverse students inside the classroom and valuing their genius. We have to work with adults to recognize the genius in young people and validate it. Students who feel a sense of belonging and value the school environment are more likely to display a higher level of academic and social engagement (Thompson & Gregory, 2011). Decreasing alienation in school can serve as one avenue to decrease education inequity in the public education system. While this is one approach, serious changes need to occur in our policies and practices in the public education system. I am welcome to an open dialogue on those. \nIf you are interested in learning more about the history of race , refer to the book The Concept of Race (Montagu, 1964). \nThis post was in collaboration with Christen Edwards, a former Research Assistant in the Collective Health and Education Equity Research (CHEER) lab, and graduate student at the University of Virginia.

Posted Oct 05, 2017 \nHow do you respond when people offer a heartfelt compliment, a friendly favor, or words of appreciation? Do you receive it gracefully or feel awkward and uncomfortable? Source: Wikimedia Commons image by Kru Tony Moore \nOftentimes we don\u2019t avail ourselves of simple interpersonal pleasures that can improve the quality of our lives. We don't let people in. We let moments slip by\u2014ignoring the possibilities of a richer connection, even if brief. Paying attention to our language and how we feel when someone treats us kindly can help us feel less lonely and more connected. \nHere are common things we say that may hinder a gracious and gratifying flow of giving and receiving. \nNo Problem \nI frequently hear people say \u201cno problem\u201d when I thank them for something. As I discussed in a previous article , this term has established itself so firmly in our lexicon, especially with younger folks, that I\u2019m sure that many people will have a problem with my having a problem with it. \nAn acquaintance returns my call, and I say, \u201cI appreciate your calling me back so quickly.\u201d \nHe replies, \u201cNo problem.\u201d \nHow could I have a problem with such a harmless response? Well, it\u2019s not really a huge problem for me, so please keep it in perspective. I\u2019m happy that he returned my call so promptly. But the response, \u201cno problem,\u201d implies something. It makes me wonder if my call might be a problem for him. It sorta sounds like, \u201cI\u2019m a busy guy, but I can tolerate talking to you.\u201d \nCustomer service employees are often trained to avoid saying \u201cno problem\u201d for these very reasons. The words \u201cno\u201d and \u201cproblem\u201d don\u2019t evoke warm, fuzzy feelings. As customer service consultant Micah Solomon puts it: \n\u201cEven when \u2018no problem\u2019 is delivered cheerfully and authentically, it still carries baggage with it: Saying \u2018no problem\u2019 in response to a customer request implies that the customer \u2014 or what they\u2019re asking for \u2014 is a problem.\u201d \nWhen a friend or acquaintance returns our call promptly and we thank them, how much warmer would it feel if they said something like \u201cI\u2019m happy to call you back,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s good to hear from you,\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we spoke. Nice to hear your voice!\u201d \nThese small adjustments in our language may seem trivial, but they can create a warmer, more connected climate for our conversation\u2014assuming that we are indeed happy to hear from someone. I\u2019m not suggesting that we fake it or overstate it, but rather convey our actual felt experience. Sadly, we often don\u2019t reveal how much our friends mean to us. A slight tweaking of our language might nurture our relationships and deepen our friendships. \nIt Was Nothing \nWhen we thank someone for performing a kind act , we may dismiss it by saying \u201cIt was nothing\u201d or \u201cno big deal.\u201d Our intention may be to alleviate any guilt the person may feel for performing a favor. But by deflecting their appreciation, we may miss an opportunity to connect in a deeper way. \nRather than say, \u201cIt was nothing,\u201d we might enhance a warm, positive feeling if we simply say something like, \u201cYou are very welcome,\u201d \u201cI was happy to do that for you,\u201d or \u201cmy pleasure.\u201d It leaves me with a warmer, more connected feeling to sense that the person received my gratitude gracefully rather than minimized or dismissed it. If we can find the courage to allow ourselves to be a little more vulnerable by giving and receiving appreciation, we may be rewarded with warmer connections in our lives. \nIt can feel good to help someone. Notice how you feel when you perform a kind act for someone. Did it drag you down, lift your spirits, or was it neutral? Did you feel satisfaction in helping them? If the latter, how might it feel to convey that? \nThe National Science Foundation has reported that there is an unprecedented number of Americans who are lonely and isolated. Although there are many reasons for this, it may be useful to notice the subtle ways we push people away in our everyday interaction rather than invite them toward us. \nBy noticing the day-to-day opportunities to interact with people in more meaningful ways, we can take a small step toward creating more intimacy in our lives and communities.\u200b", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:00:40.130+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "444179097f56584a79195173f7c239a21d87cc69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JHD47pPmFCKntLSmxUW3zTsKH9O6ugsjxPA9K___ddZiEdX34pg4dAta745hnsXX8-", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Heavy Hearts", "title_full": "Heavy Hearts", "published": "2017-10-05T22:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_teaser_image/2017-10/2017-10-05-viets-1500px.jpg?itok=zTvkgSE0", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "444179097f56584a79195173f7c239a21d87cc69", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JHD47pPmFCKntLSmxUW3zTsKH9O6ugsjxPA9K___ddZiEdX34pg4dAta745hnsXX8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "aviets", "published": "2017-10-05T22:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Heavy Hearts", "text": "Source: Cathal Mac an Bheatha \n\u200b \nFriday morning in between sessions with clients a colleague called. A teenager at a high school nearby had committed suicide after arriving at school that morning. My heart sank. She informed me that the school had released all of the students for the day and that they\u2019d canceled the football game scheduled that evening. \nThe remainder of the day it looked as though it was business as usual for me. Meeting with clients, picking up my kids from school and ordering in pizza\u2014our Friday night ritual, yet, I couldn\u2019t shake the sadness of the seventeen-year-old girl who ended her life that morning. I carried her around with me wondering how we might have spared her from suffering so intensely. My thoughts drifted to the trauma for the teens entering the building that morning, worried they weren\u2019t fully prepared for a chemistry exam or frustrated about some drama amongst their peers, and then the unimaginable happens, and everyone is shuffled back onto buses and into worried parents \u2019 cars. The faculty, I imagine, remain to deal with the aftermath. Oh, but the family\u2014my heart drops further\u2014how do they go on when their sweet girl is no longer? \nStill asleep, my five-year-old rushed in on Saturday morning, \u201cMomma, it\u2019s a home day!\u201d Yes, today is a home day (i.e., a non-school day) and with the sun shining brightly through proclaimed black-out curtains I thought of the family who didn\u2019t have the gift of a very typical Saturday. \nI\u2019ve trained myself in times like these to send love to those hurting in my mind\u2019s eye and to bring myself back into the present moment\u2014the list I need to make for the grocery store, the laundry that must be started, and the endless errands I need to run. Present moment attention helps those of us highly sensitive creatures not to get caught so profoundly in a web of sadness. Dwelling on the news of another\u2019s tragedy is just as unhealthy as ignoring it altogether. \nSunday morning as I sit in a driveway, waiting\u2014as mothers endlessly do\u2014for my thirteen-year-old to gather his things from a sleepover I check Facebook . I\u2019ve barely begun the mindless scrolling and then the headline from my local newspaper takes my breath away, \u201cThree Murdered on Mass Street.\u201d \nInterrupted by my oldest, the one I\u2019m attempting to allow a little more freedom, he hops into the car with bedhead and big news, \u201cMom, last night was insane. Lil Yachty was seriously like five feet away from me.\u201d \nHe\u2019d gone to Late Night at Allen Fieldhouse the night before, the celebratory kick off for the University of Kansas\u2019s basketball season and they\u2019d brought in one of my son\u2019s favorite rappers to \u201chype everyone up.\u201d Later, while my son and his buds played X-Box until wee hours of the morning, three kids in their early twenties were murdered after leaving the bars in our sweet little college town. \nMy brain couldn\u2019t fathom the scene. Mass Street, the same street where we spend countless hours at quaint restaurants, shopping at locally owned stores, and hanging out at coffee shops while writing my first book was a crime scene only hours before. For years, I too wandered out of bars on that same street as a college kid, eager to make plans for the afterparty as I imagine they were also until shots were fired and the scattering ensued. The fear , terror and grief others experienced nagged at me. How could we have intervened? How could this happen? I spin out. I\u2019m missing the excitement of my son as he tells the story of his favorite basketball players. Present moment, I think. Be here. Right now. First, pause, send love to those hurting today. \nMonday morning I groggily make my way into the kitchen to pour the elixir into my favorite coffee cup. My husband, already busy packing lunches for the kids, nods at the tv, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to believe what\u2019s on CNN this morning.\u201d \nI walked into the living room where images of the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas, the same Las Vegas my dad said he and my step-mom are headed to this week, flashed on the screen. Blurred images of a stampede of people fleeing in the dark, beneath it the words scrolled across, \u201cDeadliest Mass Shooting in US History.\u201d At the time it was believed fifty were dead and over two hundred injured. \nHorrified and aware of the time I started the shower, woke up sleeping children and began the usual routine of getting ready for work and rushing kids off to school. I thought of my son\u2019s excitement to see a performer he loved on Saturday night. I imagined that same level of excitement of all the fans enjoying an outdoor concert of one of their favorite country musicians, and then, in what initially seemed like fireworks to enhance the performance, the utter terror of somehow comprehending the bullets pouring from the sky and penetrating innocent friends and family members without warning. How on earth can we live in a place where this happens? \nThe toll from the teen\u2019s suicide on Friday, the three college-age kids dead from a shooting just a short distance away while I slept, and the largest mass shooting in our country's history settled in. I felt myself shifting from sadness into fear. Without realizing it I unconsciously began creating a mental list of all the things we wouldn\u2019t do or would change in an effort to keep safe. \n1. No outdoor concerts. (I recall the outdoor concert I took my son and his friends to this Summer. The joy in their faces as their idols hit the stage). Nope, don\u2019t think about that. We won\u2019t be going anymore. Too unsafe. \n2. Do my kid\u2019s need to attend private schools so they don\u2019t witness a classmates suicide while in high school? That\u2019s absurd; I know the stats, suicide is rampant, the second leading cause of death among those ages 10-24, suicide doesn\u2019t care what school you attend. \nI shifted into a place of helplessness and hopelessness. I can\u2019t protect them, those I love most, from tragedy. I shift to Glennon Doyle, my favorite author saying, in a talk while I sat in the front row, \u201cWe are going to lose each other.\u201d She too, a yellow canary, a highly sensitive soul couldn\u2019t bear the pain of this life for many years, and she hid out in an eating disorder and substance dependence. She shared in her book, Carry On Warrior , that addiction was a safe place to numb out and protect herself. She recognized, as she sat with a positive pregnancy test, that such self-destructive behaviors had to end. Becoming a mother was her invitation to find a new way of being. She realized, as she sat in one hospital holding her newborn niece on the same day that in another hospital she said goodbye to her beloved grandmother that life is \u2018brutiful.\u201d Glennon encourages us to embrace both the beautiful and brutal parts of life. \u201cWe can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d \nResistance. \nMy brain fights against this notion as the death toll rises in Vegas. I recall a conversation, not so long ago when I learned of several untimely deaths of people around my age, with my therapist (yes, therapists have therapists!). Nearing forty I was bumping up against my mortality, and I wasn\u2019t too happy about it. At all. Not one part of it. I looked at her, the same way I remember looking at my mom when I was in labor for the first time, my eyes pleading, \u201cI can\u2019t do this. And PS: Why the hell didn\u2019t you tell me it was going to be this painful?\u201d \n\u201cYou know those documentaries about the inhumane treatment of animals?\u201d I say. \u201cI just keep thinking of us, much like all the cows that are crammed up against each other while being herded towards the slaughter area. I feel like we are the cows, all just crammed together waiting to die.\u201d (I know this is morbid and dark, but this is how it felt in the moment). \nShe looked at me, more reasonable, more comfortable with the truth, that yes, in fact, we all are going to die. \u201cWhat would it be like for you, instead of being trapped in terror, to look at those who are shoulder to shoulder with you and find some comfort that at least we are all in this together.\u201d? \nAh, yes. There\u2019s that. I felt some relief as I recalled my favorite quote, \u201cWe are all just walking each other home.\u201d Together. \nAlthough today is not an ordinary day for many who are suffering, I think the best any of us can do is be present to each other and our lives when we do have the extraordinary gift of a typical day. To extend ourselves to those who are most in need in whatever form that takes for you\u2014a donation of your time, a monetary contribution towards efforts to relieve those suffering in some small way, or simply sending healing energy to those in pain. \nAs I walked past my coffee table on Monday evening, weighted and worried, I saw the title of a book a dear friend sent me, Only Love Today . What would I do right now, this very second if I was only to give love today? My golden retriever, eager for my attention, was my answer. If I focused on love instead of fear I would turn off the news for awhile. Mosley and I took a long walk and as we tiredly made our way up the hill back home, I stopped as at least fifty geese flew by in their hallmark V-shaped formation. I felt a sense of wonder as it seemed the number of geese flying overhead would never end. They poured endlessly, effortlessly from the sky. I heard a little girl down the block excitedly saying, \u201cDaddy, daddy! Do you see all of the birds?\u201d \nWhen the last of them had passed Mosley and I found our way back home. My heart was softened. Only love today. Only. Love.

What we desire from this person is love that is healing, affirming, all-encompassing, unconditionally accepting, and empowering\u2014in short, salvation. Not only is this expectation unrealistic, it\u2019s unattainable. Still, the desire for love is so compelling that it frequently blinds us to truths that may conflict with these longings. \nWhen we feel ourselves to be incomplete or lacking a sense of wholeness, we often seek out others to fill our emptiness. We have a kind of internal radar that tells us when we encounter someone who seems to possess the capacity to restore us to wholeness. Generally, such a person embodies inner qualities, character traits, and ways of being that are similar to those of one or both of our parents or caregivers. \nThese similarities reawaken old longings and wounds that we had buried in the recesses of our unconscious mind, protecting us from the pain of these memories . While we may have forgotten the details of these experiences, our unconscious mind still reacts to similar types of people with feelings of both desire and fear . What makes this person attractive to us is that we see them as someone whose way of loving feels familiar. \nSuch a person often inflames the desire for redemptive love, the kind of love that can heal our hearts and souls, not just make our bodies feel good. It makes us feel \u201cright\u201d with ourselves and removes feelings of unworthiness, doubt, anxiety, and disease. It is the love that will take away our feeling of being different, inadequate, or shameful, love that will make us right with ourselves and with our world. \u201cThis time,\u201d we tell ourselves, \u201cthis person will love me in the way I really want and need to be loved, and their love will remove the pain and suffering from my life.\" \nThis then is the redemptive longing; the hope of being saved once and for all from the suffering inherent in a life in which we feel ourselves to be unworthy of real love, which is by nature , unconditional. All too often, relationships that begin with dreams of divine bliss deteriorate into the hell of unrelenting frustration, bitterness, and unfulfilled longing. The person whom we had hoped would keep us from suffering becomes the source of excruciating emotional pain. \nHow someone whom we see as a gift from heaven in one moment can only a brief time later seem to be a curse sent from hell, is one of the great mysteries of relationships. Yet as we come to understand more about the real nature of what draws men and women together and what these unions bring out from within ourselves, the mystery disappears, as do many of the well-meaning, but agonizingly ineffective methods we employ to free ourselves of our pain. \nIt is not our disillusioned hopes that bring great suffering to relationships. These difficulties bring only \u201cordinary suffering,\u201d which though unpleasant, is tolerable and often even productive, in that it can lead to deeper levels of trust, understanding , and intimacy. This kind of pain is inevitable and not inherently damaging, as long as we are able to deal with it appropriately. When we ignore it, like a neglected wound, or a mistreated ailment, what was once a minor disturbance, soon deteriorates into a life-threatening condition. \nWhen these experiences recur, the well-being of the relationship is threatened. The anxiety and discomfort related to that threat trigger \u201csurvival responses\u201d that are embedded in our behaviors characterized by defensive and controlling patterns. In a flash, we may find ourselves locked in a battle of wills fighting for our emotional lives, each reaction inflaming a stronger, more heated counter-reaction. This can be like pouring gasoline on a fire. Unless we can put the fire out and neutralize its source, we will be condemned to replay this pattern with this and/or other partners ad infinitum. \nWe can put out the fire at its source by coming to terms with the fears, longings, and unspoken grief within us that continue to reactivate the burning emotional embers. It is based on the premise that the tendency to compromise ourselves in order to gain love and acceptance is widespread, nearly universal and is the source of much of the distress that we often mistakenly attribute to others. Looking for wholeness and security through another is like seeking relief of a toothache from a painkiller. There's nothing wrong with doing it and it will temporarily remove your pain. It is not an effective long-term solution, since it doesn't get to the source of the problem. \nWhen we use relationships to remove the pain of our inner fragmentation, we are establishing an addictive pattern that will ultimately intensify the problem that we are seeking to alleviate. Like an addict who needs ever-increasing amounts of drugs to \"do the job\", our growing dependence upon others inevitably leads to increased suffering. \nIf the source of the problem has to do with our unwillingness to honestly face ourselves, the solution involves our ability to re-member (literally, to put back together again) our essential selves and claim all of the parts that comprise the fullness of our being. This requires a willingness to accept all that we are, not simply those qualities of which we feel proud, but those aspects of ourselves that are not so pleasing, about which we feel shame . \nTo do so is to express ourselves with authenticity and integrity. This doesn\u2019t mean that we need to reveal our deepest darkest secrets to the world, but that we honestly acknowledge these and other truths to ourselves. In so doing, those aspects of our personality that we have tried to conceal gradually become exposed to our awareness, moving from the dark of the shadow into the light of recognition. This process of gradual illumination both to ourselves as well as to others is the essence of the work that over time will set us free. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:01:14.150+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "685eccf96772d85b2b0817f9c9170979a43f33a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JXtQVAJ85gIVA760tz_PRtY21St2sLxfPSapPUQHTbkx5ot7LYO4aQEhpf6uGMjTe8kIH2SJd5Ig--", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "When \"Never Mind\" Is an Insult", "title_full": "When \"Never Mind\" Is an Insult", "published": "2017-10-06T00:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_images/2017-09/pexels-photo-432655.jpeg?itok=iVFLBuXl", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "685eccf96772d85b2b0817f9c9170979a43f33a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4JXtQVAJ85gIVA760tz_PRtY21St2sLxfPSapPUQHTbkx5ot7LYO4aQEhpf6uGMjTe8kIH2SJd5Ig--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "seberts", "published": "2017-10-06T00:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "When \"Never Mind\" Is an Insult", "text": "When \"Never Mind\" Is an Insult Don't say this to someone with hearing loss. Just don't. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nIt happens sometimes. A friend or colleague is telling me a funny story or explaining an event that happened, and at some point I will ask, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d I got the beginning, but somewhere along the way I missed something and needed clarification of the last point. The speaker pauses, as if to think about the question, and replies, \u201cNever mind.\u201d Usually, this is accompanied by a dismissive wave of the hand or shake of the head or both. I hate that, don\u2019t you? Source: Pexels \nNever mind is a dismissal\u2014an insult. It says that the listener is not important enough to the speaker to repeat what was said. This also applies to \u201cforget it,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s not important,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it.\u201d If I hear that from somebody enough times, I don\u2019t bother to interact with them any longer. It\u2019s not worth my time. I essentially say \u201cnever mind\u201d to them\u2014just not out loud! \nMaybe I am being too sensitive. Sometimes the story is probably not important enough to repeat or there is not time to go through it again now. Even so, it still bothers me and it probably bothers others with hearing loss too. \nMore concerning is that this type of dismissal may lead to social withdrawal for people if it happens enough. \u201cWhy bother to interact with others if I am only to be scorned for not hearing everything perfectly,\u201d some might think. It becomes easier not to try, then to face the dismissal and shame . Thus begins a downward spiral. \nSo, how can we better handle this type of situation and nip bad feelings in the bud? I have two suggestions for the speaker, but more importantly, one very effective tool for the listener. \nFor the Speaker: If someone doesn\u2019t hear you, rephrase the last thing you said. It really does not take that long. If there isn\u2019t time to do that now, say something like, \u201cI want to finish telling you the story, but there isn\u2019t time right now. Remind me after the meeting and I will tell you.\u201d This is much more respectful than \u201cNever mind.\u201d \nFor the Listener: If someone tells you \u201cNever mind,\u201d you should calmly reply, \u201cPlease, I really would like to hear what you have to say. Do you mind trying once more?\u201d It is hard to say no to that, plus your assertiveness makes it clear that you will not take dismissal as an appropriate response.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:37:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8f52379bcac0edf88a5e31e71e4892521406b41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LESJFxFMBdTiuYeypMcPGf31Qp5etE4vByq8n7TuThT0SazjdBPIZqgP9Hg28wuhBQLlxdSjhjgF0HvgmvnllU", "site_full": "www.psychologytoday.com", "site": "psychologytoday.com", "site_section": "https://www.psychologytoday.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["health", "psychology_psychiatry", "incest_abuse_support"], "section_title": "Psychology Today", "title": "Having Anxiety About Having Anxiety", "title_full": "Having Anxiety About Having Anxiety", "published": "2017-10-06T00:03:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/field_blog_entry_images/2017-10/img_4030.png?itok=FKNLVHw2", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2192, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8f52379bcac0edf88a5e31e71e4892521406b41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVjqaUi.V6TbzslJvBvoG7my_4WzO8o4LESJFxFMBdTiuYeypMcPGf31Qp5etE4vByq8n7TuThT0SazjdBPIZqgP9Hg28wuhBQLlxdSjhjgF0HvgmvnllU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "sfader", "published": "2017-10-06T00:03:00.000+03:00", "title": "Having Anxiety About Having Anxiety", "text": "Having Anxiety About Having Anxiety How to cope when you're anxious about feeling anxious Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nAs if it wasn't enough to live with chronic anxiety, there are times when I have anxiety about having anxiety. When is the next moment I am going to feel anxious? \nYou feel anxious about the next time you're going to feel anxious and consequently, you are waiting for the other anxious shoe to drop. You're already wearing one shoe and once you find the other shoe you'll be doubly anxious. \nIt doesn't seem fair to me that this is something I deal with. However, I know I'm not alone. I reached out to my anxious community and found out that there are others who experience this phenomenon. \nWhat does this mean? Well, if you've had a panic attack it is a terrifying experience. Having anxiety about having another panic attack is a perfect example of having anxiety about having anxiety. You are worrying about the possibility of a panic attack happening again in your life. \nA common scenario is this: you've dealt with chronic anxiety in the past and lately you've been feeling relatively calm and stable. Then the worrying thoughts start to creep in: what if this ends? What if something terrible happens and I need to start worrying about that thing? The anxious thoughts are about something that hasn't happened and you have no proof that it will happen. \nContinually worrying about anxiety can put a strain on romantic relationships . Your partner might not understand why you are so anxious and try to help but not know what tools to use to be supportive to you. This in turn might cause you more anxiety. You might be afraid that your partner will abandon you because of your anxiety. That's when it is important to trust that if your partner truly loves and understands you, they will stay with you despite you having anxiety. Have confidence in your connection and try to let go of the control you're feeling to keep this relationship together. \nFeeling like you have to control things is another manifestation of anxiety. The worst part about anxiety is the lack of control you have. Not having control and being aware of your lack of control feeds anxiety a seven course meal. You only have control over your reactions to anxiety and your anxious thoughts. \nAs I am writing this I am anxious that I am going to become more anxious thinking about anxiety. But I am telling myself that I do not have control over what my feelings are but rather how I cope with them. \nThat is a huge thing with regard to anxiety. The harder you try to control anxiety, the stronger it comes back to haunt you. Because it is anxiety it is well-versed in how to frighten you. If you know that about anxiety then it is a little bit easier to manage it because you know what it's trying to do. \nIf you're anxious and reading this, that's how you feel right now. It will change because anxiety (no matter how hard it tries to convince you) does not last forever.

Put Yourself Back on the List Here's how to put what you need on the list and do it as soon as you can. Posted Oct 05, 2017 \n\u201cI know one thing for sure. It is impossible to find one\u2019s own balance from the outside in. I now know beyond a doubt that finding\u2014and maintaining\u2014our balance is an inside job.\u201d \u2013 Lu Hanessian Source: iStock/Used with Permission \nWhen you're at home with your family, you have a running list. Change the baby, feed the toddler, teach the preschooler to pick up her toys, get the elementary schooler to do his homework, help the tween braid her hair, negotiate with the teen, make dinner, fold laundry, pay the bills, email your boss, connect with your partner... the list never stops. But have you fallen off your own list? \nThe only way to keep your cup full in the constant vortex of parenting is to tend to yourself, even while you tend to your child. Throughout your day, can you make it a priority to check in with yourself? \nOften, we\u2019re surprised to realize that we deny our desires automatically, without even noticing it. Maybe we\u2019d love a cup of tea while we help our child with that project but, \u201cit\u2019s too much trouble.\u201d Maybe we really need a hug or a good cry. Maybe we\u2019re tempted to pick up a crayon and enjoy expressing our creativity while our child is coloring, but we\u2019d feel silly. Or maybe we simply need a quick visit to the bathroom, but we routinely wait until we absolutely can\u2019t delay any longer. \nStarting today, put what you need on the list and do it as soon as you can. Yes, it is possible. Here's how: \n1. Today, at the same time that you\u2019re taking care of your child, check in with yourself. \nNotice what you need. Is there anything you can give yourself right now that would help you stay in balance? Sure, you need to tend to your child. But tend to yourself at the same time, or as soon as possible. At each moment there is some small thing that would nurture you physically, emotionally, mentally or spiritually. Find it and give it to yourself. \nIf there's something you really need that you aren't getting, like sleep , make a plan. Let's say your infant wakes up all night and you have a toddler to tend to during the day. It's not doing your toddler any good for you to drag yourself through your life feeling resentful. You don't need to be a martyr. Figure out a way to get the help you need, even just a step in the right direction. That will give you the momentum to take another step. \n2. Make it a habit to tune into yourself as often as possible throughout your day. \nSimply being present with yourself is an essential form of \"attention\" that we all need. If you work outside the home, this is usually easier to do in the course of the day, but most of us don't do it. We get hooked on the adrenaline of rushing. But you'll be better at your job if you get into the habit of being more present. And if you're home with children, it's essential. When we're distracted, children act out to get us to come back into the moment to connect with them. When we're more present, they respond by wanting to \"follow\" us. \nHow to become more present? Just take a deep breath and let it flood your body with well-being. Breathe in calm, breathe out stress . Shift out of your thinking and into your senses: Notice the light on the leaves, the smell of the rain, the curve of your child's cheek, the lilt of her laugh . Breathing and noticing beauty are two reliable doorways to presence. \n3. Before you pick up your child at daycare or walk into the house, stop. \nTake a deep breath and ask yourself \u201cWhat do you need right now, My Love?\u201d Listen to whatever answer pops up. Make a deal with yourself about when you can meet that need, and how you will do it. For instance, if the answer you hear is \u201cComfort\u201d you\u2019ll want to find a way to work some snuggle time with your child and/or your spouse into your evening. If the answer is \u201cA break!\u201d you may want to order pizza for dinner and put everyone to bed early so you can take a long bath. \nOf course, if you get the same answer every day, you may need to make some structural changes in your life. \n4. Slow down and show up. Often we're so focused on the list that we forget to really live. But this is the only chance you get in this body, and your child really will be grown in the blink of an eye. If you're too busy to revel in your child's natural joy, you're turning up your nose at the fuel that keeps you going as a parent. What happened to that joyful, exuberant person inside you? He or she is your antidote to burnout . Yes, your family and household will demand every moment you have. But many of those moments are full of joy if you choose to simply enjoy them, and let the pressure go for a bit. Your life doesn't have to be perfect for you to soak in every moment of goodness you can. \n5. Parent yourself. Whose job is it to nurture you? Yours. Spouses, partners, friends, and families are companions on the journey, but we can only take in from them what we're able to give to ourselves. If you weren't nurtured enough as a little one, this may take some learning. Start by talking to yourself like someone you love. Nurture yourself through the hard times. Acknowledge just how hard it all is, and how hard you try. You don't need to be perfect. You are more than enough, exactly as you are. You deserve all the tenderness you would shower on a newborn baby. \nGiving that love to ourselves transforms our parenting\u2014and our lives. OK, so when the baby's crying and you yourself need a good cry, it's true that the baby comes first.

When we act on something we value, we might have to sacrifice something else. Posted Oct 05, 2017 MORE \nThere\u2019s a Jewish joke that I heard a lot while growing up: A mother gives her son two neckties for his birthday. He thanks her for them, tells her that he loves them both, that she has terrific taste, and so on, and they have a nice birthday dinner together. The next morning, he comes down to the kitchen wearing one of the ties. The mother glances up from preparing breakfast, then frowns and asks him: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, you didn\u2019t like the other tie?\u201d Source: Lisa Tessman \nJust as we can\u2019t wear all of our ties at once, we also can\u2019t necessarily enact all of our values at once. We are in the often distressing position of choosing against many of the things that we value or care about, for we hold a plurality of values, and our plural values tend to conflict with one another\u2014forcing us to choose. In choosing or prioritizing one, we reject another. \nThis might seem obvious\u2014after all, what is supposed to make the joke funny is that the Jewish mother appears not to take this fact into account. But I actually very much sympathize with the Jewish mother (or, perhaps, I am that mother); maybe it\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t realize her son can\u2019t wear both ties at once, it\u2019s that she doesn\u2019t want to sacrifice something that matters to her (in this case, her son\u2019s appreciative wearing of tie number two) just because it conflicts with something else (his wearing of tie number one). When we shift from talking about neckties to talking about values, we can consider how conflict complicates our lives and, in particular, our moral lives. Not only are our values in general plural and often conflicting, even our specifically moral values are plural and often conflicting. It may be that we should accept not wearing all of our ties at once, but we shouldn\u2019t easily accept being unable to actualize all of our moral values at once. \nConsider an example that Jean-Paul Sartre gives of a conflict of values, which he characterizes as an ethical conflict: I shall cite the case of one of my students who came to see me under the following circumstances: His father was on bad terms with his mother and, moreover, was inclined to be a collaborationist; his older brother had been killed in the German offensive of 1940 and the young man, with somewhat immature but generous feelings, wanted to avenge him. His mother lived alone with him, very much upset by the half-treason of her husband and the death of her older son; the boy was her only consolation\u2026The boy was faced with the choice of leaving for England and joining the Free French Forces\u2014that is, leaving his mother behind\u2014or remaining with his mother and helping her to carry on. He was fully aware that the woman lived only for him and that his going-off\u2014and perhaps his death\u2014would plunge her into despair\u2026 \u2026 he was faced with two very different kinds of actions: One, concrete, immediate, but concerning only one individual; the other concerned an incomparably vaster group, a national collectivity, but for that very reason was dubious, and might be interrupted en route. And, at the same time, he was wavering between two kinds of ethics . On the one hand, an ethics of sympathy, of personal devotion; on the other, a broader ethics, but one whose efficacy was more dubious. He had to choose between the two. (1965, 42-43) \nAt least some of our moral values\u2014unlike the ties that we choose to wear\u2014may have associated requirements. I don\u2019t just value respecting other people, I\u2019m morally required to respect them; I don\u2019t just care about preserving other people\u2019s lives, I\u2019m morally required to do so; I don\u2019t just value helping people in need, I\u2019m morally required to help; I don\u2019t just care about fairness and honesty, I\u2019m morally required to act fairly and honestly. \nSartre\u2019s student had to choose between two actions, and he judged, separately of each of them, that it was required of him. But he could not choose them both. \nWhen we choose against a moral value that has an associated requirement\u2014that is, when we don\u2019t do something that we\u2019re morally required to do, because we choose in favor of a conflicting value, whether that other value is moral or nonmoral\u2014there really is an accusation embedded in the question of whether we \u201cdidn\u2019t like the other tie\u201d\u2014the accusation of having violated a moral requirement.
