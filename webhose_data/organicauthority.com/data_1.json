It should account for about $700 million in the first year, as Amazon is expected to see roughly $4.3 billion in sales this year from its private label product family (including the Echo and AmazonBasics). \n\u201cWhole Foods\u2019 reputation for quality puts it in a unique position to tackle online grocery,\u201d reports Business Insider. \u201cConsumers\u2019 main issue with online grocery is the inability to see and choose their own products, and many grocers have struggled to overcome this hurdle. Whole Foods, however, is known for its high-quality products and stringent standards, meaning consumers may be more confident purchasing the company\u2019s offerings online. In fact, over the past month, Amazon successfully sold snacks, candy, frozen produce, turkey breast, and beverages from Whole Foods, showing that shoppers will buy a variety of products from the grocer sight unseen. That could indicate the organic-focused company is well poised to see greater success online than its competitors.\u201d \nAmazon is reportedly more focused on increasing its online sales of Whole Foods private label products instead of increasing foot traffic, which was four percent below average last month for the chain\u2019s 400+ locations in the U.S. \nEfforts to maximize store space for items including other Amazon products could also mean a decreased presence of local or small-scale producers in Whole Foods Market locations, a move that many criticize as stripping the chain of its character and community focus. \n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that such changes could alter the core Whole Foods experience, so Amazon will have to take care to ensure its adjustments do not alienate shoppers, or erode the company\u2019s key differentiator \u2014 its quality,\u201d Business Insider notes. \u201cThis will be critical as the online retailer takes aim at the online and retail grocery markets, which are projected to be worth as much as $100 billion and $400 billion, respectively, by 2025.\u201d \nThe traditional supermarket is seeing a decline in sales and decreases in overall foot traffic. According to Business Insider, close to 9,000 retail food stores could close this year \u2013 a number twice as much as the closures of the previous two years combined. At the same time, Amazon boasts 53 percent of online sales growth in the U.S. last year. \nIt\u2019s a sign Business Insider says points to the rise of omnichannel fulfillment methods \u201cthat leverage their store locations and in-store inventory in order to better compete in e-commerce.\u201d Programs like Instacart and other direct-from-store purchases, as well as click-and-collect options allow shoppers to decrease their time spent in-store as well as save money on select purchases. \n\u201cHowever, few retailers have mastered these new fulfillment services,\u201d Business Insider notes. \u201cWhile these companies have spent years optimizing their supply chain and logistics networks for delivering goods to their stores or directly to customers\u2019 doorsteps, most have yet to figure out how to profitably bring their store locations into the e-commerce delivery process.\u201d Find Jill on Twitter and Instagram Related on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marke", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amazon exceed forecast share on facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "instacart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon fresh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram related on organic authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:05:08.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2105821c1059509608731247e42f0d657f40357d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmXzTJ47e10VBtQO70UHdbqIc4rGJFUEXGx24c2e38zeIxressXMGw55LI.WW7tnLn8Da_tH6zInYwSIvQlTmUm", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "How to Have a Chia Seed Pudding and a Smoothie at the Same Time", "title_full": "How to Have a Chia Seed Pudding and a Smoothie at the Same Time", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_4685.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2105821c1059509608731247e42f0d657f40357d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmXzTJ47e10VBtQO70UHdbqIc4rGJFUEXGx24c2e38zeIxressXMGw55LI.WW7tnLn8Da_tH6zInYwSIvQlTmUm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Have a Chia Seed Pudding and a Smoothie at the Same Time", "text": "Share on Facebook \nHealthy girl problems: having to decide between chia seed pudding and a berry smoothie for breakfast. \nWell. we\u2019ve got good news and the healthiest hack ever: combine the two and never compromise on your breakfast again! \nLayering a seasonal berry smoothie between sweet chia seed pudding is not only Instagram -worthy, but a nutritious way to reap body-loving benefits. Along with providing fiber for days, (11 grams per ounce, which provides 42 percent of your daily-recommended intake) chia seeds are one of the easiest ways to incorporate more whole foods into your diet. \nBecause of their extreme versatility in the kitchen, they can be used to thicken up a variety of dishes including oatmeal and overnight oats, soups and sauces, fresca drinks, and of course, used to give oomph to chia seed pudding. Chia Seed Pudding Health Benefits \nIf you are new to the world of chia seed pudding and a bit weary of where to start, fret not \u2013 chia seed pudding takes mere seconds to throw together and is nearly foolproof. All you\u2019ll need is a milk of choice along with an optional sweetener for extra flavor and a few tablespoons of chia seeds. Due to the high amount of fiber found in the little seeds, chia can absorb up to twelve times their weight in liquid, which helps to create a gel-like pudding. \nChia seeds also pack in omega-3 fatty acids along with omega-6s. Omega-3s aid in cell growth and blood clotting, while omega-6s help to reduce bad LDL cholesterol. \nAlong with an easy-as-pie chia seed pudding, this recipe also takes advantage of seasonal berries to whip up a creamy dreamy smoothie. Feel free to get creative with the berries you use; swapping out berries that are available in your area, such as blueberries, blackberries, or boysenberries.

The \u201cSuits\u201d star, who is currently dating Britain\u2019s Prince Harry, has had her life transform from mid-level celebrity to full-blown global superstar in just over a year. \nThroughout all the jet-setting (she\u2019s based in Toronto and flies frequently to London) and public appearances, she still remains the picture of beauty with an enviable figure and glow (her recent stunning Vanity Fair cover is solid proof of that). \nSurprisingly, Markle\u2019s health and fitness tips, which she recently shared with Women\u2019s Health, are simple and easy to do \u2014 even for us mere mortals who don\u2019t have a crown in our future. Here\u2019s how Markle stays sane, fit, and gorgeous despite all eyes (especially the Queen\u2019s) on her. 1. She Finds Motivation in Her Health \n\u201cMy health, my state of mind, the feeling you have after a workout; all of this things drive me to step onto my mat or go to the gym,\u201d she revealed to the magazine. \u201cSometimes the idea of working out sounds absolutely dreadful, but I always remind myself of how good it will feel afterward. Euphoric, almost!\u201d \nWhen it comes to finding your motivation to hit the gym, sometimes all it takes is a shift in your perspective. It is almost impossible to stay committed to anything without figuring out why you\u2019re doing it. Like Markle, find out your \u201cwhy\u201d by determining what fitness and health means to you, and how it will make you feel. 2. She Makes Time to Meditate \nMarkle values giving herself the time to get out of her own head. For her, that means going for a run, which she calls her \u201cmoving meditation.\u201d Meditation , whether you do it on the pavement or a pillow, has been proven to manage stress, increase self-awareness, and reduce negative emotions, including anxiety and depression. 3. She Hits the Gym With Friends \n\u201cI\u2019m eager to come to the UK to do a workout with Russell [Bateman], the founder of SBC . My friend Millie Macintosh raves about his workouts, so I\u2019ll call her up to do a class together next time I\u2019m back in London.\u201d The benefits of having a workout buddy are numerous, including helping with accountability and motivation, while also making working out fun (yes, it\u2019s possible). 4. She Loves Yoga \nYoga probably comes a lot more naturally to the actress, thanks to growing up with a yogi mother. \u201cMy mom was a yoga instructor so that practice is in my blood,\u201d she says. \u201cI love an intense vinyasa class \u2013 and even better if its blasting hip-hop and done in a dark room with candlelight. The best!\u201d \nVinyasa yoga is an intense form of exercise that works both the body and the mind. The practice branches out from hatha yoga, with the postures flowing with the breath, and when done at a faster pace, it becomes power yoga. Benefits include improved strength, flexibility and stress relief. 5. She\u2019s All About Self-Care \nSelf-care is not just a popular Instagram hashtag; it\u2019s a legitimate way to help nourish our mind, body and soul, which Markle seems to appreciate. \n\u201cI give myself the luxury of downtime. We are all so incredibly busy and juggling so many things but I always take an hour to just decompress, watch mindless TV, snuggle with my dogs and enjoy a glass of wine. That\u2019s all part of the investment. It\u2019s a balance.\u201d \nWhether it\u2019s taking a moment with a cup of tea and a good book, or taking time with your fur (or human) baby, self-care helps us stay emotionally and physically healthy in order to avoid burnout. It is only when we are able to first help ourselves when we are able to help those around us. \nUltimately, when it comes to living like an almost-royal, you need nothing too fancy. A focus on self-care and some mean mojo can help you live your best life \u2014 with or without a prince. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meghan markle", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "millie macintosh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "markle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell [bateman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "simple health", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vanity fair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "women\u2019s health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "meghan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:05:09.015+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c18b1ec48b7e8822622053dfc9b4a1afa7219f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnY3rv9lE18gOEFr9dk0Ev8Q_o3J50EGXZhVvqnBQpfusxwrnhkoC8t5hwGa3BBbi7v9F_HbtNpzHP2HazkX9t5", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Cozy Dinner Alert: Sweet Potato Pasta with Garlic Tahini Sauce", "title_full": "Cozy Dinner Alert: Sweet Potato Pasta with Garlic Tahini Sauce", "published": "2017-10-04T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_3163.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c18b1ec48b7e8822622053dfc9b4a1afa7219f32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnY3rv9lE18gOEFr9dk0Ev8Q_o3J50EGXZhVvqnBQpfusxwrnhkoC8t5hwGa3BBbi7v9F_HbtNpzHP2HazkX9t5", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-04T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Cozy Dinner Alert: Sweet Potato Pasta with Garlic Tahini Sauce", "text": "Have an extra cozy and autumn-inspired pasta night with this simple sweet potato pasta with creamy garlic tahini sauce.

The chemical was deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organization in 2015. \nIn response to worries from French farmers regarding the repercussions of an outright ban on glyphosate, Philippe called for farm and environment ministries to propose a plan to phase the chemical out slowly, likely within the next five to seven years, according to French Agriculture Minister St\u00e9phane Travert. \nFrench farmers reacted positively to this statement, with Christiane Lambert, head of France\u2019s largest farm union, FNSEA, telling Reuters that it indicated the government was \u201cstarting to understand that a full ban would be impossible to apply in France.\u201d \n\u201cThis is already an easing in position,\u201d she said. \nA source inside France\u2019s Ministry of Environment told Reuters last month that France would be voting against the renewal of the chemical\u2019s European license. \nAbout 300 French farmers took to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es in protest of an outright ban Friday. The FNSEA claimed that given that there was no current alternative to the herbicide, a total ban placed French farmers at a severe disadvantage within Europe and around the world. \nThe European Commission proposed an 18-month extension of the license for glyphosate at the end of June after a March study released by the European Chemical Agency claimed that glyphosate should not be classified as a cancer-causing substance. A forthcoming vote to either renew glyphosate\u2019s license for the next ten years or ban it outright was originally expected on October 5 or 6, though it has been postponed for at least a month, a Commission source told Reuters. \nIf the license is not renewed before the end of the year, an automatic ban will kick in on January 1, 2018. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "philippe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st\u00e9phane travert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christiane lambert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edouard philippe", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european chemical agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fnsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monsanto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ministry of environment", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "champs-elys\u00e9es", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:01:44.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d2c01a6c68cf6ca373cadffa083fcac979b8ce3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhk1C87JeMFfUpieeF2gOZ558zhEvHDbz4AUFB5UozJta9fVe0Hl_2aAW1LawJPrvLT2swJD.lqaWw--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Holistic Sex Coach Kim Anami\u2019s \u20185 Laws of Orgasms\u2019", "title_full": "Holistic Sex Coach Kim Anami\u2019s \u20185 Laws of Orgasms\u2019", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-27-at-12.51.59-PM.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d2c01a6c68cf6ca373cadffa083fcac979b8ce3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhk1C87JeMFfUpieeF2gOZ558zhEvHDbz4AUFB5UozJta9fVe0Hl_2aAW1LawJPrvLT2swJD.lqaWw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Ban", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Holistic Sex Coach Kim Anami\u2019s \u20185 Laws of Orgasms\u2019", "text": "Holistic Sex Coach Kim Anami\u2019s \u20185 Laws of Orgasms\u2019 October 4, 2017 Share on Facebook Image via Kim Anami \nKim Anami, holistic sex and relationship coach, is best known for her mind-boggling ability to lift objects\u2014surfboards and chandeliers are two\u2014with her vagina. (She inserts a jade egg, which is fastened to a string attached to the item of choice.) But she doesn\u2019t do it for the shock factor, though it certainly inspires some jaw dropping. Anami, who\u2019s online school offers salons such as Vaginal Kung Fu, Sexual Mastery for Men, and Coming Together for Couples, doesn\u2019t think her vaginal prowess should be inconceivable. In fact, all women can lift with their vagina and maintain a sky-high libido and achieve multiple, g-spot-sourced orgasms. Every. Single. Day. We got the scoop on Anami\u2019s does what many consider the impossible (along with her famed 5 Laws of Orgasms). \nOrganic Authority: You live by your 5 Laws of Orgasms. Let\u2019s talk about each. First is: \u201cEvery woman, every orgasm.\u201d What do you mean by this? \nKim Anami : Every woman is capable of having every type of orgasm: clitoral, G-Spot, cervical, ejaculatory. I guarantee it. \nOA: Second rule: \u201cOne is never enough.\u201d This probably sounds daunting for a lot of women considering many don\u2019t\u2019 even have one period. Why are multiple orgasms so important? \nKA : The more the merrier. Prior to contrary belief women are naturally insatiable and multi-orgasmic creatures. Orgasms are powerful mechanisms of release and self-actualization for women. They ought to be part of every woman\u2019s personal growth regime. Image via Kim Anami \nOA: What are some first steps you can take to reach multiple orgasms? \nKA : Breathing deeply throughout arousal and orgasm. Knowing that you can have several and they are good for you. \nOA: The third rule is \u201cAn orgasm a day.\u201d What changes can you see when you prioritize daily orgasms? \nKA : Daily pleasure lubricates your life. When you are connected to your sexuality and own it, you are more powerful in life, love, and career. \nOA: Fourth rule: \u201cGo deep.\u201d Deep in what way? \nKA : \u201cGo deep\u201d means go deep into the vagina. The most pleasurable and life-changing orgasms\u2014G-spot and cervical\u2014are in the vagina. \nGourmet sex combines emotional openness with sexual abandon. \nOA: And lastly, the fifth rule: Let it go. What do you think are the main obstacles to allowing yourself to surrender? What can we do to start letting go? \nKA : Opening up emotionally and letting down one\u2019s guard is an ongoing practice even in healthy relationships. It\u2019s important to do the inner work both as a individual and with your partner, to create an open, honest, and trusting space, where you feel safe to show up and be vulnerable. \nMany things can prevent this, like old defense mechanisms or wounds from previous relationships or your family of origin. Or just not knowing what it even looks or feels like to live from a place of open-heartedness. This is the work I do\u2014showing people what is possible and helping them to get there. Image via Kim Anami \nOA: You talk about gourmet sex vs. junk food sex. What an analogy: eating fresh, healthy, high-quality food every day will keep your body strong and happy, while going to Burger King everyday will leave you lifeless and heavy. \nKA : Gourmet sex combines emotional openness with sexual abandon. Like a gourmet meal, it is a multi-layered experience. The meal that enriches you feeds you on every level: mental, emotional, physical, and spiritual. \nInstead of trying to force sex at the end of the night, when most people are exhausted, give yourself a huge neurotransmitter and hormonal boost first thing in the morning. \nOA: Speaking of \u2014 is there a food or habit you\u2019ve decided to remove from your life entirely? \nKA : Alcohol, drugs, smoking, sugar, gluten, GMO, and non-organic food. I don\u2019t touch any of them. I\u2019m more in tune with my own natural rhythms and my spiritual guidance and intuition is strong. \nOA : Do you have any unusual or uncommon habits for the sake of health and wellness? \nKA : I refuse to eat GMO food. When eating out, this means going into the kitchens and speaking to the chef. I find out the trace ingredients in everything and what oils are used in the foods for dressings and cooking. Then I school them on why not to use GMO ingredients. I make myself a total pain in the ass when I go out to eat\u2014on purpose. The more people who do this\u2014demand non-carcinogenic food\u2014the more restaurants will pay attention and think about their choices to provide food that nourishes, not harms. \nOA: Please describe your average morning. \nKA : Morning sex. I tell all my clients to set their alarm 30 minutes earlier and start their days off with a bang. Instead of trying to force sex at the end of the night, when most people are exhausted, give yourself a huge neurotransmitter and hormonal boost first thing in the morning. It\u2019ll pack more punch than your breakfast smoothie. \nOA: What\u2019s your natural pick-me-up for the inevitable 3pm energy crash? \nKA : A \u201ccoffee-break\u201d self-pleasuring session. Using the Tantric and Taoist breathing techniques I teach, I gain energy through a five- to 15-minute self-pleasuring break and then go back to work! \nOA: Do you do anything unique or unexpected to maintain radiant skin? \nKA : Having lots of sex and ingesting lots of ejaculate, surfing and harvesting sunshine and Vitamin D between 12 PM and 2 PM every day (i.e. peak hours). This anti-sunshine myth has to go. Vitamin D, built up through progressive tanning, is an antioxidant and prevents cancer. \nOA: What\u2019s your honest opinion on exercise? Love it, like it, hate it? \nKA : LOVE IT, NEED IT. Surfing is my favorite exercise. It\u2019s cardio, endurance, and strength-training all-in-one. \nOA: What are the words you live by? \nKA : If you\u2019re not scared shitless, you\u2019re not aiming high enough. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim anami", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anami", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook image", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organic authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burger king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tantric", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vaginal kung fu", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:01:45.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e9801b0cb32eccad16de570b19e025724e17873", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnZKD6FadspdDGGyqyNQFTVogZzMq9u_HATytWNE8YR_GPVKWs3YqT_Sco3I33TwGG2EccDfy8_c835rnRPS7kT41EqMcTRpDKFh.KwLRPpAeaGK_UGi3nq", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Emma Stone Gained a Grip of Muscle With Protein Shakes \u2014 But are They Good for You?", "title_full": "Emma Stone Gained a Grip of Muscle With Protein Shakes \u2014 But are They Good for You?", "published": "2017-10-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-02-at-4.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e9801b0cb32eccad16de570b19e025724e17873", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnZKD6FadspdDGGyqyNQFTVogZzMq9u_HATytWNE8YR_GPVKWs3YqT_Sco3I33TwGG2EccDfy8_c835rnRPS7kT41EqMcTRpDKFh.KwLRPpAeaGK_UGi3nq", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brianne Hogan", "published": "2017-10-05T12:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Emma Stone Gained a Grip of Muscle With Protein Shakes \u2014 But are They Good for You?", "text": "Share on Facebook image via Rise Movement Studio/Instagram \nTo play legendary tennis champ Billie Jean King in her new movie, \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d Emma Stone underwent a total body transformation worthy of a world class athlete. The Oscar-winning actress trained with Rise Nation founder Jason Walsh, and gained 15 pounds of muscle by the end of it. \nTo supplement her demanding exercise regimen that included heavy sled pushing, hip thrusting, squatting , lunging and deadlifting, Walsh tweaked the star\u2019s diet by increasing calories, which was done through protein shakes that had \u201chundreds of calories each.\u201d \n\u201cWe also wanted to make sure that she was getting enough calories without feeling disgusting or eating too much, so we put in a couple of shakes that we would do per day, because we were training twice a day on some days,\u201d Walsh told the Hollywood Reporter of the \u201cLa La Land\u201d star\u2019s workout program. \nWith Stone\u2019s impressive results and protein shakes being one of the most widely used supplements out there, it\u2019s easy to assume that they really do work wonders for those who are looking to tone up. But just how healthy are protein shakes? Do they really do a body good? What is a Protein Shake? \nProtein shakes consist of some sort of protein, including whey, casein, soy, egg, hemp, rice, and pea protein powders , which are often mixed with a fave fruit and/or veggie. Because protein has many roles in the body, there are a number of benefits of adding extra protein through supplementation, like increasing lean muscle mass, speeding up recovery (injury or after a workout), and strengthening the immune system. Protein is Necessary to Muscle Up \nLooking to sculpt your arms like Stone did? Then you\u2019ll need to increase your protein intake. That\u2019s because if you don\u2019t eat enough protein everyday, your body can become deficient in the amino acids it needs to build and repair muscles, which hinders muscle growth. \n\u201cWhen working with a resistance training program it is essential to be obtaining enough protein to support the demands of the body,\u201d says Robert Raponi , a certified sports nutritionist and naturopathic doctor with a focus on sports medicine. \u201cThis can be done through a whole foods diet, however, for busy people on the go, a protein shake is the perfect solution. Furthermore, at a certain point, depending on the demands of training, individuals may require an amount of protein that is just too difficult to obtain through food alone. In this case, additional protein gained through a shake can be easier to get down.\u201d Which Protein Shake Should You Use? \n\u201cMy biggest suggestion is to look for a clean protein source that works well with the individual. My top choice would be a grass-fed whey isolate,\u201d says Raponi. Whey is the most common base for the protein powder, as it contains all of the nine essential amino acids that facilitate the healing of damaged muscles, while whey isolates currently are the quickest and best absorbed proteins on the market, according to Raponi. \n\u201cTypically if dairy is a problem, it is the casein proteins people tend to have issues with and the whey isolates are well tolerated. If dairy is a problem overall, look for a grass-fed beef protein. They are newer to the market but are complete proteins with great amino acid profiles,\u201d says Raponi. \u201cIf looking for vegan or vegetarian sources ensure that it is a blend of multiple plant proteins for a complete amino acid profile.\u201d \nAside from the type of protein to look for, Raponi also recommends to look for a protein powder that has little to no sugar, which will only add extra calories. Consciously Consume Your Shake \n\u201cThe absolute best time to consume a protein shake would be immediately after a workout,\u201d says Raponi. \u201cMix with some water or unsweetened dairy alternative and try to consume about 20-30g (of total protein) within two hours of your workout. The sooner the better. After exercise, our body is primed to absorb much more protein into the muscle and use it to rebuild and repair. Take advantage of this window.\u201d \nAnd remember that your shake makes a great supplement to whole foods but shouldn\u2019t replace them. \n\u201cIf you only consumed protein shakes you would not be obtaining the proper amount of nutrition that you need to live optimally and in good health,\u201d says Raponi. \u201cAlso, consuming more protein than your body needs to carry out all of its functioning will cause the extra protein to be converted and stored as fat. While not the main energy source for the body, protein still can be used as energy and has calories associated with it.\u201d The Takeaway \nAs with everything, moderation is key, and always consult with your doctor or nutritionist before adding more protein to your diet. Don\u2019t expect instant results, but over time, the combination of your preferred protein shake with a consistent resistance training could result in some Wimbledon-worthy muscles. \nRelated on Organic Authority ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "emma stone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "billie je", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert raponi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raponi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason walsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raponi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T12:29:50.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4170a63eb9dc35fe9d577deae561bf00eebff307", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkKMfaTu7_VtCvkRYhxlI1fh9zKA.enCQn3Upkdvs7arlhfuOV5D0EtGXgKT3fhId04ea9CGZnrR2bvyi.6w_pZ", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Here\u2019s Why You Need a Tongue Scraper in Your Wellness Routine", "title_full": "Here\u2019s Why You Need a Tongue Scraper in Your Wellness Routine", "published": "2017-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-516723074.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4170a63eb9dc35fe9d577deae561bf00eebff307", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkKMfaTu7_VtCvkRYhxlI1fh9zKA.enCQn3Upkdvs7arlhfuOV5D0EtGXgKT3fhId04ea9CGZnrR2bvyi.6w_pZ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here\u2019s Why You Need a Tongue Scraper in Your Wellness Routine", "text": "Here\u2019s Why You Need a Tongue Scraper in Your Wellness Routine October 5, 2017 Share on Facebook Photo by Marion Michele on Unsplash \nYou already oil pull with coconut oil, dry brush , practice mindfulness, and then some, but there\u2019s another wellness ritual that may be missing from your daily routine: tongue scraping. \nOriginating in India in Ayurvedic medicine, tongue scraping aids in clearing away bacteria, food debris, toxins, and fungus from the tongue. Using a tongue scraper is also thought to enhance sense of taste, boost immunity, and promote oral and digestive health, too. \nHere\u2019s why you need a tongue scraper in your bathroom vanity, ASAP. The Health Benefits of Using a Tongue Scraper \nUsing a tongue scraper is an easy way to reduce bad breath and halitosis, AKA chronic bad breath. According to a 2002 report , around 85-90 percent of halitosis can be attributed to metabolic outputs of naturally occurring bacteria in the mouth, which are commonly found on the back of the tongue. \n\u201cScraping the tongue daily removes any build-up on the tongue, which, if left untreated, can lead to bad breath and may house a significant number of bacteria\u201d says Sheila Patel, M.D., medical director of the Chopra Center . \nCan a tongue scraper really remove odor-causing bacteria? A 2004 study published in the Journal of Clinical Pediatric Dentistry found that using a tongue scraper daily significantly removed the amount of anaerobic bacteria from the tongue associated with bad breath. \nA 2005 study found that tongue scraping twice daily for seven days had significant effect on reducing both Mutans streptococci and Lactobacilli bacteria, as well as decreasing bad breath. \nUsing a tongue scraper is clinically shown to reduce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), which are associated with halitosis, according to this 2004 study . The tongue scraper showed a 75 percent reduction in VSCs, while a toothbrush only showed a 45 percent reduction. \nAlong with removing odor-causing bacteria from the tongue, tongue scraping may even improve the taste and sensation of food. \u201cBy removing this coating you improve your ability to taste your food, which makes it more satisfying\u201d Patel says. \n\u201cBy increasing your taste reception, not only do you eat less, you also eliminate the need to add more sugar, salt, or excessive spice to the food to make it more flavorful.\u201d \nIn fact, a 2004 study found that two weeks of tongue scraping greatly reduced tongue coating, while significantly improving taste sensation of bitter, sweet, salty, and sour tastes in participants. What Kind of Tongue Scraper to Use \nAccording to one of the Ayurvedic texts, the Charaka Samhita , tongue scrapers should be made of gold, silver, copper, tin, or brass. \nCopper, which has been used for centuries as a bacteria-resistant metal, is one of the more popular tongue scraper choices. A 2012 study shows that copper is both toxic to bad bacteria and is necessary for specific microbial enzymes in the mouth. \nAnother option, a stainless steel tongue scraper is considered to be balancing for all Ayurvedic constitutions (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) and imbalances. How to Use a Tongue Scraper \nAyurvedic practitioners recommend tongue scraping every morning on an empty stomach. \nTo tongue scrape, gently hold the ends of the scraper in both hands and place it far back on the surface of the tongue as comfortable. \n\u201cThe tongue should be gently scraped from back to front for 7 to 14 strokes,\u201d Patel notes. If there is a lot of accumulation on the scraper, rinse it off in between strokes. \n\u201cSome people report stimulation of the gag reflex during scraping, which may indicate that the scraping is too aggressive. If this occurs with gentle scraping, begin slightly more forward on the tongue to avoid the gagging reflex\u201d Patel says. \nFinish tongue scraping with brushing , flossing, optional oil pulling, and a large glass of water, and prepare to feel fresh. Where Can You Find a Tongue Scraper \nLook for tongue scrapers online at retailers like Amazon or at natural grocery stores, like Whole Foods Market. \nMy favorite tongue scraper is from Banyan Botanicals who makes a stainless steel tongue cleaner that\u2019s made to last. Other great options are The Dirt copper tongue scraper from Urban Outfitters and this copper tongue scraper from I Love Herbal . \nNow, go get your scrape on. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sheila patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pitta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charaka samhita", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chopra center", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T12:29:52.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a28f140c72c93c53cff50e6153bbc2ddc3838852", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhmih4Hu1kHvHk2BhMQFUzkeht1iQYBbTc6sR3s7Bvy6BZUO0LPHxOy8VTFxMXOeUPAHJJZLFB9jbA--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Where\u2019s the Love?

Scores of brands have used \u201cmade with love\u201d or listed \u201clove\u201d as an outright ingredient on food labels, particularly in natural and organic foods, as well as some beauty products. But according to a warning letter the FDA sent to a bakery last month, love is not an actual ingredient and shouldn\u2019t be listed as one. \nLate last month, the FDA cited Massachusetts\u2019 Nashoba Brook Bakery for several health code violations including failure to prevent the spread of microorganisms and improper sanitization of baking tools. But it also took aim at the company\u2019s ingredient listing. \n\u201c\u2019Love\u2019 is not a common or usual name of an ingredient, and is considered to be intervening material because it is not part of the common or usual name of the ingredient,\u201d the FDA wrote in its warning letter. \u201cIngredients required to be declared on the label or labeling of food must be listed by their common or usual name.\u201d \nThe company\u2019s CEO John Gates told Bloomberg the FDA\u2019s comments felt \u201cso George Orwell.\u201d \nWhile Nashoba says it will comply with the FDA\u2019s request, Gates says having to do so is a great disappointment for the 20-year-old company and its 75 employees. \n\u201cI really like that we list \u2018love\u2019 in the granola,\u201d Gates told Bloomberg. \u201cPeople ask us what makes it so good. It\u2019s kind of nice that this artisan bakery can say there\u2019s love in it and it puts a smile on people\u2019s face. Situations like that where the government is telling you you can\u2019t list \u2018love\u2019 as an ingredient, because it might be deceptive, just feels so silly.\u201d Find Jill on Twitter and Instagram Related on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nashoba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john gates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george orwell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gates", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fda", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashoba brook bakery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram related on organic authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T12:29:53.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7f1ce59a878a1d001e873273b0ef611061a8e44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlEAPwIdy0UgeOb_tMZ_isS3A_Mayr3orlCeBKGbaigypRZdtwTaHd0", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "These 3-Ingredient Homemade Peanut Butter Cups are Delicious Happiness", "title_full": "These 3-Ingredient Homemade Peanut Butter Cups are Delicious Happiness", "published": "2017-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_6487.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7f1ce59a878a1d001e873273b0ef611061a8e44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlEAPwIdy0UgeOb_tMZ_isS3A_Mayr3orlCeBKGbaigypRZdtwTaHd0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "These 3-Ingredient Homemade Peanut Butter Cups are Delicious Happiness", "text": "Sugar per serving: 12.6g Sodium per serving: 127mg We promise these homemade peanut butter cups are far more delicious than the original neon orange wrapped treat.

Ingredients 160 grams dark chocolate, roughly chopped (At least 80% cocoa) \u00be cup organic creamy peanut butter 3 Tbsp melted unrefined coconut oil, divided Instructions Line a muffin tin or mini muffin tin with paper cupcake liners and set aside. Using a double boiler, gently melt two tablespoons of the coconut oil with chopped dark chocolate until smooth in texture and completely melted. Set chocolate aside to keep warm while you mix peanut butter. Mix together the remaining coconut oil with creamy peanut butter until completely incorporated. You want this mixture to be nice and runny. If not, gently warm up peanut butter and coconut oil together. Pour a heaping tablespoon of chocolate into the base of each lined tins. Place in the freezer and allow to set for about five minutes. Remove from freezer and add a heaping one to two tablespoons of the peanut butter mixture into the center of each cup. Place PB cups back in the freezer to set for five minutes more. Scoop the remaining melted chocolate to cover the top of each peanut butter cup, about one to two tablespoons. Place PB cups back in the freezer to set a final time, about 15-20 minutes. Remove peanut butter cups from liner if desired and store in an airtight container. Notes PB cups will keep for two weeks in the refrigerator and multiple months in the freezer. If you have a peanut allergy, swap peanut butter with almond, cashew, sunflower, etc. If your PB is unsalted and you\u2019d like a sweet/salty thing going on, sprinkle a bit of flaky sea salt over the top of your cups before setting them in the freezer the last time.

Grab some candles, flower petals, and a good book; you\u2019re going to want to take a long, hoat soak in an Epsom salt bath ASAP. \nEpsom salt isn\u2019t a salt at all; it\u2019s a pure mineral compound of magnesium sulfate that\u2019s been used for centuries for a variety of ailments. Named after a saline spring where the compound was first diluted in Epsom, England, Epsom salt is filled with beneficial properties to soothe the body and mind. The Benefits of an Epsom Salt Bath \nEpsom salt baths are commonly used to soothe a variety of health conditions including arthritis pain and swelling, bruises and sprains, fibromyalgia, ingrown toenails, insomnia, psoriasis, muscle soreness, sunburn, and tired feet, according to WebMD . \nWhen Epsom salt is added to warm bath water, it is broken down into magnesium and sulfate. Simply soaking the body in Epsom salt is thought to replenish levels of magnesium, a mineral that many people (roughly 75 percent, according some experts) are deficient in. \nMagnesium is essential for over 300 enzymatic functions, which are responsible for regulating metabolic behaviors including energy and glutathione production. \nMagnesium is also essential for maintaining blood sugar levels, as healthy magnesium levels are linked with lower incidences of diabetes, according to a 2006 study . \nTaking an Epsom salt bath is also a wonderful way to reduce stress. Simply soaking in a bath of warm water has been shown to clinically improve mood and even have an antidepressant effect. Soaking in a magnesium rich bath can help to boost mood even more, as magnesium salts have been shown reduce stress and improve neuropsychiatric disorders, according to this study . iStock/olegbreslavtsev How to Take an Epsom Salt Bath \nTaking an Epsom salt bath is the perfect way to unwind after a long day. Simply fill up a bathtub with warm water and add in two cups of Epsom salts. Grab a good book, light some candles, add your favorite bath products and soak for at least fifteen minutes. \nTake deep breathes, quiet your mind, and relax! Remember to drink lots of water after your Epsom salt bath as hot baths can be dehydrating. \nInstant bliss.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T11:13:35.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "62af24378833858414f6eebf8d9373b2341f5ff4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhkcv3gNbK1qQIR1x3ifpwUwna2Mh09Ce5wrKYlWXeVYlqRzdyXUy2suthdQWh2.23HD1E23yHIaWtW9qrwo4Tn92xz.ssFPrXg-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Wanderlust Isn\u2019t Just a Yoga and Food Festival: For Founder Jeff Krasno, It\u2019s a Way of Life", "title_full": "Wanderlust Isn\u2019t Just a Yoga and Food Festival: For Founder Jeff Krasno, It\u2019s a Way of Life", "published": "2017-10-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Wanderlust.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "62af24378833858414f6eebf8d9373b2341f5ff4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhkcv3gNbK1qQIR1x3ifpwUwna2Mh09Ce5wrKYlWXeVYlqRzdyXUy2suthdQWh2.23HD1E23yHIaWtW9qrwo4Tn92xz.ssFPrXg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kelly Page", "published": "2017-10-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wanderlust Isn\u2019t Just a Yoga and Food Festival: For Founder Jeff Krasno, It\u2019s a Way of Life", "text": "Share on Facebook \nJeff Krasno was an entrepreneur running a music entertainment company in lower Manhattan, two blocks from the World Trade Center when 9/11 hit. Right afterward, his girlfriend, who would later become his wife, took over some empty space in his office building and opened a yoga studio to support the local community. \u201cI had a front-row seat to the power of yoga and intentional community to really heal people and get them back on their feet,\u201d says Krasno. \nAfter witnessing a few of his wife\u2019s yoga retreats in Costa Rica, Krasno was inspired to combine his event producing skills with the practice of yoga to create the world\u2019s largest yoga festival, best known as Wanderlust . The first festival took place in 2009 in Squaw Valley, Calif., with approximately 3,000 people in attendance. There are now nearly 70 Wanderlust events taking place in 16 countries each year, with roughly 120,000 annual tickets sold. \nKrasno didn\u2019t just set out to bring a bunch of people together to do downward dog at the same time. He wanted to cultivate community and connection. \nWanderlust also wants people to find their true north. What\u2019s your true north? Krasno explains, \u201cFinding your true north is that process of living a truly mindful and inspired life. You\u2019re always seeking it out. You never get there. It\u2019s that self-actualized self. \u201c \nThe Wanderlust events offer one way for people to tap into their true north. There are yoga classes galore, but there are also cooking demonstrations, group meditation practice, evening concerts and BBQs. If you live in Austin, Hollywood, or Montreal, you can even visit a brick and mortar Wanderlust location for more yoga and community event opportunities. \n\u201cWe\u2019re sort of like a gateway drug for a deeper, more mindful life. We\u2019re accessible. We offer a really big tent. We offer a lot of ways in. We\u2019re a platform. We\u2019re non-dogmatic,\u201d Krasno says. You\u2019ll find kundalini , hatha, vinyasa and Iyengar-based yoga practices, in addition to multiple meditation techniques. \u201cWe can offer all of these initial entry points for people to discover all of these different kinds of practices and recipes for living. They can key in on what\u2019s right for them and then pursue their true north.\u201d \nKrasno found food to be another natural extension for the Wanderlust brand and its yogi community, so he penned a book called \u201cFind Your True Fork: Journeys in Healthy, Delicious, and Ethical Eating\u201d. He gathered a collection of chefs who focus on ingredients that heal the body. Each chef took a chapter to highlight their food story and philosophy, and then they provided a collection of healthy recipes. You\u2019ll find a who\u2019s who of clean eating styles from vegan to paleo, raw, gluten-free, vegetarian, and Ayurvedic recipes. \n\u201cEveryone has a different diet that\u2019s optimal for them. The book offers a way to discover a bunch of different, healthy, ethical approaches to food through the stories and recipes of all of these amazing chefs, many of whom have transformational stories. A lot of the chefs were sick or suffered from some kind of affliction and managed to solve it through diet. I think that by telling their stories, a lot of people can see their own personal journeys within those stories. It\u2019s also food porn and lovely to look at.\u201d \nMany of the chefs hosted special dinners at Wanderlust Hollywood over this past summer. A lot could also be found on the culinary stage at Wanderlust events this year, a practice that will likely continue into the future. \nWith Wanderlust\u2019s 10-year anniversary fast approaching, plans for the future continue to include ways to provide community. \u201cWe can all come together regardless of all the different things that may divide us or people who may want to divide us. It\u2019s constantly being aware of what society needs the most, and then being able to step up and use our resources to try in a small way to provide some solutions.\u201d \nCheck out \u201cWanderlust Find Your True Fork: Journeys in Healthy, Delicious, and Ethical Eating\u201d here .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T16:35:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "513e1195d9bd0422706b8b493769b938d20930fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkjJpiqjhsbVbBUfQ6LdJy3Cum7RFiMCNG5NtcTh4nwVssGVdyyiDVCVVitbzidiW1_AjX2UNqBZC3c7UZ2bu7qSvOphLwHYYxSOn_vB4e4p41L4yY.nYiU", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Here\u2019s How to Find the Right Meditation Class For Your Personality Type", "title_full": "Here\u2019s How to Find the Right Meditation Class For Your Personality Type", "published": "2017-10-07T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iStock-840155516.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "513e1195d9bd0422706b8b493769b938d20930fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkjJpiqjhsbVbBUfQ6LdJy3Cum7RFiMCNG5NtcTh4nwVssGVdyyiDVCVVitbzidiW1_AjX2UNqBZC3c7UZ2bu7qSvOphLwHYYxSOn_vB4e4p41L4yY.nYiU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sara Novak", "published": "2017-10-07T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here\u2019s How to Find the Right Meditation Class For Your Personality Type", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/fizkes \nRegular meditation can come with a host of benefits. But just like certain yoga classes are more appealing than others depending on what you\u2019re looking for in a practice, the same is true of meditation class. Luckily, with guided meditation showing up in everything from podcasts to Fortune 500 companies, you\u2019re sure to find a class that fits your needs. Different Types of Meditation \nResearch continues to show that meditation practices can change your brain for the better, increasing focus and memory and even slowing aging. It doesn\u2019t always matter how you get there as long as you get there. \nWe\u2019ve rounded up a list of practices, according to Jaime Pfeffer, meditation teacher and author of \u201c Meditation for Moms .\u201d \n-Mindfulness meditation (being aware). Usually conducted with eyes open and person fully conscious. Quick exercises that last 3-5 minutes. \n-Walking meditation. \n-Alpha-level meditation (what most people think of when they think of meditating. Usually 20-30 minutes long. Can be silent or guided. \n-Trance (similar to hypnosis). Deep level of meditation. Tips for Choosing a Meditation Class to Fit Your Personality 1. Experiment with different classes. \n\u201cTry meditation at least six times before writing it off,\u201d says Pfeffer. \nQuite simply, the best way to figure out what meditation is the best fit is by trying all of the different varieties and seeing what feels authentic. 2. Identify your dominant sense. \nIt\u2019s helpful to identify what sense is dominant when it comes to relaxation, according to Jefferey Martin, founder of the Transformative Technology Lab for Well Being at Sofia University. Does visualization help you to calm down? What about relaxing music or scanning the body for tension. We\u2019re all different, says Martin, and we all respond differently to stimulus. Choose a meditation practice that highlights your dominant sense. 3. Connect with a teacher. \nIf your teacher doesn\u2019t make you feel at ease and open, that meditation class might not be the right fit. The teacher shouldn\u2019t be rushed or distracted. Sometimes it\u2019s less about the type of meditation that the teacher is teaching and more about the teacher herself, according to Karen Downing, meditation teacher and founder of Your Soul Mission . 4. Utilize YouTube. \nYouTube is your best friend when it comes to experimenting with different types of meditation. \n\u201cI would recommend trying out a few different YouTube videos,\u201d says Downing. \u201cTry two or three different videos for each style of meditation you are interested in. Even if you don\u2019t connect deeply with the practitioner, you should still be able to determine which style(s) suited you best.\u201d 5. Keep at it. \nThe benefits of meditation don\u2019t happen overnight. If you\u2019re completely sure you don\u2019t want to try a form of meditation again, that\u2019s one thing, but for the most part, try and stay committed, says Downing. \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t think a form of meditation is working for you, and you are just starting out, I would recommend that you try it at least five to 10 times before making a decision,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the beginning of a new style (especially for those just starting out with meditation), it can be difficult to learn how to shut off your mental chatter, so you need to give it a good go before you decide to give up on it.\u201d \nThe most important part of choosing a meditation practice is that you do it as often as possible. Try and meditate every day at around the same time so you can get into a routine. 6. Go on retreat. \nOnce you\u2019ve identified a teacher and a type of meditation, it\u2019s time to dive right in. Meditation retreats are great ways to take your practice to the next level. On retreat, you\u2019re often able to come to a quieter place than you can in daily meditation. Once you get back to your daily practice at home, you can intermix what you\u2019ve learned on retreat. The best part is retreats don\u2019t have to be expensive and some are even free. Meditation centers are sometimes donation-based, for example. Ashrams are also good venues for cultivating a deeper meditation practice because you often meditate three times per day. Ashrams sometimes allow you to work at the facility and take classes for free as well. 7. We all hit plateaus. \nJust because you hit a plateau doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not working. Some changes are more obvious that others. But in those times when you want to step things up a notch, consider spending time outdoors alone. It\u2019s a great way to ground down and reconnect with yourself. \nAccording to Downing, it\u2019s natural to hit plateaus in your meditation practice every now and again. \u201cI often recommend adding walking meditation, or forest bathing, as a regular part of your meditation routine,\u201d she says. \u201cTogether they create a fabulous inspirational flow for my own intuition, insights, priorities, and peace of mind.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jefferey martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaime pfeffer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen downing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pfeffer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "transformative technology lab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sofia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meditation  research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T17:23:03.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d9184e330bde2eb15efd3243be4fedfc80cc56f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhlp4WrQv1_vqZjDyqlSIhD.5kJaGJR5heDRJwl4bl3F_yewp3eyXV98PNDtlf784vnRI.yiQi_PtPDnHdbuRtv32hKs3TN55g4-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Pose Serious Health Concerns, WHO Reports", "title_full": "Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Pose Serious Health Concerns, WHO Reports", "published": "2017-10-06T20:19:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/greg-ortega-943.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d9184e330bde2eb15efd3243be4fedfc80cc56f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhlp4WrQv1_vqZjDyqlSIhD.5kJaGJR5heDRJwl4bl3F_yewp3eyXV98PNDtlf784vnRI.yiQi_PtPDnHdbuRtv32hKs3TN55g4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-06T20:19:00.000+03:00", "title": "Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Pose Serious Health Concerns, WHO Reports", "text": "Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria Pose Serious Health Concerns, WHO Reports October 6, 2017 Share on Facebook image via Greg Ortega/Unsplash \nThe world is running out of antibiotics that can combat increasing antibiotic-resistant bacteria, a new World Health Organization report warns. \n\u201cAntimicrobial resistance is a global health emergency that will seriously jeopardize progress in modern medicine,\u201d says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. \u201cThere is an urgent need for more investment in research and development for antibiotic-resistant infections including TB, otherwise we will be forced back to a time when people feared common infections and risked their lives from minor surgery.\u201d \nThe report identifies 12 classes of pathogens that are becoming harder to treat due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including pneumonia, gonorrhea, urinary tract infections, and drug-resistant tuberculosis, which kills around 250,000 people each year. \nTo combat these pathogens, the report highlights 51 new antibiotics in clinical development, only eight of which the organization classifies as \u201cinnovative treatments that will add value to the current antibiotic treatment arsenal,\u201d reports Inter Press Service . \nThe WHO and Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative have set up the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership to support the development of new treatments and research for these diseases. \nBacterial resistance causes 700,000 human deaths every year worldwide and has the potential to become \u201c.even more deadly than cancer,\u201d the UN warns, with the capacity to kill as many as 10 million people a year. \nThere are several contributing factors to increasing antibiotic resistance, including the overzealous use of subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics in agricultural livestock farms. These antibiotics are used both to prevent illness, which would otherwise run rampant due to the close and often unsanitary living conditions of livestock, as well as to promote faster growth of these animals. \nWhile the FDA recently unveiled a new guidance that the agency calls a \u201csignificant milestone\u201d in the more responsible use of antibiotics, with the goal of reducing the use of medically important drugs in food-producing animals, the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy criticizes the guidance for not going far enough. \n\u201cThe effectiveness of this guidance depends on how the guidance is followed and monitored through the control of antibiotics in food-producing animals,\u201d says Stuart Levy, MD, a professor of medicine and director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University School of Medicine. The guidance specifically targets regulations that allowed agricultural professionals to acquire antibiotics for growth promotion in livestock without a prescription. \nIn 2015, bacteria resistant to last-resort antibiotic colistin was detected in swine in China and in both people and in swine in the United States last year as a direct result of these practices. \nAntibiotic-resistant bacteria are also promoted by the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in hospitals, a problem that was recently addressed by Boston-based startup Day Zero Diagnostics , the winner of the 216 MedTech Innovator contest, with the development of a test that can identify specific infection-causing bacterial strains much more quickly than ever before, thus allowing doctors to treat infections with appropriate antibiotics more quickly and avoid the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics entirely. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tedros adhanom ghebreyesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg ortega/unsplash", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart levy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "who reports antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose serious health concerns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "antibiotic-resistant bacteria pose serious health concerns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for adaptation genetics and drug resistance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tufts university school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for infectious disease research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inter press service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global antibiotic research and development partnership", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T17:23:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b7e1fc3b17a0cc0a39447ee7360e5064e777d86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmPE.n2HzLwIONkE2lNdoZwHCQk0g8BE1mqwAVtaJEEIvhh.xQRf__Xw1cxLEAHM6E-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "13 Adaptogens to Help You Conquer Stress", "title_full": "13 Adaptogens to Help You Conquer Stress", "published": "2017-10-06T14:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/iStock-619088918_Alexandra-Iakovleva.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b7e1fc3b17a0cc0a39447ee7360e5064e777d86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmPE.n2HzLwIONkE2lNdoZwHCQk0g8BE1mqwAVtaJEEIvhh.xQRf__Xw1cxLEAHM6E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-06T14:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "13 Adaptogens to Help You Conquer Stress", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/Alexandra Iakovleva \nIf you never got a Hogwarts letter, adaptogens are as close to magic as you\u2019ll likely ever get. An adaptogenic herb has the unique capacity to reduce the levels of stress hormones in your blood, helping you to \u201cadapt\u201d more easily to difficult environments, such as cold, a stressful work situation, or fatigue. \nIn the non-Western world, adaptogens are often used in high-risk occupations to reduce job-related stress, but they\u2019re quickly gaining traction in the West as well, especially as peer-reviewed studies increasingly confirm what experts in Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine have known for centuries: that adaptogens really have amazing effects on your body\u2019s ability to deal with outside stressors. \nOur experts weigh in on which adaptogens are the real deal as well as how to integrate them into your daily life. How Adaptogens Work \nDespite what it may seem, there\u2019s nothing mystical about the way adaptogens help our bodies adapt to stress. According to Phytotherapy Research , adaptogenic herbs can work in one of two ways: when taken over the long term, they work to help the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, our body\u2019s central stress response system, better adapt to stressors and produce fewer stress hormones. A single dose in the short term can be important \u201cin situations that require a rapid response to tension or to a stressful situation,\u201d note the researchers; these effects are associated instead with the sympatho-adrenal-system, which is crucial to how our body\u2019s react to outside stimuli. \nThe ability of adaptogens to affect change in these two systems in our bodies allow them to help us in three distinct ways: They Increase Physical Performance \nOne 1999 study in Phytomedicine showed that schizandra berry could increase physical performance during heavy physical exercise, specifically by keeping the body from producing nitric oxide and cortisol afterwards. Cortisol is a stress hormone that contributes to general inflammation in the body, so regulating the body\u2019s responses to stress can logically contribute to reduced cortisol, reduced inflammation, and a greater ability for the body to \u201cbounce back\u201d after heavy exercise or exertion. They Reduce Mental Fatigue \nA 2010 literature review in Pharmaceuticals showed that \u201cadaptogens exhibit neuroprotective, anti-fatigue, antidepressive, anxiolytic, nootropic and CNS stimulating activity,\u201d helping people to overcome mental fatigue linked to stress. \nThe study even noted that adaptogens exhibited an anti-fatigue effect that increased mental work capacity. They Reduce the Physical Effects of Stress on the Body \nThis is the headlining characteristic of adaptogens, and the scientific studies supporting this are myriad. \nOne 2007 study in Drug Target Insights found that rhodiola and schizandra berry modified the response to immobilization stress in rabbits by suppressing three stress-activated substances: kinase, nitric oxide, and cortisol. \n\u201cIt is suggested that the inhibitory effects of R. rosea and S. chinensis on p-SAPK/p-JNK activation may be associated with their antidepressant activity as well as their positive effects on mental performance under stress.\u201d \nA similar study conducted on mice in 2009 for the journal Phytomedicine found comparable results. 13 Types of Adaptogenic Herbs \nThe term \u201cadaptogen\u201d has become a bit of a buzzword of late, and while that\u2019s certainly exciting, there is one downfall of adaptogens\u2019 quick rise to fame: suddenly, everyone wants to join the party. Some folks will have you believe that there are hundreds of different adaptogens, but in reality, this exclusive group features just a handful of members. \n\u201cA true adaptogenic herb helps you to adapt to all forms of physical and mental stress, whatever they might be \u2014 whether it\u2019s cold temperature or a lousy commute or work pressure,\u201d says Chris Kilham, Medicine Hunter . \u201cThey support virtually every system in the body in some measurable way.\u201d \nBut just because all adaptogens help your body respond to stress doesn\u2019t mean they all do it in the same way. \n\u201cEach adaptogen has a unique characteristic, a unique application, a unique profile that may make it appropriate or not appropriate for somebody,\u201d explains Dr. Tieraona Low Dog. \nIndividual companies may also mix and match different herbs to create blends to support multiple systems at once. Walter Faulstroh, co-founder of HUM , notes that the company has a very \u201cuser-centric\u201d formula for creating its GMO-free adaptogenic blends. \n\u201cFirst, we identify the customer need,\u201d he explains. \u201cAre we talking about stress or stress-related fatigue? Perhaps skin conditions as a result of high cortisol levels? The immune system? Once we have identified that need, we look at clinical research to understand how nutrients can help solve the customer\u2019s concerns and identify the right amount of each adaptogen.\u201d \nGaia Herbs has also created several formulas comprised of different adaptogens, such as Adrenal Health Jump Start , for which, Susan Hirsch, Gaia Product Information Specialist, notes, \u201csynergy\u201d is expected, \u201cmeaning that the total effect of all herbs together in a formula is greater than with taking each individual herb separately.\u201d 1. Ashwagandha \nAshwagandha or Withania somnifera is an adaptogenic herb known as the \u201cstrength of the stallion\u201d in India. It is one of the most famous adaptogens and is touted by many as being the most powerful. \nIt\u2019s traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to strengthen the immune system after illness, and it has also been proven to improve thyroid function, treat adrenal fatigue, reduce anxiety, and combat the effects of stress on the body. \n\u201cAshwagandha is great for the adrenal glands,\u201d says naturopathic Doctor Serena Goldstein , who notes that it can help balance stress due to its ability to regulate cortisol. \u201cIt\u2019s also great for when people are \u2018on the floor\u2019 tired mostly due to thyroid/adrenal concerns.\u201d \nThat said, Dr. Low Dog explains that ashwagandha is also \u201cthe only truly sedating kind of adaptogen that we have,\u201d saying that it can be quite calming and help people relax. While it may seem counter-intuitive that the same herb could be helpful for both people who are overly tired and people who suffer from insomnia, anyone who has experienced stress-related sleeplessness can tell you that sometimes these two go hand in hand. \nAshwagandha is a member of the nightshade family, which means that it should be avoided by some people, particularly those on an anti-inflammatory diet , and Low Dog notes that there is some doubt as to whether it is safe for pregnant people to consume. \nTo discover more about ashwagandha and see product picks, check out our guide to ashwagandha . 2. Astragalus \nThis is one of Goldstein\u2019s favorite adaptogens. Used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for centuries, this adaptogenic herb has been shown to protect the body against disease and support the liver. \n\u201cIt\u2019s very toning, and also great for the cardiovascular system, immune system, and digestion, in addition to the nervous system,\u201d says Goldstein. \nAstragalus is occasionally used topically for its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and in the United States, researchers have looked at using it as a treatment for those who have weakened immune systems due to cancer treatments or AIDS. 3. Eleuthero \nOnce known as Siberian ginseng, and still occasionally known as wucha or ciwujia , eleuthero has historically been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to invigorate sexual function and boost vital energy. \nChinese herbalist Li Shi-Chen wrote in his 1596 treatise on herbal medicine Ben Cao Gang Mu, \u201cI would rather have a handful of Wucha than a cartload of gold and jewels.\u201d That\u2019s pretty high praise. 4. Holy Basil \nHoly basil , also known as tulsi, helps enhance the body\u2019s natural response to physical and emotional stress, helping our physiology to better react to stressors. \nThere are many proven benefits to consuming holy basil, including cancer prevention, skincare, reduced anxiety, and reduced blood glucose in diabetes sufferers. 5. Jiaogulan \nJiaogulan is an adaptogen that Kilham only recently discovered on his travels to Southeast Asia. A member of the pumpkin family, the plant contains enormous quantities of compounds similar to those found in ginseng. \n\u201cIt has a reputation as an immortality herb,\u201d says Kilham. \u201cAnd it\u2019s great stuff- it shows benefits for the heart and for immunity and for brain function.\u201d \nWhile it\u2019s not too common in the West yet, it may just be the next big thing. 6. Maca \nMaca is occasionally called \u201cPeruvian ginseng,\u201d despite having no relation to the Asian plant. Maca was, however, revered in ancient Incan culture for its ability to increase strength, energy, and stamina, just like ginseng \u2014 and even more, for its ability to improve libido and sexual function. \n\u201cMaca\u2019s quite interesting for its ability to help men and women with their libido and just their sexuality,\u201d explains Low Dog, who notes that a number of studies in men have shown positive effects on sex drive and suggested that maca may help reduce enlarged prostates, and one 2005 study in the International Journal of Biomedical Science showed that it could help with hot flashes, night sweats, and other menopausal symptoms. \n\u201cBasically all the studies show that it helps women feel more easily aroused,\u201d she notes. 7. Panax Ginseng \nPanax ginseng, also known as Korean ginseng or Asian ginseng is used to rejuvenate and invigorate the body in Traditional Chinese Medicine, stimulating the body and improving energy and stamina. \nBut while most Americans think of ginseng as a booster, like caffeine, Low Dog notes that this is a myth, likely linked to the fact that the expensive herb has long been tainted or otherwise adulterated in the U.S. After years of people assuming that ginseng could elevate blood pressure, a study conclusively showed that this is not the case. \n\u201cSome people may feel a little jolt from ginseng, but the vast majority do not,\u201d she explains. \u201cWhat you begin to feel is after a week or two of taking it, you begin to feel like you have more energy throughout the day and that you\u2019re more mentally alert.\u201d \nIn China, she notes, ginseng is used for people who \u201care tired and fatigued and worn out and have low chi,\u201d she says, noting that it is sometimes given to people upon their release from the hospital to help them build up strength. She notes that dozens of cancer centers around the country give ginseng to patients with cancer, so this could be an alternative option to discuss with your doctor. 8. Panax Quinquefolius \nAlso known as American ginseng , this adaptogenic herb is known in Traditional Chinese Medicine for promoting yin (shadow, cold, negative, female) energy, as opposed to Asian ginseng, which promotes yang (sunshine, hot, positive, male) energy. \nUnlike its Asian counterpart, renowned for boosting energy, American ginseng is used for its calming and tonic properties. 9. Reishi Mushrooms \nRed Reishi, also known as Ling Zhi in Chinese, is a non-toxic mushroom that is excellent for regulating the immune system and organ function. When taken regularly, reishi mushrooms improve liver function, reduce cancer risk, and can even lower blood pressure. \nSome studies have also shown that the ganoderic acids in reishi mushrooms can also help alleviate common allergies and asthma, due to their natural antihistaminic properties. 10. Rhaponticum \nRhaponticum carthamoides root is chock full of antioxidants, helping to promote cell health and even to reduce blood lipids. Some studies have shown that rhaponticum can help stimulate the nervous system and memory. \nRhaponticum is, however, best known for its abilities to replicate the effects of steroids \u2014 all-naturally, of course. Rhaponticum can help accelerate weight gain, particularly in skeletal muscles, completely independent of testosterone. The result is increased muscle mass without the use of anabolic steroids, meaning that rhaponticum is ideal for people looking to increase bulk in a healthy way via weight training. 11. Rhodiola Rosea \nRhodiola is an interesting herb and one of the most popular in Siberia. According to Goldstein, the herb can be stimulating at low doses and becomes calming at higher doses. It reduces the effects of stress on the body and can reduce fatigue as well. \nThis is one of Kilham\u2019s favorite adaptogenic herbs, and he takes it regularly, notably to help his body deal with the stress of cold water while surfing. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that compares with rhodiola; I think it is at the top of the list,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are people who would say, ashwaganda\u2019s at the top of the list, but I think rhodiola is the most profound of the bunch.\u201d \nLow Dog likes rhodiola for its stimulating benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely amazing for people who have fibromyalgia, depression, they\u2019re tired, they\u2019re fatigued \u2014 they do really well on rhodiola.\u201d \nShe does caution against using it if you do not have these symptoms, as it can worsen anxiety and make someone who generally has high energy \u201cbounce off the walls.\u201d 12. Schisandra \nSchisandra , also known as the \u201cFive Flavored Berry,\u201d is a general tonic that decreases fatigue and increases endurance and physical performance. Named for its sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and pungent flavors, Schisandra is often used in Traditional Chinese Medicine for longevity, energy, and as a sexual tonic. 13. Sea Buckthorn \nSea buckthorn is a super fruit that contains all of the omegas \u2014 not just 3, 6, and 9, but also the ultra-rare 7 \u2014 as well as more than 60 antioxidants and at least 20 minerals. Known as \u201cHoly Fruit\u201d in the Himalayan Mountains where it is grown, it is often used to improve skin health, as it has been linked to healing psoriasis and to slowing aging. It can also be used to improve gastrointestinal disorders and colon health. \nThis is a pretty complete list \u2013 for now, at least. As Kilham explains, \u201cThere are lots of herbs out there that occupy important places in the traditional medicines or the cultures of various people that we just don\u2019t know of yet.\u201d Adding Adaptogens to Your Diet \nIn addition to knowing how much of an individual adaptogen to add to your diet, it\u2019s also important to decide how to consume it: as a standardized extract in capsule or tincture form, as a tea, or even as food, in the case of adaptogens like maca. \nOne of the key defining factors of adaptogens is that they are \u201cbasically harmless,\u201d explains Kilham. This means that you can take adaptogens every day and generally don\u2019t need to worry about taking too much. \n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like showering,\u201d says Kilham. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to shower every day, but it\u2019s not a bad idea.\u201d \nOf course, you can get too much of a good thing, as Dr. Low Dog explains. While she does agree that most adaptogens have a \u201cpretty big range that you could consume,\u201d she notes, for example, that \u201cif you took 20 grams of rhodiola, you\u2019d be bouncing off the walls. I wouldn\u2019t even know what to do with somebody who had consumed that much.\u201d \nBe sure to follow instructions on the packaging for the adaptogens you have purchased so that you don\u2019t exceed recommended doses of these powerful plants. \nWhile adaptogens can be taken long term, most of our experts recommend taking breaks every so often: a day off per week, a week off every few months, and a month off every year. \nMoon Juice team member Janie Wood also notes that individuals should feel free to vary their adaptogenic formulas as they choose. \n\u201cSome days you might pick your favorite flavor profile and use it multiple times,\u201d she says. \u201cOther times you may look at what your mood or your day needs to accomplish and select a few different ones.\u201d \nThat said, in certain high-stress scenarios, you may wish to supplement with something extra. \n\u201cThere are specific situations that you would have a specific short term protocol for a health challenge you might be facing, and that would be best recommended by your healthcare practitioner,\u201d says Amy Keller, Director of Education and Training at Organic India . \nNo matter what form you choose, one thing you want to be sure of is that you\u2019re sourcing your adaptogens from a reputable source and, as with any new regimen, it\u2019s important to ask your doctor before adding any adaptogens to your diet, particularly if you\u2019re attempting to treat a pre-existing condition or problem.

The ones you can use on skin, hair, and slip in your smoothie? You know, like coconut oil . The powerful multipurpose moringa plant is making its way into many a wellness routine, and this natural ingredient has beauty benefits, too. \nOne of the best aspects of natural beauty is that it\u2019s constantly evolving. Experts are always discovering new ways to use the earth\u2019s bounty for healthy skin and hair. While many of these ingredients seem new to us, most have been used for centuries. \nEgyptians knew about the beauty perks of moringa oil, obtained by pressing seeds of the moringa tree, and used it to protect the skin. The ingredient was so revered in Egyptian culture that they were often buried with jars of the oil. \nMoringa oil is native to Northern India and is a staple in Ayurvedic skincare . The oil is packed with nutrients, antioxidants, and anti-inflammatories, good for smoothing, calming and clearing the complexion. Often compared to argan oil , moringa is lighter and more easily soaks into skin, making it a suitable choice for all skin types. \nMore recent evidence suggests moringa oil may have links to battling cancer. Study results show the oil killed 50% of colon cancer cells tested, while leaving normal cells intact. \nAs with most natural ingredients, it\u2019s important to use products made with high quality moringa oil. Cold-pressed moringa oil contains the highest levels of nutrients and antioxidants. Green Virgin Products sources its cold-pressed moringa oil from small organic growers to ensure only the best goes into its products. \nMaybe you\u2019ve sipped a moringa-infused tea or smoothie . Well now\u2019s your chance to extend the star ingredient\u2019s goodness to your complexion. iStock/yokeetod How to Use Moringa Oil for Skin \n1. Cleanse face and body: Soap made with moringa oil clears pores and moisturizes skin. No Scent Soap Nut Moringa Bar Soap offers a gentle lather and mild cleanse. Or try Soap Nut & Moringa Peppermint Bar Soap for a refreshing cleanse. \n2. Soothe Inflammation: Dealing with red or upset skin? Moringa oil can help with that. Use as a facial oil to treat irritation or inflammation, or add a few drops to your daily moisturizer for a calming effect. \n3. Clear Blemishes: Clogged pores and breakouts can be tough to banish. Moringa oil has a skin-clearing effect and is light enough to keep oily skin hydrated without feeling greasy. Use as a nighttime moisturizer or add to your daily acne treatment. \n4. Smooth and firm skin: Reduce fine lines and wrinkles with a healthy dose of moringa oil. Vitamin A smooths the skin and boosts collagen production for a firmer appearance. Vitamins C and E are powerful antioxidants, and help to soften and brighten the complexion. B vitamins make the skin more resilient and hold in moisture. \n5. Moisturize face and body: Of course, moringa oil can be used for its moisturizing benefits alone and makes a great body oil. Mix with a carrier oil, like jojoba or apricot seed, and add a drop or two of your favorite essential oil for fragrance. How to Use Moringa Oil for Hair \n6. Shampoo to strengthen hair: Most natural shampoos (those free from SLS and other harsh ingredients) won\u2019t strip hair of natural oils and cause dryness. Dry hair is fragile, and vulnerable to breakage and damage. Moringa Soap Nut Citrus Shampoo not only keeps hair healthy and moisturized, but strengthens and improves the condition of hair. \n7. Condition for shine: Is your hair tangled and dull even after using loads of conditioner? Maybe you\u2019ve even resorted to using silicone conditioners to keep locks manageable and looking good. Moringa Oil Citrus Conditioner not only makes hair feel super soft and enhances shine, but you only have to use half the amount of a traditional conditioner. No silicones required. \n8 Treat dry scalp: If flakes and itching are a concern, try giving your scalp a moringa oil massage. Wrap hair in a warm towel and allow the oil to soak in for 20-30 minutes. \n9. Smooth frizz and flyaways: Summer brings the frizz and winter brings the flyaways. Keep both under control with the help of moringa oil. Add a small amount of the oil to palm and warm between hands, then gentle run through strands. Moringa oil is light and won\u2019t leave behind a greasy looking \u2018do. \nRelated on Organic Authority:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "moringa oil citrus conditioner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soap nut & moringa peppermint bar soap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "northern india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T03:39:26.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a97666ad6b59a15342f91d1373d46df99c8ffa8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhk.CYMCSThRBYvjO.ofJZ4oAkkKO_rKfwd8sQDyA.DkIPR4R_a0nVZfp0XNDQy3JOH97HoEpbZLNUOBlLKRRH_b", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Genetically Engineered 'Double-Muscle' Pigs Surface in Cambodia", "title_full": "Genetically Engineered 'Double-Muscle' Pigs Surface in Cambodia", "published": "2017-10-09T19:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.022, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-609700416.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a97666ad6b59a15342f91d1373d46df99c8ffa8e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhk.CYMCSThRBYvjO.ofJZ4oAkkKO_rKfwd8sQDyA.DkIPR4R_a0nVZfp0XNDQy3JOH97HoEpbZLNUOBlLKRRH_b", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-09T19:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Genetically Engineered 'Double-Muscle' Pigs Surface in Cambodia", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/levers2007 \nImages of hogs that appear to be genetically engineered to have hulking, enlarged muscles have surfaced from a farm in Cambodia.

Asia samples came in at 80 percent, Europe at 79 percent, and South America the lowest at 57 percent. Neonics, as they\u2019re also called have been directly linked to bee decline and a condition called colony collapse disorder where bees become disoriented, abandon their hives, and often die. \nNeonics are widely used as agricultural pesticides because while they are effective at killing insects, they\u2019re believed to pose little threat to mammals or humans. \nBut their damaging effects to bees hurt humans indirectly. If honeybees continue to face this level of decline, it will mean significant challenges for our global food system as bees are responsible for pollinating about one-third of major food crops. Without honeybees certain foods will become more scarce and food prices will rise dramatically. It\u2019s not yet known what other impacts the significant loss of a pollinator species would have on our food and ecosystems. \nFrance has taken measures to drastically decrease neonic use, imposing a temporary ban of several classes of the chemical.

After all, there\u2019s nothing more beautiful than a wooden cutting board, but those things are breeding grounds for bacteria \u2026 right? Well, the truth is a bit more complicated, but to make a long story short, it\u2019s perfectly safe to slice and dice on wood \u2013 and it may even be better for you than plastic. Plastic vs. Wood: Which to Choose? \nPlastic cutting boards are touted for their cleanliness and the ease of their care: all you need to do to wash one is run it through the dishwasher. People also tend to assume that because wood is porous and plastic isn\u2019t, it\u2019s more sanitary. \nResearch from Dr. Dean Cliver at the University of California, Davis, disproved this line of thinking. He found that since plastic boards are easily scarred by knives (whereas a well-made wooden board is soft enough to not be damaged by knife use), they can become breeding grounds for bacteria, which congregate in the grooves formed by blades. \n\u201cWooden boards that had been used and had many knife cuts acted almost the same as new wood, whereas plastic surfaces that were knife-scarred were impossible to clean and disinfect manually, especially when food residues such as chicken fat were present.\u201d \nIn addition, even though plastic surfaces \u201callowed the bacteria to persist, but were easily cleaned and disinfected,\u201d bacteria \u201cwere not recoverable from wooden surfaces in a short time after they were applied.\u201d What About Bamboo? \nBamboo is sometimes highlighted as a good halfway point, as it tends to be cheaper than wood and is a very renewable resource, making it an environmentally friendly choice. In addition, since bamboo is harder than wood, these boards absorb less liquid, which many believe make them more sanitary. \nBut this hardness isn\u2019t always a positive. Not only are bamboo boards tougher on your knives, they can also be dangerous to use. \n\u201c The very slight texture provided by wood keeps the both the food and the knife blade from sliding or hopping around,\u201d notes Joseph Barbercheck, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Michigan Maple Block. Blade skip on bamboo or glass cutting boards can at the very least can make you less precise with your cutting and even contribute to knife-related kitchen injuries. \nIt\u2019s no surprise that most chefs choose wood: it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s sanitary, and it\u2019s safe to use in the kitchen. Choosing a Wooden Cutting Board \nWhen you\u2019re choosing a wooden cutting board, there are a few things to bear in mind. \nThe first is the species of wood being used. \n\u201cAs a general rule, it\u2019s preferable to select a hardwood, as it is hardier and will hold up better over time,\u201d explains Grant Yuanu, president of CuttingBoard LLC. \u201cSoft woods, such as pine or fir, don\u2019t hold up to knives and washing well and will wear much faster as a result.\u201d \nCommon hardwoods include cherry and hardwood; maple, he notes, is the most popular for its durability and for its abundance in North America, making it cheaper than some others. \n\u201cTeak is also becoming popular,\u201d he notes. \u201cWhich makes sense because teak has been used in marine applications due to its abilities to resist harsh outdoor weather environments.\u201d \nYou\u2019ll also want to look into the sustainability of the source materials. \n\u201cThe good thing about wood boards is that the vast majority are renewably grown and harvested,\u201d Yuanu notes. \u201cDomestic North American woods such as maple, cherry and walnut are all plentiful and eco friendly.\u201d \nAside from the variety of wood being used, one of the most important decisions to make when choosing a wood board is how it\u2019s made. Two major types of assembly are used in the wooden cutting board industry: end-grain and edge-grain. \nEdge-grain, as its name suggests, is made of parallel pieces from the edge of the wood. More durable and easier to maintain, edge-grain cutting boards are also more affordable. However, edge-grain can also be harder on knives, due to the way in which wood fibers are laid out. \n\u201cProbably the easiest way to picture wood fibers in a board is to think of them as a bundle of soda straws,\u201d says John Loftis of The Boardsmith. \u201cThe wood fibers are actually hollow, like drinking straws, and when you have an edge-grain board, those straws would be visualized as lying lengthwise.\u201d \nWhen cutting, then, your knife damages the fibers, creating scratch marks \u2013 something that Loftis notes are \u201cthe enemy of any cutting board, because scratch marks and knife-marks are places where bacteria can hide.\u201d \nEnd-grain wood is the favorite for most pros. These boards are made from end pieces of wood that are glued together, often in a checkerboard pattern. With end-grain, Loftis explains, you can imagine the \u201cstraws\u201d of the wood fibers being turned vertically. \n\u201cWhat happens when the knife chops or strokes on them is that it goes between these individual straws, and the straws bounce back together,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo there\u2019s a tremendous amount of resistance of scratching and storing.\u201d \nThis layout also allows bacteria-laden moisture to wick down into the board itself. \u201cIn essence,\u201d says Loftis, \u201cIt\u2019s sealed off and the bacteria dies.\u201d \nAn end-grain board is also easier on your knife, preserving these all-important tools in your kitchen arsenal. \nWhichever board you use, it\u2019s also important to stay away from glues that contain formaldehyde. Most of the boards that we recommend use either Titebond II or Titebond III food-safe glues. The latter is a waterproof glue; the former, while not waterproof, is water-resilient, and it withstands high heat better. \nRichard Rose of Richard Rose Culinary notes that he uses type III for boards destined for home use. \n\u201cI know that someone is gonna submerge it or run it under water, and I want those joints to stay laminated,\u201d he explains. \nHe usually opts for type II for restaurants, because of the glue\u2019s resistance to high heats. \n\u201cWe do a lot of pizza boards,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want the glue to be broken down by high heat, so tight bond II is the better choice.\u201d \nDepending on what you will be using your board for and how you intend to care for it, this is a good question to ask the manufacturer before buying a board. The 7 Best Wood Cutting Boards Image care of John Boos 1. John Boos \nJohn Boos has long been one of the top names in American-made wooden cutting boards. Established in 1887, John Boos works with three American hardwoods \u2013 hard rock maple, cherry, or black walnut \u2013 for solid, durable boards that stand the test of time. \nJohn Boos is also a sustainable choice, boasting the National Hardwood Lumber Association certification. \n\u201cOur butcher block wood is sourced and responsibly harvested,\u201d explains John Boos rep Mandy Ruholl-Cook. \u201cNo scrap goes to waste. We use every piece in our product and what is left over we grind into sawdust to fuel our boilers and dry kilns to dry our lumber.\u201d Image care of Michigan Maple Block 2.

The company takes particular pride in its eye towards sustainability: a forest stewardship team manages the company-owned tracts of land from which the wood is harvested, and scraps and sawdust generated in the production process are used to heat the plant and fire kilns. \n\u201c We source generally from within a 200 mile radius of the plant,\u201d explains Barbercheck. \u201cThis keeps the use of fuel to a minimum.\u201d \nThis also ensures that the woods have a particularly tight grain, he notes, due to the long, cold winters in the area. \n\u201cThis tight grain distinguishes us even from other wood cutting boards,\u201d he says. Catskill Craftsmen 3. Catskill Craftsmen \nThis rural New York-based manufacturer has been making hardwood kitchen islands, carts, and work-centers since the 1940s and today is one of the top producers of quality end- and edge-grain cutting boards made from sustainable North American, non-endangered hardwoods like birch and hard rock maple. \n\u201cLumber is purchased from area sawmills, then dried, manufactured, and packaged on site,\u201d explains the company. \u201cAll sawdust, shavings and waste materials generated during the manufacturing process is converted into wood pellet fuel, and used to heat homes. We are proud to say, \u2018Our operations generate no wood waste.\u2019\u201d \nCatskill Craftsmen went even further in its sustainability goals in 1997, when the company teamed up with the Watershed Agricultural Council to install an air recirculation system to take advantage of the warm air in the plant, lowering wintertime heating costs substantially. \nMany of Catskill Craftsmen\u2019s boards are thicker slabs with finger slots, making them both sturdy to use and easy to manage and maneuver. They offer both reversible boards and boards with feet; the former are great for separating meat and plant-based cutting surfaces, while the elevated surface of the latter is great for ensuring that your board does not absorb too much moisture while you work. Image care of Ironwood Gourmet 4. Ironwood Gourmet \nThe unique patterns of Ironwood Gourmet\u2019s acacia and rubberwood boards make these pieces as beautiful as they are useful. \nAcacia is an environmentally friendly wood that is known for its rich, dark colors and its unusual chatoyancy, a property that makes it appear to change color and luster in different lighting conditions. Rubberwood, meanwhile, is an eco-friendly wood that is durable and less likely to warp and crack than other woods and sourced from latex-producing rubber trees that are between 26 and 30 years old. At this point, latex yields become low, and planters usually fell the rubber trees to make way for new ones. \n\u201cUnlike other woods that are cut down for the sole purpose of manufacturing,\u201d explains the company, \u201cRubberwood is used only after it completes it\u2019s latex-producing cycle and dies. This wood is therefore eco-friendly in the sense that we are now using what was going as waste.\u201d \nIronwood Gourmet plays with the natural textures of the woods to create beautiful cutting boards, such as an end-grain board with an edge-grain frame and juice groove, or a patchwork board combining both end- and edge-grains. Image care of Teakhaus 5. TeakHaus \nTeak is an excellent, durable choice for cutting boards thanks to its natural resistance to moisture, and FSC-certified TeakHaus is committed to making these boards environmentally sustainable as well, planting teak forests in previously undeveloped lands. \n\u201cTeakHaus products combine fashion with sustainability,\u201d explains the company. \u201cOur boards are ready-made, stylish, long-lasting and perfect for every cooking moment.\u201d \nThe beautiful butcher block collection of end-grain cutting boards offers a variety of shapes and sizes to suit your specific needs. Image care of The Boardsmith 6. The Boardsmith \nThe Boardsmith\u2019s boards are as much useful as they are works of art for the kitchen. John Loftis, who honed his craft with Boardsmith founder David Smith, makes each and every board by hand. \nThe details are king, here; Loftis works with only three wood species \u2013 maple, walnut, and cherry \u2013 which he says have the best balance of hardness and scratch resistance. He off-sets the pieces for stronger glue joints, and as a finishing touch, he nests the silicone or rubber feet inside wooden escutcheons for a more finished final product. \nLoftis intends for his boards to be passed down through generations, which means that if they get scratched or warped, he\u2019s more than happy to rehab them. \n\u201cHonestly, when it\u2019s done, it looks like a brand-new board,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s also very satisfying, to think that people care enough about the board.\u201d Image care of Richard Rose Culinary 7. Richard Rose Culinary \nA favorite of Food Network and Cooking Channel chefs, Richard Rose Culinary cutting boards are perfect for the home chef who wants a professional quality product. Previously known as Ozark West, the company specializes in end-grain cutting boards made with cherry and walnut woods. \n\u201cI pretty much stick with North American hardwoods because I know that they\u2019re readily available,\u201d explains Rose. \u201cThey\u2019re being harvested properly.\u201d \nAs a one-man enterprise, Rose is able to control everything about the process, from sourcing to how each board is made. \n\u201cUltimately, we\u2019re trying to make a board that lasts a long, long time for the consumer,\u201d says Rose. \u201cThey pay for it up front, but if you can get 50+ years off of a nice end-grain board, and you look back at what you paid for, you\u2019re only looking at a few dollars a year to maintain something that will last that long. It\u2019s almost unheard of in today\u2019s manufacturing. Taking Care of Wood Cutting Boards \nWooden cutting boards require slightly more care than their plastic counterparts, but if you treat a wooden cutting board right, it will last you a lifetime. \nAs with any cutting board, it\u2019s important to be aware of what you\u2019re cutting and in what order. While wooden cutting boards do wick away bacteria, to avoid cross-contamination, it\u2019s a good idea to chop vegetables before meat or poultry. With a two-sided cutting board, you could also use one side for meat or for strong-smelling garlic and onions and the other side for everything else. \nCare-wise, wooden cutting boards should never be put in the dishwasher; they also should not be washed under a stream of running water. Wash your cutting board quickly with dish soap, rinse it, and dry it off before putting it away. \n\u201cBecause wood is still naturally living, it expands and contracts,\u201d explains Rose. \u201cAnd eventually, if it gets really soaked, the board will absorb all this water, and then as it dries out, that\u2019s where cracks happen.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a good idea to regularly treat your board with oil \u2013 Yuanu suggests every two to three months. \u201cWhen a wood board isn\u2019t properly maintained, the wood becomes overly dry and can split or crack as a result,\u201d he says. \u201cParadoxically, a dry cutting board is also most likely to warp, as water will cause the dry wood fibers to expand and cup (curl) when wet.\u201d \nWhile many board manufacturers also make their own board oil, we like Caron & Doucet vegan cutting board oil , which is made with coconut oil and devoid of petroleum byproducts. It is refined to be flavorless and odorless, and not to go rancid like other oils. The blend also includes essential oils, lending the product a scent reminiscent of pine and citrus. \nIn addition to regular oiling, most experts also recommend using some sort of conditioning cream, usually made with beeswax, to serve as a natural water repellant. Caron & Doucet also makes a vegan board wax , which you can use in tandem with the natural oil to keep your board looking like new. \nHelp support Organic Authority!

October 10, 2017 Share on Facebook \nNo food coloring needed for these bloody Halloween cupcakes! This vegan and gluten-free dessert will get you in the mood for a frightful night. With a red wine reduction to give them a bloody appearance, they are a festive yet spooky treat. \nThese aren\u2019t your ordinary cupcakes. The two key ingredients; red wine and cacao (raw chocolate) provide an antioxidant boost from polyphenols. \nRed wine has been associated with improving cholesterol, promoting weight loss, and even increasing longevity. Though these benefits are occasionally challenged by scientists, in moderation a bit of red wine may provide the body an antioxidant boost. \nYou\u2019ll also be reaping antioxidant benefits from cacao\u2019s polyphenols. Polyphenols can help fight free radicals and prevent inflammation in the body. While most chocolate cupcake recipes call for cocoa powder, cacao powder is a healthier alternative that tastes just as delicious. \nA dollop of coconut whipped cream adds an extra dose of coziness to these cupcakes. The light and fluffy texture will make you say goodbye to heavy frostings on cupcakes. Plus, the sweet and mellow flavor counteracts any bitterness from the dark chocolate and red wine. \nThese boozy Halloween cupcakes are certain to be a hit amongst the adults at your Halloween party!

On plastic surgery, she said , \u201cMaybe there will be a time when you\u2019re an oddball because you\u2019re the only one left. I\u2019d rather be the only one, the sole survivor. And in that case? I\u2019ll just wear turtlenecks all year-round.\u201d \nSo what\u2019s Turlington\u2019s secret? Is she drinking from some sort of magical elixir, like a new organic fountain of youth? \nYes, and no. Though she is certainly genetically blessed, Turlington also dedicates herself to a holistic lifestyle that includes yoga, organic food, and a penchant for letting her skin go au naturel. In fact, the humanitarian\u2019s beauty routine, outlined in Peaceful Dumpling , is so refreshingly simple that it proves we can all be supermodels. Or, at least, live like one. She Puts Her Skin First \n\u201cYou can\u2019t choose your nose or your legs or whatever, but you can actually take care of yourself and your skin and take care of you,\u201d Turlington said. \nNot only is your skin the largest body organ, it\u2019s also the largest barrier against infection that we have. Keeping our skin healthy helps it to do its job better and longer. \nAdditionally, your skin is a mirror that reflects what\u2019s happening inside your body. A radiant and healthy complexion indicates a healthy, well-nourished bod, which is why implementing a skincare regime is so important. She Wears Little Makeup \nTurlington admits to wearing very little makeup because she believes less really is more. During the day, she\u2019ll swipe on just some mascara and concealer. At night, it\u2019s \u201cmaybe a deeper lip color and a bit of eyeliner\u2026 But very little. For me, I prefer looking like myself. If you have good skin you want to show it.\u201d \nAnd though we know she\u2019s big on skin, the former model isn\u2019t a huge fan of facials. \u201cI don\u2019t do a lot of facials or anything like that, I just try to eat well and exercise because that\u2019s the best thing you can do for your skin and your health.\u201d \nThe body part she does like to indulge? Her hair. She loves Rahua shampoo and treatments, which is made with rahua oil from the Amazon, and is sustainably sourced. Rahua oil is rich in Omega-9 nutrients and is highly effective for repairing dry and damaged hair, and the products are organic, cruelty-free, and sulfate-free. She Loves Avocados, Too \nTurlington, who\u2019s an advocate of clean eating , is just as obsessed with avocados as you probably are. \n\u201cAvocado is the food that I would eat all year long,\u201d she says. Not only are avocados super delicious and loaded with a number of nutrients, but they are also the only fruit that provides a substantial amount of healthy monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). MUFAs are good for promoting healthy heart function, while lowering cholesterol and triglyceride levels. \nAnother favorite of Turlington\u2019s? Sweet potato . \u201cOne of my favorite meals is still sweet potato with tahini.\u201d \nIt\u2019s a meal worth checking out. Sweet potatoes have many health benefits, including being an excellent source of fibre and vitamin C, which, among other things, helps maintain skin\u2019s youthful elasticity (and remember Turlington is all about the skin). While tahini is rich in healthy fats, amino acids, and minerals. Put them together , and you get one nutritious, tasty snack. She Uses Supplements \nTurlington might adhere to a clean diet, but she also uses supplements when she needs to. In order to help her gorgeous skin, she swears by grapeseed oil. Grapeseed oil is the oil that\u2019s extracted from grape seeds and is rich in beta-carotene, vitamins D, C, and E, as well as fatty acids, like omega-6. It\u2019s an easily absorbable, thin oil that works with all skin types, and is known to treat acne, tighten skin, help diminish dark circles around the eyes, reduce scars, restore collagen and fight aging. The Takeaway \nUltimately, Turlington\u2019s anti-aging secrets are pretty easy to follow. By simplifying her makeup routine, focusing on nourishing her body from the inside, out, and keeping her skin the star, it\u2019s proof that anyone can look better with age. \nAs she says, \u201cI\u2019m much more interested in how I feel. If you feel good you tend to look better too\u2026There\u2019s no negative to getting older.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "christy turlington", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "rahua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "too  turlington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elle magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turlington", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T09:11:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e707c21f1da715a5de04291cf9cd24ac72da0227", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmuVv.v7SSThwNYTDmobxRtD.7AUcqLBGe3eU.YdXGfPyqmm.RibtoPHX50ZfKb7Iou7zFgE5ASSZowqCht1.nUQzRdexYGnjZ26T0I_tRcEuDlXNayeL8gEwdMIECAdQU-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "3 Excellent Reasons to Choose Wine with Natural Cork Stoppers (Drink Up \u2013 It\u2019s for the Environment!)", "title_full": "3 Excellent Reasons to Choose Wine with Natural Cork Stoppers (Drink Up \u2013 It\u2019s for the Environment!)", "published": "2017-10-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-454326095.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e707c21f1da715a5de04291cf9cd24ac72da0227", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmuVv.v7SSThwNYTDmobxRtD.7AUcqLBGe3eU.YdXGfPyqmm.RibtoPHX50ZfKb7Iou7zFgE5ASSZowqCht1.nUQzRdexYGnjZ26T0I_tRcEuDlXNayeL8gEwdMIECAdQU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "3 Excellent Reasons to Choose Wine with Natural Cork Stoppers (Drink Up \u2013 It\u2019s for the Environment!)", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/PeopleImages \nYou might think that you\u2019re making a more sustainable choice when you choose wine bottles closed with plastic or aluminum, but the truth is that the traditional cork stoppers are by far the best option. \nThe superiority of alternate closures like aluminum screw caps or plastic \u201ccorks\u201d is a myth that developed in the \u201980s, following two separate but equally important issues. \nThe first was identification of cork taint in 1981. A \u201ccorked\u201d wine takes on an aroma of wet dog or old socks \u2013 not terribly palatable. \nThe second major issue was a widespread blight in the cork forests of Portugal in the \u201990s, which led to farmers cutting down infected trees. This issue was quickly highlighted by the media and spun into an ecological disaster. \n\u201cThe spin on that was, \u2018See, they\u2019re cutting the trees down just like they do in the Amazonian rainforest! They\u2019re just raping these forests!\u2019\u201d recalls Cork Forest Conservation Alliance founder Patrick Spencer. \nWhile the reality \u2013 that about one percent of trees were affected and removed to avoid infecting the rest of the forests \u2013 was far from this conflation, the damage was done, and winemakers began to opt for synthetic closures. \nBut not only was the unsustainability of cork harvest grossly exaggerated, major advances have been made in identifying corks affected with cork taint before they are used, reducing cork taint from five to ten percent of bottles to just one percent. The reasons for choosing synthetically closed wine seem negligible, especially when you consider the true sustainability of the natural cork harvest. Image care of the Cork Forest Conservation Alliance 1. Cork is a Renewable Resource \nWine corks are made from the wood from the cork oak. Cork oak forests grow in seven Mediterranean countries: Italy, Spain, France, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and finally Portugal, which produces 60 percent of all harvested cork. \nUnlike many other woods, cork is actually fully sustainable to harvest. Because cork is the only tree bark that doesn\u2019t contain lengthwise fibers, it can be removed without chopping down the tree or harming it in any way. The cork tree restores the bark every seven to twelve years, at which point harvesters can return and harvest it once more. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not like other crops which require replenishing,\u201d explains Peter Weber, Executive Director of the Cork Quality Council . \u201cIt\u2019s more like shearing a sheep.\u201d \nThese trees are only cut down in the instance of blight or when they die naturally \u2013 after between 100 and 200 years. In Portugal, where the trade is heavily regulated, it is illegal to cut down a living cork oak. \n\u201cPeople will say, \u2018Gee, I was buying screw caps because I thought I was saving the cork forest,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s kind of a devastating thing to hear, because it\u2019s the antithesis of what\u2019s actually happening.\u201d Image care of the Cork Forest Conservation Alliance 2. Cork is Good for the Environment \nNot only is natural cork sustainable to harvest, but keeping cork oak forests alive is good for the environment. \nThe trees naturally grow in biodiverse forests: each tree sustains up to 135 different plant species, according to the World Wildlife Fund, not to mention rare animal species like the short-toed eagle or the Iberian lynx. \nSpencer also notes that the Portuguese cork forests boast one of the healthiest honeybee populations in the world. \n\u201cThere is a great desire not to use a lot of pesticides or chemicals in those forests, because there is a really great balance,\u201d he says. \nThe presence of these cork forests also keep the North African deserts from expanding all the way to the Mediterranean. The forests have been highlighted as important ecosystems by both the United Nations and the World Wildlife Fund. \nTo top it all off, cork forests are also carbon sinks. Conservative estimates say that cork forests sequester 10 million tons of CO2 annually (4.8 million tons in Portugal alone). \nImage: Wine corks background 3. Cork Stoppers are Recyclable \nOne of the major points highlighted by the aluminum screw cap industry is the recyclability of their product. \n\u201cThey\u2019ll always say, \u2018aluminum is infinitely recyclable,\u2019\u201d explains Spencer. \u201cBut then the question always is, \u2018Yes, but can those caps be recycled?\u2019\u201d \nSpencer notes that for the most part, screw caps are not recycled in the United States, due to their small size. \u201cThey fall through the system as particulate matter,\u201d he says. \nThis means that to make more screw caps, the industry has to partake in active bauxite mining, one of the more devastating mining industries for the health of the planet and for the health of the people in the regions: well water is contaminated up to five miles around bauxite mines, and respiratory disease is rampant. To top it off, turning bauxite to allum and allum into aluminum is one of the most energy-consuming processes in the world, consuming one percent of all electricity used in the United States. \nMaking cork stoppers for wine, on the other hand, is far less devastating to the planet. Most modern wine cork factories utilize cork dust from the processing plant to co-generate steam, and in some cases electricity. And now, even small wine cork stoppers can be recycled, thanks to an initiative by the Cork Forest Conservation Alliance. \nIn 2008, the Alliance collaborated with Whole Foods to collect wine corks from individuals, retailers, bottle shops, restaurants, and wineries. While recycled cork cannot be used to make wine stoppers, it can be broken down into granules and used to make other products, including tiles, footpads for shoes, yoga mats, and floor tiles, to name a few. \nThe collaboration helped to make the program carbon neutral, an important factor for the Alliance. \n\u201cIf you start shipping corks around the United States, then in fact what you\u2019ve done is a disservice to the environment,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cYes, we\u2019ve got the corks out of the landfill, but if we now add more carbon footprint to those corks, it becomes an environmental negative as opposed to a positive.\u201d \nWhole Foods Market\u2019s preexisting internal distribution network was tapped in order to ship the corks in a carbon neutral way, thus negating this issue entirely. \n\u201cI would never tell a winemaker how to close his or her wine,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cThat\u2019s a choice that they have to make based on what\u2019s best for their wine. But what I will say is please don\u2019t close your wine with screw cap or plastic because you think there\u2019s a cork shortage or they cut the trees down or somehow you\u2019re being more environmentally sound, because you\u2019re not.\u201d \nEven without the environmental benefits of choosing cork stoppers, wine aficionados often prefer them: cork has been used to close wine for centuries (cork wine stoppers were even found at Pompeii), and it does not change the flavor or the nature of the wine itself. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cork", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter weber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick spencer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cork forest conservation alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cork quality council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world wildlife fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alliance", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mediterranean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pompeii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tunisia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T09:11:53.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4755fffcab949e69946dd3807544d302b1edd63a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhltcXQDoqsMzYgqjE8kpi6gTqPir09wN2gzEsiSugXMu8jhz.7tRfyJ8tXA89y_GyW.BHcrzsO7KA--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "GloPRO is the Tool All Natural Beauty Lovers Need", "title_full": "GloPRO is the Tool All Natural Beauty Lovers Need", "published": "2017-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-518884400.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4755fffcab949e69946dd3807544d302b1edd63a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhltcXQDoqsMzYgqjE8kpi6gTqPir09wN2gzEsiSugXMu8jhz.7tRfyJ8tXA89y_GyW.BHcrzsO7KA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sarah Ban", "published": "2017-10-09T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GloPRO is the Tool All Natural Beauty Lovers Need", "text": "GloPRO is the Tool All Natural Beauty Lovers Need October 9, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/lisegagne \nDespite spending at least a full minute massaging in my serums and moisturizers with my fingertips on top of the occasional jade rolling , I\u2019m perpetually worried my skincare elixirs aren\u2019t absorbing deeply enough. This fear was heightened when, years ago, I began using totally natural and organic products. I can easily visualize harsh chemicals penetrating down to my bones, but rose oils and aloe vera, in my irrational mind, merely sit on top of skin, coating the outermost stratum. But the truth is, all of our skincare products can use a little help getting into the hidden layers of skin. And I\u2019ve finally found the way: the GloPRO. \nGloPRO is a microneedling tool you can use at home (a more intense\u2014and uncomfortable\u2014procedure is available professionally, with aestheticians, dermatologists, and plastic surgeons). If you aren\u2019t in the know already, microneedling is the process of rolling teeny needles over your skin. The idea is that by injuring your skin a little, it jumpstarts your skin\u2019s innate healing mechanism and starts repairing itself by producing more collagen , the protein responsible for plump and firm skin. Microneedling also paves way for your topical treatments to flood in. These two benefits together, theoretically, produce smoother, uplifted skin. GloPRO takes it one step further: as you glide the thorny cylinder on your skin, the device emits a red LED light, known for its ability to help stimulate collagen production while calming inflammation and healing. Image via GloPRO \nI first discovered GloPRO when I saw it pop up all over the glossy pages of magazines and Instagram. I was instantly jealous of all these women pricking their seemingly flawless complexions while appearing so calm and luminous. And when I saw GloPRO\u2019s claims\u201497% of their research participants thought their skin looked younger and firmer, while 93% saw \u201can improvement in the evenness of their skin tone\u201d after using three times per week for 30 days\u2014I had to try it. \nGloPRO is simple to incorporate into your existing skincare regimen. You roll it over your skin horizontally, vertically, and diagonally for about a minute, focusing on areas you consider problematic. Mainly bothered by new newly formed expression and eleven lines (the creases that form between your brows when you frown), I used the tool over my forehead but also the areas flanking my nose and mouth. You do this on dry skin right after you cleanse and before you proceed with your usual topicals. If you\u2019re the type of person who rushes through your skincare application, this could be difficult for you, but the needles could serve as a reminder to slow down (because, trust me, you won\u2019t rush through this). A quick splash and slather hasn\u2019t done good for anyone! \nThe main challenge I faced was learning the level of pressure to apply. Because my skin likes to surprise me with sensitivity whenever it feels like it, I rolled the GloPRO way too light at first, the way you would when you tickle someone with a feather. I knew that wasn\u2019t enough. The second time around I applied more pressure, enough so that if I pushed the needles in any harder it would cause mild pain. After my minute of rolling, my skin was flushed but I felt no discomfort. I continued this same pressure for the next month. And like the people in GloPRO\u2019s study, I used the device three times a week, making sure I didn\u2019t apply anything crazy (like acids) right afterwards. \nI didn\u2019t see much of a change after the first two weeks, which disappointed me because I\u2019m extremely impatient and had high hopes from other reviewers who were shocked by their results after a single night. But in the third and fourth weeks, I finally saw what all their fuss was about. Having become so accustomed to the GloPRO routine, I didn\u2019t even give it credit when I noticed that my skin looked so good. My most troublesome area is my forehead, and it was smoother and clearer than I\u2019ve seen it for ages. The little lines that appear when I raise my eyebrows were less visible. My cheeks felt soft and looked more voluminous. \nI stopped using GloPRO for two weeks to see what would happen to my skin without it. Yes I know, what kind of masochist would voluntarily jettison something that makes you look awesome? But I needed to conduct my own study, damn it. And lo and behold, I kid you not, my skin started looking shitty again. The tool doesn\u2019t market itself as a blemish treatment, but my pesky forehead blemishes reappeared, my pores appeared to reemerge, and my skin looked less smooth overall. \nIt goes without saying that I\u2019ll be gliding the GloPRO on my skin moving forward. Sure, I\u2019ll still have bad days (no skincare treatment can combat the effects of stress and weekend indulgences), but it\u2019s improved my the general state of my complexion. Now I really trust that my marula oils and green tea extracts are getting in there and working their miracles. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-11T09:11:54.030+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b2d32a7eb785e33857cfeb3b8e50107eb4db4997", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmfhQmTw503TV7_kv7JZQ6cCfkfAvQkF7VtylnIFcXebIMuFFJw_daI_6EBSDM.D5xBWwLQXFrRQFAxwCpeZ6lEW5WV55YgGe0cKYzxB6YICA--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Celebrate Pumpkin Spice Everything This Season With No-Bake Pumpkin Balls", "title_full": "Celebrate Pumpkin Spice Everything This Season With No-Bake Pumpkin Balls", "published": "2017-10-11T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_3274.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b2d32a7eb785e33857cfeb3b8e50107eb4db4997", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhmfhQmTw503TV7_kv7JZQ6cCfkfAvQkF7VtylnIFcXebIMuFFJw_daI_6EBSDM.D5xBWwLQXFrRQFAxwCpeZ6lEW5WV55YgGe0cKYzxB6YICA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-11T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Celebrate Pumpkin Spice Everything This Season With No-Bake Pumpkin Balls", "text": "Share on Facebook \nStep aside, pumpkin spice lattes.

No-Bake Pumpkin Balls Ingredients \nThe base of these pumpkin balls is made of raisins, almond meal, and pecans. Raisins provide ample fiber as well as B vitamins, iron, and potassium. They are also naturally sweet, which means this recipe requires no additional sweetener. \nAlmond meal, which is different from almond flour, is made from ground whole almonds. Almond meal has a thicker texture then almond flour and is made from almonds with their skins left on, not blanched in the case of almond flour. The meal also has a grittier texture, which is ideal for these no bake balls. \nLike almonds, almond meal is a good source of healthy fats, vitamin E, and a variety of other vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Many of these beneficial nutrients are also found in pecans, too. Pecans give these no bake pumpkin balls a hearty and nutty flavor, while also adding texture to the balls. \nReal deal pumpkin puree gives these balls a delicious flavor. Make your own pumpkin puree from sugar pie pumpkins, or purchase an organic BPA-free can instead. \nCinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger naturally add warmth and depth to these no bake pumpkin balls, as well as a variety of antioxidants. Sprinkle liberally and add more spices to taste, if you\u2019d like. \nToss all the ingredients in a food processor and make seasonal pumpkin treats in no time at all.

Spend as little money as possible, and\u2026 \n2. Help you potentially think of other similar costumes that your friends and family could wear, too. 1. A woman running for local office \nIf the 2016 presidential election has taught us anything, it\u2019s that not voting\u2014especially in local elections\u2014is not an option. And sadly, people typically don\u2019t vote, or even pay attention to, local elections. \nSo, if you choose to dress as a woman running for local office, you can do the following: \n1. Answer the inevitable, semi-drunken, \u201cso, what are you, anyway?\u201d with a confident, \u201cI\u2019m a strong, capable woman who is running for local office to make change from the bottom to the top!\u201d \n2. In addition to being able to wear whatever you want with this costume, you can easily make it more fun by creating political signs or flyers that spread the word about the importance of participating in local elections. 2. An ally \nAlthough everyone thinks they are an ally, many people truly fall short in achieving this goal. From men who crow, \u201cnot all men\u201d, to people who think it\u2019s okay to ask \u201cwhat are you\u201d, in reference to a person\u2019s nationality\u2014many people could use help when it comes to being a true ally. \nSo, help educate the masses; consider being a real ally this Halloween . Basically, someone who has the guts to go up to the people in the culturally insensitive costumes and say, \u201chey, I know you mean well, but this isn\u2019t okay.\u201d \nYour costume can, again, consist of whatever outfit you want. Simply embellish it with activist pins, etc. 3. An Internet troll fighter \nWe all know the Internet is filled with people who want to ruffle our feathers. However, allowing these people the satisfaction of letting our hair raise is not the answer. Thoughtfully responding to their hate\u2014or knowing when to not respond\u2014are the only ways to really stop a troll in their tracks. \nSo, for this outfit, merely wear a white shirt that\u2019s printed with various trolly sentiments that are followed by the appropriate, thoughtful response. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T22:13:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "742e68b4ea37043112e4936db899c0a67560efc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlunCkwRvUc8zLysEGH8JEOcI6DJK2oI7XYhpacYbWhHkPrsS6HE53w9wM31LBYlkK9ik0oHPwmYkIfXw1WO1px5ckY4AmsJ3XYBCSCA5eHQpja5U27hoh.", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "A Mushroom a Day Keeps the Doctor Away: New Culinary Guide from the Original Funguy", "title_full": "A Mushroom a Day Keeps the Doctor Away: New Culinary Guide from the Original Funguy", "published": "2017-10-13T19:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/sandis-helvigs-125065.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "742e68b4ea37043112e4936db899c0a67560efc5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlunCkwRvUc8zLysEGH8JEOcI6DJK2oI7XYhpacYbWhHkPrsS6HE53w9wM31LBYlkK9ik0oHPwmYkIfXw1WO1px5ckY4AmsJ3XYBCSCA5eHQpja5U27hoh.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tanya Flink", "published": "2017-10-13T19:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "A Mushroom a Day Keeps the Doctor Away: New Culinary Guide from the Original Funguy", "text": "\nPhoto Courtesy Avery Books/Penguin Random House . Mushrooms are generally segmented into two categories: the kind you toss in stir-frys and the kind college kids trip out on. However, there is a third category of mushrooms that falls in between. This family of adaptogenic fungi far surpass the health benefits of the humble white button variety, but they are also legal and do not induce any hallucinogenic effects. Tero Isokauppila of Four Sigmatic, the company that popularized mushroom coffee, is on a mission to promote wellness by spreading the mushroom message. His new book, \u201cHealing Mushrooms\u2019 Culinary Guide to Adaptogenic Mushrooms,\u201d makes mushrooms accessible to the masses as a complete 101 guide on the feel-good \u2018shrooms. Isokauppila packs a lot into this work; however, the book itself is kept to a non-intimidating length (no encyclopedia volumes here). The chapters are broken down into digestible segments. The reader can skip right to the recipes or take some time to learn about the foundation of Isokauppila\u2019s work. Those that opt for the latter option will enjoy a light-hearted and pleasant read about his life growing up on a Finnish farm, his discovery of mushrooms as powerful natural healers, and the challenges he has faced in bringing mushrooms into the mainstream. Although scientific, the book is far from boring; even the most detailed portions remain engaging and relevant to the non-scientific mind. It truly is a fun, educational read . Besides the recipes, perhaps the most helpful chapter is \u201cMeet the Mushrooms.\u201d Isokauppila breaks down the top ten healing mushrooms, the \u201cpowerhouse players\u201d amongst the 1.5 million species in the fungi kingdom. From calming reishi, to energizing cordyceps, the chapter details the specific health-promoting effects of each variety. The writing is extremely user friendly, as the benefits are listed in bullets directly under the mushroom. Those who wish to go deeper can read on to learn about the mushroom\u2019s history, as well as discover specific examples that support the wellness claims. Each section has an \u201cIn Action\u201d and \u201cFun Fact\u201d boxed paragraph. \u201cIn Action\u201d involves a a short story of Isokauppila\u2019s personal experience with that mushroom, and \u201cFun Fact\u201d delivers a random statement that could be quite useful during your next trivia night. Here\u2019s a quick tip: Lion\u2019s Mane (yes, that\u2019s a mushroom ) can improve memory and concentration. So, if you\u2019ve been feeling a bit foggy, sharpen your mind by adding lion\u2019s mane into your diet (both powdered extract and whole form are available). The original \u201cFunguy,\u201d Tero Isokauppila. Photo courtesy Markus Karjalainen A culinary guide is not complete without recipes. The \u201cMushroom Magic in the Kitchen\u201d chapter thoroughly delivers, including fifty recipes from beginner to advanced that highlight the ten fungi varieties earlier discussed. The recipes are grouped together into categories that address some of the most common health issues. For example, there are recipes to reduce chronic inflammation, regulate blood pressure, promote gut health, increase sports performance, and more. To our delight, there is also a section on \u201cNext Level Desserts.\u201d Don\u2019t be too appalled by the thought of shroomy sweets. We tried the Cordyceps Raw Vegan Cheesecake and experienced complete, indulgent bliss. A few other recipes we loved were the Raw Pizza, Chocolate Avocado Turkey Tail Mousse (that\u2019s a mushroom, not bird feathers), Chaga Chai, Raw Vegan Sushi, and Vegetarian \u201cClam\u201d Chowder. The variety of recipes is impressive; Isokaupplia included multiple options for every appetite, diet, and skill level. There are hearty, stick-to-your-ribs dishes, lighter dishes, raw, vegan, paleo, and gluten-free dishes. Bonus: Isokauppila developed several cocktail recipes, like Cordysex on the Beach\u2026there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s known as the Funguy. Once the reader has learned about the benefits of these mushrooms and how to use them in the kitchen, it is necessary to know where to find them. To address this issue, Isokauppila concludes the book with a helpful shopper\u2019s guide, which includes online resources that carry these specific fungi varieties. Some, like oyster and shiitake, can be found at your local natural foods store or farmers market, but ask for a variety like tremella at the supermarket, and you\u2019re likely to get a blank stare back from that teenage employee. Consult the shopper\u2019s guide of trusted resources, and you can avoid driving store-to-store searching in vain for just one key ingredient. Everyone can benefit from this book, from the fungi junkies to the formerly mushroom-adverse.

Fans who caught her performance at the Billboard Music Awards earlier this year can attest to the singer\u2019s apparent agelessness, thanks in part to her super toned bod. And now the style icon is fronting the Gap\u2019s fall campaign, alongside rapper Future, not looking a day over her infamous Bob Mackie days. \nSo just how does Cher turn back time? We did some digging to find out the legend\u2019s secrets to staying fit and looking fresh, even as a \u2014 dare we say it? \u2014 septuagenerian. She Planks for Five Minutes \nWhen it comes to holding planks, Cher is total #goals. \u201cI started out with 30 seconds and I thought I was gonna die,\u201d she recently told People magazine . \u201cNow I do three to five minutes!\u201d \nThe plank is one of the best total body exercises you can do. Not only does it work the entire core, but it also works your glutes and hamstrings, supports proper posture, and improves balance. Though you don\u2019t have to hold it as long as Cher does (30-second intervals are fine), when you throw in some additional progression moves, like alternating legs or side planks, you will still have an excellent workout. She Exercises Five Times a Week \nCher\u2019s been a diehard gym rat for decades, and shows no sign of slowing down. \u201cI exercise about five times a week because it\u2019s something I\u2019ve always done and I just enjoy it,\u201d she told Hello! back in 2013. \u201cI try to play the age card with my trainer but she just doesn\u2019t go for it.\u201d In addition to working out at the gym, Cher\u2019s also a big fan of surfing, walking, and playing Wii tennis to get her heart rate up. Though Cher probably doesn\u2019t refer to herself as a senior citizen , she is one. And working out as a senior is one of the best things you can do for your health. Regular moderate exercise prevents chronic disease, improves mood and lowers chances of injury. Additionally, many medical conditions common among seniors, including high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, are known to improve with a consistent exercise program. Working out five times a week might be excessive for the average senior, which is why it\u2019s important to consult with your doctor before embarking on a new exercise plan. She\u2019s a Vegetarian \nCher\u2019s adhered to a veggie diet for years. \u201cI don\u2019t like meat and so most of things that I like are healthy for you,\u201d she told Hello! \nBecause a vegetarian diet is often filled with a higher consumption of fiber, vitamins, minerals, unsaturated fat, and countless phytochemicals, vegetarians often have lower cholesterol and blood pressure, as well as a reduced risk of heart disease, which undoubtedly helps Cher to keep performing and exercising as much as she does. Studies have also shown that vegetarians have a lower body mass index than non-vegetarians, which helps explain the singer\u2019s svelte figure. \nWriting in her 1991 book, \u201cForeverFit,\u201d Cher says that dairy products \u201care not good for us. I weaned myself from whole milk to nonfat milk \u2014 if I\u2019m having milk at all. I think cheese is one of the worst things for the body. It doesn\u2019t digest well, and most cheeses are too high in fat and cholesterol.\u201d \nThere are a number of reasons to ditch dairy . High cow\u2019s milk intake is associated with increased risks for bone fractures as well as osteoporosis, while increased exposure to estrogen, thanks to the hormones in cow\u2019s milk, may increase the risk of cancer. Plus, a dairy-rich diet will most likely make you feel bloated \u2014 which you know Cher will not have. The Takeaway \nUltimately, to look as timeless as Cher, sticking to a regular workout program and plant-based diet well into your seventies will make believers of us all. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cher", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bob mackie", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "people magazine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exercises five times", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T22:13:28.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6738fd5f282a6800bc8b5c348a884f8d895d94e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhm3JMykWOtFCVXt0O1kEKK2IUZhlf0BrQYLLilzroH4.mVFUoOaJJqH", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Can You Drink Kombucha Every Day?", "title_full": "Can You Drink Kombucha Every Day?", "published": "2017-10-12T19:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/brooke-lark-210776.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6738fd5f282a6800bc8b5c348a884f8d895d94e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhm3JMykWOtFCVXt0O1kEKK2IUZhlf0BrQYLLilzroH4.mVFUoOaJJqH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-12T19:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Can You Drink Kombucha Every Day?", "text": "Can You Drink Kombucha Every Day? October 12, 2017 Share on Facebook image via Brooke Lark on Unsplash \nBubbly, probiotic-rich, and oh so trendy, kombucha is a delicious fermented drink. But, should you really be guzzling a whole bottle of kombucha everyday? What is Kombucha? \nKombucha is a fermented beverage made from tea, sugar, water, and a SCOBY, an acronym for symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast. These ingredients are placed in a large jar and left to ferment, as the SCOBY (also called the Mother) bacteria and yeast work their magic. \nThe result is an effervescent drink that\u2019s rich in gut-loving probiotics and noted health effects. A 2014 review that looked at several recent studies on the health benefits of kombucha concluded that kombucha is \u201cattractive as a fermented functional beverage for health prophylaxis,\u201d making it a preventative sip. \nThe study found that kombucha is detoxifying, rich in antioxidants and energizing potencies, and able to boost immunity. It may even be protective against broad-spectrum metabolic and infective disorders, according to the study. \nAccording to WebMD , Kombucha tea is used for memory improvement, PMS, joint pain, loss of appetite, AIDS, cancer, high blood pressure, constipation, arthritis, and hair regrowth. It\u2019s also used to increase white cell counts, boost the immune system, and strengthen metabolism. \nHowever, kombucha may have a scary side \u2013 and not just its high price tag per bottle . Are There Any Risks of Kombucha? \nSince the nineties, many cases of illness and at least one death in people who drank kombucha have been reported, according to WebMD. Other reported issues have included liver problems, lactic acidosis, allergic reactions, and nausea. \nSandor Elixir Katz, the father of modern fermentation, writes in his book \u201cWild Fermentation,\u201d that kombucha \u201chas inspired much polarized debate, with claims of dramatic curative properties matched by dire warnings of potential dangers\u201d he writes. \n\u201cMy own conclusion is that both sets of claims tend to be exaggerated. Kombucha is neither panacea nor peril. Like any ferment, it contains unique metabolic by-products and living bacterial cultures that may or may not agree with you. Try some, starting with small servings, and see how it tastes and feels to you\u201d Katz notes. \nThe FDA considers kombucha to be safe when properly prepared. If brewing \u201cbooch\u201d at home , keep containers, jars, and tools sanitized and clean. Can You Drink Kombucha Everyday? \nMany experts recommended drinking just a small amount of kombucha per day, roughly no more thaneight ounces (about half a bottle of store-bought stuff). Anyone drinking kombucha tea for the first time should begin with a small amount, to see how the body will react, according to Organic Kombucha . \nWomen who are pregnant are cautioned against drinking kombucha as well, as the drink contains both alcohol and caffeine in small amounts. \nIf drinking kombucha everyday is your thing, there\u2019s no reason to give up the addiction. If you do experience any unpleasant side effects after drinking, limit the amount consumed or take a break for a while and see what happens when you reintroduce it to your diet. May we suggest another delicious sip ? \nRelated On Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brooke lark", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sandor elixir katz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kombucha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "katz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "webmd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "unspla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scoby", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T22:13:30.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4646edb510fc7b96193f10c7faf2a617fd04d62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkcWHaRrVGC_KflJuo9TJC8p5yb9hasBMEHDiZfQETRb2pXAB5CohLRKgNbK7_mOA8VnKDySQZyBgjEAIpe1x_VCwxYwq0txPP6LCenB1aBbw--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "All Top-Selling Orange Juice Brands Contain Monsanto\u2019s Roundup, Tests Reveal", "title_full": "All Top-Selling Orange Juice Brands Contain Monsanto\u2019s Roundup, Tests Reveal", "published": "2017-10-12T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-673369204.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4646edb510fc7b96193f10c7faf2a617fd04d62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkcWHaRrVGC_KflJuo9TJC8p5yb9hasBMEHDiZfQETRb2pXAB5CohLRKgNbK7_mOA8VnKDySQZyBgjEAIpe1x_VCwxYwq0txPP6LCenB1aBbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jill Ettinger", "published": "2017-10-12T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "All Top-Selling Orange Juice Brands Contain Monsanto\u2019s Roundup, Tests Reveal", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/LightFieldStudios \nNew research commissioned by the advocacy group Moms Across America found detectable levels of glyphosate \u2013 the active herbicide ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s Roundup \u2013 in every sample tested. \nThe group says it tested two samples of each of the top five best-selling orange juice brands including Tropicana, Minute Maid, and several private label juices sold under the brand names Kirkland (Costco), Stater Brothers, and Signature Farms (Vons). \nThe tests revealed contamination levels ranging from 4.33 parts per billion (ppb) to 26.05 ppb \u2013 well below the EPA\u2019s allowable levels of 30 ppb, but it\u2019s enough to cause concern, the group says, particularly if one consumes more than a single serving of juice per day. On average, Americans consume 2.7 gallons of orange juice and three pounds of fresh oranges every year. \n\u201cThe discovery of glyphosate residue in orange juice is unacceptable, especially since a branch of the World Health Organization designated glyphosate a probable carcinogen , two years ago,\u201d Moms Across America founder Zen Honeycutt said in a statement. \u201cThe EPA has had ample time to revoke the license of this chemical and restrict its use in our food and beverage crops. As confirmed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, our children (who frequently drink orange juice for breakfast) are especially vulnerable to pesticides and measures should be taken immediately to protect them.\u201d \nIn addition to being the key ingredient in Monsanto\u2019s Roundup, glyphosate is used in 750 brands of herbicides and is the mostly widely used herbicide on the planet. It is routinely used on citrus crops, such as oranges. \nGlyphosate residue has been found in other breakfast staple foods including wheat and oatmeal products as Organic Authority reported in 2016.

October 12, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/marekuliasz \nGhee, also known as clarified butter, has been deemed a bit of a super-fat in health circles for a variety of reasons, not the least of which are that it\u2019s both paleo-friendly and lactose-free. But while it\u2019s currently on-trend, this butter derivative actually has a long history in the culinary and medicinal worlds of Southeast Asia, and may just be the fat to change the way you cook. What is Ghee? \nA butter derivative with no lactose? It almost seems too good to be true, and yet ghee is very real. \nGhee is a clarified butter that has had its milk solids toasted then skimmed away from the fat, resulting in a product that combines oil\u2019s very high smoke point and butter\u2019s rich, nutty flavor and excellent nutritional profile. \nGhee may only now be appearing on store shelves with any regularity, but it\u2019s been around for more than 5,000 years throughout the Indian subcontinent, where it is traditionally made from sacred cows\u2019 milk and used in religious ceremonies. Ghee is also commonly used as a cooking fat, particularly in Punjabi cuisine \u2013 the regional cuisine served in most Indian restaurants \u2013 where it is preferred to oil for its rich flavor. 5 Health Benefits of Ghee \nAs a butter byproduct, ghee is a type of cooking fat. That said, as last year\u2019s update to the federal health guidelines confirmed, not all fats are created equal, and ghee, as an animal-derived fat, may be one of the best options. \n\u201cThe more we learn about the dangers of partially hydrogenated oils, the more healthful these alternative spreads look,\u201d says Rafael Avila, Director of Research and Development at Nature\u2019s Plus. \nWhile it took modern medicine some time to catch up, traditional Ayurvedic medicine has long prescribed ghee for digestive issues, ulcers, and for the product\u2019s natural vitalizing properties. \nThat said, it\u2019s important to choose the source of your ghee carefully. As Christina Major of Crystal Holistic Health explains, \u201cIn naturally raised animals, the fat profile is healthy. There are over 30 different fats, and when butter is clarified into ghee, the fat profile is near perfect for us.\u201d \nIf the animals aren\u2019t raised naturally or healthfully, however, as with conventional butter products, this concentrated ghee can have the opposite effect, and at the very least, it won\u2019t boast nearly as many health benefits. 1. Lactose-Free \nGhee is both lactose- and casein-free; both of these elements of butter are removed during the clarifying process. Because of this, ghee can often be enjoyed by those who cannot consume other dairy products. Do be aware that this is not the case for all lactose intolerant people, and check with your doctor before consuming if you have dairy allergies or sensitivities. 2. Contains Alkalizing Short-Chained Fats \nUnlike butter, ghee is an alkalinizing food thanks to its short-chained fats known as butyrates , which are thought to promote healthy bacterial growth in the intestines. This is one of the reasons why ghee has traditionally been used for bowel enemas in Indian medicine. \nThat said, you can obtain many of the same benefits just by consuming ghee, as Cate Stillman, founder of Yogahealer.com and Ayurvedic expert, explains, \u201cBeneficial intestinal bacteria convert fiber into butyric acid and then use that for energy and intestinal wall support. Therefore, this aids in your body\u2019s natural digestive function.\u201d 3. Rich in Metabolism-Boosting Medium-Chain Fats \nGhee is also rich in medium-chain fatty acids which, like carbohydrates, are absorbed directly into the liver and metabolized as energy. According to Stillman, \u201cStudies show that when replacing butter with ghee, metabolism increases, and cholesterol remains unaffected.\u201d 4. High in CLA \nAn additional fat that is particularly present in grass-fed ghee is conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), a fatty acid that has been associated with anti-cancer and weight loss benefits. 5. Good Source of Vitamins K, A, and E \nWhen made from quality butter, ghee is also a great source of fat-soluble vitamins, including vitamins K, A, and E. \u201cSince the volume is reduced, the concentration of these vitamins is increased,\u201d explains Major. \u201cPlus, with all the healthy fats, the required co-nutrients to help absorption are right there with the vitamins.\u201d How to Make Ghee \nThe traditional Ayurvedic method of making ghee involves boiling raw milk, cooling it, adding yogurt cultures, and allowing it to sit for 12 hours before churning and simmering \u2014 a complicated process that makes store-bought ghee look like a better option. But you can make ghee much more simply at home. iStock/vm2002 \nBegin by melting eight ounces of organic, grass-fed, unsalted butter in a saucepan. Simmer over a low heat, watching it carefully. First, the butter will foam up, then it will begin to bubble, like boiling water. Once all of the water in the butter has boiled off, the butter will stop bubbling for a moment and then foam a second time; this means that all of the water has evaporated, and you are left with pure fat. \nAt this point, allow to cool for two to three minutes before straining through cheesecloth to remove the toasted milk solids. \nGhee can be kept in a dark place at room temperature for a month, stored in a sealed container. What is Ghee Used For? \nGhee is used traditionally in a number of cuisines, but it has been rapidly gaining in popularity because it is one of the only dairy products that is Whole30- and paleo-friendly. iStock/marekuliasz \nWhile these whole food diets generally eschew dairy, the fact that the milk solids are removed from ghee means that it is not actually considered dairy \u2014 at least for the purposes of these diets. \n\u201cBy removing the lactose and milk proteins, ghee no longer presents problems to those with lactose or dairy intolerance,\u201d explains Jonathan Clinthorne, PhD. Manager of Scientific Affairs at Natural Grocers. \nSpecifically, ghee does not have the inflammatory properties that butter and other dairy products contain; these properties are the main reason why dairy products are forbidden on these diets. \n\u201cGhee is sometimes considered acceptable for Paleo because the milk solids are fully caramelized in the cooking process, and therefore it is pretty much pure fat,\u201d explains Andrew Westrich, Organic Valley Brand Manager. \u201cThe allergens in dairy are mostly attached to the milk protein \u2013 so not present in ghee.\u201d \n\u201cSo it depends on how dogmatic Paleo dieters want to be,\u201d he continues. \u201cIf you truly want to eat like a caveman, then dairy and ghee would not be on your menu. If you want the benefits of eating like a caveman with some modern amenities, then you are good to go with ghee.\u201d \nWhile ghee boasts the nutrition of butter, it also has the smoke point of oil, meaning that it\u2019s a versatile fat that can find its way into your cooking in a myriad of different ways \u2014 and even used for its non-cooking related uses. 1. Deep-Frying \nGhee is the ideal fat to use for deep-frying, as it has a high smoke point of 250\u00b0C (482\u00b0F). Try using ghee to make onion pakodas , a gluten-free fried treat. 2. Toasting Spices \nTraditional Indian cooking calls for toasting all spices before adding them to a dish for flavor. Fry your spices in ghee to infuse the cooking fat before making a soup, stew, or curry. 3. A Condiment \nUse ghee in place of butter as a spread on toast, on steamed vegetables, or on steak. Ghee contains a lot more flavor than regular butter, so use sparingly. 4. Coffee \nThe trend of adding butter to coffee works just as well with nutty ghee; try this bulletproof coffee for astounding health benefits starting first thing in the morning. 5. Healing the Skin \nAyurvedic medicine calls for using ghee for skincare; first, the ghee must be carefully washed to purify it. This can be achieved by combining ghee with an equal amount of water and mixing by hand for three to five minutes before changing out the water. While traditionally, this is done 100 times, in practice, 20 to 30 minutes should do it. \nThe washed ghee can then be used as a fantastic moisturizer that also reduces the appearance of scars. 6. Healing the Lips \nGhee\u2019s natural vitamin content makes it a great cure for chapped or dry lips. Apply a few drops before going to bed, and wake up with super soft, moisturized lips. 7. Ayurvedic Massage \nGhee is traditionally associated with rejuvenation in Ayurvedic medicine, making it a great tool in Ayurvedic massage . Where to Buy Ghee \nIf you\u2019d rather buy ghee than make your own, you\u2019re in luck \u2014 you can find organic, grass-fed ghee at online retailers (like Amazon and Thrive Market) and in most large supermarkets including Trader Joe\u2019s and Whole Foods Market. Since ghee is shelf stable, you can even stock up on your favorite brands, too. 1. Viva Naturals Organic Ghee \nThis ghee has a rich buttery flavor perfect for roasting vegetables and slathering on toast. Made from 100 percent grass-fed cows, this ghee from Viva Naturals is organic, lactose-free, and certified Paleo. \u201cIt\u2019s also natural in every sense of the word\u201d Viva Naturals notes. \u201cIt can have different textures and colors \u2014 it may be grainy, runny, or separated, and vary in color from pale yellow to deep gold. This happens because ghee\u2019s made up of many fatty acids with different melting points. It\u2019s a sign that our ghee is truly pure.\u201d 2. Vanilla Bean Grass-Fed Ghee from Fourth and Heart \nTransform your baked goods, morning bulletproof coffee, and saut\u00e9ed bananas with this vanilla bean ghee from Fourth and Heart. All Fourth and Heart ghee (they have a variety of heavenly flavors, like California garlic) comes from 100 percent grass-fed cows raised without hormones and antibiotics. It\u2019s also tested dairy-free and lactose-free, making it great for those with allergies. 3. Ancient Organics Ghee \nThis ghee from Ancient Organics tells it like it is: eat good fat. Made from 100 percent grass-fed cows, this ghee is certified both organic and kosher. \u201cOur ghee is hand-crafted over an open flame and made in small batches, ensuring you will always get the freshest ghee\u201d Ancient Organics notes. This flavorful and nutty ghee is delectable on pancakes, eggs, and popcorn, too. \nChoosing the best ghee ensures that you reap the most benefits from this healthy, versatile product. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viva naturals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lactose-free  ghee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael avila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stillman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew westrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan clinthorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cate stillman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "better butter", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "research and development at nature", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christina major of crystal holistic health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ancient organics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metabolism-boosting medium-chain fats  ghee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organic valley brand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayurvedic massage  ghee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "good source of vitamins k", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health benefits of ghee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lips  ghee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paleo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T22:13:33.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e657f6271cee2718eda56269bf4f247527abe32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhm.pbCb0dSZJO7KzTp5GS55Qa1HirJpMmVTLVyDwQ2Ko9.BuU3kjB7.zWmgvLzqUBSaSi1Z.Ph8oh3m9jDGPF1P", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Organic Sweet Potato Sales Growing Like Weeds", "title_full": "Organic Sweet Potato Sales Growing Like Weeds", "published": "2017-10-11T20:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-181077113.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e657f6271cee2718eda56269bf4f247527abe32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhm.pbCb0dSZJO7KzTp5GS55Qa1HirJpMmVTLVyDwQ2Ko9.BuU3kjB7.zWmgvLzqUBSaSi1Z.Ph8oh3m9jDGPF1P", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-11T20:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Organic Sweet Potato Sales Growing Like Weeds", "text": "Organic Sweet Potato Sales Growing Like Weeds October 11, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/ClarkandCompany \nOrganic sweet potato sales are growing tremendously in the United States. In North Carolina, Boyette Brothers Produce , which grows about 23 million pounds of sweet potatoes every year, nearly one percent of the total U.S. production, reports a 20 to 25 percent increase in sales over the past few years. \nRobert Boyette, co-owner of Boyette Brothers, tells The Produce News he has increased organic sweet potato acreage to 350 this year. \nSweet potato demand had been in a decline until recent years, but Mike Duarte, of California\u2019s D&S Farms, says that it has begun to rebound. According to Agricultural Marketing Research Center, sweet potato sales have increased nearly 80 percent between 2000 and 2014, reaching 7.5 pounds per capita in the United States. \n\u201cA lot of that\u2019s based on everything from Oprah Winfrey to cooking shows to the Food Networks, and the value of the sweet potato in a person\u2019s diet,\u201d Bob Weimer, a California sweet potato grower, told the California Farm Bureau Federation . \nBoyette agrees, noting that this is why his farm decided to \u201cramp up\u201d its sweet potato operation in 2011. \n\u201cIt\u2019s classified as a superfood,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only good to you, it\u2019s good for you. It needs to be in everybody\u2019s diet. The awareness of sweet potatoes is growing every day.\u201d \nSweet potatoes are rich in vitamin A, niacin, and beta carotene, and they are relatively low in calories, as compared to white potatoes. \nU.S. farmers harvested more than 3.2 billion pounds of sweet potatoes last year, according to the USDA, with North Carolina accounting for 54 percent of the production and California for 20 percent. \nOrganic produce is one of the largest categories of organic food in the United States, making up close to 40 percent of the nation\u2019s $43 billion organic food market. About 15 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the United States are now organic, and the sector is growing twice as quickly as conventional produce, according to the Organic Trade Association. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "boyette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike duarte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob weimer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oprah winfrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert boyette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boyette brothers produce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food networks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organic trade association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agricultural marketing research center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california farm bureau federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyette brothers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d&s farms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T22:13:34.026+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a066de212396bf153a46aa3305ec57a49b8f0afc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkFST.vcZnb7MB9LkB3Rtfz8rE1PmmY47ecvUpZL2CMbF8tP7apiorh9N9PKyrMuJg-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Breast Cancer Awareness: Beyond the Pink", "title_full": "Breast Cancer Awareness: Beyond the Pink", "published": "2017-10-11T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/bigstock-Pink-Boxing-Glove-124681646.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a066de212396bf153a46aa3305ec57a49b8f0afc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkFST.vcZnb7MB9LkB3Rtfz8rE1PmmY47ecvUpZL2CMbF8tP7apiorh9N9PKyrMuJg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kristina Sampson", "published": "2017-10-11T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Breast Cancer Awareness: Beyond the Pink", "text": "Breast Cancer Awareness: Beyond the Pink October 11, 2017 Share on Facebook \nIt\u2019s October \u2013 time to get out your pink tutu, put on your tiara, and fight for more breast cancer awareness. \nWhen I started writing my book \u201c Leave Cancer in the Dust: 50 Tips to Prevent Breast Cancer and Supercharge Your Health \u201d in October 2013, it was a direct response to my frustration about Breast Cancer Awareness Month (BCAM) and the thousands of events held each year in the name of \u201cawareness.\u201d \nMy first issue with BCAM is its origin. BCAM was started in the mid 1980s in an effort to promote mammography by Astra Zeneca , a pharmaceutical company that sells both cancer treatments and cancer-causing chemicals. \nUnfortunately, mammography is not a perfect detection tool. \nFirst, mammography exposes women to radiation. While many debate whether or not this exposure is dangerous, according to The Breast Cancer Fund there is considerable evidence that medical X-rays such as mammography are an important and controllable cause of breast cancer. \nSecond, mammography\u2019s effectiveness in identifying tumors in women with dense breast tissue, a condition that affects approximately 40 percent of women of mammography age , i s q u e s t i o n a b l e. Women with this condition can be up to six times more likely to develop breast cancer than women with low breast density. However, one study of 335 cancers seen only on screening ultrasound found that 78 percent were obscured by dense tissue on mammography. \nThird, in women for which mammography works, the technology has actually gotten so good that it is detecting tiny tumors, many of which would never have developed to a harmful size. Yet, evidence suggests women in the U.S. are being overtreated with too much chemo, too much radiation, and way too many mastectomies for potentially harmless tumors. \nThe controversy around mammography is so prevalent that in 2013 the Swiss Medical Board chose to stop recommending new systematic mammography screening programs and place a time limit on existing programs. The group cited that it was \u201cstruck by how nonobvious it was that the benefits of mammography screening outweighed the harms.\u201d \nNone of this is to say that all mammograms in all situations are bad\u2013they have certainly saved countless lives. But these issues are rarely discussed during the month of October. \nOctober has become far too much about pink ribbons and blatant consumerism rather than addressing the bigger issue. Artificially sweetened yogurt, candy, alcoholic drinks, Kentucky Fried Chicken, toxic beauty products, useless trinkets \u2013 even handguns! \u2013 have been adorned with the ubiquitous pink ribbon. Nothing, no matter how egregious, seems to be off limits. \nAdding insult to injury, companies profit greatly from slapping a pink ribbon on an item and promising to donate to the cause. The problem is no one is monitoring how much, or even if, the company is actually donating. There are currently no regulations whatsoever covering the use of pink ribbons in marketing. \nAnd last but certainly not least, one of my biggest concerns about BCAM is that prevention is rarely discussed in any real way. \nThe truth is, in many cases, breasts become diseased because of toxic diet, environment, and lifestyle choices. A 2008 study conducted at M.D. Anderson concluded that 90-95 percent of cancers are rooted in environment and lifestyle. Only five to ten percent of breast cancers are genetic in nature. Breast tissue is the proverbial canary in the coal mine; it is extremely sensitive to its environment and soaks up toxins like a sponge. It\u2019s no wonder one study found parabens, a toxic class of chemical commonly found in beauty products and some food, in 99 percent of the breast tumors studied. Sixty percent of the women had five different types of parabens in their tumors. \nWhat the world needs is for companies to stop producing products that cause cancer. The world needs these same companies to stop polluting our water and our air. And the world needs doctors and oncologists to start telling their patients that yes, there is something you can do to reduce your risk of breast cancer. And since that\u2019s all not likely to happen anytime soon, we must make prevention part of the conversation, and part of our everyday lives. \nCurrently, one in eight women will experience breast cancer in her lifetime. According to recent estimates , the number of new breast cancer cases in the U.S. is expected to climb by 50 percent by the year 2030. That\u2019s a 50 percent increase in just 15 years. (Some, but clearly not all, of this increase will be due to the population increase during that time period.) \nWhat can you do? \nFirst and foremost, you can stop listening to those who tell you there\u2019s nothing you can do! \nSecond, you can change your diet to incorporate more whole foods and fewer processed, sugary foods. You can also lose weight, drink less alcohol, get more physical activity (movement, not just exercise, matters), avoid toxins in your home and personal environment (including beauty and personal care products), and reduce your stress. \nThis isn\u2019t about blame; it\u2019s about empowerment. You simply may not have been told about some of these factors that may be harming you. However, now that you know you can drastically change your health for the better and significantly reduce your risk of getting breast cancer by changing your lifestyle. \nKristina Sampson is a breast cancer survivor and Certified Health Coach who focuses on the effects of nutrition, exercise, environment, and mindfulness on our health.

It\u2019s Scary", "text": "Treat yourself for Halloween with these vegan homemade snickers squares made with salted date caramel, dark chocolate, and almonds. Homemade Snickers Ingredients \nUnlike, say, a traditional sugar-bomb Snickers bar, these homemade snickers are actually healthy. They\u2019re made with a variety of nutrient-dense ingredients that are loaded with fiber, healthy fats, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. \nThese homemade snickers are made of three simple (delicious!) layers. The bottom layer is a coconut oil, brown rice syrup, and almond meal base that provides the perfect nutty flavor and texture to the squares. \nCoconut oil binds the almond meal together and is essential for providing healthy fats to this recipe. Look for almond meal , not flour, which has a grittier and thicker texture. If you don\u2019t have any almond meal, simply grind up raw almonds instead. \nThe next layer is the gooey salted date caramel layer. Medjool dates , which are filled with fiber, calcium, potassium, and zinc, are blended with water and pink Himalayan sea salt to form a thick paste. Use medjool dates in this recipe, which have a gooey and sticky texture and caramel-like taste.

If we just stuck to the nutritionally recommended amount of protein, rather than overconsuming, an area 1.5 times the size of the European Union would be saved from agricultural production,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cEating less animal protein would allow us to farm in a more sustainable way, with less impact on the environment and healthier and more nutritious food.\u201d Find Jill on Twitter and Instagram Related on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duncan williamson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "global biodiversity loss linked", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wwf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world wildlife fund", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram related on organic authority", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "congo basin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yangtze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T04:51:04.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5769d54b22ac4c353f1848ac8749e3f135548b53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhl2uH0yLStH0m9m1_J21XWXfPughDCf_6px5XmOQovMo9fSir93QrqCHWFdbhUqGiPvIhBCX2abv7Zg0WFA_BhFBDQZDQS2WjJbwU_wyN.WpA--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ben & Jerry's to Launch Organic Ice Cream", "title_full": "Ben & Jerry's to Launch Organic Ice Cream", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.597, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/12466072_10153895996497236_3266449947365013476_o-e1508095079922.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5769d54b22ac4c353f1848ac8749e3f135548b53", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhl2uH0yLStH0m9m1_J21XWXfPughDCf_6px5XmOQovMo9fSir93QrqCHWFdbhUqGiPvIhBCX2abv7Zg0WFA_BhFBDQZDQS2WjJbwU_wyN.WpA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ben & Jerry's to Launch Organic Ice Cream", "text": "Share on Facebook \nAfter European samples of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream were found to contain traces of the herbicide glyphosate in a recent survey, the company announced last week that it would be cutting all glyphosate -tainted ingredients from its products and launching an organic line next year, which the company expects to make up 5 percent of its U.S. product sales. \nThis follows the July discovery of similar levels of glyphosate in the company\u2019s American ice creams , found by the Organic Consumers Association. At the time, the OCA called for Ben & Jerry\u2019s to stop labeling its ice creams as \u201cnatural\u201d until all traces of glyphosate had been eradicated and demanded that the company \u201cannounce it will be immediately be transitioning to 100 percent organic.\u201d \nThe European survey, conducted by Health Research Institute laboratories, found traces of the weedkiller in 13 of the 14 tubs of ice cream sampled in the UK, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. All of the tubs in the UK contained between 1 and 1.23 parts per billion of the herbicide, reports the Guardian . \nWhile this amount is well within the allowable U.S. and European standards, even low levels of glyphosate have been linked to health risks. A 2012 study in the journal Archives of Toxicology found that glyphosate was toxic to human DNA even in low doses, and a study published this year in Scientific Reports found that low levels of glyphosate caused non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rats. \nA statement from Ben & Jerry\u2019s noted that while glyphosate is nearly omnipresent in our food system, thus rendering the company \u201cdisappointed, but not totally surprised\u201d at the discovery, company spokesperson Laura Peterson told the Guardian that \u201csimply saying trace levels are in everything is not a strategy.\u201d \nPeterson went on to outline the company\u2019s plan for removing the chemical from its supply chain, which includes phasing out ingredients made with crops chemically dried using glyphosate by 2020. Such crops include wheat, barley, peanuts, and oats. \nAs opposed to crops that are genetically engineered to resist glyphosate and are thus treated with the chemical as an herbicide, non-GMO varieties of wheat, barley, peanuts, and oats are treated with glyphosate in order to dry them out and prepare them for processing. As Ben & Jerry\u2019s does not use GMO ingredients, this is the most likely way in which the herbicide entered the company\u2019s supply chain. \n\u201cWe understand and share our fans\u2019 desire to limit the amount of chemicals in the food system,\u201d explains the company, \u201cwhich is why this step is important. In addition, we intend to advocate for policies that would end use of glyphosate as a chemical drying agent.\u201d \nGlyphosate, which is sold under the brand name Roundup by Monsanto, is the most widely applied herbicide around the world. Traces of the chemical have notably been detected in Quaker Oats which, like Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream, are not made with GMO ingredients. \nIn 2015, the World Health Organization dubbed glyphosate a probable human carcinogen. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jerry", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "laura peterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peterson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "archives of toxicology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "health research institute laboratories", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guardian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monsanto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organic consumers association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-16T10:25:27.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b548c865c639322ea539592b118d080181f363b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkmXGn560a.jYh2jQW8X_N9M7k9nmexOWXp_wAS2xyrBRYUnwyezzCijvzyc2vE8ajnn9BwxLpCD7MrGuqxL5XaY0JO4HXwUSitM2bL1.HFng--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Sofia Vergara Wears Saran Wrap to Bed to Keep Her Figure (Yes, Really): Should You?", "title_full": "Sofia Vergara Wears Saran Wrap to Bed to Keep Her Figure (Yes, Really): Should You?", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-12-at-10.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b548c865c639322ea539592b118d080181f363b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkmXGn560a.jYh2jQW8X_N9M7k9nmexOWXp_wAS2xyrBRYUnwyezzCijvzyc2vE8ajnn9BwxLpCD7MrGuqxL5XaY0JO4HXwUSitM2bL1.HFng--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brianne Hogan", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sofia Vergara Wears Saran Wrap to Bed to Keep Her Figure (Yes, Really): Should You?", "text": "Sofia Vergara Wears Saran Wrap to Bed to Keep Her Figure (Yes, Really): Should You? October 16, 2017 Share on Facebook image via Sofia Vergara/Instagram \nActress Sofia Vergara is as famous for her bombshell body as she is for her comedic talents. The \u201cModern Family\u201d star recently spilled her beauty secrets to US Weekly , including how she helps to keep her A-list figure so trim: by going to bed wrapped in Saran wrap. \n\u201cWhen I have time at home I\u2019ll do masks, I\u2019ll put coconut oil all over my hair,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen Joe [Manganiello] is out of town I even sleep in [plastic] wrap and coconut oil everywhere \u2013 I love products.\u201d \nHomemade body wraps have been around for centuries, dating all the way back to ancient Greece, Rome and Egypt (Cleopatra was also apparently a fan). The wraps are said to heal and detoxify the body, including removing excess fat and fluid from tissues, tightening and toning the skin, as well as nourishing and softening it. \nSo if body wraps are good enough for beauty queens like Vergara and Cleopatra, then should you be adding them to your wellness routine? How Do They Work? \n\u201cSaran wrapping traps heat and increases sweat from the skin,\u201d says Dr. Sonia Batra, dermatologist and co-host of \u201cThe Doctors\u201d on CBS. \u201cUsually, a mask or product is applied to the skin and then sealed in by wrapping the area of concern (such as the abdomen) with Saran or plastic wrap. Some people will then cover or seal the wrap with compressive bandages or warm blankets.\u201d Do They Work? \n\u201cThe potential benefits are from the products used in conjunction with the wrap that may be helpful as antioxidants, hydrating, or exfoliating agents for the skin,\u201d says Dr. Batra. For example, the coconut oil that Vergara uses is naturally antibacterial and antifungal and penetrates the skin better than most other oils. \n\u201cThe benefit of the wrap itself is a temporary loss of water weight,\u201d says Dr. Batra. \u201cWhile exercising, using a wrap may enhance results by increasing body temperature and metabolic rate. Wraps work in the short term to slim down or lose inches by increasing water loss.\u201d \nThough wraps are effective, as Dr. Batra mentions, the key thing to know is that they are \u201cshort term.\u201d \n\u201cIt is a quick fix to dehydrate the skin and temporarily lose volume. However, the skin will return to its usual size when a person rehydrates,\u201d says Dr. Batra. \u201cIf there are any long term benefits, they would likely be from products used to hydrate or exfoliate the skin used in conjunction with the wraps. Wraps provide a temporary reduction in weight and bloat through water loss, but they do not provide any long term fat reduction or improvement in cellulite .\u201d Are They Safe? \nWrapping your body tightly, even in coconut oil, does have its drawbacks. \n\u201cIn the short term dehydration and fluid shifts can harm overall skin quality,\u201d says Dr. Batra. \u201cDehydration can cause symptoms of weakness, dizziness and confusion. The seal or occlusion created by the wrap could clog pores and lead to breakouts. The warm, moist environment created by the wrap is perfect for harboring bacterial and fungal infections, especially if this is repeated frequently.\u201d \nAnd lest we forget that plastic wrap is not a natural material, thus, as Dr. Batra cautions, \u201cRepeat exposure to Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the Saran wrap may also leach toxic molecules into the skin.\u201d \nShe also cautions that pregnant or nursing women and anyone with kidney disease or fluid dysregulation should avoid this treatment. The Takeaway \nThough a homemade, or salon, body wrap like Vergara\u2019s can soothe and nourish the skin, ultimately, it\u2019s not a long term form of weight loss . \nSays Dr. Batra: \u201cExercise and a healthy diet remain the safest and most effective ways to lose belly fat and reduce weight.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cleopatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sofia vergara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vergara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe [manganiello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonia batra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saran", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sofia vergara wears saran wrap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sofia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T04:16:06.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8cc9f5490ccb5d809885f48486203208123c8069", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlM8D_Cropgkv7wtYbUd_L39usITorfyzuLmgXt3bByjFcbGYaRP0nliI9h16g8PUqkDcgoaUuBPGwhEyDepw4KMyS9fwVIrtg-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Organic Rice is a Family Affair at Lundberg Family Farms", "title_full": "Organic Rice is a Family Affair at Lundberg Family Farms", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Red-and-White-Jasmine-Thai-Hom-Mali.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8cc9f5490ccb5d809885f48486203208123c8069", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlM8D_Cropgkv7wtYbUd_L39usITorfyzuLmgXt3bByjFcbGYaRP0nliI9h16g8PUqkDcgoaUuBPGwhEyDepw4KMyS9fwVIrtg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-16T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Organic Rice is a Family Affair at Lundberg Family Farms", "text": "Organic Rice is a Family Affair at Lundberg Family Farms October 16, 2017 Share on Facebook Image care of Lundberg Family Farms \nThe story of Lundberg Family Farms begins 80 years ago, when Albert and Frances Lundberg first settled in Richvale, California with the goal of making a commitment to care for the soil . Eight generations later, the Lundberg family is still doing just that, with sustainable organic rice production that supports the Lundberg family motto: \u201cLeave the land better than you found it.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re proud to continue the family legacy of sustainable farming,\u201d says Grant Lundberg, CEO of Lundberg Family Farms and son of Eldon Lundberg, one of Albert and Frances\u2019 four sons. \u201cWe\u2019re humbled to be stewards of what my grandparents established eight decades ago and hope future generations will continue to be inspired as much as we have been.\u201d Image care of Lundberg Family Farms A Family Farm at Heart \nFrom a modest rice farm in the \u201930s to a rice mill in the \u201960s, Lundberg Family Farms has grown to a 16,000 acre operation producing 18 different varieties of rice, about 70 percent of which are certified organic (including organic short-grain brown rice, the company\u2019s flagship product that remains its most popular, even today). \nThough the company has seen great expansion, the Lundberg family still maintains a family farm in California, which produces about 40 percent of the rice the company sells; the rest is produced by about 40 other family farmers that the second generation of Lundbergs began bringing on board in the \u201970s. \n\u201cWe realized that the business had so much more potential, and that there was growth in organics,\u201d explains Jessica Lundberg, Vice President of People, Planet and Process as well as a member of the Board of Directors of Lundberg Family Farms. \u201cWe had to make a decision: do we want to go out and buy more land, or should we really be investing in the business side of the brand and bringing more growers in to help us?\u201d \nThey opted for the latter \u2013 mainly because, as Lundberg explains, bringing more growers in was the easiest way to convert even more land to organic production. \n\u201cWe found a handful of growers who shared the philosophy of organic and shared the philosophy of crop rotation, of taking care of the soil, of even just healthy food production,\u201d she says. By bringing these farmers on board, the company was able to focus on the sustainability of other elements of the business. \n\u201cLeaving the land better than you found it was pretty clear as farmers,\u201d says Lundberg. \u201cIt really was a challenge for us to think, OK, how do you take these values and apply them across a food company?\u201d \nThe Lundbergs have since found their inspiration: everything from energy use to packaging to production at the facility is designed with sustainability in mind. \n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to maintain the philosophy and grow it as we get bigger as a company, as we bring more people in who are new to organic and who are new to the business,\u201d she says. \nLundberg works on a contract basis with its growers. Depending on the soil type of their farms, some farmers may produce only rice and cover crops, while others produce a greater variety, with rice being only one piece of their rotation. It\u2019s important to the Lundbergs that there be a great deal of transparency between the company and the growers, to build trust and ensure that everyone feels supported. \n\u201cIt\u2019s understood that we\u2019re all in this together,\u201d explains Lundberg. \u201cThere are harder varieties to grow, meaning that there\u2019s more risk with them, because maybe they have different levels of competition with weeds, but that we all have to take a little bit of a share of that.\u201d Image care of Lundberg Family Farms At the Forefront of Development in Sustainable Food \nThe Lundbergs haven\u2019t stopped at rice. The company has recently become the national leader in the production of domestically-grown organic quinoa, and it has also begun producing whole-grain prepared foods, from gluten-free pasta to rice cakes and chips to frozen arancini appetizers. \nIn addition, Lundberg is moving onto the world of biodynamic farming , with biodynamic short-grain and sushi rice. \n\u201cWithin our markets, biodynamic is still something that people are learning about,\u201d says Lundberg. \u201cSo to be able to really promote it and have people understand what biodynamic is and to grow that market is a little bit challenging. It\u2019s kind of like what organic was 40 years ago.\u201d \nEven as Lundberg Family Farms continues to expand and grow, though, it remains a family company at heart. \n\u201cWe do maintain a family council, so that\u2019s just family members that organize activities and keep the family coming into the business very proactively,\u201d explains Lundberg, who notes that day-to-day, there are about eight family members working together, six from the third generation of the family and two from the fourth. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really fun to work with family,\u201d says Lundberg. \u201cThere\u2019s always challenges, just because family members know you really well, but it\u2019s also very supportive in that we all have a vision with where we want to go with the business and we\u2019re all committed to the legacy of the company we\u2019re working for.\u201d \nContinuing to have family at the heart of the business makes it easy to encourage the newest generation of the family to think about a career with the family business in mind. \nAnd, says Lundberg, \u201cThat could be the way that they could continue a legacy set up by their great grandparents and continue a really noble profession of food production.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lundberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frances lundberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eldon lundberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica lundberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant lundberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frances", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lundberg family farms organic rice", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook image", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lundberg family farms", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "board of directors of lundberg family farms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lundbergs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richvale", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-17T04:16:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ab6cd7b00165caa8e49183da667a110b0341508", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlscaOgikTG4adBHmpoO9kNqmJlpBJQiBz4c_QvGOK8VoHtgbq8Y9ZVnYH5rlZXBJK8VzEcFZnWR4go1w1l_lUxMaChFnbA_0__MI7Mw9BsvQ--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "The 4 Steps Jennifer Garner Swears By to Get Her Body Back in Action Star Shape", "title_full": "The 4 Steps Jennifer Garner Swears By to Get Her Body Back in Action Star Shape", "published": "2017-10-18T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jennifer-garner.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ab6cd7b00165caa8e49183da667a110b0341508", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlscaOgikTG4adBHmpoO9kNqmJlpBJQiBz4c_QvGOK8VoHtgbq8Y9ZVnYH5rlZXBJK8VzEcFZnWR4go1w1l_lUxMaChFnbA_0__MI7Mw9BsvQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brianne Hogan", "published": "2017-10-18T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The 4 Steps Jennifer Garner Swears By to Get Her Body Back in Action Star Shape", "text": "image via Karon Liu / Flickr \nActress Jennifer Garner recently shared her step-by-step guide for transforming her body back into her former \u201cAlias\u201d badass self. \nDubbed \u201cRecipe for Turning A Mom Back into Action Lady,\u201d the star revealed her tips on her Instagram : \u201cTake one mama ADD daily dose one hr @bodybysimone 1.5 hr Stunt Team 50 cups of coffee and three min Cryotherapy. Good luck everybody!\u201d \nFrom the looks of her intense workout schedule, Garner seems to be preparing for her role in the upcoming high-action revenge thriller, \u201cPeppermint\u201d, in which a mother seeks revenge after her husband and daughter are gunned down in a drive-by. \nWith starring roles in high-octane movies like \u201cDaredevil\u201d and \u201cThe Kingdom,\u201d as well as her star-making turn on the TV series \u201cAlias,\u201d Garner is no stranger to kicking some serious butt on screen. Which is why her \u201crecipe\u201d for working out has all the makings of being a success. \nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about Garner\u2019s fitness formula. Step One: Dance! \nAccording to Garner, she completes one hour of a Body by Simone workout. The dance-based cardio workout, which is loved by other celebs like Selena Gomez and Chrissy Teigen, was created by personal trainer and former professional dancer, Simone De La Rue. De La Rue\u2019s workouts combine high intensity dance cardio mixed with strength training, including body weight training and light weights and resistance bands to create long, lean muscles. \nIn addition to improving your cardiovascular system, balance, and coordination, as well as strengthening your joints and muscles, dance is known to improve your mental health by boosting your overall happiness. Who doesn\u2019t enjoy themselves while busting a move? And if you\u2019re not a fan of the treadmill, you\u2019ll like this: 30 minutes of dancing burns between 130 and 250 calories \u2014 about the same as jogging. Step Two: Stunt Team \nWhile most of us don\u2019t have access to stunt training like Garner does, we can do some of the kickass workouts that she\u2019s recently shared on her Instagram like kickboxing and trampoline exercise. \nYes, trampoline exercise. Doing exercises on a trampoline, or rebounding, is a low-impact antigravity cardio workout that\u2019s easier on the joints, boosts lymphatic drainage and immune function, which also works to improve your balance and coordination (which every action star needs). \nGarner\u2019s been a fan of kickboxing since her \u201cAlias\u201d days, and for good reason. Not only is it a high-intensity, full-body cardio workout that works to tone your legs and core, but it\u2019s also an empowering workout that will leave you feeling stronger and more confident. Step Three: Coffee \nOkay, Garner was most likely exaggerating her copious amount of caffeine (50 cups is more than a little excessive), but drinking a cup of joe has been proven to give an edge to your workout. \nDrinking coffee pre-workout will give you that jolt of energy you need to get through your next sweat session, as well as increase your metabolism and cause fat cells to be used as an energy source as opposed to glycogen. Studies have also shown a link between caffeine intake before exercise and increased athletic performance, meaning those who consume coffee before working out can either train more powerfully or longer. Step Four: Cryotherapy \nCryotherapy is used often by athletes. It involves entering cryosaunas and undergoing a hyper-cooling process that lowers a person\u2019s skin temperature to approximately 30 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of up to three minutes by enveloping the body with extremely cold air. It\u2019s primarily used for athletic recovery and muscle repair and the reduction of chronic pain and inflammation. The Results \nThough her workout regimen might seem intense to some, as a mother of three kids with a busy career, Garner demonstrates that it is possible to achieve action star results. with consistency, tenacity, and patience \u2014 which is the true recipe of any successful fitness routine. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jennifer garner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "karon liu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "simone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chrissy teigen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "de la rue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "selena gomez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simone de la rue", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stunt team", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T16:06:45.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d15010e68d6890fccb75090cee5ebe2732f89ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkL4MEL7IiHbroVdknwh6sQkwBkG7uApENkclzD5FFjpI30p_Val7EjHy4Saw9Kl3mRZ2kg2EldCt1k8UiFblk58Lh2lKxxhU.BF2PFuqnIGw--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "National Chicken Council Lobbies for Deregulation of Poultry Processing Speeds", "title_full": "National Chicken Council Lobbies for Deregulation of Poultry Processing Speeds", "published": "2017-10-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-478007224.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d15010e68d6890fccb75090cee5ebe2732f89ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhkL4MEL7IiHbroVdknwh6sQkwBkG7uApENkclzD5FFjpI30p_Val7EjHy4Saw9Kl3mRZ2kg2EldCt1k8UiFblk58Lh2lKxxhU.BF2PFuqnIGw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "National Chicken Council Lobbies for Deregulation of Poultry Processing Speeds", "text": "National Chicken Council Lobbies for Deregulation of Poultry Processing Speeds October 18, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/andresr \nAppealing to the Trump administration\u2019s calls to reduce \u201cregulatory burdens on the industry,\u201d the National Chicken Council has submitted a petition to remove a cap on the speed at which chickens can be processed in poultry plants . The petition, created by the group last month, calls the cap \u201carbitrary\u201d and cites it as a key hinderance to the industry\u2019s ability to compete on the global marketplace. \nThe Council has asked the USDA to allow poultry plants to \u201coperate at any line speed at which they can maintain process control.\u201d \nThe current Obama-era protocol limits lines to 140 birds per minute. \nAdvocates for worker safety say that speeding up lines any further could harm plant employees, who are already working very quickly with potentially dangerous tools to process the birds. Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, wrote in a letter to the USDA that workers at these plants \u201chold some of the most dangerous and difficult jobs in America,\u201d calling the implications of the possible change \u201cstriking.\u201d \nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports that poultry workers are twice as likely to sustain serious injuries at work and six times as likely to become ill from work-related reasons as compared to the average private industry worker. \n\u201cThere\u2019s no data to support that this would be safe,\u201d Debbie Berkowitz, a senior fellow at the National Employment Law Project, a research and advocacy group in Washington, tells NBC . \u201cEven at existing line speeds, it\u2019s extremely unsafe.\u201d \nWhile advocates of the change claim that regulations over these plants are outdated and were developed to monitor problems that are no longer prevalent in the industry, experts say that it is in fact thanks to these laws that many formerly common industry health issues have been eradicated or reduced. \n\u201cThe conditions are safer now because we have laws that were written because of the Upton Sinclair era,\u201d Patty Lovera, assistant director of Food & Water Watch tells Gizmodo . \u201cWe have laws that say that the government will be in plants and they\u2019ll look at every bird and they\u2019ll look at every carcass. The industry loves taking shots at those rules. And that\u2019s what this is. You\u2019re taking animals apart and that\u2019s messy and you have to do that carefully.\u201d \nA previous request to increase line speeds to 175 birds per minute was rejected in 2015, after warnings it would endanger workers and increase the likelihood of food contamination. \nA similar push is currently in process at pork processing plants, reports NBC. \n\u201cWhile the details haven\u2019t been made public, outside groups expect that the proposed rule could increase the maximum line speed from about 1,100 to 1,300 hogs per hour,\u201d reports the outlet. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gizmodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upton sinclair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patty lovera", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marc perrone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debbie berkowitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national chicken council lobbies for deregulation of poultry processing speeds national chicken council lobbies", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national chicken council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food & water watch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national employment law project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "occupational safety and health administration", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united food and commercial workers international union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T16:06:47.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb5765eeb5039d4f2f8bdae5f3df0e6bcf40467b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlM8D_Cropgkg51TJ83YK0OeEy6UEiwLXH3AduIr_6UkTwe6ojsA877rp0KahpoX6UT2PaP2JdRC3obK0QnIBRNOKLsDTiNVbc-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "How It\u2019s Made: Clover Sonoma, A Pioneer of Clean, Sustainable, Organic Milk", "title_full": "How It\u2019s Made: Clover Sonoma, A Pioneer of Clean, Sustainable, Organic Milk", "published": "2017-10-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Cow-2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb5765eeb5039d4f2f8bdae5f3df0e6bcf40467b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlM8D_Cropgkg51TJ83YK0OeEy6UEiwLXH3AduIr_6UkTwe6ojsA877rp0KahpoX6UT2PaP2JdRC3obK0QnIBRNOKLsDTiNVbc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-18T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How It\u2019s Made: Clover Sonoma, A Pioneer of Clean, Sustainable, Organic Milk", "text": "Share on Facebook Image care of Clover Sonoma \nCompanies trying to grow sustainably and ethically could take a page out of the books of Clover Sonoma. From humble beginnings, this milk brand has grown to become one of the biggest names in dairy on the West Coast, never compromising on its values of producing clean, high-quality milk. \nClover Sonoma got its start 101 years ago, when Petaluma Cooperative Creamery began making and distributing Clover Brand products locally. As the co-op grew, so did the brand: the first Clover milk bottles were sold in 1929, and a few years later, a Clover-brand cottage cheese was added to the mix. \nIt is with this co-op background in mind that the Benedetti family established Clover Stornetta Farms Inc. in 1977; former General Manager of the cooperative Gene Benedetti purchased the brand name and brought many of the former members on board to form the new company. \nToday, Marcus Benedetti, the founder\u2019s grandson, is at the helm of the operation, where he still works closely with local farmers whose families have been supplying milk to Clover for generations. \n\u201cThe roots run very deep here in northern California,\u201d says Marcus Benedetti. Image care of Clover Sonoma A Sustainable Dairy Pioneer \nBefore organic was really on anyone\u2019s radar, Clover made an important decision that would change the way that milk was sold forever. \nIn 1994, Monsanto began touting a newly developed wonder drug, rBST. This synthetic hormone was designed to artificially stimulate milk production in dairy cows by about 20 percent, promising boosted yields and dramatic increases in revenue for milk producers. \n\u201cThe entire industry had suddenly adopted that reality: this was going to be out there; it was gonna be part of the food system,\u201d says Benedetti. \u201cAnd my dad said, \u2018Whoa, how is this going to affect probably the most educated consumers anywhere in the world?'\u201d \nThen-president and CEO Dan Benedetti was, of course, referring to consumers in the Bay Area, who had always been pioneers in clean eating and transparency in the food system. \n\u201cMonsanto got wind of that,\u201d continues Marcus Benedetti, \u201cSo they flew out and tried to convince him to essentially sweep it under the rug. He basically said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to guarantee an rBST-free milk supply, but I\u2019m gonna do it. Sorry.'\u201d \nDan Benedetti called upon individual local dairies, promising to pay them more to produce milk devoid of what was rapidly becoming an omnipresent hormone. Sixteen of them answered the call. \nThis was a risk, both for Clover and for these farmers. At the time, consumers were disconnected from their food supply; no one was talking about its problems, much less how to improve upon it. Facing consumers whose only expectation was a competitive price, Clover took a different tack. \u201cWe really wanted to connect the urban consumer, in our case, the greater San Francisco Bay Area folks, back to where their food comes from,\u201d says Marcus Benedetti. \nFrom that point on, it seemed, sustainable, clean milk would always be the Clover way. \n\u201cThey were really one of the cutting-edge companies saying, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to accept rBST from our partners,\u2019\u201d says Mark Kastel, co-founder of the Cornucopia Institute, an organic watchdog group. \u201cThey were non-GMO before there were any GMO crops; they were non-GMO before there was any Non-GMO Project. They were non-GMO before there was even a USDA organic label.\u201d \nBut the organic label did come, and with it came the expectation for Clover to rise to the occasion, which the company did, happily: in 1999, Clover became USDA certified organic, and in 2000, it became the first dairy in the U.S. to be certified by the American Humane Association. \n\u201cThe Humane Association had gotten wind of this little dairy in northern California taking a stand on rBST,\u201d says Benedetti, who notes that while the Association already had criteria for humanely raising swine and chickens, they had yet to establish regulations for cattle. \n\u201cSo they engaged us, and their scientific community flew out from D.C.,\u201d recalls Benedetti, \u201cAnd over the course of several months and a lot of conversations at dining room tables and kitchens with our dairy families, collectively, they developed the standards for animal welfare.\u201d \nIn 2016, Clover took its commitment to sustainable, ethical dairy one step further and applied to become B-Corp certified. The company achieved the certification with a whopping 97 point score (80 is required to pass; 55 is the median). \n\u201cWe thought it would be interesting to kind of give us a baseline of where we\u2019re at, with the hope of kind of improving upon that every year,\u201d explains Benedetti of the certification. \u201cWe felt good that we were there, but more importantly, it gives us something to talk about with our people. Here\u2019s where we landed \u2013 good for us \u2013 but how do we move forward?\u201d \nThese steps have included producing the nation\u2019s first conventional non-GMO milk and a recent commitment to transition all of its conventional milk supply away from GMO feeds by the end of 2018. Image care of Clover Sonoma The Clover Sonoma Name Today \nIn 2017, Clover Stornetta Farms changed its name to Clover Sonoma, a nod to the region that had long been its home. \n\u201cFor more than 100 years, our brand has worked closely with family dairy farmers in Sonoma and Marin Counties to produce the best milk on the market, and now our Clover Sonoma name expresses this heritage while looking to the future,\u201d says Benedetti. \nClover took its rebranding as an opportunity to announce its intention to remain an independent and family-owned company, something that was especially important to the company as large corporations continue to acquire small brands in the natural and organic food space. \nFor Clover, this commitment means continuing to work in closed-loop system, with all of its dairy-producing heifers being raised on one of the 28 small family farms that supply milk to Clover, thus ensuring biosecurity within the company\u2019s milk supply. And of course, there\u2019s a long history of trust between Clover Sonoma and these individual farmers. \n\u201cThey all either inherited the footprint \u2013 the ranch \u2013 from their parents or their grandparents or their great grandparents,\u201d explains Benedetti, something that he and they have in common. \n\u201cOur values were instilled in us by our grandfather,\u201d says Benedetti, who notes that with that much history, \u201cWe get the benefit of developing a lot of goodwill over the years from our employees and our community and our customers.\u201d \nToday, Clover Sonoma produces a wide range of dairy products, including fluid milk, yogurt, kefir, butter, and ice cream. No matter what product it is, consumers can be sure that it is true to Clover\u2019s standards of sustainability. Undeterred by Fire \nClover\u2019s history has twice been marred by fire. It was a 1975 blaze, the largest in the history of the town of Petaluma, that destroyed the original Petaluma Cooperative Creamery, creating the ashes from which Clover would rise in its current incarnation under the careful direction of Gene Benedetti. \nThis past month, fires in Sonoma and Napa Counties in Northern California have once again devastated farms and vineyards in the region, but while historic Stornetta buildings were destroyed in the blaze, Clover Sonoma\u2019s dairy, animals, and processing plant were not impacted by the fire. \n\u201cAlthough we\u2019re extremely sad to see this bit of history lost, we\u2019re happy to report this isn\u2019t our current processing plant where we make our products,\u201d explains the company. \u201cThe empty historic Stornetta building that was lost in the fire was a landmark of sorts, one the community admired as part of our local history, and belonged to a Clover neighbor who has tragically lost part of their land.\u201d \nThere is no doubt that Clover will face this difficulty with the same spirit that has defined its past: one of doing what is best, not only by the farmer and the animal, but by the consumer and what he or she has come to expect from the Clover brand. \n\u201cClover believes that being a sustainable business is the only way to do business,\u201d explains the company. \u201cWe recognize that doing so is not only a tradition, it is an obligation.\u201d \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

rage, pumpkin seeds are a timeless enjoyment that brings back childhood memories. There\u2019s nothing like a handful of warm, crunchy pumpkin seeds on a crisp autumn day. Mastering how to roast pumpkin seeds is simply a must. \nThough it may seem easier to buy pre-roasted pumpkin seeds, homemade pumpkin seeds are worth the effort due to their deliciousness. It\u2019s so rewarding, saves money, and generates less waste if you are using the rest of the pumpkin for carving or pie. Double the batch and you\u2019ll have enough to last a couple weeks. Well, that might not actually be possible since they are so tasty but you can try at least! \nThis recipe uses a secret method to ensure savory, crispy pumpkin seeds. By boiling pumpkin seeds before roasting, the seeds will be digested easier, roast better, and be salted to perfection. This method only takes an extra ten minutes and will have you wondering why you didn\u2019t try it sooner. Pumpkin Seeds Benefits \nHomemade roasted pumpkin seeds are a guilt-free treat since they are full of health benefits . Pumpkin seeds are a great source of omega-3 fatty acids which have benefits to the skin, hair, and nails. The healthy fat has also been linked to improving artery, cholesterol, and brain health. \nPumpkin seeds are also a great source of manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, copper, zinc, protein, and iron. It is believed that you can receive more zinc by eating the whole pumpkin seed including the shell. Directly beneath the shell is a layer which tends to be rich in the mineral. Since the seeds have been boiled, eating the shell won\u2019t make pumpkin seeds harder to digest. Recipe Tips \nYou can also roast butternut squash, spaghetti squash, and acorn squash seeds. Simply follow the same steps as below. If the seeds are smaller than that of pumpkin seeds, then you will want to roast them for a shorter amount of time. You\u2019ll want to make sure that the inside isn\u2019t burning. First, try halving the time to ten minutes, try a seed, and go from there. If not crispy yet, roast for longer. \nSugar pie pumpkins tend to produce the crispiest seeds so try using one for this pumpkin seed recipe. Plus, you can roast sugar pie pumpkins and use the flesh for delicious (what else?) pumpkin pie! Cleaning Pumpkin Seeds \nCleaning pumpkin seeds may seem daunting but with a few tips and tricks, it can be a breeze. Grab a cutting board, large bowl, fine mesh strainer, and pot to get your seeds ready to roast! \nTo start, cut open your pumpkin. Remove the seeds from the pulp by scraping the interior. Try to only place the seeds in your bowl but if some pulp gets in, that\u2019s okay since it\u2019ll be removed later. \nFill the bowl of seeds with water. The pumpkin seeds should float on top. Swish the bowl around to loosen the seeds from any remaining pulp. Let settle for about a minute. Using a slotted spoon, skim the pumpkin seeds from the bowl and transfer to a fine mesh strainer. Then, rinse the seeds really well and detach any leftover pulp. \nBring a pot of salted water to boil. Add the pumpkin seeds. Boil for ten minutes. Drain into the fine mesh strainer and rinse with cold water. You\u2019ll need to dry the seeds, which you\u2019ll do next. You can hasten the process by placing the mesh strainer in the warm pot that was used to boil the water since its heat will help evaporate the moisture. \nTransfer the seeds to a clean tea towel or between paper towels. Pat dry until no moisture remains. This step is crucial as it will ensure crispy pumpkin seeds. How Long To Roast Pumpkin Seeds \nPreheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat. Add the cleaned and dried pumpkin seeds to the baking sheet. Drizzle with two teaspoons olive oil. Sprinkle one teaspoon of sea salt. Mix well and then spread into a flat, even layer. \nBake for 20 minutes, tossing the pumpkin seeds halfway through. Once timer, goes off, test a seed. If it\u2019s not crispy enough, return to the oven for an additional two minutes then check again. Once crispy, let cool for five minutes. \nPumpkin seeds can be stored in an airtight container for two weeks in the pantry or up to one month in the refrigerator. Enjoy!

About 40 percent of the store\u2019s offerings are private label while the rest is made up of national best-selling brands and products. \nWhole Foods says the Bellevue closure isn\u2019t indicative of a trend for the stores, although many experts have expressed concern over their long-term viability with Amazon now at the helm. Amazon is expected to continue to lower prices of Whole Foods items, which may make the spinoff stores obsolete \u2014 or the new norm. \nThe chain says the decision was based solely on Bellevue\u2019s performance and that it is moving forward with plans for 17 more 365 by Whole Foods Markets slated to open in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas and Virginia. \nEmployees of the Bellevue 365 location were only given a few day\u2019s notice of the closing and the chain says it\u2019s working to find employment for its staff at other nearby Whole Foods Market locations.

For many of these groups, the type of small-scale, sustainable agriculture that organic embodies is important to their communities. More than 56 percent of Fairtrade farmers are also certified organic and many are in the process of converting to organic production. Unique Perspective Encouraging Transition to Organic \nWhile organic products are certainly good for consumers, Fairtrade Standards include a price incentive to encourage conversion to organic production. For many farmers in Fairtrade certified organizations, the higher price that organic products command combined with lower input costs, and environmentally-friendly production make sense. \nIn Indonesia, the 5,671 farmers of the Koperasi Baithul Qiradh Baburrayyan (KBQB) cooperative are committed to producing 100% Fairtrade organic coffee. The farmers of KBQB weren\u2019t always farming organically, relying on herbicides until they recognized the negative effects on trees, their coffee, the environment and even their health. \n\u201cCoffee is our source of life, and our future is in coffee. I believe that training is important to be professional farmer. We used to do it like our forefathers, now we are professionals, and we farm based on knowledge and skills,\u201d said Sobur of KBQB who farms coffee on 2.5 acres of land. The cooperative now makes strong investments in training farmers to improve quality while maintaining strict production standards. Consumer Demand Driving Interest \nStudy after study demonstrates consumers\u2019 interest in where products come from and how they\u2019re produced. Recent research from GlobeScan , found that over 50 percent of consumers surveyed had purchased USDA Organic certified products in the previous six months; 26 percent had purchased fair trade products (at a similar level to locally-sourced products). When asked to spontaneously name types of labels they\u2019re familiar with 21 percent of consumers mentioned organic. \nAlthough consumers are less familiar with fair trade labels, their presence has a \u2018halo effect\u2019 on brands. Over 80 percent of consumers said they would view a brand more favorably if it had a fair trade label and 75 percent said they would recommend fair trade products to friends and colleagues. \n\u201cFairtrade is the right step in what our company is trying to do and provide. We want to be part of the solution to growing inequality. We focus on organic, small-farmers and making sure they\u2019re appropriately paid,\u201d said Max Darcey, Manager, Quality & Sustainability at Navitas Organics. \u201cAs we\u2019ve grown, we found that we needed to have more transparency in our supply chains and the authenticity behind that.\u201d \nWith the continuing growth in interest in organics and Fairtrade, you can boost your impact by sseeking out products that certified by both ensuring that you not only have access to healthier products, but that farmers and workers are treated fairly. \nAll images courtesy of Fairtrade America \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "max darcey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sobur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koperasi baithul qiradh baburrayyan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "usda organic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fairtrade america  related on organic authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "globescan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "navitas organics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kbqb", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T16:06:53.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dff65b563986fba5408b62ef9cca75de9c7353bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnwAiKQmMPREi2tjkhrF3NPTCfNygGQNALQRlyvemeLe2N_9hiso6tHfVbElrlCijz_DMhsV9z4FBX6Mh9l1jgG6Y3gEvwn0vSZlidwMvLtkdytVekxC3p.i3UsOuzPiBs-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "How to Tell if You\u2019re Suffering From Seasonal Affective Disorder\u2014And What to Do About It", "title_full": "How to Tell if You\u2019re Suffering From Seasonal Affective Disorder\u2014And What to Do About It", "published": "2017-10-20T12:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-542089316.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dff65b563986fba5408b62ef9cca75de9c7353bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnwAiKQmMPREi2tjkhrF3NPTCfNygGQNALQRlyvemeLe2N_9hiso6tHfVbElrlCijz_DMhsV9z4FBX6Mh9l1jgG6Y3gEvwn0vSZlidwMvLtkdytVekxC3p.i3UsOuzPiBs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dr. Josh Axe, DNM, CNS", "published": "2017-10-20T12:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Tell if You\u2019re Suffering From Seasonal Affective Disorder\u2014And What to Do About It", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/m-gucci \nWe all experience days when we\u2019re low on energy, feeling blah, or just wishing we could stay in bed all day. But if you find those days increasing in frequency as cooler weather approaches and the days get shorter and darker (and then feeling better months later with the start of spring), you might not just be having a series of bad days. You could be experiencing seasonal affective disorder. \nWhile experts are not quite sure what causes seasonal affective disorder, the prevailing theory is that a vitamin D deficiency in the body disrupts the circadian rhythms . In turn, levels of melatonin increase, making us feel tired, while serotonin, a \u201chappy hormone,\u201d decreases. \nThis vitamin D deficiency is typically more pronounced in fall and winter months, when sunshine is at a premium and people typically spend less time outdoors. But seasonal affective disorder (also known as SAD, an appropriate acronym) isn\u2019t just a bad case of the winter blues. It\u2019s actually a type of depression that affects about half a million Americans each year\u2014three out of four of whom are female. \nSAD is different from other types of clinical depression is the fact that it rears its head seasonally. But there are some seasonal affective disorder symptoms that are similar to those of other types of depression: Fatigue, including feelings of lethargy, excessive tiredness, or exhaustion. Insomnia and disturbances in sleeping patterns or sleep quality \u00ad\u2014 which leads to even more feelings of fatigue. Trouble focusing or difficulty processing thoughts. A decreased sex drive and a loss of interest in activities. A change in appetite, which can range from a loss of interest in eating to cravings for sugar and carbohydrates. \nSo, how do you know if someone is experiencing SAD or a more persistent from of depression? It usually lies in when depressive episodes begin\u2014with late September bringing the first signs of symptoms, December through February being the most difficult months to manage, and April ushering in the beginnings of relief. \nUnfortunately, because SAD is so dependent on the seasons, it\u2019s hard for professionals to diagnose after just one winter and typically requires at least two to three years of episodes before a doctor can conclusively label it SAD. But you don\u2019t need to spend half the year feeling like crap \u2014 try these natural seasonal affective disorder remedies. Get a light box \nIf you find that your SAD symptoms are really severe, you might want to invest in a light box. These give you exposure to bright, artificial light, which has been proven to help people with seasonal affective disorder. \nAbout 15 minutes to half hour of light therapy are recommended\u2014preferably in the morning so that your sleep cycles aren\u2019t disrupted and you can enjoy the benefits throughout the day. Most people see improvements after just a few days and get the full benefits after two weeks or so. Supplement with vitamin D \nNot only is vitamin D likely a large part of the SAD equation, but it\u2019s also one of the most common deficiencies. Give yourself a boost by taking a supplement and eating foods that are naturally rich in the vitamin, like wild-caught salmon, eggs, and sardines. \nAnd don\u2019t skip one of the best sources of vitamin D\u2014sunshine! Though it can be tricky to catch during winter months, bundling up and taking advantage of any sunlight you can get will really improve how you\u2019re feeling. Go out for a lunchtime walk or take a stroll on the weekends to soak up the sunlight when possible. Steer clear of sugar \nPeople suffering from SAD often crave sugar and refined carbohydrates, but, unfortunately, turning to these foods will make you feel even worse. Mood swings, energy crashes, and irritability all accompany these foods\u2014and that\u2019s without accounting for standard SAD symptoms. \nInstead of relying on baked goods and sugary treats to lift your mood, turn to healing foods like leafy greens and high-quality lean proteins. When you do get the urge for sweets, opt for fruits instead, and choose complex, whole-grain carbohydrates like sweet potatoes and brown rice when you need a carb fix. Reach out for help \nFinally, depression is incredibly difficult to handle, whether it strikes seasonally or lingers year-round. Getting in touch with a therapist to talk things out can really help, particularly if you can find someone who specializes in cognitive behavioral therapy . This type of psychotherapy has been found to be just as, or even more, effective than light box therapy, and it focuses on helping people learn skills to cope with the negative thoughts they have during depressive episodes. 16", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T12:27:49.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07a24385d75bc6f7e9f1bafc0fc19d2dfb01726a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhn2zp.vECxWXwPFJXuDDQjJE_dFRuY2oZUrHiU13Wj05I25zZ.gKFWeeKBGduRCK80lIElEtMdVyVkvByPiKeXD.bhOKHDU1tI-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "There\u2019s a New Way to Make Golden Milk Lattes: Turmeric Blends", "title_full": "There\u2019s a New Way to Make Golden Milk Lattes: Turmeric Blends", "published": "2017-10-20T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-650997672.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07a24385d75bc6f7e9f1bafc0fc19d2dfb01726a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhn2zp.vECxWXwPFJXuDDQjJE_dFRuY2oZUrHiU13Wj05I25zZ.gKFWeeKBGduRCK80lIElEtMdVyVkvByPiKeXD.bhOKHDU1tI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-20T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "There\u2019s a New Way to Make Golden Milk Lattes: Turmeric Blends", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/13-smile \nGoing to a trendy caf\u00e9 to snag a turmeric latte can set you back a few dollars, while making one at home requires time, different spices, and a very stained blender.

It also contains a variety of other nutrients including manganese, iron, manganese, potassium, and phosphorus, too. \nTurmeric\u2019s main claim to fame is its active compound curcumin, which may be responsible for many of the spices noted health benefits. According to a 2014 study published in Biotechnology Advances, more than 6,000 articles published within the past twenty years have researched the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, and anticancer activities associated with curcumin. \n\u201cOver sixty five clinical trials conducted on this molecules, have shed light on the role of curcumin in various chronic conditions, including autoimmune, cardiovascular, neurological, and psychological diseases, as well as diabetes and cancer,\u201d according to the study.

The sandwich sold out in just a few hours last October. \nThe chain plans to serve the same recipe as last year, featuring a thick-cut venison steak cooked sous-vide and topped with juniper berry sauce and onions. Last year, the sandwich was only available in six \u201cheavy deer hunting\u201d states, including Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. Arby\u2019s expects that the sandwich will \u201csell out quickly\u201d this year. \u201cIf people are interested in trying the sandwich, the only way to guarantee they can get one is to get there when we open or a little before and make sure they are in line, just like the folks last year,\u201d chief marketing officer Jim Taylor told USA Today . \nArby\u2019s will also be selling a very limited-run elk sandwich at just three restaurants in Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming. The sandwich will be similar to the venison sandwich, but it will feature a blackberry port sauce in place of the juniper sauce. \nThe Montana Wildlife Federation raised concerns about the promotion, specifically the chain\u2019s decision to use farmed elk and venison in the sandwiches. \n\u201cThe Arby\u2019s Corporation was probably well-intentioned in their desire to celebrate the start of hunting season in Montana and across the nation,\u201d said Federation executive director Dave Chadwick. \u201cThey certainly probably had the best of intentions, but it\u2019s not the best way to honor our hunting heritage in Montana.\u201d \nHe continued by saying that game farms, which were banned in Montana in 2000, contribute to the spread of diseases and are often used for the \u201cunethical shooting\u201d of animals, reports KRTV . \nArby\u2019s responded to this criticism, noting that the chain had done work with the Georgia Wildlife Federation to best understand how best to work with game and had sourced the meat from a grass-fed supplier in New Zealand. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dave chadwick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim taylor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "arby", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "georgia wildlife federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa today", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krtv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arby\u2019s corporation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana wildlife federation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wyoming", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T12:27:55.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "72a141f18495f95a57bae7cc3966bde19d81877b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhl7XhFKHKBItqQD9cEVEoMgyPWtfDs5FwSc2lW_5tT5q3J.n5YpjT9mUYwjC9S0xicT83vDf92bSWjorCDGDEoNZBWntCD4jHQ-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "How I Brought the Life-Changing Magic of Happiness Back Into My Life", "title_full": "How I Brought the Life-Changing Magic of Happiness Back Into My Life", "published": "2017-10-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/iStock-596044702_AleksandarNakic.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "72a141f18495f95a57bae7cc3966bde19d81877b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhl7XhFKHKBItqQD9cEVEoMgyPWtfDs5FwSc2lW_5tT5q3J.n5YpjT9mUYwjC9S0xicT83vDf92bSWjorCDGDEoNZBWntCD4jHQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laura Klein", "published": "2017-10-19T11:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How I Brought the Life-Changing Magic of Happiness Back Into My Life", "text": "How I Brought the Life-Changing Magic of Happiness Back Into My Life October 19, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/AleksandarNakic \nMagic. It seems to be an adjective that\u2019s used a lot in our culture at the moment. Whether it\u2019s magical supplements like Moon Juice\u2019s dusts that are supposed to give you supper powers, or unicorn food with rainbows and sprinkles, Americans are looking to bring some magic back into their lives. But perhaps that magic is something much more internal. I\u2019m talking about happiness. \nWe\u2019ve all had those magical moments where we\u2019ve showed up 110% in life and been in \u201cthe zone,\u201d whether it\u2019s playing a sport, sharing a moment with a best friend or loved one, or accomplishing a big goal. But they seem to have disappeared in our highly connected, workaholic, sleep-deprived, over-scheduled lifestyle that is making America sick, stressed, and unhappy. \nConsider the statistics: According to a 2017 World Happiness Report , Americans\u2019 happiness is at its lowest point since 2006, despite economic growth since the financial crisis. In fact the U.S. doesn\u2019t even rank in the top ten happiest countries. Measured on a ten-point scale by the Gallup International Cantril ladder, America ranks about 6.8. Out of 155 nations it ranks 14th and a full point lower than the happiest country, Norway at 7.6. \nEven though the United States government seems to be fulfilling its goal of raising economic growth with the intent of restoring the American Dream and the happiness that supposedly goes along with it, many would say it\u2019s not working. According to a 2013 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, one in six American adults take some form of psychiatric drug, with antidepressants leading the way followed by anxiety relievers and antipsychotics. A 2011 government report found that one in ten adults took some form of prescription drug for issues with nerves, emotions, and mental health. As you can see America\u2019s happiness is not getting any better, it\u2019s getting worse. \nWhy is the U.S. more stressed out, anxiety ridden, overmedicated, more unhappy and rich in expensive health issues? Perhaps it\u2019s the endless pursuit of the American Dream that\u2019s become more elusive, expensive and exhausting. Or perhaps according to Jeffrey D. Sachs, economist and Director of The Center for Sustainable Development at The Earth Institute, it\u2019s our, \u201cmulti-faceted social crisis \u2013 rising inequality, corruption, isolation and distrust.\u201d In today\u2019s turbulent political crisis, one can conclude it\u2019s probably a combination of all of the above. \nRelying on outside sources like our government to be our source of happiness is the wrong approach, because it\u2019s failing us. In today\u2019s turbulent world you have to be willing to take 100 percent of the responsibility for your life, and that includes your happiness and health. You can not rely on outside forces or others to make you happy and healthy and there are tools that can help you do this, like The Art of Living\u2019s Happiness Program. \nImage via Art of Living Foundation \nFounded by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in 1981, The Art of Living Foundation is an international, nonprofit, humanitarian and educational non-governmental organization. Considered by many to be a living saint, Shankar\u2019s vision is for all to live in a stress-free, violence-free society. Powered by educational and self development courses that utilize ancient practices like yoga, meditation and breathing techniques, students of the foundation uncover and rediscover who they really are, deep pools of energy and a renewed joy and passion to live the life they are meant to live. \nThe Art of Living Foundation\u2019s flagship retreat center in Boone, North Carolina, is set atop Heavenly Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains, a range that\u2019s over one billion years old. The property spans over 380 acres. Legend has it that these mountains house some of the oldest quartz in the world that carry a special spiritual energy. \nThis peaceful getaway is for the wellness warrior and spiritual seeker alike, seeking authentic personal transformation. Launched in June 2012, the property was initially developed by the Transcendental Meditation community in 1999 as a retreat center, but was abandoned several years later. In 2011, The Art of Living Foundation purchased and renovated it turning it into their flagship retreat center (they have more than 10,000 centers worldwide in 155 countries). \nI had the opportunity to experience the retreat\u2019s signature Happiness Program in the Blue Ridge Mountains. When I showed up I knew nothing about the program, the foundation, or it\u2019s founder and mission. I arrived exhausted and overworked. In fact, at the time, I thought there was something wrong with me. My energy was off, I mean really off, so much so that all my tricks stopped working, my supplements, my exercise, my tea. The brain fog was high and energy depleted. But I was willing to give this program a chance because I knew something had to change. And truth be told, I needed to bring some happiness back into my life. I love what I do and I have a great life, but something wasn\u2019t right. I was willing to give this program 110 percent of my focus that weekend. After all, I had nothing to lose except stress, anxiety, and worry. \nThe program started on a late Friday afternoon with some education, meditation, and breathing exercises. After dragging myself out of bed that morning, recovering from the jet lag of traveling east, I thought it would be an early night for me after our session. When I returned to my room I unexpectedly stayed up an hour-and-a-half past my usual bedtime because of an unusual surge of energy that emerged through me. I thought for sure I would have a hard time waking up the next day and getting to the early morning yoga class (when it comes to sleep, I\u2019m an an eight hour minimum type of gal, many times nine, and when I don\u2019t get enough sleep, I\u2019m cranky). Surprisingly, the next morning, I easily awoke before my alarm went off, on seven hours sleep. I was stunned. \nImage via Art of Living Foundation Day two and three consisted of yoga, more education, meditation, and breathing exercises. In between sessions we dined on delicious Ayurvedic vegetarian fare made by the retreat\u2019s onsite chefs; much of the food is grown in their organic garden on the premises. With floor to ceiling windows and breathtaking panoramic views of the Blue Ridge mountains, the dining hall is a place to sit in silence while resting your eyes on the gorgeous view. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll get to see an ocean of clouds delicately winding their way through the soft rolling mountains. When you sit down, don\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t want to touch your cell phone for fear it will rudely disrupt the breathtaking views and peaceful energy that exudes from this magical place. \nImage via Art of Living Foundation Afternoon breaks can be filled with spa treatments from the center\u2019s award-winning Shankara Ayurveda Spa that offers traditional Ayurvedic treatments to help you further unwind, rest, and relax (they are not required by the program, they are optional and but highly recommended). \nEvenings can be capped off laughing wildly by a bonfire with newfound friends from the program or enjoying some kirtan music to help distract you from your chatty mind. Mornings and breaks can also be spent walking through the gentle woods of the surrounding forests to help ground and reconnect you with mother nature. If you\u2019re seeking answers to life\u2019s questions, take a walk through the labyrinth. And if you really want to go deep, step into one of their meditation halls built according to the ancient architectural principals of Vastu Shastra, the Indian version of feng shui, designed to focus the mind and lift the spirit. For instance, the entrance to the meditation halls face east for sunrise, while natural light floods through the rising pyramid of skylights creating a vibe of intense positive energy. \nBy the end of the program you may be laughing and skipping back (literally) to your room feeling high on life with a reservoir of energy you may not have felt in years (yes, I experienced this). If this happens to you, consider yourself lucky; it doesn\u2019t happen for everyone (some even leave the program before it\u2019s over). Only those that choose to show up and give 100 percent get 100 percent in return. When you leave you may not want to jump into those old habits that create anxiety, zap your energy, and leave you feeling lifeless \u2013 and unhappy. \nWhen you return to your life, your music may dance a little more. The flavors in your food might taste more alive. The sunrise might twinkle a little brighter and the sunset glow a little longer. Your day-to-day life and work might feel \u2013 a little more effortless. \nYou might laugh a little harder, smile a little more, breathe a little easier, and even experience a calm mind and deep sleep. You also might be grateful for a few more things in your life. And even thankful for your first world life. Your problems might feel just a tinny bit smaller. \nThat\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t have challenges in your life, or downs with the new highs. You\u2019ll have them, you\u2019ll just have a new set of tools to deal with them \u2013 to bring you back to your natural state. Back to your authentic, natural self with a relaxed nervous system and calm mind that will allow you to live a little lighter and happier in your everyday life. \nWhen you depart the program you\u2019ll leave with new skills to take home and practice daily to help keep you centered and calm. The center will even connect you with an Art of Living organization in your city so you can continue to practice your new skills with people who live it. But you must practice and implement your new tools, ideally daily. They say it takes 40 days of practice to create a new habit. After all it took you years to create your habits of anxiety, stress, and unhappiness. I\u2019m told that even if you miss a day in the first 40 days you must start over. Have I achieved the 40 days straight? No. But I\u2019ve gotten pretty darn close, and my new meditations and breathing practices are a part of my weekly life, and I\u2019ve even connected with my local Art of Living center and go their weekly for longer sessions. \nWhen I look back, I had no idea how much stress and anxiety I was carrying. It was too much. So much so that my energy tanks were depleted and headed for burn out. This retreat had a huge impact on my life. Quite simply: it changed it.

(And they are natural, too!) 1. Sutil from Self Serve \nSelf Serve is a feminist, sex-positive sex shop in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Self Serve specializes in selling sex toys, lubricants, and more that can enhance any person\u2019s sex life. \nWe\u2019re highlighting Sutil because it\u2019s a water-based lubricant. This lube is thicker than most water-based lubes, so, it will last for longer sexual sessions. It\u2019s considered medium-thick and is perfect for sensitive skin. It\u2019s also ideal for easy cleanup, vegan, glycerin and paraben-free, and has a neutral taste. It\u2019s packaged in an \u201cEco-Tube\u201d\u2014packaging that\u2019s better for the environment\u2014that will biodegrade in a landfill in a year. Priced at $15.95. 2. Aloe Cadabra, Natural Aloe (unscented) \nAloe Cadabra was created by a couple\u2014who happen to also be organic farmers\u2014who were frustrated with the lubricants on the market. \nAloe Cadabra is a Ph-balanced personal lube and daily moisturizer. The lube mimics vaginal mucosa. It\u2019s FDA-cleared, certified by NSF organic standards, and made with 95 percent Organic Aloe Vera. It\u2019s also free of hormones, parabens, glycerin, and toxic chemicals. Priced at $11.95. Search the company\u2019s site to discover all the brand\u2019s various scents and styles. 3. Good Clean Love Almost Naked Personal Lubricant \nGood Clean Love \u2019s Almost Naked Lube is water-based and made with aloe vera. It\u2019s great for all skin types. In addition to being easy to clean-up and non-sticky, it also contains food grade flavors\u2014lemon and vanilla. Priced at $9.49. Bonus: Organic Olive or Coconut Oil \nBoth Melissa Eboli , owner of ViaMelissa, LLC, and Jill Crosby , owner and founder of the Conscious Dating Network, think that the best natural lubes are already in your kitchen cabinet. \nEboli recommends organic olive oil, a product she thinks works just as good if not better than its chemical counterparts. \u201cIt\u2019s food-based, safe for internal use, most people are not allergic to it, and it does not dry out like KY Jelly, or other synthetic agents,\u201d she adds. Crosby, however, prefers organic coconut oil. However, it should be stressed that you should not use them with condoms as oil-based lubricants can deteriorate the efficacy of condoms. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "unspl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elizabeth tsung", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "viamelissa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jill crosby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa eboli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sutil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aloe cadabra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nsf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "conscious dating network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eboli", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crosby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albuquerque", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-20T12:27:58.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1b85e8f3b67e25eea65bf27e1651a2ce903817db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhntsmxa6pJCHnX18czeibSNLYFLO37Nt.Z_ORBaO1Yaj2z5hBy8FMCQJPtp3JjUHZhdf8TErOWEH3.953zi3xEg", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Yasss!

Allow us to explain why this cookie recipe is just about as amazing as cookies get. \nWe get it. Homemade cookies almost always make us think of grandma lovingly pulling out trays of ooey gooey chocolate chip cookies from the oven and serving them up alongside a tall, cook glass of milk. Of course, those magical ( sugar and refined-flour filled) cookies have their place. \nBut these no bake cookies are one of the easiest ways to make something nutrient dense and energy packed that requires literally no time (or skill) at all to make and no oven required. Even better, with the kids (or yourself) going back to school, there\u2019s no better snack or sweet treat to have on hand than these babies. \nPacked with just five simple, and pantry-stocked, ingredients, there\u2019s no excuse not to make these no-bake cacao cookies as soon as possible. Why? To be a total convert on the whole raw vegan cookie thing, of course. Those whole food ingredients include: Medjool Dates \nOnly the stickiest and sweetest dates will do for these raw cookies. Look for Medjool dates, which are the plumpest and juiciest dates to help bind the cookie batter together. Nutritionally, dates are whole food superstars packed with 16 vitamins and minerals including potassium for muscle recovery and electrolyte balance. Even better, dates are filled with digestive friendly fiber, with about 6.7 grams in a 100 gram serving of the fruit. Almonds \nWhole almonds are used to provide texture and substance to our no-bake cookies. Along with a sweet taste, almonds boast tons of body loving benefits as well. Eating a small handful of the nuts, about 28 grams, contains 3.5 grams fiber, 6 grams protein, 14 grams fat (9 of which are heart loving monounsaturated), 37 percent RDA vitamin E, 32 percent RDA manganese, and 20% RDA magnesium. These nutrient-packed nuts are thought to assist with blood sugar control and even lower LDL cholesterol levels. Those who are sensitive or allergic to almonds can easily swap the nuts with another nut (walnut, pecan, cashew), pumpkin or sunflower seeds. Sunflower Seeds \nAlong with providing skin-loving vitamin E (82 percent RDA in just 35 grams), sunflower seeds are filled with copper, vitamin B1, and manganese. Peanut Butter \nIf you love the taste of peanut butter as much as we do, then by all means go for the peanut buttahhh. If not, swap the PB with almond, sunflower, or cashew butter instead. If you stick with peanuts, you\u2019ll know that you\u2019ll reap healthy monounsaturated fats, protein, and a variety of vitamins and minerals. In fact, peanuts are one of the richest sources of biotin , a vitamin important during pregnancy and for metabolism and tissue maintenance. Always chose organic peanut butter from a reputable company to get the best PB out there. Cacao Powder \nChocolate lovers take note. It\u2019s cacao\u2013pure raw chocolate\u2013not a Snickers bar that provides the health benefits associated with chocolate. Cacao is loaded with vitamins and minerals including fiber, iron, magnesium, and manganese along with potassium, phosphorus, zinc, and magnesium. Cacao lovers reap tons of body-loving benefits of which include enhanced memory , improved blood flow and lower blood pressure , and protection against free radical oxidation due to cacao\u2019s ample amount of antioxidants. Look for organic, unrefined cacao powder at your local health food store or online for the best quality goodness. \nThose five healthy-girl pantry staples along with your trusty food processor are enough to whip up raw cacao cookies worthy of any adventure or long-ass-day. These raw cookies are not only energizing and packed with nutrients, but they taste divine and absolutely rich too. \nThey\u2019re the perfect sweet treat for lunchboxes, late summer camping trips, hangry outbreaks, and midnight chocolate cravings. The fact that these cookies are raw, vegan, refined sugar free, dairy free, and easy to make too? How sweet is that.

That move could make lobbying and meetings with government agencies more accessible to the company directly, removing the need for a proxy that the GMA serves as. \nBut according to sources that spoke with Politico, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s decision came over differences on \u201ckey nutrition issues\u201d it had with the GMA.

Consumers are aware of what they do and don\u2019t want in their beauty and personal care, for the most part. Shopping for safe products and supporting the brands who make them is a different story. \nHere\u2019s the deal: Natural is up to interpretation. At this point, there is no legal definition of the term \u201cnatural\u201d. Organic isn\u2019t always what it\u2019s cracked up to be either. While there are strict and specific regulations covering organic standards, simply using the term \u201corganic\u201d on a product label does not equal toxin-free. \nSo, how are you supposed to know if the products you purchase live up to your standards? How do you know who to trust in the rapidly expanding beauty marketplace? \nAnyone can slap fancy terminology and natural looking labeling on a product. As May Lindstrom, Founder of May Lindstrom Skin , says, \u201cIt\u2019s not about being an \u2018organic\u2019 brand as much as it is upholding my promise to create the highest possible quality skin treats that I am capable of.\u201d \nThose brands that have a strict commitment to using the highest quality healthy ingredients and never use toxins in their creations. The ones that started out in this business when natural beauty was seen as hippy dippy or granola. Those who painstakingly researched which ingredients they want to use in their products, how to source them so they are not only the safest but benefit communities and are gentlest on the environment. Those are the brands we should follow, put stock in, and purchase from. \nLook for those brands that align with your values and walk the talk. As Victoria Fantauzzi Cofounder of La Bella Figura Beauty put it, \u201c[Authentic natural beauty brands] have stories to tell that connect artisanal, highly effective products with the customer coveting quality over marketing, hype and old-school PR.\u201d \nYou\u2019ve seen it before. A conventional beauty brand starts making a splash with \u201cnatural\u201d beauty products. They\u2019ve been around forever, have a solid reputation, and have sold kajillions of products. And now they are adding a natural ingredient or two, maybe even some organic ingredients, to their formulations. Do you trust that these products are healthy and safe? \nThe best way to know \u2026 read those ingredient listings. It may seem old school, time consuming, and (let\u2019s face it) sort of boring, but it is still the only way to truly know what ingredients are used to make a product. Natural Beauty Label Reading Made Easy \nLabel reading isn\u2019t so bad once you get the hang of it. Here\u2019s a little cheat sheet for label reading made easy. Forget the front label and go straight to the ingredient listing. Cosmetic product listings are the same as food, listed in descending order of predominance. So, if a product is made mainly of water, water will be the first ingredient listed, and so on. While getting familiar with all nasty ingredients in cosmetics is a good idea, it\u2019s a lot to remember. Here\u2019s a handy list of ingredients to avoid and healthy alternatives to have nearby as you shop. Check the first five and the last five. The first five ingredients make up the majority of the product. This is where you will find synthetic emollients and harsh foaming agents. The last five ingredients are often preservatives and fragrance ingredients. Fragrance ingredients do not need to be listed so that brands can protect their trade secret recipe. If \u201cfragrance\u201d is on the list, check for a notation to see if those ingredients are naturally sourced. Many brands follow the European INCI ingredient listings, using Latin names for ingredients, and you can check those here . Get to know your organics. \u201c100% Organic\u201d means the product contains only organically produced ingredients, \u201cCertified Organic\u201d must contain at least 95% organically produced ingredients, and \u201cMade with Organic Ingredients\u201d means the product contains at least 70% organically produced ingredients. You Get What You Pay For \nYou know how your expectations for a cheap makeup or skincare product is lower than when you spend good cash on an item? Yes, natural and organic products are often, but not always, pricier than conventional drug store brands. \nSerums and facial oils, for instance, tend to run on the higher end of the price spectrum. That\u2019s because the ingredients used in these types of products are more concentrated and usually more expensive. This may drive the cost up, but it should also mean a higher quality product. \nMost often, authentic brands like to share the reason they choose the ingredients they use. And that\u2019s because they\u2019ve put the time and effort into knowing those ingredients and have created their own product formulations. \u201cI\u2019m amused by brand founders who clearly have little knowledge of their product formulas,\u201d says Heather Hamilton, Founder of Zoe Organics . \u201cWho default entirely to outside labs to tweak stock formulas and develop their line.\u201d \nMost authentic brands have a select few that are their star ingredients and will share why they like those ingredients and what they will do for skin. \u201cOur story begins with creativity and a passion for the ingredient and then we study,\u201d said Fantauzzi. \u201cAt the end of the day, no matter how pretty the product looks in its packaging if it isn\u2019t effective then what\u2019s the point?\u201d \nYou can find very affordable natural products but it is important to put your bucks where it counts. \u201cMaybe you can\u2019t afford a really expensive, 100% natural brand so you make compromises,\u201d says Adina Grigore, Founder of S.W. Basics . \u201cThat\u2019s fine. What\u2019s not fine is being in the dark about your choices because a brand is desperately trying to market to you, and they have to lie to do that.\u201d \nCheck out brand websites and look for their ingredient commitment and information on the ingredients they source. If they are simply putting up flashy terms or using the latest \u201cit\u201d ingredient with nothing to back it up, be cautious. Who\u2019s In Charge, Anyway? \nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees cosmetics regulation in the U.S. Unfortunately, cosmetics are under-regulated, ingredient research is significantly overdue, and standards are in need of modernization. In short, you can\u2019t rely on the FDA to identify a natural beauty product that is free from synthetic garbage. \nSince the terms \u201cnatural\u201d and \u201corganic\u201d are little help in determining a toxin-free product, some natural beauty brands have sought other means of safety identification. \u201cWe earned the license to manufacture under the rigorous global ECOCERT \u00ae standards to ensure that our products meet the highest quality, certified natural and organic, cruelty-free and environmentally friendly standards,\u201d President of One Love Organics Suzanne LeRoux said. \u201cIt is a big commitment but was important to us to have an industry \u201cdefinition\u201d of natural and organic and so customers don\u2019t have the added worry and guesswork about our ingredients, manufacturing practices or environmental practices.\u201d \nThis doesn\u2019t mean that products that aren\u2019t ECOCERT \u00ae certified are not safe, but it is one example of how authentic brands are taking natural beauty labeling into their own hands. Until more stringent standards are set by the government, consumers need to educate themselves and know what to look for in beauty and personal care, especially with the surge in natural beauty products hitting the market. \nAs Founder of Soapwalla Rachel Winard said, \u201c\u2026the more popular a concept becomes, the more saturated the market becomes \u2013 with brands that have all sorts of goals. It\u2019s still up to us as passionate trailblazers to continue to educate ourselves and the public, and to continue to push ourselves to make the best possible products.\u201d \nAnd that\u2019s another thing that is different about authentic natural beauty brands. Their support of each other. As Hamilton notes, \u201cI have a deep respect for the circle of brands Zoe Organics has \u2018grown up\u2019 with. [Founders] who were here before \u2018green beauty\u2019 was a thing. Hustling, evangelizing, and walking the talk. THAT is authentic organic beauty.\u201d \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank marino", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "adina grigore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather hamilton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindstrom skin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hamilton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suzanne leroux", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soapwalla rachel winard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "fda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria fantauzzi cofounder of la bella figura beauty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natural beauty label reading made easy  label", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zoe organics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and drug administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T05:29:20.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "56f46a389bfcf561c65697902df4dbead72cf23b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnS.Wv7y6tSyQ_MKXYOVrvCxjwcMabkwvztsW.MPiDzlNVRKdRkWCmjF2Zd.WDqTB9V.3aKkBgaSwOQN9rU51TU", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Snack Savory With a Roasted Garlic and Cauliflower Hummus", "title_full": "Snack Savory With a Roasted Garlic and Cauliflower Hummus", "published": "2017-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG_3391.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "56f46a389bfcf561c65697902df4dbead72cf23b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnS.Wv7y6tSyQ_MKXYOVrvCxjwcMabkwvztsW.MPiDzlNVRKdRkWCmjF2Zd.WDqTB9V.3aKkBgaSwOQN9rU51TU", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Snack Savory With a Roasted Garlic and Cauliflower Hummus", "text": "Snack Savory With a Roasted Garlic and Cauliflower Hummus October 24, 2017 \nCelebrate the abundance of seasonal cauliflower with this unique spin on a classic dip. This roasted garlic and cauliflower hummus is sure to become a new kitchen staple, not to mention a batch-cooking favorite to snack on all week long. Cauliflower Hummus Ingredients \nHummus is a crowd favorite . Not only is it perfect for snacking and entertaining, hummus is packed with fiber, protein, vitamins, and minerals. \nThis recipe is a unique spin on hummus, as the majority of the dip is from roasted cauliflower , as opposed to chickpeas as in classic hummus. \nCauliflower, along with other vegetables like kale and Brussels sprouts, is a member of the brassica family. Brassica vegetables are noted to prevent oxidative stress, induce detoxification enzymes, stimulate the immune system, and reduce the spread of cancer cells, according to this 2012 study . \nRoasted cauliflower is a delightful and savory way to enjoy this brassica. As opposed to raw cauliflower, which can be a bit pungent, roasted cauliflower is incredibly flavorful. In this recipe, cauliflower is roasted alongside garlic in avocado oil or ghee until tender and crisped. \nRoasted cauliflower and garlic are then combined with tahini, chickpeas, lemon juice, and olive oil to create a savory, smoky dip. Tahini, which is blended sesame seeds, adds essential nuttiness as well as ample amounts of calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin E. \nChickpeas provide protein and fiber as well as extra creaminess to this roasted cauliflower hummus. A splash of fresh lemon juice adds brightness and depth. Finally, a few spoonfuls of extra virgin olive oil gives this recipe a dose of healthy fats and additional antioxidants. \nBlended all together, this roasted garlic and cauliflower hummus is simply perfect.

A major rally has been organized on October 31 at the Jacksonville, Florida, meeting of the National Organic Standards Board, at which it is assumed the issue of organic hydroponics will be discussed. \nHydroponic and aquaponic foods are produced in soil-free environments; plants are fed with mineral nutrient solutions. Because their production does not contribute to the development of healthier soil, many proponents of organic do not believe the products of these systems should be allowed to share the certified organic label. While this produce is not certified organic in most countries and regions that have an organic certification, for example, the European Union, in the United States, organic hydroponics remain able to use the USDA\u2019s organic label. \nIn a letter of endorsement for the October 31 rally, influential Maine farmer Eliot Coleman wrote a letter, saying that \u201corganic farming is best defined by the benefits of growing crops on a biologically active fertile soil.\u201d \n\u201cWithout soil,\u201d Coleman continued, \u201cThere is no organic farming.\u201d \nOrganic farmers accuse hydroponic growers of wanting the advantages of the certified organic label without doing the hard work that goes into organic farming. Dave Chapman, owner of Long Wind Farm and a member of the NOSB\u2019s task force on hydroponics and aquaponics, told Valley News that these growers \u201cwant the label, but they don\u2019t want to change how they farm.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty telling that they want to steal our word,\u201d Linley Dixon soil scientist at organic watchdog group the Cornucopia Institute told Modern Farmer . \u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard for this word, and it means something, and they want it, and it\u2019s not theirs. Let them build it for 30 years, like the organic farmers did.\u201d \nThe NOSB discussed the issue during its previous meeting this past spring, but the board ultimately determined that \u201cthey have more questions than answers,\u201d Modern Farmer reports. \n\u201cThe NOSB decided this was something so fundamental to the organics industry, they want everyone participating in the policy developing process for how to handle container and hydroponic growing systems,\u201d Lee Frankel, executive director for the Coalition for Sustainable Organics told the Packer at the time. \nFrankel also indicated this spring that a decision on organic hydroponics may not be made this month, due to significant turnover on the board. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eliot coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linley dixon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee frankel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "packer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "organic farmers reject hydroponics with 16 protest rallies organic farmers reject hydroponics with", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cornucopia institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nosb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "modern farmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coalition for sustainable organics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "long wind farm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national organic standards board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valley news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T05:29:27.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "413fefbca8ad6d2c9f118593c78a17e619635001", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlSgRyE8aoweCIgqnk446dlfgZ2rL2kw1Ekyh8n8gmfHYNxOrtzJC2CedpODnMk1F0C11A_6JX4v7ecMZF7gV.FWLw_8G.uXfpflhE9_HOUPQ--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "The Anti-Inflammatory Diet Catherine Zeta-Jones Swears By", "title_full": "The Anti-Inflammatory Diet Catherine Zeta-Jones Swears By", "published": "2017-10-23T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-19-at-9.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "413fefbca8ad6d2c9f118593c78a17e619635001", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhlSgRyE8aoweCIgqnk446dlfgZ2rL2kw1Ekyh8n8gmfHYNxOrtzJC2CedpODnMk1F0C11A_6JX4v7ecMZF7gV.FWLw_8G.uXfpflhE9_HOUPQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brianne Hogan", "published": "2017-10-23T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Anti-Inflammatory Diet Catherine Zeta-Jones Swears By", "text": "The Anti-Inflammatory Diet Catherine Zeta-Jones Swears By October 23, 2017 Share on Facebook image via Instagra/Catherine Zeta-Jones \nAt 48, actress Catherine Zeta-Jones is undoubtedly a timeless beauty, thanks to her classic style of long, wavy raven locks and a killer smokey eye. However, in part to her 2011 bipolar diagnosis, Zeta-Jones is just as focused on keeping herself healthy and balanced from the inside, out, as she is with her makeup and skin routine. \nShe recently detailed her wellness routine to W Magazine, which includes everything from her workouts to her preferred diet, all of which helps keep her balanced, beautiful, and healthy, both physically and mentally. Here\u2019s a rundown of what we learned. She Eats an Anti-Inflammatory Diet \nAccording to the interview, Zeta-Jones\u2019s diet consists of, \u201cWater, maintaining my pH balance, no alcohol and through diet keeping my body free of any inflammation inside and out.\u201d \nInflammation is often at the root of many medical conditions, including heart disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, allergies, and cancer, as well as mental disorders such as depression and bipolar. \nThough it\u2019s not a cure-all, an anti-inflammatory diet, which is comprised of healthy, wholesome, unprocessed foods, is recommended to help us feel good and live with little to no pain. \nFruits and veggies with high levels of antioxidants are important, especially onions, garlic, peppers and dark leafy greens, as well as herbs and spices like turmeric, oregano, rosemary, and ginger, that help combat inflammation. \nMaintaining a healthy pH balance like Zeta-Jones means keeping the internal conditions of your body at just about 7.0 on the pH scale. It\u2019s believed that our metabolism, as well as our respiratory, digestive, and immune systems function at their best at this level. \nAdhering to an alkaline diet, which, like an anti-inflammatory diet promotes eating whole, raw, organic fruits and vegetables, as well as fitting in regular fitness and meditation are some of the ways to help your body maintain its optimal blood pH level. She Drinks Kombucha \nWhen asked her drink of choice, the Oscar winner told the magazine, \u201cCold press juice and Kombucha.\u201d Considering her diet, it\u2019s no wonder that Zeta-Jones is a fan of kombucha . \nThe fermented tea has many healthy benefits. Not only is it a rich source of glucosamine, which has been found to help reduce inflammation, but it\u2019s also filled with antioxidants and probiotics, essentials for a healthy gut. And a healthy gut has many benefits such as an effective immune system, improved digestion, mental clarity, and mood stability. \nAs for the Zeta-Jones\u2019s other beverage of choice? Since cold pressed juices are exposed to minimal heat and air, they\u2019re said to be able to hold onto more vitamins, minerals, and enzymes present in the fruits and vegetables. Though there isn\u2019t any scientific evidence supporting this claim, consuming cold pressed juice is a good way to get more fruits and veggies into your diet in a fast and easy way. She Exercises Regularly \nZeta-Jones told W that she keeps active with a variety of sports and hobbies, including swimming, tennis, tap dancing, working out at her home gym, and peloton, which is to cycle within an integrated unit similar to those in Tour de France. \nNot only does her busy fitness schedule keep her body in top shape, but a regular exercise routine is key for Zeta-Jones\u2019s mental health , too. Due to the endorphins it releases, there\u2019s no wonder why exercise makes us feel so amazing after a sweat session. Consistent exercise is known to help reduce stress and symptoms of mental health conditions like depression and anxiety. \nUltimately, by focusing on her overall well-being and working from the inside, out, including maintaining a healthy diet and consistent exercise, Zeta-Jones is a good (looking) example of what it means to balance both your physical and mental health. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "catherine zeta-jones", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zeta-jones", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T05:29:31.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd8b8ab3afc7ad0a5fd2ef2abf0aa836aadc9542", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhn0irjlNIrsFwnbvGnNu7M4Sp3zyLNer_.OkAaTQEzBGr7vOvZHulpXC0VILB4hIJTyldMwLbqxhE9N8_HZrJAHCyY71ElPK7RpuCBF9dHUNA--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "These Matcha Benefits Do Wonders for Your Skin (Plus Expert Tips and Skincare Picks!)", "title_full": "These Matcha Benefits Do Wonders for Your Skin (Plus Expert Tips and Skincare Picks!)", "published": "2017-10-23T19:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2f13310b-istock-513808604.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd8b8ab3afc7ad0a5fd2ef2abf0aa836aadc9542", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhn0irjlNIrsFwnbvGnNu7M4Sp3zyLNer_.OkAaTQEzBGr7vOvZHulpXC0VILB4hIJTyldMwLbqxhE9N8_HZrJAHCyY71ElPK7RpuCBF9dHUNA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Liz Thompson", "published": "2017-10-23T19:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "These Matcha Benefits Do Wonders for Your Skin (Plus Expert Tips and Skincare Picks!)", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/JANIFEST \nMatcha is the latest superfood drink. Consuming this form of green tea is good for you, inside and out. And matcha benefits the complexion in big ways when used topically, too. \nBefore you run to the pantry to make your own face mask, let\u2019s take a peek behind the scenes of this healthy ingredient and find out why experts are so keen on using it. \nAt first glance, matcha looks like a thicker, creamier version of your standard green tea. So what\u2019s the big deal? \nTypically when we drink green tea it\u2019s by steeping the leaves in hot water. Matcha is green tea where the green tea leaves are pulverized, so you are actually consuming the whole leaves, not just the water they\u2019ve soaked in. \nAny health guru or nutritionist worth their salt will tell you that green tea is an excellent addition a healthy diet. The main reason being its massive amount of catechins, powerful antioxidants that wrangle free radicals before they can do damage to skin, and cause premature aging and disease. And since matcha is a highly concentrated form of green tea, a study by Department of Chemistry, University of Colorado at Colorado Springs found that it contains three times the antioxidant power of regular green tea. \nBut matcha\u2019s goodness doesn\u2019t stop there. This ingredient is said to reduce inflammation, is both detoxifying and antibacterial, and helps to reduce UV damage. \nAre green tea\u2019s benefits as great when used in skincare? Let\u2019s let Urb Apothcary Founder Leyna Allred (and matcha fan!) fill us in. iStock/yue_ Matcha Benefits for Skin from Urb Apothecary\u2019s Leyna Allred \nLiz Thompson: Why did you choose matcha as an ingredient in your beauty products? \nLeyna Allred: If it\u2019s good for us to consume, it\u2019s just as good for us to put on our skin. I love using food as medicine in my beauty routine and it\u2019s hard to argue with the benefits matcha has shown in Japanese culture for over 800 years. \nLT: What are matcha benefits for skin when applied topically? \nLA: Matcha is loaded with polyphenols, micronutrients from plants that are powerfully antioxidant, reducing redness and combatting signs of premature aging. The bright green color of matcha is from chlorophyll which aids in the elimination of toxins from the skin and its anti-inflammatory properties make it a must-have for sensitive skin with acne or rosacea. \nLT: How often should we use matcha on our skin? \nLA: Everyday! People rave about the benefits of drinking a cup of matcha a day, I think our skin deserves the same treatment. \nLT: How does matcha differ from green tea extract when used in skincare? \nLA: Green tea and matcha are from the same exact plant, but the processing and nutrient/antioxidant content is where the real difference can be seen. Green tea is phenomenal for your skin, but the extra care that goes into making matcha (hand harvesting only the finest leaves and completely separating them the stems and veins) creates a more powerful medium for delivering its benefits. Because matcha is composed of only the highest grade green tea leaves their antioxidant and free radical fighting properties are more potent, perfect for helping our skin combat everyday environmental pollutants and solar radiation while giving the skin a youthful glow. 5 Skincare Products With Matcha \nGet in on the powerful bounty of matcha today with these natural skincare products.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "leyna allred", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leyna allred  liz thompson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "department of chemistry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of colorado", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado springs", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-25T05:29:33.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d0fa4bbcb05babc1a86004a842e020e6b6a27f58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnNVcLCWWPuooLVnB9n1vb9.9OxdQtJhDOZ6L.ay_HdW6VWG5GT7wr3_.2.ubiOcA8-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Europe Poised to Phase Out Glyphosate by 2022", "title_full": "Europe Poised to Phase Out Glyphosate by 2022", "published": "2017-10-25T19:53:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/99a3b4e6-istock-639898846.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d0fa4bbcb05babc1a86004a842e020e6b6a27f58", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnNVcLCWWPuooLVnB9n1vb9.9OxdQtJhDOZ6L.ay_HdW6VWG5GT7wr3_.2.ubiOcA8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-25T19:53:00.000+03:00", "title": "Europe Poised to Phase Out Glyphosate by 2022", "text": "Europe Poised to Phase Out Glyphosate by 2022 October 25, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/Pablo_K \nThe European Parliament called Tuesday for use of glyphosate to be phased out over the next five years. This resolution was announced a day before a committee of expert representatives from EU member nations was due to meet in Brussels to discuss the European Commission\u2019s proposal to renew the license for glyphosate for the next ten years. \nThe European Commission, however, told Reuters that ultimately, \u201cthe relevant committee did not vote\u201d today and that it would announce a new meeting \u201cshortly.\u201d \nWhile Parliament\u2019s resolution is non-binding, it represents \u201ca powerful political signal\u201d to member governments, reports Le Monde . The Guardian notes that France has already shown resistance to the renewal of the license, and representatives have even stated the country\u2019s intention to vote against it. Germany, meanwhile, is likely to abstain from the vote. It remains unclear how the UK will vote, particularly given the imminence of Brexit. \n\u201cThe European Parliament has correctly acknowledged the magnitude of glyphosate\u2019s risks,\u201d Nathan Donley, a senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a news release. \u201cNow European regulators charged with protecting human health and the environment must follow the parliament\u2019s brave leadership and phase out the gross overuse of glyphosate.\u201d \nThe EU\u2019s current glyphosate license expires at the end of the year. \nHours after the resolution, Greenpeace heralded the vote, calling the resolution \u201ca breath of fresh air.\u201d The organization expressed concern over a subsequent Commission proposal to extend the license for glyphosate to seven years, however, calling it \u201ca fudge that changes nothing about how much people are exposed and how much the environment is contaminated.\u201d \n\u201cThe direction given is to strive to reach between five and seven years, taking into account the risk assessment made by the European Parliament in today\u2019s vote,\u201d a Commission spokesman told Reuters. \nParliament voted 355 to 204 in favor of the resolution, with 111 abstentions. Parliament not only demanded that glyphosate be phased out entirely by mid-December 2022 but also that the Commission immediately ban the use of the herbicide in households and public parks, as well as in farming situations where biological alternatives, such as integrated pest management systems, could be used instead. This already the case in certain member countries such as France, where such legislation went into effect in January. \nA previous draft resolution from Members of European Parliament had called for a ban on the chemical over the course of the next three years, eradicating it entirely by December 2020. This proposal was modified in order to give the industry more time to find the adequate replacements for the herbicide and to draw up plans to phase it out. \nThis resolution follows the August reveal of the Monsanto Papers , internal company documents released in a U.S. court case that suggest that Monsanto knew about the dangers of glyphosate and hid them from the public. It was also revealed that the European Food Safety Authority had only concluded that glyphosate was safe after relying on a review that lifted language from a Monsanto report. \nThe EFSA\u2019s findings contrasted those of the World Health Organization, which stated in 2015 that glyphosate was a likely human carcinogen. \nTuesday\u2019s developments also follow the delivery of a petition by the European Citizens\u2019 Initiative calling on the EU to ban glyphosate. The petition was signed by 1.3 million Europeans and will trigger a public hearing in Parliament in November, reports the Independent. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nathan donley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monsanto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for biological diversity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european citizens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european food safety authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "efsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenpeace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le monde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T04:10:07.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cd1e04670498f74cc54f3d44222cbbca3c63f0b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhn139_D2UaKD13UbjZE2mRxUID_O7diBjWdv3t.k0zQ.2d7rBOWmb4.PEuiphhYo5ClkAqdGZyLqRXfvFLNEkCry7OcNajzovq7PhK21nPUQQ--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Vegan Candy Corn Rice Crispy Treats: the Halloween Recipe Everyone Can Make", "title_full": "Vegan Candy Corn Rice Crispy Treats: the Halloween Recipe Everyone Can Make", "published": "2017-10-25T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_1110.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cd1e04670498f74cc54f3d44222cbbca3c63f0b2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhn139_D2UaKD13UbjZE2mRxUID_O7diBjWdv3t.k0zQ.2d7rBOWmb4.PEuiphhYo5ClkAqdGZyLqRXfvFLNEkCry7OcNajzovq7PhK21nPUQQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karissa Bowers", "published": "2017-10-25T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vegan Candy Corn Rice Crispy Treats: the Halloween Recipe Everyone Can Make", "text": "Trans fat per serving: 0g Cholesterol per serving: 0mg 1 box crispy brown rice cereal 1 jar brown rice syrup \u00bc cup dark chocolate chips 2 drops natural orange food coloring Instructions Line a 9x13 pan with enough parchment paper to hang over the edges.

Bone broth protein powders, made from dehydrated bone broth, promise a hefty dose of protein, collagen, vitamins and minerals in every serving. \nWhat\u2019s the best bone broth protein for your buck? Learn all the benefits of bone broth protein, and how to find the best bone broth protein brands, as not all bone broth proteins are created equally. How Bone Broth Protein is Made \nBone broth protein is made the same way bone broth is made. Chicken or beef bones, ligaments, tendons, and cartilage are cooked under sustained high heat with water. \nRyan Raman, MS, RD of Healthline notes that manufacturers use high heat pressure-cooking in order to for broth to be cooked for a shorter time, but still retain beneficial nutrients. \nThese nutrients include chondroitin, glucosamine, hyaluronic acid, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, all of which can be lost during long periods of cooking, Raman notes. \nAfter the bone broth is cooked, the bones are removed and discarded. The liquid is then dehydrated to form a concentrated bone broth powder. Additional ingredients may be added such as natural flavors and sweeteners. \nThe result is a protein-rich bone broth protein powder packed with beneficial nutrients, healthy fats, and amino acids. Distilling the Health Benefits of Bone Broth \nLike bone broth , bone broth protein powder has numerous health benefits. \nBone broth contains 19 essential and nonessential amino acids, which are essential for creating protein in the body. It\u2019s also rich in collagen and gelatin, which form connective tissues and promote joint health, and a variety of electrolytes and minerals. Bone broth contains calcium, magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus, all of which are essential for bone health, nerve functioning, and digestive function. \nBone broth has been shown to improve joint health in those with arthritis and osteoarthritis. This 2016 study found that chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine, found in bone broth, taken orally is comparable to a common drug in reducing pain, stiffness, functional limitation and joint swelling after six months in those with painful knee osteoarthritis. Another 2015 study confirms this by concluding, \u201cthe present study provided evidence for the symptomatic efficacy of glucosamine plus chondroitin in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis.\u201d \nBone broth protein powder is a gut-friendly and gut-healing food. In fact, bone broth protein powder is easier to digest than many other protein powders, such as whey, which contains dairy proteins that can provoke allergic response. Gelatin, found in bone broth protein, supports intestinal health and is beneficial for restoring integrity to the gut, according to a 2012 study published in Clinical and Experimental Gastroenterology. \nThe skin benefits from bone broth and bone broth protein powder, too. Numerous studies have shown the collagen and amino acids in bone broth to provide moisture to dry skin, reduce fine lines and wrinkles, and improve hallmarks of skin aging . \nBone broth consumption is also associated with healthy immune system function and increasing antioxidant defense systems . Bone Broth Proteins \nThere are a variety of bone broth protein powders and bone broths on the market. Always choose a brand that contains minimal ingredients, and one that is non-GMO and organic, if possible. These three brands and bone broth protein powders have been tried and true, and are all uniquely delicious. \nTry adding one into your diet for a protein boost, daily. 1. Ancient Nutrition Organic Bone Broth Protein, Dark Chocolate \nThis bone broth protein powder from Ancient Nutrition is deliciously chocolaty.

In 2008, the animal rights organization offered up one million dollars to the first scientist who could create and bring to market in vitro chicken \u2013 poultry meat created from a few chicken cells, rather than from a whole bird. They had until June 30 th , 2012. \nPETA\u2019s proposition wasn\u2019t a mere media stunt. If anything, it was foreshadowing the massive shift happening in our food system \u2013 a not-too-distant future where vegans are running the global meat supply. \nScientists tried. Teams at the University of Missouri and the Netherlands\u2019 University of Maastricht worked diligently, but the cost of bringing lab-grown meat, \u201cclean meat\u201d as its come to be known these days, was prohibitive . PETA, willing to go to any lengths to bring a viable alternative to the massive livestock industry, extended its deadline after the 2012 date came and went with no victors. The deadline moved to March 4 th , 2014. \nStill, no one was able to claim the prize. Research labs and for-profit businesses were tempted by the million-dollar PETA bounty; but they also saw beyond that, too \u2013 the ability to \u201cgrow\u201d lab meat without the inherent problem of having an animal attached to it would revolutionize our food system, laying the groundwork for one of the most profound shifts humanity has ever seen. And a lucrative one at that. If successful, companies producing clean meat stand to gain far more than the promise of one million dollars. They\u2019d be as profitable as the companies leading the near-trillion-dollar global meat industry . Quite likely even more so. \nLast month, China signed a $300 million deal with SuperMeat, Future Meat Technologies, and Meat the Future \u2013 three Israeli clean meat producers \u2014 in what many are hailing as a clear sign that the days are finally numbered for factory farmed animal products. \n\nBut just how is it that ranchers and industrial farmers may soon be replaced by the work of animal rights organizations, ethical scientists, and vegan entrepreneurs? \nThe first step in understanding this 180-degree shift is looking at our current food system \u2013 and the flaws of industrialization, particularly in the livestock sector. Bigger, faster, cheaper has been the mantra of the last half century, but it\u2019s only proven that while it\u2019s indeed bigger and faster, it isn\u2019t better. Between the gross mistreatment of animals and misuse of natural resources, to our predilection toward a diet laden with processed meat, sugar, and fat \u2014 it\u2019s not a stretch to say we\u2019re lucky to have made it this far. Obesity rates continue to climb, toppling 39 percent in the U.S ., as do rates of type-2 diabetes, cancer, stroke, heart disease, and scores of other life-limiting illnesses. We\u2019re erasing ourselves from history one Happy Meal at a time. \nAnd, says, Josh Tetrick, the vegan founder and CEO of Hampton Creek , \u201cwe desperately need new tools.\u201d Problems are often best solved by people looking in from the outside. Vegans, in this case, offer the meat industry perspectives to the problems it wasn\u2019t seeing and solutions it likely never imagined. \nHampton Creek made a name for itself with its Just Mayo and dressings that replace egg with pea protein. But the Bay Area company completely rocked the food industry this summer when it announced it\u2019s going to be first to market with lab-grown clean meat and fish that\u2019s price and taste competitive with its \u201creal\u201d counterparts. image via Memphis Meats / Instagram But what exactly is \u201cclean\u201d meat? \nClean meat\u2019s been called lab-grown meat, in vitro and test-tube meat, cultured meat, and even Frankenmeat. But the industry\u2019s parallel to clean tech \u2013 a sustainable, renewable, and ethical alternative to the conventional industry standards \u2013 seems to have cemented its new moniker, not to mention its literal definition found in the absence of raising and slaughtering billions of animals every year for meat. \nWhile the science is certainly an innovation, the process itself is a lot less exciting than it sounds, unless you find watching yogurt ferment or kombucha brew exceptionally fascinating. While clean meat doesn\u2019t have the probiotic effects of fermented foods, it\u2019s grown in much the same process \u2013 cells are cultured from an animal, without harm , and allowed to grow. Certain cells are more prone to do that than others, Tetrick explains, and it\u2019s figuring that out that\u2019s the hard part. Everything after that is all a matter of patience and proper care. \n\u201cWe start with high quality animal cells. We feed those cells nutrients (water, sugars, proteins, fats, vitamins and nutrients \u2014 the same macronutrients that cows obtain when they eat grass),\u201d says David Kay, Head of Mission and Business Analyst for Bay Area clean meat producer, Memphis Meats . \u201cOnce the cells grow sufficiently, we harvest them and they are ready to be cooked and prepared just like conventionally-produced meat. Essentially, we are recreating a process that naturally occurs inside an animal\u2019s body, but doing it outside that animal\u2019s body.\u201d \nBy removing the messiness of breeding, raising, killing, and processing animals, clean meat is also removing the most serious risks associated with meat \u2014 which, in today\u2019s meat market aren\u2019t just the good old high cholesterol and heart disease of last century, there\u2019s also the rampant issues of foodborne illness, antibiotic resistance, avian and swine flu, to name a few. Working with meat at the cellular level also delivers the ability to include \u201cadditional functionality,\u201d Tetrick notes. Scientists can also grow meat that\u2019s lower in saturated fat, or contains more iron, for example. \nWatch the story of Ian, a chicken whose cells created Hampton Creek\u2019s clean meat. \nJosh Balk, senior director of food policy for The Humane Society of the United States farm animal division, co-founded Hampton Creek with Tetrick. He says it was the first food company viewed as a tech company \u2013 and that was a pivotal moment for our food supply. Hampton Creek has spent more time developing tools to identify new proteins, fats, polysaccharides and other plant components than it has on practically anything else. (And it\u2019s done a lot to revolutionize the food system in the last few years.) It has patented technology that can look at all of the 357,000 some species of plants on earth and identify new possible uses for each one of them. The technology will be used not only to produce better Hampton Creek products, but it\u2019s also a tool it can share (for a fee) with any company looking for novel ingredients. \n\u201cA plant we use for flour or animal feed may have so many more functions than what we\u2019re currently using it for,\u201d says Tetrick. The company gives secret code names to its research projects, treating something as unsuspecting as a mung bean like a protected national security secret. But these tools \u2013 and this critical understanding of all of a plant\u2019s functions \u2014 is at the forefront of writing the future of food, not just for meat, but quite possibly all food as we know it, particularly as a changing climate changes the nutrient profile and accessibility of common foods . Plants will be used to feed cells that turn into eggs, milk, butter, and even just better-tasting plant products. But they\u2019ll also be used to create the new era of meat. \n\u201cIt\u2019s the DNA of a steak without the DOA of a cow.\u201d \nBalk likes to use the advent of the car to explain clean meat\u2019s potential. \u201cIt\u2019s the Model T,\u201d he says, \u201cand factory farming, well that\u2019s the horse and carriage. How many people do you see driving around town in those these days?\u201d \nFrom an animal rights perspective, there\u2019s no downside to clean meat. While notable technology continues to happen on the plant side ( Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat lead the charge there with their meaty plant burgers), clean meat is a step closer to satisfying everyone. It\u2019s the DNA of a steak without the DOA of a cow. \nIt\u2019s also that line in history that some say pulls us firmly into a new age \u2014 the beginning of a post-speciesism era. The future is clean image via Hampton Creek \nAnd the meat industry is buying into it, big time. There\u2019s China\u2019s recent commitment that made headlines last month. Hampton Creek says it\u2019s also in talks with some of the world\u2019s largest meat producers. The Bay Area\u2019s Impossible Foods recently raised $75 million. And last year, Tyson Foods, the largest producer of meat in the U.S., invested in Beyond Meat , the El Segundo, Calif., startup that spent years crafting its iconic Beyond Burger. It\u2019s a patty made from plants, but meaty enough to fool committed carnivores . While people are often quick to criticize a company like Beyond Meat for taking money from Big Meat, Beyond Meat Founder and longtime vegan Ethan Brown says it\u2019s an even bigger step for Tyson. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment of courage [for Tyson],\u201d he told me last January , shortly after Tyson invested. \nClean meat technology solves a lot of problems for the meat industry \u2013 from the ethical to the logistical. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that there\u2019s a potentially new revenue stream for the meat industry in clean meat, too. \n\u201cMore and more shareholders are looking for companies promoting sustainability,\u201d says Bruce Friedrich, executive director of the DC-based policy group and incubator, the Good Food Institute . \nEven though sales of animal products are on the uptick, particularly in the developing world, there\u2019s no question consumers here in the U.S. are opting for alternatives. The plant-based protein market just surpassed $5 billion in sales earlier this year , and most of the people buying these products aren\u2019t vegans. They\u2019re the flexitarians, the Tom Bradys of the world who rely heavily on a predominantly plant-based diet, but still add in small amounts of animal protein. \n\u201cThere needs to be a way to produce large quantities of meat that is delicious, sustainable, and better for the planet, animals and public health.\u201d \nStill, the technology has its critics. One organic food expert I spoke with who wished to remain anonymous said he simply can\u2019t get past the idea of \u201cgrowing\u201d meat without it being connected to the land, \u201cit\u2019s just too weird to be reality,\u201d he said. \u201cI want my food to come from nature, not a laboratory. And although [clean meat producers] think they can replicate what the evolutionary process took thousands of years to develop, I\u2019m a skeptic.\u201d \nIt\u2019s an understandable argument; perhaps the biggest issue with our current food system is how distanced it is from the whole foods still caked in dirt and sweat we should be eating instead of Doritos. But when it comes to animal products, save for the extremely small number of farms where animals truly live off the land, most animals raised for food never see much dirt or sky, if any, in their short lives. iStock/SteveOehlenschlager \nAnd, says Kay, that small family farm operation doesn\u2019t necessarily need to go away. \u201cFamily farms will likely play a role in feeding the world \u2013 but they will only be able to supply a tiny fraction of the global demand for meat, so there needs to be a way to produce large quantities of meat that is delicious, sustainable, and better for the planet, animals and public health.\u201d \nFriedrich says it\u2019s also important that we recognize the human suffering in the conventional meat system as well. \n\u201cIf you look at reports of industrial farming you\u2019ll see we now have a fraction of the number of pig or chicken farmers that we had ten or twenty years ago,\u201d he explains. \u201cEven as the number of animals have gone up the number of so-called farmers producing them have plummeted. It\u2019s not the plant-based industry consolidating; its Big Ag.\u201d And that\u2019s coming at the expense of workers asked to do more work faster and for longer periods of time. It\u2019s workers brought to the U.S. illegally with nowhere to go and no one to help them find better jobs. \nU.S. chicken processing facilities move 140 birds per minute, which already takes a significant toll on workers\u2019 health, with conditions like carpal tunnel or machine-related injuries on the rise. Recent legislation wants to deregulate the line speed, which many experts say could be disastrous. Factory farms and slaughterhouses have some of the highest rates of worker injuries, as Organic Authority reported last year. The 2005 Human Rights Watch report \u201cBlood, Sweat, Fear\u201d notes that a human rights crime occurs in slaughterhouses every twelve seconds. \n\u201cWe expect our process to require up to 90% less land, water, and greenhouse gas emissions than conventionally-produced meat.\u201d \nBut a widespread shift to plant-based or clean meat isn\u2019t just purporting to solve our ethical dilemmas over eating animals. It takes away the very serious environmental issues connected to livestock production that have become considerably pressing in recent years. By removing the breeding of billions of animals every year, methane emissions would nearly cease. Methane is responsible for about 10 percent of gases contributing to climate change, according to the EPA , and most of it can be traced back to farm animals. But there\u2019s also the razing of rainforest in numerous countries to grow crops to feed these animals. Replacing them with monocrops dependent on herbicides is also extremely damaging to the planet, causing pollution of air and waterways, loss of native flora and fauna, and these chemicals are particularly threatening to pollinator habitats. Without honeybees, one of the most important pollinators, we\u2019d lose nearly one-third of our current food supply. \nThere are also the environmental tolls of transport \u2013 both of crops and animals. There\u2019s the massive amount of water routed to animals, energy, and land. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly inefficient system,\u201d says Friedrich. \n\u201cWe expect our process to be significantly better for the environment, animals and human wellbeing,\u201d says Kay. \u201cEnvironmentally, we expect our process to require up to 90% less land, water, and greenhouse gas emissions than conventionally-produced meat.\u201d \nClean meat could also be part of the next wave in urban farming, with city-based operations \u2013 \u201cmeat breweries\u201d \u2014 producing fresh meat, poultry, or fish in warehouses, rather than rural farm lots, reducing transport time to minutes, rather than days. \n\u201cAt scale our process will take place in facilities that are similar to beer breweries,\u201d Kay says. \u201cYou can imagine us providing public tours of those facilities, which would offer an unprecedented degree of transparency to meat production. When was the last time you were asked to tour a slaughterhouse?\u201d iStock/boogich \nAs more people now live in cities than rural areas, the bucolic country farm is becoming a less realistic component of the food supply \u2013 be it meat, eggs, dairy, or plants. In many cases those small family farms have been replaced by industrial megafarms. For the small farmers that do remain, the city is the new country. Farm operations that continue to move closer to or position themselves right inside city centers will not only make fresh, local food more accessible, but, in the case of growing plants, bring air-cleansing green spaces to otherwise colorless, hazy cityscapes. My Pennsylvania hometown, Pittsburgh, recently announced it\u2019s opening the gates to the nation\u2019s largest urban farm lot just across the river from a downtown blackened for decades by turn-of-the-century industrial steel mill pollution. While Pittsburgh and other large U.S. cities have brought farmers markets and urban farms closer to their communities, it\u2019s a drop in the bucket of what the cities of the future will need to look like. \n\u201cPeople eat meat despite how it\u2019s produced, not because of how its produced.\u201d \n\u201cThe two big questions an awful lot of the companies are focused on: how do we feed 9 billion people by 2050, and how do we address climate change,\u201d says Friedrich. \u201cFood tech and clean meat are the answer to both questions.\u201d \nChef and television host Cat Cora agrees. \u201cIt is definitely exciting that this revolutionary technology could completely change the way we produce and consume meat,\u201d she says. \u201cDespite the current trends and research-backed medical advice of adopting a more plant-based diet, the consumption of traditional meat only seems to be increasing.\u201d \nThese new technologies, Friedrich says, are exponentially more efficient than conventional agriculture. And he notes that people eat meat \u201cdespite how it\u2019s produced, not because of how its produced.\u201d \nAnd that\u2019s a critical distinction. Tetrick points to it as well \u2013 noting that he\u2019s vegan, but not because he doesn\u2019t like the taste of meat. There are many vegans like him. He doesn\u2019t like the system; he doesn\u2019t like the suffering . He\u2019s convinced that most people \u2013 even his own dad, for example \u2013 wouldn\u2019t know the difference if their normal fast food chicken sandwich or nugget was made from clean meat. And for the most part, they probably wouldn\u2019t care. Most people, he says, want to make the most ethical and responsible choice possible but \u201cthey don\u2019t want to give up their comforts.\u201d \nSo, why don\u2019t we just eat more plant-based foods that taste like meat? \n\u201c Vegan products and restaurants are opening up left and right and traditional chefs are offering more plant-based options as well on their menus,\u201d says Cora. \nThe innovations happening in that space are in some respects even more impressive than growing meat from cells. Meat is an obvious endpoint when you take chicken cells and culture them \u2013 you\u2019re going to get something quite like chicken meat. But what about taking peas, beets, and coconuts and getting them to taste convincingly meaty, like Beyond Meat has done with its Beyond Burger ? Or Impossible Foods meaty soy-based patty? These aren\u2019t the crumbly veggie burgers lost to barbecue grill slats of Labor Day cookouts in the past. For all intents and purposes, this is meat, only it\u2019s made from plants. To the consumer, it\u2019s nothing short of sheer alchemy. \n\u201cThe idea of a whole foods diet has been a part of the conversation for decades,\u201d says Friedrich, \u201cyet it\u2019s still only one-fourth of one percent of the market. Meat consumption is now going back up to all-time per capita highs.\u201d \nWhile the plant-based burgers are good enough for a lot of consumers, they may not be able to satisfy everyone. At least, not at every meal. \n\u201cReplacing industrial meat with clean meat is a colossal win for getting GMO crops [and their companion herbicides] out of the marketplace.\u201d \nAnd clean meat delivers another victory for clean food proponents: it could bring an end to genetically modified crops like corn, soy, alfalfa, and canola. The majority of these crops are grown for livestock feed, and while there\u2019s controversy over whether or not the technology of modifying a seed is safe, what\u2019s become clear is the reason for those modifications aren\u2019t. The vast majority of GMOs are modified for one purpose: to tolerate heavy applications of herbicides and pesticides. \nUse of Roundup, the best-selling herbicide made by St. Louis-based agrochemical giant Monsanto, has increased to 9.4 million tons worldwide since it was introduced in the 1970s. \nGlyphosate and other agricultural chemicals have been linked to human health risks \u2013 the World Health Organization classified glyphosate as a possible human carcinogen in 2015. Its efficacy has also come into question. Weeds have developed resistance to the herbicide after just a few generations, causing farmers to have to increase applications or resort to stronger chemicals. \n\u201cReplacing industrial meat with clean meat is a colossal win for getting GMO crops [and their companion herbicides] out of the marketplace,\u201d says Friedrich. \nBy replacing the need to feed a 1,200-pound steer every day and just feeding the cells that produce the meat instead, clean meat also eliminates the need for antibiotics, another huge health concern. Farmers began adding antibiotics to meat around 1950 when they realized the drugs used to fight infection had an interesting side effect: they help the animals put on weight rather quickly. Today, approximately 80 percent of the nation\u2019s supply of antibiotics are routed into livestock production, and that practice is having a side effect of its own: antibiotic resistance. Routine exposure to antibiotics in our food supply has led bacteria to become resistant to common antibiotics and even some of the most potent last resort antibiotics available. The vegans are coming image via Beyond Meat / Instagram \nIn his recent book named after his animal rights organization Mercy for Animals, founder and executive director Nathan Runkle, tells the story of a history-changing victory he had with Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest food company, after MFA posted undercover video implicating a Nestl\u00e9 dairy supplier on its website . \n\u201cWe can run a company saying we have a strong ethical code, but if it\u2019s not upheld at even the lowest levels, we\u2019ve failed.\u201d \n\u201cNo corporation as big as ours should have suppliers who are breaking laws, behaving irresponsibly, or inflicting pain and suffering, and we\u2019re determined that\u2019s never going to happen again,\u201d Nestl\u00e9 executives told Runkle and his team. \u201cWe can run a company saying we have a strong ethical code, but if it\u2019s not upheld at even the lowest levels, we\u2019ve failed. So after we met with you \u2026 we hired independent auditors through-out the dairy supply chain in order to find the cracks in the system. We visited dozens of farms in several states, and unfortunately, we found a lot.\u201d \nThe situation resulted in a huge shift \u2014 not just for Nestl\u00e9\u2019s animals, but a ripple effect for millions of farm animals. But more than that it helped set the stage for what\u2019s become a common practice \u2014 cage-free eggs are now the norm and suppliers are being held to higher standards every year. Just this week Nestl\u00e9 announced it\u2019s withdrawing from the Grocery Manufacturers Association over \u201ckey nutrition issues.\u201d In recent years Nestl\u00e9 has moved toward more transparency, supported additional nutritional labeling, and most recently, acquired plant-based company Sweet Earth Foods. It\u2019s hard to imagine Nestl\u00e9 coming to this place without its relationship with Mercy for Animals. \nToday, most of the nation\u2019s leading food producers in all sectors have made significant shifts to help improve the lives of the billions of farm animals. Hundreds of suppliers have moved away from controversial farming practices like gestation crates for sows or battery cages for egg-laying hens. Humane standards have also become a key component of the USDA\u2019s National Organic Program. And at the center of all of these shifts are the negotiations with animal rights groups like Mercy for Animals, the Humane Society of the U.S., and PETA \u2014 organizations started and run by vegans. \nRunkle\u2019s Mercy for Animals can be credited with much of the victories we\u2019ve seen around improvements for chickens in the last decade. His undercover workers have captured some of the most-viewed videos of abuse and controversial practices in industrial farming, leading to huge shifts like he detailed with Nestl\u00e9. But it\u2019s not just on the supplier side. The organization\u2019s work to educate consumers has resulted in countless animal lives being spared and the increased inclination of millennials toward a plant-based diet. The group\u2019s Choose Veg program says it\u2019s reached more than 250,000 consumers eager to reduce their meat intake. \nBalk\u2019s work with the Humane Society has recently opened up plant-based options to the nation\u2019s leading food service providers for hospitals, restaurants, colleges and universities; and there\u2019s little doubt he\u2019ll get clean meats on the menus once they\u2019re available, too. Meatless Monday has become a force of nature in the U.S. and around the world \u2013 just this week 15 Brooklyn schools announced they\u2019d begin observing the campaign. Meatless Monday started out to promote the environmental benefits of giving up meat one day a week and has found its way into government offices, leading Fortune 500 companies\u2019 cafeterias, and some of the nation\u2019s largest school districts. Some schools, including one just on the other side of Manhattan, have gone completely vegan . \n\u201cThe solution to the big global crises \u2013 that\u2019s clean meat. That\u2019s plants.\u201d \nTetrick hopes he\u2019ll be eating meat again regularly, only it will never come from an animal \u2013 at least not in the traditional sense. It\u2019ll come from a cell or two of a chicken feather, or perhaps an ear rub of a pig. \n\u201cThe solution to the big global crises \u2013 that\u2019s clean meat. That\u2019s plants,\u201d Friedrich says. \u201cMeat is just lipids, and amino acids, and minerals, and water. There is nothing in meat we can\u2019t recreate in a better way.\u201d \n\u201cPeople want meat,\u201d Tetrick says, \u201cso we\u2019re going to give it to them.\u201d Find Jill on Twitter and Instagram Related on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "friedrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cat cora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frankenmeat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "runkle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david kay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh tetrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruce friedrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh balk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom bradys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tetrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan runkle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "memphis meats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "good food institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beyond meat / instagram  in", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mfa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monsanto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grocery manufacturers association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram related on organic authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organic authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national organic program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humane society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay area\u2019s impossible foods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "choose veg program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyson foods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of maastricht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweet earth foods", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "impossible foods", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "memphis meats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. louis-based", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hampton creek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el segundo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bay area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tyson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T10:16:52.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f65e5c2d3a71b38a5af17bfb7dffaf8894f9d77d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhlfcj7huFHY5PEl5BWecoZOD71FsFxpEw3jzLti7EiHdOuqKSmxIDaKukd9z3Bl4tVTgXzM8NZUVmQWkdn1Yg.csJWwhjjcOcAwS7.qDnn2Ag--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "The Rough Guide to Ethical Alcohol: What Makes Beer, Wine, and Spirits Vegan?", "title_full": "The Rough Guide to Ethical Alcohol: What Makes Beer, Wine, and Spirits Vegan?", "published": "2017-10-26T22:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/2f01f76b-istock-588596902.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f65e5c2d3a71b38a5af17bfb7dffaf8894f9d77d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhlfcj7huFHY5PEl5BWecoZOD71FsFxpEw3jzLti7EiHdOuqKSmxIDaKukd9z3Bl4tVTgXzM8NZUVmQWkdn1Yg.csJWwhjjcOcAwS7.qDnn2Ag--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aylin Erman", "published": "2017-10-26T22:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Rough Guide to Ethical Alcohol: What Makes Beer, Wine, and Spirits Vegan?", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/Instants \nIf you assume alcohol is naturally vegan, you\u2019d be wrong. Ethical alcohol is harder to come by than you think and even if you think it\u2019d be easy to discern, it\u2019s not. Here\u2019s what to look out for when it comes to beer, wine, and spirits. Animal Byproducts Lurking in Alcohol \nAnimal derivatives can either be in the beverage itself as an ingredient or can be infused into the drink by way of the filtration process. Some hidden animal byproducts found in alcoholic drinks include: albumen (egg white), albumin (egg or dried blood), carmine (insect), casein (milk), charcoal (animal bone), chitin (shellfish), gelatin (connective tissue of cow or pig), honey (bees), isinglass (fish bladder membranes), lactose (milk), and pepsin (pigs). Wine \nConsidering wine is made from grapes, it comes as a surprise that animal-derived products would find their way into the mix. Wine is filtered through fining agents that help to remove protein, yeast, cloudiness, and undesired flavors and colorings. Wine producers often apply fining agents that are animal derived, including casein, chitin, albumen, fish oil, gelatin, and isinglass. \nVegan wine, however, is filtered with animal-friendly agents, including carbon, bentonite clay, limestone, kaolin clay, plant casein, silica gel, and vegetable plaques. \nThe natural wine industry is also growing and offering a completely unfiltered, straightforward wine that is made with minimum or no intervention. The resulting wine bears a unique, quirky flavor and is 100% worth the try. Beer \nLager tends to be completely devoid of animal-derived products but ale often contains isinglass, which is used to clarify the liquid. To avoid potentially isinglass-containing beer, steer clear of ale or do your research beforehand to find out which ale brands forgo the fish guts. \nLuckily, vegan ale is a growing trend. This year, Guinness ditched isinglass to keep its brew vegan. Many craft beer companies are also hyper-aware of the isinglass subtlety and avoiding its use in their ale production. Spirits \nSpirits are much easier to navigate than are wine and beer. Spirits are mostly vegan across the board, save for a few imported vodkas that are filtered with charred animal bones or those that are obviously cream-based, such as Baileys and Advocaat. \nThis list of delicious vegan spirits is most certainly motivating! Stay Informed \nIf you are confused about what to order at the bar, take a few minutes beforehand to look up animal-friendly alcoholic beverages on Barnivore and/or Vegaholic , two incredible resources for the buzzed vegan. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "advocaat", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "guinness", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T10:16:54.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "012ed843254fa051cbff3886bfc208ce3d5d4759", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhngET8AOOswE1dsFDmr_b5DIbfZn.OFIRmKRolP7ytBRDDdPVuyliwY11WloJGqkOBAimq4PwyQkz7lAKBevy6Rw4n3ETSz9d3duI76fc7opw7eKjcIf8jk", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Why French Women Don\u2019t Suffer From Incontinence (and How to Prevent Post-Baby Leakage)", "title_full": "Why French Women Don\u2019t Suffer From Incontinence (and How to Prevent Post-Baby Leakage)", "published": "2017-10-26T21:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/5254cbf0-istock-697577196.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "012ed843254fa051cbff3886bfc208ce3d5d4759", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhngET8AOOswE1dsFDmr_b5DIbfZn.OFIRmKRolP7ytBRDDdPVuyliwY11WloJGqkOBAimq4PwyQkz7lAKBevy6Rw4n3ETSz9d3duI76fc7opw7eKjcIf8jk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sara Novak", "published": "2017-10-26T21:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why French Women Don\u2019t Suffer From Incontinence (and How to Prevent Post-Baby Leakage)", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/bee32 \nIt\u2019s a running joke amongst many women, you laugh too hard, sneeze unexpectedly, or go for a run and you may spring a leak post- baby birth. Once you open up the flood gates, it\u2019s hard to close them back up again. But for many women it\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s a real problem that leaves them feeling embarrassed and isolated. However, if you look at women in France, you\u2019ll find that incontinence post-baby or at any point is far from an inevitability, in fact, it\u2019s highly preventable. What is Incontinence? \nAccording to the National Association for Incontinence , 25 million Americans suffer from incontinence at some point in their lives and nearly 75 percent of them are women. Incontinence is the term used to describe involuntary or accidental loss of urine from the bladder. It ranges in severity from a little leak to a complete loss of bladder control. Stress incontinence is the form of incontinence that\u2019s common amongst many women post-pregnancy and childbirth when the pelvic floor muscles that support the urethra are weakened. This can cause leaking during activities that push down on this part of the body. \n\u201cDuring childbirth, the increase in gestational weight gain puts additional pressure on your entire pelvic floor. The muscles and ligaments in your pelvic floor are weakened and damaged, making it more difficult to hold your bladder,\u201d says Laura Arndt, a certified strength and conditioning coach that recently started Matriarc , an app focused on pregnancy and postpartum health. \u201cRelaxin is a hormone in your body that increases elasticity of your ligaments and joints to aid in delivery and this also causes issues. During delivery, there may be additional damage and strain to the muscles in your pelvic floor. This can later lead to Pelvic Organ Prolapse which effects urinary and rectal incontinence.\u201d Why Don\u2019t French Women Suffer From Incontinence? \nOne of the main reasons that French women don\u2019t suffer from incontinence is because post baby, French women are prescribed 20 post baby \u201cpelvic floor re-education\u201d sessions. The sessions consist of a probe being inserted into a women\u2019s undercarriage after which she is instructed to squeeze on the probe with her pelvic floor muscles to test the strength of the pelvic floor. Then, the doctor sets what amounts to a dildo with electrodes in it to a level necessary to work the pelvic floor muscles into a tizzy. Women even play video games with their vaginas, one writer wrote about her favorite of the games which she calls \u201c cooter Pac-Man \u201c. But embarrassing video games aside, after a few sessions, most women don\u2019t have to worry whether a sneezing spell will cause an unexpected leak from below. \nThe difference in the U.S. versus France is that in the U.S. we view occasional leakage as a given post-baby and as the number of vaginal births increases, the worse the problem becomes. Add in an episiotomy and all bets are off. But it doesn\u2019t have to be this way. For starters, says Gail Page, co-founder of Consortia Health, which specializes in treating incontinence, we need to open up a dialogue on the subject. \n\u201cPeople don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d says Page. \u201cBut incontinence is associated with isolation, depression, and reduced intimacy with partners. It can even cause marital problems.\u201d \nPage helped open a state-of-the-art facility in Austin, Texas, that she says is even better than what the French are currently doing. Consortia Health offers pelvic floor screening surveys, incontinence testing, and pelvic floor muscle training. What to Do About Incontinence \nBeyond contacting Consortia Health or another healthcare provider that specializes in treating incontinence, there are a number of other steps that you can take that according to Arndt, can do a lot to prevent incontinence post pregnancy. 1. Stay active during pregnancy and avoid too much weight gain. \nIn 2015, Yale School of Medicine published research that found that women who gained too much weight during pregnancy or weren\u2019t active were more likely to experience weakening of their pelvic floor. 2. Make time to strengthen your pelvic floor. \nIn France, new moms make time for their pelvic floors because of the treatment regimen that nearly all moms go through. But in the U.S. it\u2019s not seen as important. This shouldn\u2019t be the case. If you make time for your pelvic floor post-pregnancy, you won\u2019t have to deal with leakage later. According to Arndt, strengthening of your core and pelvic floor immediately postpartum and continuing for life can greatly reduce your risk of \u201cmommy bladder\u201d. \u201cYour transverse abdominals (lower abs), hips, lower back, and pelvic muscles strength all play a role in your body\u2019s ability to control your bladder,\u201d she says. She recommends kegels, pelvic tilts, bridges, dead bug crunch, supermans, and bird dogs for a couple minutes each day because they can play a huge role in prevention of incontinence. 3. Don\u2019t do exercises post-pregnancy that could damage your pelvic floor. \nArndt warns against exercises that increase abdominal pressure in the first six months to a year postpartum. Recti Diastasis, or abdominal separation, is common in many pregnancies, but in order for it to heal properly, women need to avoid exercises like crunches, planks, and heavy lifting that can increase abdominal pressure and make diastases worse. \u201cIf Diastasis doesn\u2019t heal, your core muscles will remain weak and difficult to strengthen,\u201d says Arndt. \u201cThis puts pressure on your lower back and pelvic muscles, causing pain, muscle weakness, strain, and increasing incontinence.\u201d \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arndt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura arndt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diastasis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gail page", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "yale school of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "consortia health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national association for incontinence", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-27T10:16:58.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7682c6e15cfa71cd8de8ff0407159afb5a5e2cdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnajV_GXOnNdnFTHT38eKeb.Qtv9YZCdx4fud8yDBQK_LAnR8G9mhz3bukkfOTebHsdQ1RX92hDitcLbMe.WeLl2l42Wd3nCLVZFBSNbOPAqM8zZcyT6FPUOqckJP0K8k.q_DpxPfDbS91kLuyPJgJGfsYOQIP5w5Svbu1085XH7A--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Nation\u2019s Premier Farm to Table Dining Event to Host Fundraisers for Recent California Fires, Earthquake, and Hurricane Relief", "title_full": "Nation\u2019s Premier Farm to Table Dining Event to Host Fundraisers for Recent California Fires, Earthquake, and Hurricane Relief", "published": "2017-10-26T20:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/a3615696-screenshot-2017-10-26-10.52.47.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7682c6e15cfa71cd8de8ff0407159afb5a5e2cdd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnajV_GXOnNdnFTHT38eKeb.Qtv9YZCdx4fud8yDBQK_LAnR8G9mhz3bukkfOTebHsdQ1RX92hDitcLbMe.WeLl2l42Wd3nCLVZFBSNbOPAqM8zZcyT6FPUOqckJP0K8k.q_DpxPfDbS91kLuyPJgJGfsYOQIP5w5Svbu1085XH7A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jill Ettinger", "published": "2017-10-26T20:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nation\u2019s Premier Farm to Table Dining Event to Host Fundraisers for Recent California Fires, Earthquake, and Hurricane Relief", "text": "Share on Facebook image via Outstanding in the Field \nOutstanding in the Field, the premier farm to table dining experience that connects farmers and consumers in a one-of-a-kind multi-course outdoor event, will be hosting two benefit dinners to offer relief for victims of the recent Mexico City earthquake and the Northern California fires. \nOutstanding in the Field \u2019s team traverses the country between spring and fall, setting up unique dining experiences with breathtaking backdrops. \n\u201cThrough the Summer and Fall, we have carried our table across North America, setting it for meals from farm to farm and town to town.

For Your Skin, Maybe", "text": "Are Essential Oils Overrated? For Your Skin, Maybe October 29, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/FotoCuisinette \nEssential oils are touted as miracle elixirs that offer a host of benefits. But when it comes to skincare, are they really all that and a bag of chips? \nTo say Marie Veronique knows what she is talking about when it comes to skincare is an understatement. The eponymous founder of Marie Veronique is a trained esthetician with degrees in math and science and was once a high school chemistry teacher. Her daughter Jay Nadeau is a physicist and bio-medical engineer and works with Marie Veronique to create effective products that target and absolve real skin issues, from acne to aging. Essential Oils: Fair-Weather Friend \nVeronique\u2019s approach to skincare goes beyond blanket qualifications, such as \u201ctoxin-free\u201d, and avoids playing into marketing hype. R&D is the fastest growing department in the company and it reflects her quest to provide real results to her highly-selective customers. \nSo, when Marie Veronique released a collaborative line with Kristina Holey that entirely omitted essential oils, we scratched our heads: Does this mean essential oils are bad? \nVeronique clarifies her intentions with the line: \u201cWe do not oppose using essential oils. We use them judiciously in many of the CoreLine Marie Veronique products. We chose to omit them entirely within the collaborative line with Kristina Holey to eliminate one factor in the guesswork with sensitive skin issues.\u201d There\u2019s the catchphrase: sensitive skin. Everyone I know, including myself, seems to have this elusive condition. Does that mean all of our essential oils elixirs have been doing us dirty all this time? \nVeronique clarifies, \u201cMy general stance on essential oils is that their beneficial aspects are overrated. Many studies attest to the value of micro-nutrients likevVitamins A, C, E and B complex, as well as lipids that supply essential fatty acids, effecting positive change across a wide range of skin care concerns such as aging, breakouts and sensitive/sensitized skin reactions,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd while there are studies demonstrating the benefits of individual essential oils with respect to anti-microbial or anti-fungal properties, when it comes to the category of reactive skin there are other studies emerging that suggest that the overuse of volatile organic compounds can initiate or exacerbate skin sensitivities, or even cause contact dermatitis.\u201d \nThe quality of the essential oil, its measure, and the way it interacts with other ingredients in the formulation all have an impact on how the essential oil will affect your complexion. A subtle variation in any of these factors could be the make or break for your skin. Trusting the company behind your skincare products is, well, essential. \nDara Kennedy, founder of Ayla Beauty , an online non-toxic skincare shop that lists thoroughly-vetted natural skincare products and provides sage skincare guidance, insists that we should all care more about where we are getting our skincare products and advice from. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to use products that are formulated by bona fide experts,\u201d she says, \u201cand it\u2019s also important that the essential oils in those products are of the highest possible quality. Variation in raw materials can have a major impact on the activity of an essential oil.\u201d \nAnd Kennedy says she doesn\u2019t recommend a full regimen of essential-oil-heavy products, \u201cespecially if you have sensitive skin, because that\u2019s usually when problems occur: they might be in everything from your hand soap to your body lotion to your facial products, all of which you\u2019re using every single day.\u201d Marie Veronique formulated Dara\u2019s Oil specifically for Kennedy\u2019s super sensitive skin as a skincare step that gives the skin a break from essential oils and thus minimizes potential reactions. The Takeaway \nWhile essential oils indeed have their praise-worthy benefits, their use doesn\u2019t always equate with safe. The best way to know if essential oils are right for you is to test them out on your own skin, but, and I mean BUT!, only if you\u2019re getting your essential oil laden products from the right source. \nKennedy knows a thing or two about choosing the right skincare companies to worth with and, ultimately, trust with her complexion . She says, \u201cWith all products in general, try to find out if there\u2019s more to them than a pretty package and a nice scent. I love brands like Marie Veronique, TWELVE , and BioRecept , where the founder is the formulator \u2014 and the formulator is very, very highly skilled \u2014 because there\u2019s a real understanding of how their products work on people. I also love brands like MyHavtorn , which actually grows the sea buckthorn they use in their products on their own farm. There\u2019s a real closeness to the product that leads to a great quality level and great results.\u201d \nAt the end of the day, if you find your skin reacts sensitively to skincare products containing essential oils, opt for a skincare line that is essential-oil-free. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dara kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayla beauty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay nadeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veronique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristina holey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marie veronique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-29T11:53:16.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0954d79078d8433c17b96121e4a338dfa7f0550a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhl2T6phfz7zOuUALr5vCVWNOywPv7SGliOun6yeP7Wi2AfXufMBEX2S2jXv1DAef0mSGLbFWkn00zYPZJIzdh7jZzE4ArfLssGlL_s1TJNivzaQ7gZuFrVZm7z.dwOdi64-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "How P!nk is Getting in Shape After Her Second Pregnancy (Hint: She Starts By Loving Herself)", "title_full": "How P!nk is Getting in Shape After Her Second Pregnancy (Hint: She Starts By Loving Herself)", "published": "2017-10-28T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/01463602-screen-shot-2017-10-24-at-8.26.10-pm.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0954d79078d8433c17b96121e4a338dfa7f0550a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhl2T6phfz7zOuUALr5vCVWNOywPv7SGliOun6yeP7Wi2AfXufMBEX2S2jXv1DAef0mSGLbFWkn00zYPZJIzdh7jZzE4ArfLssGlL_s1TJNivzaQ7gZuFrVZm7z.dwOdi64-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Aylin Erman", "published": "2017-10-28T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "How P!nk is Getting in Shape After Her Second Pregnancy (Hint: She Starts By Loving Herself)", "text": "Share on Facebook image via Pink/Instagram \nIf there\u2019s anyone we should all look up to when it comes to body image goals (or ALL goals, really), it\u2019s musician P!nk.

Jeanette trains P!nk to target the pelvis wall, transverse abdominus, and all the muscles of the core, which are particularly important after childbirth. image via Pink/Instagram P!nk\u2019s Getting in Shape for a Cause \nP!nk clearly keeps her exercise routine exciting, so much so that she even pairs her fitness training with good causes! In May of this year, Pink joined the Chef Cycle bicycle race to raise money for No Kid Hungry , a non-profit committed to ending childhood hunger.

Simply put all the ingredients in a crockpot, leave it for the day, and return home to quick (and healthy!) comfort food. Crockpot Chicken Ingredients \nThis crockpot chicken recipe couldn\u2019t be easier. All you\u2019ll need are two frozen chicken breasts and a handful of other pantry ingredients. If your chicken is already thawed, have no fear! Simply cook the chicken in the crockpot for less time. \nChoose certified organic chicken, if possible, or purchase chicken locally from a farmers market. Many labels on packaged chicken, such as sustainably farmed and humanely raised, are unverifiable and actually give no indication for how the chicken was raised. Choosing organic chicken means that the chicken was raised without antibiotics or hormones and complies with the USDA\u2019s definition of organic practices. \nOrganic frozen chicken is combined with tomato sauce and hearty, Italian flavors in a crockpot. Choose plain organic tomato sauce, or one that hasn\u2019t been sweetened or filled with preservatives and additives. Find glass jars or cardboard boxes of plain tomato sauce for this recipe at local health food stores or Whole Foods Market. \nBalsamic vinegar is a delicious addition to this crockpot chicken recipe and adds a hint of acid and balance to the sauce. When slow cooked, balsamic vinegar sweetens and has a remarkable taste. \nWhole cloves of garlic and onion infuse into the sauce to create a heavenly tasting (and smelling) sauce. When cooked low and slow, both garlic and onion sweeten and take on a caramelized, rich flavor. \nAfter cooking for hours, this crockpot chicken is ready to go. Simply shred the chicken with a fork and serve with your favorite pasta noodles, baked spaghetti squash , or zucchini zoodles . Top with fresh basil and enjoy a hearty comfort classic!

Many people don\u2019t know their blood type personality or even their blood types, especially in Western cultures. But in East Asian countries, particularly Japan, a person\u2019s blood type provides essential insight into their temperament and character. \nIn Japan, blood types are often listed on online dating profiles and resumes to help potential partners and employers find the best match. Dr. D\u2019Adamo, author of \u201c Eat Right 4 Your Type ,\u201d takes it further by theorizing that each blood type has unique dietary and health issues. \nBlood type personality may be more superstition than science, but it can be fun to see where you fit in. Don\u2019t know your blood type? Your Japanese friends would be horrified \u2013 and you could put yourself in a sticky situation if you ever get injured, especially while traveling. Ask your doctor or order a quick online kit to find out. Type A \nType As just want everyone to get along. They are kind, responsible, and sensitive \u2013 great listeners and excellent friends. Harmonious surroundings, structured schedules, and a supportive community are essential for Type A\u2019s happiness. Patient and organized, Type As are people pleasers. But the dark side of this agreeable blood type personality is an inner turmoil and anxiety that comes from putting other\u2019s needs first. Type As need time to recharge with exercise and stress-reduction strategies. According to D\u2019Adamo, they will often flourish on a vegetarian diet, especially with pure, raw, and organic foods. Type B \nEffortlessly friendly, Type B is your typical people person. Type Bs are in tune with their surroundings and themselves, and often pursue creative passions. Type Bs are often quirky and march to the beat of their own drummers \u2013 but this can sometimes be seen as selfish and uncooperative. Some people theorize that this blood type\u2019s root is in nomadic people that roamed the planet. Type B will find it easy to be a vegetarian, and should avoid wheat and corn to keep their metabolism humming. Type Bs can be susceptible to inflammation and auto-immune disorders, but overall they have fewer risk factors for disease than any other blood type. Type AB \nOnly 5% of people are Type AB, which is the rarest blood type. And it\u2019s the only blood type that exists because of intermingling instead of evolution. As such, it blends the benefits and challenges of Type A and Type B. Type ABs are calm, cool, and collected \u2013 and often known as eccentrics. They are popular and smart \u2013 and able to let logic trump emotion when need be. ABs are very open-minded; however this same characteristic can make them wishy-washy when they need to be decisive. According to D\u2019Adamo, ABs tend not to metabolize meats well, storing them as fat instead. Type O \nType O is the oldest blood type on the planet. Type Os are confident, determined, and optimistic \u2013 the classic natural leader. Strong-willed Type Os are often very successful. Stress and workaholism is the downside to this blood type personality. Because Type O is the most ancient blood type, people with this blood thrive on a paleo or keto diet that is higher in fat and protein and lower in carbs. Carbs, especially grain-based carbs, may cause inflammation and are quickly converted into fats for this blood type. Type Os may also be predisposed to thyroids and ulcers due to their high stress levels. Best tip: Take care of yourself with the same determination you use at work. \nRelated on Organic Authority ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "d\u2019adamo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "type ab", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-29T11:53:28.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1a48795b4c998c05c18db0b94b3268dfc6c1eb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhm.pbCb0dSZJNcZ8SvaXKHdRW.a8tyOu0guVZurc_98hzkEG56Hy8jm6ZDDQSwT__AHkQqBxrBwS9HCH48_9deqkY2KTKBEEEA-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Organic Acreage Continues to Grow as Conventional Grain Prices Plummet", "title_full": "Organic Acreage Continues to Grow as Conventional Grain Prices Plummet", "published": "2017-10-27T22:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/9a370c07-istock-604352738.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d1a48795b4c998c05c18db0b94b3268dfc6c1eb9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhm.pbCb0dSZJNcZ8SvaXKHdRW.a8tyOu0guVZurc_98hzkEG56Hy8jm6ZDDQSwT__AHkQqBxrBwS9HCH48_9deqkY2KTKBEEEA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-27T22:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Organic Acreage Continues to Grow as Conventional Grain Prices Plummet", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/JamesBrey \nConventional corn and soybean prices continue to drop, contributing to increased organic acreage across the United States as farmers attempt to boost their margins. \n\u201cFour years of global oversupply have pushed down grain prices, reduced agricultural revenues and put more expensive producers under financial pressure,\u201d reports Reuters , noting that corn futures have dropped about 12 percent this year, and soybean prices have dropped 17 percent. \nOrganic acreage, meanwhile, increased 37 percent from 2011 to 2016, reaching a total of 5 million acres. Several states specifically saw a jump in land devoted to organic cereal crops, including soybeans in Iowa, corn in Minnesota, and wheat in Colorado and Texas, reports High Plains Public Radio. Production of these crops jumped 30 percent nationwide between 2015 and 2016. \nMuch of the motivation for this is increased demand for feed from organic dairy and poultry farms, particularly in the wake of the Washington Post expo revealing fraudulent \u201corganic\u201d grain imports . Today, half of the organic corn and three-quarters of the organic soybeans sold in the United States are imported. \nEric Thalken of Burkey Farms in Nebraska notes that the price premium is well worth the effort of converting to organic. \n\u201cSome of (this corn) is sold at $8.80, some of it\u2019s sold at $9,\u201d Thalken tells High Plains Public Radio ; this is nearly triple the current conventional corn price which, the outlet reports, has been \u201chovering around the break-even mark.\u201d \nThe price of organic conversion is a deterrent to some, however, particularly given the lack of margin of error with this method of farming. \n\u201cTo pull off a good organic crop, you have to be good on every single step through the way,\u201d says Thalken. \u201cIf someone didn\u2019t set a cultivator right or if you got the wrong cover crop mix you could literally cut your yields in half.\u201d \nFarmers had high hopes for a certified transitional label developed by the Organic Trade Association in partnership with the USDA. Announced in January, the label would have allowed farmers transitioning to organic certification, who must use more expensive and labor-intensive organic methods for three years before being certified, to earn a premium on their crops during this transitional period. \n\u201cI think that would have been a tool or a piece of the puzzle,\u201d says the OTA\u2019s Senior Crops and Livestock Specialist, Nate Lewis of the transitional certification. \u201cFor folks that really just can\u2019t get over the financial hurdle, having the ability to get some kind of premium in that interim time could make a real difference.\u201d \nHowever, according to the Lewis, the label is currently stalled at the USDA. \n\u201cOur political appointments aren\u2019t there to make these critical decisions moving forward with programs,\u201d he says. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thalken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nate lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric thalken", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burkey farms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high plains public radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farmers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organic trade association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ota", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-29T11:53:32.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e14f9533e8f7e89538905f921bef6d3ee7205e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnOvCDOG9VDgzfhBcgdIYbVu5kRMomLY.k34WNQ8Lv0MbETBlQGob_vt3foynUHkIklJP4.Cig1Vwj4PEVBvEvFm.zomCyvXtA-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "5-Ingredient Homemade Almond Joy: No Tricks, Just One Delicious Treat", "title_full": "5-Ingredient Homemade Almond Joy: No Tricks, Just One Delicious Treat", "published": "2017-10-30T11:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/d9e8c3c8-img_3671.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e14f9533e8f7e89538905f921bef6d3ee7205e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhnOvCDOG9VDgzfhBcgdIYbVu5kRMomLY.k34WNQ8Lv0MbETBlQGob_vt3foynUHkIklJP4.Cig1Vwj4PEVBvEvFm.zomCyvXtA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-30T11:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "5-Ingredient Homemade Almond Joy: No Tricks, Just One Delicious Treat", "text": "5-Ingredient Homemade Almond Joy: No Tricks, Just One Delicious Treat October 30, 2017 Share on Facebook \n\nServe up these healthy homemade almond joy bars at your Halloween party for a delightful treat, without any tricks. \nMade with minimal ingredients, (only five of them!) these homemade almond joy bars are gluten-free, dairy-free, and can be made vegan by swapping out honey for maple or brown rice syrup. Homemade Almond Joy Ingredients \nThese homemade almond joy chocolates come together in no time. All you\u2019ll need is shredded unsweetened coconut flakes, raw honey, extra virgin coconut oil, dark chocolate, and raw almonds. \nShredded unsweetened coconut flakes make up the creamy, coconutty filling along with extra virgin coconut oil and honey. Look for finely shredded coconut flakes, as they make the mixture easier to bind together and deliver a tastier texture. Coconut flakes can often be found in the bulk section of your natural grocery store, or in the baking aisle. \nCoconut flakes are mixed with extra virgin coconut oil and honey to make a sweet and sticky paste. Always purchase cold-pressed or raw organic extra virgin coconut oil, which hasn\u2019t been overly processed and refined. This means that many of coconut\u2019s beneficial nutrients remain in tact in the oil. \nRaw honey sweetens these homemade almond joy chocolates while adding a hint of nutrients. Raw honey is a minimally processed variety of honey that offers more vitamins and minerals than processed conventional honey. Find it at farmers markets, Whole Foods Market, and local co-ops. \nAdding raw almonds to these chocolates is a deliciously crunchy way to add in healthy fats and flavor. Almonds are a rich source of monounsaturated fats, which are associated with reduced cholesterol and risk of heart disease, vitamin E, fiber, protein, and magnesium. Of course, if you prefer to go the Mounds route, leave the nuts out. \nTop the coconut and almond center with dark chocolate to transform these bars into heavenly goodness. Choose a dark chocolate with at least 80 percent cacao or higher , which delivers the most antioxidants and nutrients associated with dark chocolate health benefits . \nThese homemade almond joy chocolates are wickedly good.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T05:48:40.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e4b063f9d1de8dc42a0eaeeb3b555b394c5f2e48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhkrh466FtcYxh8cyvV.5aEJyyrcMKvkg0VMDLB80NWiAQ--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "84-Year-Old RBG\u2019s Workout Regime is Supreme #FitnessGoals", "title_full": "84-Year-Old RBG\u2019s Workout Regime is Supreme #FitnessGoals", "published": "2017-10-30T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c71ac6a2-rbg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e4b063f9d1de8dc42a0eaeeb3b555b394c5f2e48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhkrh466FtcYxh8cyvV.5aEJyyrcMKvkg0VMDLB80NWiAQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brianne Hogan", "published": "2017-10-30T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "84-Year-Old RBG\u2019s Workout Regime is Supreme #FitnessGoals", "text": "Share on Facebook image via Wikimedia \nJust when you thought Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg couldn\u2019t get anymore badass, her personal trainer reveals the 84-year-old \u2014 and two time cancer survivor \u2014 has a workout routine that would leave most gym rats begging for mercy. \nIn his new book, \u201c The RBG Workout: How She Stays Strong\u2026and You Can Too! \u201d Bader Ginsburg\u2019s personal trainer of nearly 20 years, Bryant Johnson, details his intense training sessions with RBG that solidifies her powerhouse status. \nHere\u2019s what we found out about the octogenarian\u2019s workout that gives her the stamina to lay down the law both in the courthouse, and in the gym. She Stretches A Lot \nAccording to Self , after a quick warmup on the elliptical, Johnson leads RBG through a long series of stretching, targeting arms, shoulders, legs, back, and hamstrings. \nStretching is an integral part of a workout routine, although it\u2019s often overlooked by most gym goers. In addition to improving flexibility, stretching increases the range of motion of your joints, which helps to prevent injury. It also improves blood circulation and energy levels, and for a senior like Bader Ginsburg, it also helps to relieve back pain and arthritis. \nThough stretching is usually saved for post-workout, performing static stretches before a strength training session, like RBG, helps to maintain flexibility of your muscles. She Pumps Some Serious Iron \nSelf reports that Bader Ginsburg does a series of weight resistance exercises , including chest press, leg extension, lat pull-down, cable row, and chest fly machines. According to Vogue , for the arm exercises, RBG will pump out up to 20 in one sitting. \nWith age, you start to lose muscle density which changes the way in which your body uses and burns energy. This is why consistent strength training is imperative for seniors, like RBG. Resistance training helps seniors to improve their functional strength and flexibility, while building bone density and mass, which protects against osteoporosis. She Loves Her Push-Ups \n\u201cShe gets mad if I try to skip the push-ups,\u201d Johnson told Vogue. According to Self, RBG does two sets of 10 regular push-ups \u2014 after her already excruciatingly tough strength session. And, not surprisingly, RBG doesn\u2019t do modified. \nPush-ups are a great full-body workout, working everything from your neck to your toes, while helping to strengthen your arms and chest. By working the core , push-ups not only give you a defined middle section, but also improves balance and stability, which is key to help seniors from falling. (Seriously, is RBG hiding a six-pack underneath that robe?) She Has a Unique Workout \nAccording to Vogue, Bader Ginsburg insists on playing PBS\u2019\u201cNewsHour\u201d or NPR during gym sessions while sporting an old sweatshirt emblazoned with \u201cSuper Diva!\u201d \nThough RBG\u2019s choice of playlist doesn\u2019t have much of a beat, research shows that music , from the lyrics to the tempo, can affect athletic performance by improving a person\u2019s mind-set or distracting from discomfort. \nAs for her choice of clothing? Well, it sounds pretty amazing, and it probably helps RBG feel amazing, too. Studies have shown that what an athlete wears can affect their self-perception, which, ultimately, reflects in their performance. \nIf talk radio and an awesome sweatshirt helps RBG to step up her game in the gym and get in the zone, then maybe she\u2019s onto something. The Takeaway \nRBG is a boss. But she is also dedicated to her workout regime. The New York Post reports that she once left dinner with President Obama early just so she could get in her exercise session. Ultimately, what makes RBG powerful in the gym is the attitude she conveys on the bench: confidence, and consistency. \nRelated on Organic Authority", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ruth bader ginsbu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bader ginsburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryant johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rbg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vogue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york post", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vogue", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T05:48:43.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7ce91fd27768a5d79a1cc5bd4f280ff916096ad6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhmbw4LSvujxafedHblt2HQRbVNl1xbEcNK3SE2hrmUGTrU_HbdIKtQ_Lru9WR_mblW0Pmq4e5OK0ibRad5XxSPiYEKAoQEeEN6AJkKSPie9WA--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "New Study Shows Human Glyphosate Levels Have More than Doubled in 23 Years", "title_full": "New Study Shows Human Glyphosate Levels Have More than Doubled in 23 Years", "published": "2017-10-30T09:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/972514ca-istock-505597657.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7ce91fd27768a5d79a1cc5bd4f280ff916096ad6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhmbw4LSvujxafedHblt2HQRbVNl1xbEcNK3SE2hrmUGTrU_HbdIKtQ_Lru9WR_mblW0Pmq4e5OK0ibRad5XxSPiYEKAoQEeEN6AJkKSPie9WA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily Monaco", "published": "2017-10-30T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "New Study Shows Human Glyphosate Levels Have More than Doubled in 23 Years", "text": "Share on Facebook iStock/ImagineGolf \nA new study has shown that glyphosate levels in humans have more than doubled since 1993; glyphosate-resistant GMO crops were first introduced into the United States in 1994. \nThe research , which compared glyphosate levels in the urine of 100 people in California, was conducted by the San Diego School of Medicine and was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \n\u201cPrior to the introduction of genetically modified foods, very few people had detectable levels of glyphosate,\u201d says study author Paul Mills, of the University of California at San Diego School of Medicine. \u201cOur exposure to these chemicals has increased significantly over the years but most people are unaware that they are consuming them through their diet.\u201d \nResearchers found that detectable amounts of the herbicide increased from an average of 0.2 micrograms per liter to .44 micrograms per liter in 2014-2016.

But one Chicago company is redefining the very connotation of seasonal food. MightyVine uses state-of-the-art technology to grow tomatoes in the Chicagoland area 365 days a year \u2013 and the company is committed to sustainability. \nIt\u2019s no surprise that before MightyVine, there was a bit of a dearth of good winter tomatoes in Chicago. \n\u201cMy office back in 2010 was in the Loop; there were a bunch of different lunch places around there, and every sandwich and every salad you bought would have these tomatoes on them,\u201d co-founder and CEO Gary Lazarski tells Fast Company . \u201cThey were terrible. You\u2019d see people sitting on a park bench, and without fail, they all do the same thing: Open up the sandwich, look at that sad, orange disk, peel it off like it was a dirty sock, and throw it out.\u201d \nIt was then that Lazarski began thinking about how he could bring great tomatoes to Chicago 365 days a year, and the answer came in the form of hydroponics. \nMightyVine uses glasshouse technology pioneered in Holland. The model creates its own little ecosystem, from using rainwater and snow melt capture to avoid water waste, resulting in using only ten percent of the water of field grown tomatoes, to natural bumblebee pollination and sustainable, all-natural pest management techniques. \n\u201cIf everything goes as planned, we don\u2019t have to use pesticides,\u201d says MightyVine co-founder and VP Danny Murphy. \u201cFor the most part, we use biologicals to control the greenhouse: beneficial bugs \u2013 typically ladybugs or wasps \u2013 combat the harmful white flies and aphids and things like that.\u201d \nIt seems that MightyVine has everything it could possibly need to be deemed a sustainable enterprise \u2013 except an organic certification. The Battle Between Hydroponics and the Organic Certification \nWhether or not to include sustainable hydroponics in the organic market has been a hotly debated issue of late. While some sustainable hydroponic growers would love to have the trusted certified organic label (and the price premium it affords), proponents of organic say that these farmers should not be permitted to sport the label, no matter how sustainable their operations, because they are not building soil fertility. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked really hard for this word, and it means something, and they want it, and it\u2019s not theirs,\u201d Linley Dixon of the Cornucopia Institute tells Modern Farmer . \u201cLet them build it for 30 years, like the organic farmers did.\u201d \nBut at least in the case of MightyVine, the lack of a label isn\u2019t too worrying. \n\u201cPrior to the new food movement, I think organic was it,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cEverything else kind of seemed to be second fiddle. For us, we don\u2019t see that.\u201d \nMurphy and Lazarski know that their practices are \u201cas good as organic, if not better.\u201d All they need to do is show the world what MightyVine can do. Chicago-Grown, Chicago-Loved \nFor Murphy and Lazarski to be able to even consider growing tomatoes in Chicago in the winter, they had to seek out the technology that would give the tomatoes the warmth they needed. This they found in 2010, with Royal Pride Holland, a Dutch company, a pioneer of sustainable glasshouse technology since 1960. MightyVine partnered with the Royal Pride and harvested its first tomatoes in October of 2015 in a 7.5 acre glasshouse in Rochelle, IL. \nThe land was another hurdle that it took the company a long time to overcome. After looking at innumerable parcels, the founders finally found the ideal location: a former farm that had been sold to be developed for warehouses. After the topsoil was removed, the recession hit, and the site was abandoned. The farming family, who had owned the land for generations, bought it back, but because of the topsoil removal were unable to work it. \nMightyVine saw the potential in this land, buying 20 acres (with the option to buy 20 more) and bringing the farmer on as a partner in the company. It is on this land that MightyVine built its first greenhouse; a second opened last year, and today, MightyVine has 15 acres upon which to grow its 200,000 tomato plants. \n\u201cIt was a great way for [the farmer] to be able to repurpose the land in an agricultural way, which is pretty neat,\u201d says Murphy. \nThe structure uses glass and radiated heat to create the ideal temperatures for growing two of Royal Pride\u2019s proprietary seeds: MightyVine\u2019s \u201csignature\u201d Robinio cherry tomatoes and Roterno on-the-vine slicing tomatoes. \n\u201cOur seed is a little bit smaller than most,\u201d says Murphy of the slicing tomatoes, which make up about 60 percent of the company\u2019s total output. \u201cObviously, the larger you get with your tomato, the harder it is to retain a high sugar content or a good flavor profile, so we wanted to choose a little bit smaller of a tomato on the vine for \u2013 to be a little bit more of a specialty tomato, if you will.\u201d \nThe company also grows select varietals based on demand from Chicago chefs, including grape, cocktail, orange, and red beefsteak tomatoes. \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to grow a great-tasting beefsteak, just because a tomato\u2019s 90 percent water, and the larger you get, the harder it is to retain that good flavor profile,\u201d says Murphy, but MightyVine is up to the challenge. \nThe goal with all of the company\u2019s tomatoes, at any rate, is to live up to its name: tomatoes are grown on the vine as long as possible, to be picked at the peak of ripeness, rather than being picked early for better shipability like so many tomatoes in the grocery store today. \nSmall-scale distribution also means that MightyVine drastically reduces its carbon footprint. The tomatoes are distributed only in the Chicagoland area \u2013 just as far as Milwaukee and Madison, Wisconsin. \nOne would think this would prove limiting, but MightyVine has more than enough demand just in the area. In a given month, the company harvests and delivers around 700,000 pounds of tomatoes to grocery stores; as well as chefs including Frontera\u2019s Rick Bayless; and the founders\u2019 from-scratch school food service company, HandCut Foods. And they\u2019re planning on further expansion: more greenhouses, or even more products, from cucumbers and peppers to strawberries. \nThat said, there\u2019s one part of the industry that MightyVine never expects \u2013 or wants \u2013 to replace. \n\u201cWe actually start cleaning out and go to about 50 percent production in the summertime because of locally grown tomatoes,\u201d explains Murphy. \u201cWe\u2019ll always be second fiddle to that, and we\u2019re OK with that.\u201d \nThe goal is not to replace summer tomatoes but rather to give Chicago a taste of summer \u2013 produced locally \u2013 when the weather just doesn\u2019t allow it. \n\u201cBeing able to source local produce in the wintertime is a challenge, to say the least, so we\u2019re trying to help bridge that gap and allow chefs in Chicago to have a great opportunity to have a great-tasting tomato 365 days a year,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cThose six to eight months a year when it\u2019s a challenge to find those delicious tomatoes, for us, that\u2019s our time to shine.\u201d \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T18:19:47.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c3e5ce732de2a82da3296f177368d4294c4bb82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhnvc06SHq14YJ1SxN_Qzv8olM2XwELY0AT53o0weioTkjRssQJTFj_4qRpI_QhdSjEKZNRbp2anpzCWm4WRgwVxuCc2kdS4pIQ-", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "The Campbell Soup Company Joins Nascent Plant Based Foods Association", "title_full": "The Campbell Soup Company Joins Nascent Plant Based Foods Association", "published": "2017-10-31T09:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/21c80382-3533550418_4ce897d1fd_b.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c3e5ce732de2a82da3296f177368d4294c4bb82", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9Lhnvc06SHq14YJ1SxN_Qzv8olM2XwELY0AT53o0weioTkjRssQJTFj_4qRpI_QhdSjEKZNRbp2anpzCWm4WRgwVxuCc2kdS4pIQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jill Ettinger", "published": "2017-10-31T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Campbell Soup Company Joins Nascent Plant Based Foods Association", "text": "Share on Facebook image via Yohei Yamashita / Creative Commons \nThe Campbell Soup Co. has set its sights firmly on the future.

In Spain, the siesta is engrained in society. Stores, restaurants, and businesses close daily for a midday break so that citizens can take a snooze after lunch time. The same is true of Italy, where, as a result of the riposo, businesses are known to shut down for a few hours as well. \nIt\u2019s clear that we have something to learn from these slower-paced cultures where the average life expectancy is significantly longer. Italy comes in 14th on the list with a lifespan of 82 years old and Spain comes in 21st with a lifespan of 81. Much further down the list is the U.S., which comes in at 43 with an average lifespan of 79. Napping in the U.S. still isn\u2019t as culturally accepted everywhere but here\u2019s why it should be. What Research Says About Napping \nA November 2006 study published in the journal Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine found that 30-minute naps during the day promote wakefulness and enhance performance and learning ability. Another study published in the 2010 edition of the journal Progressive Brain Research found that napping improved cognitive function throughout the rest of the day. In fact, the study found that just seven to ten minutes of sleep can result in a substantial increase of alertness. According to Robert Stickgold, a Harvard sleep researcher, a well-timed nap can almost immediately make you more productive at work because it makes people better problem solvers. Why Napping Works \nResearchers have found in recent years that there is a brief hump built into our circadian rhythm which may cause us to become tired midday naturally. A brief nap at this point in the day can help us to get over the hump, while extended naps (longer than one hour) can cause post-nap inertia. Another factor in daytime sleepiness is that our circadian rhythms cause us to get sleepy no matter what after 16 hours of being awake. This means that if you wake up in the middle of the night because you\u2019re restless or you work at night, you\u2019ll almost certainly require a short nap to reset your circadian rhythm. How to Nap Effectively \nNapping has been shown to be good for your health and your performance but how you nap is important. According to Rebecca Lee, holistic health expert and founder of RemediesForMe.com , short naps are highly important. The longer you sleep, the more groggy you\u2019ll feel when you wakeup. According to Lee, there are four stages of sleep: Stage 1 is light sleep, which we can be easily awakened. Stage 2 our brain waves slow down. Stages 3 and 4 are deep sleep, characterized by very slow delta brain waves. \n\u201cWhen you first fall asleep, stages one and two each last about 10 minutes. You can wake up from stage one feeling energized and alert,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt takes a bit longer to recover from stage two. If you sleep for more than 20 minutes and are woken from deep sleep, you\u2019re likely to feeling sluggish and disoriented until brain wave activity speeds up again.\u201d \nAccording to Lee, you should nap intentionally, not just when you\u2019re feeling sleepy. Here\u2019s how: Plan to nap for 10 to 20 minutes at the same time and place every day in order to adjust your system to the routine. If you can\u2019t do this, just try and keep the nap times similar. Consider setting the alarm on your smartphone and sleeping with headphones on. This will help block out noise. Wearing an eye mask will block out light and signal to others that you are intentionally napping. If you are a coffee drinker, drink your coffee right before taking your nap. The caffeine effects will kick in after you are all done with your nap. You will feel well rested and the extra boost of caffeine will help keep you up for the rest of the day. As counterintuitive as this might sound, research has shown that for those that do drink coffee, if you drink it right before you nap, by the time you wake you\u2019re ready to attack the rest of your day. A study published in the 2003 edition of Clinical Neurophysiology found that caffeine combined with a nap was most effective for sleepiness and performance level and its effects lasted more than an hour after the nap. How NOT to Nap \nAccording to sleep experts at Harvard Medical School , napping too much during the day can also be an indication of health problems if the napping is a result of a lack of sleep at night or if the naps are excessively long. \n\u201cIn studies of older people, regular napping has been associated with diabetes, depression, and chronic pain, presumably because those conditions adversely affect nighttime sleep,\u201d the reseaechers noted. \u201cIndeed, it only stands to reason that napping might be a coping mechanism for those who can\u2019t sleep well at night, no matter the age or the reason.\u201d \nThis shows that napping is a key tool for optimal health when it\u2019s proactive rather than reactionary. So, don\u2019t feel guilty getting a few minutes of shut eye at your desk post lunch, I know I won\u2019t. \n ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rebecca lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert stickgold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "progressive brain research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard medical school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-31T18:19:49.004+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42df65ae32c8f0f2281e4ca20b5db9a97f44d9d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhljpKNIj3930yXb5m.FaNQ0P_LcdJ5lbdRIi75Z9YlviwQVUZ8l3pa7_.Ty8pIiNCZglWwJRL6x1g--", "site_full": "www.organicauthority.com", "site": "organicauthority.com", "site_section": "http://www.organicauthority.com/feed/", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "Organic Authority", "title": "Elderberry Syrup: the Deliciously Sweet Cold and Flu Remedy that Works", "title_full": "Elderberry Syrup: the Deliciously Sweet Cold and Flu Remedy that Works", "published": "2017-10-31T09:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/iStock_16353326_MEDIUM.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 53334, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42df65ae32c8f0f2281e4ca20b5db9a97f44d9d4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8pRPTlHbHlPSalMFbRBfkjwrDKaLs9LhljpKNIj3930yXb5m.FaNQ0P_LcdJ5lbdRIi75Z9YlviwQVUZ8l3pa7_.Ty8pIiNCZglWwJRL6x1g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kate Gavlick", "published": "2017-10-31T09:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Elderberry Syrup: the Deliciously Sweet Cold and Flu Remedy that Works", "text": "Elderberry Syrup: the Deliciously Sweet Cold and Flu Remedy that Works October 31, 2017 Share on Facebook iStock/cjp \nInstead of reaching for conventional cold and flu medicine this winter, try using something more holistic . Enter the powerful herbal elixir of choice for centuries: elderberry syrup. \nNot only does elderberry syrup taste delicious, (kids even like the stuff!) it packs powerful healing properties and can be made in your own kitchen. What are Elderberries? \nBlack Elderberries , or Sambucus nigra, are small berries that come from the European elder tree, native to Europe and North America. The tart, bluish-purple berries and cream-colored flowers of the tree have been used for centuries for topical wound healing and to treat illnesses such as the cold and flu. \nIn fact, the potent medicinal powers gave the elder tree the nickname of the \u201ccountry people\u2019s medicine chest\u201d for centuries. \nAlthough black elderberries can be consumed raw, the Practical Herbalist notes that \u201cthey should to be processed into syrup, jam, vinegar, or tincture before use to prevent an upset stomach. Avoid dwarf elder ( Sambucus ebulus ), which grows berries that can be toxic.\u201d Health Benefits of Elderberry Syrup \nElderberry has been widely studied due to its reported antioxidant, antiviral, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, and immune-modulating, as well as antidepressant properties. \nSo much of elderberry\u2019s powerful medicinal properties and healing benefits are due to its high number of antioxidants, including anthocyanins, which give the berries the rich blue-violet color. \nAccording to the University of Maryland medical center , \u201celderberry outranks blueberries, cranberries, goji berries, and blackberries in terms of total flavonoid content.
