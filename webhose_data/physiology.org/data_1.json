We investigated changes in the central gain of the stretch reflex circuitry in response to Btx injection in the triceps surae muscle in rats. Experiments were performed in 21 rats. Eight rats were a control group, and 13 rats were injected with 6 IU of Btx in the left triceps surae muscle. Two weeks after Btx injection, larger monosynaptic reflexes (MSR) were recorded from the left (injected) than the right (noninjected) L4 + L5 ventral roots following stimulation of the corresponding dorsal roots. A similar increase on the left side was observed in response to stimulation of descending motor tracts, suggesting that increased excitability of spinal motor neurons may at least partly explain the increased reflexes. However, significant changes were also observed in postactivation depression of the MSR, suggesting that plastic changes in transmission from Ia afferent to the motor neurons also may be involved. The data demonstrate that muscle paralysis induced by Btx injection is accompanied by plastic adaptations in the central stretch reflex circuitry, which counteract the antispastic effect of Btx. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Injection of botulinum toxin into ankle muscles causes increased gain of stretch reflex. This is caused by adaptive changes in regulation of transmitter release from Ia afferents and increased excitability of spinal motor neurons. botulinum toxin", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T01:48:30.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e06b2b6408c50c577afbf6f8f544b6ee5fa6de9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21R0q.kw8mhRRkLIc337m0THCnNvFKxa0JI-", "site_full": "ajpcell.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://highwire.stanford.edu/rss/journalsbydate.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HighWire-hosted journals, sorted by date of last publication", "title": "American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology", "title_full": "American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e06b2b6408c50c577afbf6f8f544b6ee5fa6de9f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21R0q.kw8mhRRkLIc337m0THCnNvFKxa0JI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "American Journal of Physiology - Cell Physiology", "text": "10.1152/ajpcell.00075.2017 ABOUT AJP-CELL \nThe American Journal of Physiology-Cell Physiology is dedicated to innovative approaches to the study of cell and molecular physiology.

By studying balance and postural control of a participant with camptocormia - an involuntary flexion of the trunk during standing that resolves when supine - a divergence between balance and postural control was revealed. A kinematic and kinetic investigation of standing and walking showed a stereotyped flexion of the upper body by almost 80 degrees over a few minutes, and yet the participant's ability to control their center of mass within their base of support and to compensate for external perturbations remained intact. This unique case also revealed the involvement of automatic, tonic control of the paraspinal muscles during standing and the effects of attention. Although strength was reduced and MRI showed a reduction in muscle mass, there was sufficient strength to maintain an upright posture under voluntary control and when using geste antagoniste maneuvers or \"sensory tricks\" from visual, auditory and haptic biofeedback. Dual-tasks that either increased or decreased the attention given to postural alignment would decrease, or increase the postural flexion, respectively. The custom-made, 'twister' device that measured axial resistance to slow passive rotation revealed abnormalities in axial muscle tone distribution during standing. The results suggest that the disorder in this case was due to a disruption in the automatic, tonic drive to the postural muscles and myogenic changes were secondary.

In particular, this hypothesis predicts force illusions caused by muscle vibration and mediated via changes in both afferent and efferent components of kinesthesia. Healthy subjects performed accurate steady force production tasks by pressing with the four fingers of one hand (the task hand) on individual force sensors with and without visual feedback. At various times during the trials, subjects matched the perceived force using the other hand. High-frequency vibration was applied to one or both of the forearms (over the hand and finger extensors). Without visual feedback, subjects showed a drop in the task hand force, which was significantly smaller under the vibration of that forearm. Force production by the matching hand was consistently higher than that of the task hand. Vibrating one of the forearms affected the matching hand in a manner consistent with the perception of higher magnitude of force produced by the vibrated hand. The findings were consistent between the dominant and non-dominant hands. The effects of vibration on both force drift and force mismatching suggest that vibration led to shifts in both signals from proprioceptors and the efferent component of perception, the referent coordinate and/or co-activation command. The observations fit the hypothesis on combined perception of kinematic-kinetic variables with little specificity of different groups of peripheral receptors that all contribute to perception of forces and coordinates. kinesthetic perception", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T11:06:59.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a61ae8aec34301dd237f95df40a04feb6b6a218", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9Hry9zvQQDVAuY.RIbRjBsg--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "State-Dependent Rhythmogenesis and Frequency Control in a Half-Center Locomotor CPG", "title_full": "State-Dependent Rhythmogenesis and Frequency Control in a Half-Center Locomotor CPG", "published": "2017-10-04T21:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a61ae8aec34301dd237f95df40a04feb6b6a218", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9Hry9zvQQDVAuY.RIbRjBsg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ausborn, J., Snyder, A.

This rhythmic pattern is likely to result from inhibitory interactions between neural populations representing flexor and extensor half-centers. However, it is unclear whether the flexor-extensor CPG has a quasi-symmetric organization with both half-centers critically involved in rhythm generation, features an asymmetric organization with flexor-driven rhythmogenesis, or comprises a pair of intrinsically rhythmic half-centers. There are experimental data that support each of the above concepts but appear to be inconsistent with the others. In this theoretical/modeling study, we present and analyze a CPG model architecture that can operate in different regimes consistent with the above three concepts depending on conditions, which are defined by external excitatory drives to CPG half-centers. We show that control of frequency and phase durations within each regime depends on network dynamics, defined by the regime-dependent expression of the half-centers' intrinsic rhythmic capabilities and the operating phase transition mechanisms (escape versus release).

We have previously shown that nitric oxide (NO) can elicit release of GABA independently from activation of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels in cultured retinal ACs. This voltage-independent quantal GABA release relies on a Ca 2+ influx mechanism with pharmacological characteristics consistent with the involvement of transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels TRPC4 and/or TRPC5. To determine the identity of these channels, we evaluate the ability of NO to elevate dendritic Ca 2+ and to stimulate GABA release from cultured ACs under conditions known to alter the function of TRPC4 and 5. We find that these effects of NO are phospholipase C-dependent, have a biphasic dependence on La 3+ and are unaffected by moderate concentrations of the TRPC4 selective antagonist ML204. Together, these results suggest that NO promotes GABA release by activating TRPC5 channels in AC dendrites. To confirm a role for TRPC5, we knocked down the expression of TRPC5 using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockdown and found that both the NO-dependent Ca 2+ elevations and increase in GABA release are dependent upon the expression of TRPC5. These results demonstrate a novel NO-dependent mechanism for regulating neurotransmitter output from retinal ACs.

Linear acceleration signals arise from otolith organs and rotation signals arise from semicircular canals. In the vestibular nerve, these signals are carried by different afferents. Vestibular nucleus neurons represent the first point of convergence for these distinct sensory signals. This study systematically evaluated how rotational and translational signals interact in single neurons in the vestibular nuclei: multisensory integration at the first opportunity for convergence between these two independent vestibular sensory signals. Single-unit recordings were made from the vestibular nuclei of awake macaques during yaw rotation, translation in the horizontal plane, and combinations of rotation and translation at different frequencies. The overall response magnitude of the combined translation and rotation was generally less than the sum of the magnitudes in responses to the stimuli applied independently. However, we found that under conditions in which the peaks of the rotational and translational responses were coincident, these signals were approximately additive. With presentation of rotation and translation at different frequencies, rotation was attenuated more than translation, regardless of which was at a higher frequency. These data suggest a non-linear interaction between these two sensory modalities in the vestibular nuclei, in which coincident peak responses are proportionally stronger than other, off-peak interactions. These results are similar to those reported for other forms of multisensory integration, such as audio-visual integration in the superior colliculus. otolith", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "yaw rotation signals on non-eye movement neurons", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T11:07:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c8aa55aa437263b19b3622343153f15b8a867c48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9BqbAWIUjJJGdYqyoI4ys7w--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Calcium dynamics control K-ATP channel mediated bursting in substantia nigra dopamine neurons: a combined experimental and modeling study", "title_full": "Calcium dynamics control K-ATP channel mediated bursting in substantia nigra dopamine neurons: a combined experimental and modeling study", "published": "2017-10-04T21:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c8aa55aa437263b19b3622343153f15b8a867c48", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9BqbAWIUjJJGdYqyoI4ys7w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Knowlton, C.

Burst firing in mSN DA neurons, in contrast to lateral SN DA neurons, requires functional ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATP) both in vitro and in vivo. However, the precise role of K-ATP channels in promoting burst firing is un-known. We show experimentally that L-type calcium channel activity in mSN DA neurons en-hances open probability of K-ATP channels. We then generated a mathematical model to study the role of Ca 2+ dynamics driving K-ATP channel function in mSN DA neurons during bursting. In our model, Ca 2+ influx leads to local accumulation of ADP due to Ca-ATPase activity, which in turn activates K-ATP channels. If K-ATP channel activation reaches levels sufficient to terminate spiking, rhythmic bursting occurs. The model explains the experimental observation that, in vitro, co-application of NMDA and a selective K-ATP channel opener, NN414, are required to elicit bursting as follows. Simulated NMDA receptor activation increases the firing rate and the rate of Ca 2+ influx, which increases the activation of K-ATP. The model suggests that additional sources of hyperpolarization, such as GABAergic synaptic input, are recruited in vivo for burst termination or rebound burst discharge. The model predicts that NN414 increases the sensitivity of the K-ATP channel to ADP, promoting burst firing in vitro, and that that high levels of Ca 2+ buffering, as might be expected in the calbindin-positive DA SN subpopulation, promote rhyth-mic bursting pattern, consistent with experimental observations in vivo. dopamine", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "adp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T11:07:02.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "90c33645405db2c931cce93a60931dea15c45832", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9n6Gtr6j8csfwktGEKBZqbQ--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Synchronization Matters for Motor Coordination", "title_full": "Synchronization Matters for Motor Coordination", "published": "2017-10-04T21:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "90c33645405db2c931cce93a60931dea15c45832", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9n6Gtr6j8csfwktGEKBZqbQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pesce Ibarra, L.

However, the neural circuits involving fear memory acquisition and retrieval are still unclear. Two subregions within mPFC that have received a lot of attention are the prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) cortices (e.g., Santini et al. 2008; Song et al. 2015). Interestingly, PL and IL may play distinct roles during fear memory acquisition and retrieval but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. One possibility is that the intrinsic membrane properties differ between these subregions. Thus, the current study was carried out to characterize the basic membrane properties of mPFC neurons in different layers and subregions. We found that pyramidal neurons in L2/3 were more hyperpolarized and less excitable than in L5. This was observed in both IL and PL and was associated with an enhanced h-current in L5 neurons. Within L2/3, IL neurons were more excitable than those in PL, which may be due to a lower spike threshold and higher input resistance in IL neurons. Within L5, the intrinsic excitability was comparable between neurons obtained in IL and PL. Thus, the heterogeneity in physiological properties of mPFC neurons may underlie the observed subregion-specific contribution of mPFC in cognitive function and emotional control, such as fear memory expression. infralimbic", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T11:07:04.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2ef8e62ac7cf93b4ebd1ee8c9d09241d5a795895", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9n6Gtr6j8csdWQfl9BYvz5g--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Figure-ground organization in the visual cortex: does meaning matter?", "title_full": "Figure-ground organization in the visual cortex: does meaning matter?", "published": "2017-10-04T21:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2ef8e62ac7cf93b4ebd1ee8c9d09241d5a795895", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVLE0wuQy.X9n6Gtr6j8csdWQfl9BYvz5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ko, H.-k., von der Heydt, R.", "published": "2017-10-04T21:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Figure-ground organization in the visual cortex: does meaning matter?", "text": "PDF Abstract Figure-ground organization in the visual cortex is generally assumed to be based partly on general rules, and partly on specific influences of object recognition in higher centers as found in the temporal lobe.

We found no superiority of face silhouettes compared to nonsense shapes in eliciting border-ownership signals over all. However, in some neurons, border-ownership signals differed strongly between the two categories consistently across many different profile shapes. Surprisingly, this category selectivity appeared as early as 70 ms after stimulus onset, which is earlier than the typical latency of shape selective responses, but compatible with the earliest face selective responses in the inferior temporal lobe.

While the cellular mechanisms underlying these two contrasting afferent responses remain obscure, we postulated that the reduction in afferent sensitivity was attributed, in part, to the activation of alpha9-containing nAChRs ( 9nAChRs) and small-conductance potassium channels (SK) in vestibular type II hair cells, as demonstrated in the peripheral vestibular system of other vertebrates. To test this hypothesis, we examined the effects of the predominant EVS neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) on vestibular type II hair cells from wild type (wt) and \u03b19nAChR-subunit knockout (\u03b19-/-) mice. Immunostaining for choline acetyltransferase revealed there were no obvious gross morphological differences in the peripheral EVS innervation among any of these strains. ACh application onto wt type II hair cells, at resting potentials, produced a fast inward current followed by a slower outward current, resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and decreased membrane resistance. Hyperpolarization and decreased resistance were due to gating of SK channels. Consistent with activation of \u03b19*nAChRs and SK channels, these ACh-sensitive currents were antagonized by the \u03b19*nAChR blocker strychnine and SK blockers apamin and tamapin. Type II hair cells from \u03b19-/- mice, however, failed to respond to ACh at all. These results confirm the critical importance of \u03b19nAChRs in efferent modulation of mammalian type II vestibular hair cells.

In this study we investigated the effects of profound early psychosocial neglect associated with institutional rearing on the development of task-independent brain networks, estimated from longitudinally acquired electroencephalographic (EEG) data from <30 to 96 mo, in three cohorts of children from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), including abandoned children reared in institutions who were randomly assigned either to a foster care intervention or to remain in care as usual and never-institutionalized children. Two aberrantly connected brain networks were identified in children that had been reared in institutions: 1 ) a hyperconnected parieto-occipital network, which included cortical hubs and connections that may partially overlap with default-mode network, and 2 ) a hypoconnected network between left temporal and distributed bilateral regions, both of which were aberrantly connected across neural oscillations. This study provides the first evidence of the adverse effects of early psychosocial neglect on the wiring of the developing brain. Given these networks' potentially significant role in various cognitive processes, including memory, learning, social communication, and language, these findings suggest that institutionalization in early life may profoundly impact the neural correlates underlying multiple cognitive domains, in ways that may not be fully reversible in the short term. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This paper provides first evidence that early psychosocial neglect associated with institutional rearing profoundly affects the development of the brain\u2019s neural circuitry. Using longitudinally acquired electrophysiological data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), the paper identifies multiple task-independent networks that are abnormally connected (hyper- or hypoconnected) in children reared in institutions compared with never-institutionalized children. These networks involve spatially distributed brain areas and their abnormal connections may adversely impact neural information processing across cognitive domains. brain networks early development psychosocial neglect from the microscale of individual neurons to the macroscale of cortical regions, the brain's neuroarchitecture is characterized by networks organized into topologies that ensure flexible, rapid, and efficient neural information processing ( Bullmore and Sporns 2009 ). These networks may be divided into two broad categories: task-related networks that are activated and coordinated in response to cognitive demands and external stimuli, and task-independent (resting-state or stimulus-independent) networks that are spontaneously active and coordinated when the brain is not actively engaged in specific cognitive tasks. In some cases, task-dependent networks increase their activity and coordination at the same time as specific task-independent networks decrease theirs ( Fox et al. 2005 ). Thus, in part due to these inverse correlations, task-independent networks may play a critical role in cognitive function and neural information processing ( Dosenbach et al. 2008 ; Kelly et al. 2008 ; Raichle et al. 2001 , Raichle and Snyder 2007). Predominantly fMRI studies in adults have identified several distinct, and in some cases interconnected task-independent networks, including the default-mode network (DMN) ( Greicius et al. 2003 ; Mantini et al. 2007 ; Vincent et al. 2006 ; Ward et al. 2014 ). The topologies of these networks, estimated from fMRI data with excellent spatial resolution, may be directly correlated with those of structural networks ( Barttfeld et al. 2015 ; Greicius et al. 2009 ). Previous studies have associated disrupted task-independent networks, with neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism ( Bluhm et al. 2007 ; Kennedy et al. 2006 ). The dynamic evolution of task-independent networks in the developing brain is poorly understood and our current knowledge is primarily based on fMRI studies. Elements of these networks come on line early in infancy ( Fransson et al. 2007 ), but at least the DMN, which includes the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, lateral temporal cortex, precuneus and lateral parietal inferior gyri, and the hippocampal formation ( Buckner et al. 2008 ; Greicius et al. 2003 ), may be incompletely connected even at ages 7\u20139 yr ( Fair et al. 2008 ). Negative early experiences and stressors, including poverty, abuse, and psychosocial neglect, may have profound effects on neural maturation and consequently brain structure and function. In fact, social and emotional deprivation associated with institutional rearing has been shown to adversely affect brain\u2019s structure ( Bauer et al. 2009 ; Bick et al. 2015 ; Eluvathingal et al. 2006 ; Sheridan et al. 2012 ), metabolism ( Chugani et al. 2001 ; Tottenham et al. 2011 ) and electrical activity ( Marshall et al. 2004 , 2008 ; McLaughlin et al. 2010 , 2011 ; Stamoulis et al. 2015a; Vanderwert et al. 2010 ). Earlier work on the Bucharest Early Intervention Project (BEIP), a longitudinal study of children with a history of severe early deprivation (see Nelson et al. 2014 ; Zeanah et al. 2003 ), has shown that early psychosocial deprivation significantly impacts age-related dynamics in the developing brain\u2019s rhythms (Stamoulis et al. 2015a). In the same sample, Marshall et al. (2008) showed that removal from an institution and placement in a foster care home before 24 mo of age resulted in higher local network synchrony and statistically higher power in the alpha band (8\u201312 Hz) in the first 4 yr of life in comparison to children who remained in institutions. A positive modulatory effect of foster care placement was also reported in other oscillations (Stamoulis et al. 2015a), although changes in these oscillations from 42 to 96 mo were found to be distinct in children removed from institutions and placed in foster care compared with those who had never been institutionalized. These results highlight the profound adverse effects of early institutionalization on the developing brain. There are very few studies that have investigated task-independent networks in the developing brain and no previous work on the effects of neglect on these networks. This study investigated the topologies of task-independent networks and their developmental trajectories in children participating in the BEIP. Longitudinal electrophysiological (EEG) data from three cohorts were analyzed, including a group of institutionalized children who were randomized to a high-quality foster care placement (the foster care group), a group randomized to remain in institutional care (care as usual group) and a group of children who had never been institutionalized and lived with their families in the Bucharest community (never-institutionalized group). Although EEG has excellent temporal resolution, it lacks the high spatial resolution of fMRI and cannot resolve network topologies with the same spatial specificity as fMRI. Consequently, brain network topologies estimated from fMRI (which measures hemodynamic responses) and EEG (which measures neural activity) are not directly comparable. Nevertheless, EEG may still provide spatially sparse connectivity information on task-independent networks that may overlap with those identified by fMRI. Here we hypothesized that the spatial organization, properties and age-related dynamics of these networks are significantly impacted by early neglect in a frequency-specific manner, resulting in aberrant topologies that impair the efficiency of neural information processing and consequently cognitive function. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bucharest Early Intervention Project The BEIP is an ongoing longitudinal study that started in 2001 as a randomized controlled trial with foster care as an intervention for young children who had been abandoned at birth and placed in institutions. Using multimodal data, the study aims to investigate the effects of early psychosocial deprivation on the structure and function of the developing brain and potentially beneficial effects of removal from an institution and foster care placement ( Nelson et al. 2014 ; Zeanah et al. 2003 ). One hundred thirty-six children who had been reared in institutions entered the trial at ages 6\u201330 mo and were randomized to two arms: care as usual (CAUG; n = 68), i.e., more prolonged institutional rearing, and foster care (FCG; n = 68), i.e., placement in high-quality foster care specifically created for the project. A comparison group of 72 Romanian children who had never been institutionalized and lived with their families in Bucharest communities was also recruited (NIG). Participants The present study sought to quantify the age-related changes in task-independent networks using longitudinally acquired EEG signals from the BEIP cohorts, with an emphasis on 42 and 96 mo (although data at all ages were analyzed). Thus only subgroups of the BEIP cohorts with measurements at a minimum of two time points were included. Also, four children in the CAUG with diagnosed Autism Spectrum Disorder were excluded. The characteristics of these groups are described in more detail in (Stamoulis et al. 2015a). Sixty-two children in the CAUG [median age at study entry = 23.0 mo, interquartile range (IQR) = 9 mo], 61 children in the FCG (median age at study entry = 23.0 mo, IQR = 11 mo), and 44 children in the NIG (median age at study entry = 21.5 mo, IQR = 12 mo) were studied. Demographic Data Age, which varied between participants both at study entry and the second assessment (30\u201333 mo) but not at 42 or 96 mo, sex, age at foster care placement for children in the FCG, percent time spent in institutions for children in the FGC and CAUG, birth weight, and head circumference were included in the analysis as potential covariates. All missing data were assumed to be missing at random, mainly as a result of longitudinal attrition. Eighty-four girls and 83 boys were studied. Birth weight varied in the range 0.9\u20134.5 kg (median = 3.0 kg, IQR = 0.8 kg). These data were missing in 15 children. There were no statistically significant differences in birth weight between the CAUG and FCG (median of CAUG = 2.8 kg, median of FCG = 2.6 kg, P = 0.14) but both groups had statistically lower birth weights than the NIG (median of NIG = 3.3 kg, P < 0.001). Head circumference was measured at all four time points. These data were missing for 17 children at baseline, 16 at 30 mo, 25 at 42 mo, and 32 at 96 mo. Median circumference at baseline was 46.8 cm, IQR = 2.5 cm; 48.0 cm at 30 mo, IQR = 2.0 cm; 48.6 cm at 42 mo, IQR = 1.6 cm; and 51.0 cm at 96 mo, IQR = 2 cm. There were no significant differences in head circumference between the CAUG and FCG at any age ( P = 0.18 at baseline, P = 0.07 at 30 mo, P = 0.09 at 42 mo, P = 0.38 at 96 mo). In the FCG, age at foster care placement was in the range 6.8\u201333 mo, median = 24.8 mo, IQR = 10.1 mo. Time spent at institutions at baseline, 42 and 96 mo is summarized in Table A1 . EEG Data Characteristics and Preprocessing EEGs were collected at study entry (baseline) as well as at 30\u201333, 42, and 96 mo, using an Electro-Cap (Electro-Cap International) system (12 scalp electrodes: F3, F4, Fz, C3, C4, P3, P4, Pz, T7, T8, O1, O2). The characteristics of these data are described in detail in ( Marshall et al. 2008 ; Stamoulis et al. 2015a; Vanderwert et al. 2010 ). At baseline, 30\u201333 mo, and 42 mo assessments, task-independent EEG signals were recorded while lights were turned off for ~1\u20133 min. At 96 mo, task-independent EEG signals were recorded during 1-min intervals of eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO). Only signals recorded under the EC condition were included in the analysis. Data were sampled at 512 samples/s and band-pass filtered during acquisition in the range 0.1- 100 Hz. Prior to analysis all signals were referenced to an average reference. Previous work has shown that in the absence of appropriate source modeling, which is difficult with a small number of electrodes, an average reference results in substantially lower connectivity errors than a mastoid or Cz reference ( Chella et al. 2016 ). However, similar to all referencing approaches, an average reference has shortcomings, too, particularly for localizing specific EEG waveforms such as event-related potentials. Here, the issue of localization is of less concern. Also, several studies have shown that for connectivity analyses, even with a low number of EEG electrodes average referencing is preferable to the use of a common reference ( Dien 1998 ). A stopband filterbank of third order elliptical filters with a 1-Hz bandwidth, 0.5 dB ripple in the passband, and 20 dB in the stopband was used to suppress the power line noise at 50 Hz and its 100-Hz harmonic. Artifacts associated with eye blinking were locally suppressed using a matched-filtering approach, where signal templates for eye blinks were used to detect intervals containing these artifacts ( Stamoulis and Chang 2009 ). Individual EEG signals were further denoised via signal decomposition and elimination of random components identified based on their autocorrelation function (Stamoulis et al. 2015b). Finally, signals containing extreme amplitude outliers, i.e., above a threshold equal to the median plus three times the interquartile difference ( Tukey 1977 ) were also eliminated. These outliers are likely to be associated with broadband muscle and/or other nonneural activity. Consequently, 1-s intervals containing outliers were excluded from the signal decomposition and mutual information estimations. Signal Analysis Estimation of narrowband EEG signal components (individual oscillations). Neural oscillations in the developing brain may have characteristic frequencies that do not fall within the limits of traditional biological bands (delta to ripple), established based on adult brain signals. Thus frequency domain analysis of band-pass-filtered signals in these bands may not be appropriate. Instead, a fully unsupervised, time-domain approach based on the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition method (EEMD; Wu and Huang 2009 ) was used to estimate neural oscillations and their dominant frequencies. The EEMD is a modification of the classical Empirical Mode Decomposition method ( Huang et al. 1998 ) and accounts of the problem of mode (component) mixing. The estimation process has been described in detail in previous work (Stamoulis et al. 2015a). Task-independent network connectivity was estimated for individual oscillations of the EEG to construct frequency-specific networks. Briefly, each EEG signal was decomposed into a small set of narrowband components that significantly contributed to the broadband signal amplitude. The cost function proposed by Stamoulis and Betensky (2011 ) was also used to select nonrandom components and eliminate noise-related signal contributions with substantial amplitude. A sliding 1-s window was used in all estimations. In exploratory analyses of the data, the window length was varied between 1 and 4 s, yielding similar estimates in oscillation amplitude, frequency, and connectivity. Glossary of terms. The following network parameters were estimated for each identified oscillation in the EEG: 1 ) spatially averaged connectivity (over the entire brain and over individual networks identified in models to be statistically distinct between groups), 2 ) nondirectional edge-specific connectivity for each edge connecting pair of network nodes, and 3 ) node centrality, a measure of the importance of each node in the network. Each electrode was treated as a network node. Spatially averaged and edge-specific connectivities were quantified using mutual information, an information theoretic measure (see Estimation of oscillation-specific connectivity section). Two types of connectivity matrices were estimated for each child at each time point and each oscillation: a weighted connectivity matrix containing the actual mutual information values and thus the actual connection strengths between pairs of nodes and the adjacency matrix, a binary matrix of edge connection/nonconnection obtained by appropriately thresholding the weighted connectivity matrix. Based on connectivity thresholds two sets of networks were identified, hyper- and hypoconnected networks (see Connectivity threshold estimation and Adjacency matrix estimation for relative hyper- and hypoconnectivity sections). Node centrality was quantified using node strength, a measure of the sum of its connections based the adjacency matrix (see Estimation of node centrality section). Estimation of oscillation-specific connectivity. In the case of a large number of electrodes, connectivity analysis may be best conducted at the source level, to appropriately address issues of volume conduction that may impact various connectivity measures. The adequacy and accuracy of source connectivity analysis in the case of 12 electrodes are questionable, independently of the source separation or localization methods used. Information-based connectivity measures have been shown to be relatively robust to volume conduction ( Vicente et al. 2011 ) and were used in this electrode-level analysis. Mutual information was used to quantify undirected pairwise network connectivity. Together with other information theoretic measures, it has been previously used in a number of studies to quantify correlation between electrophysiological signals and may be more robust to the inherent noise of these signals than other measures such as coherence ( Palus et al. 2001 ; Schreiber 2000 ; Stamoulis et al. 2013 ; Vejmelka and Palus 2008 ). Mutual information I ( X , Y ) = \u2211 x , y p ( x , y )log \u2265 0, between random variables X and Y , measures their mutual dependence ( Cover and Thomas 2006 ). It is a function of their joint and marginal probability density functions p ( x , y ), p ( x ), and p ( y ), which were estimated using a kernel-based method (assuming a Gaussian kernel) following segmentation of EEG signals in 1-s windows. Across ages and participants, a kernel bandwidth of 0.8 was used in the estimation and the probability density functions were evaluated at 200 points. Connectivity threshold estimation. Edge-specific mutual information thresholds were estimated as follows: for each oscillation and network edge, the median (across subjects) mutual information for the NIG (and thus each age-matched oscillation and edges in the control group) was calculated as well as corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), using bootstrapping with replacement [2,000 draws and an accelerated, bias-corrected percentile method ( Efron and Tibshirani 1993 )]. The edge-specific upper CI for the NIG median mutual information was selected as an edge's threshold for edge hyperconnectivity, and the corresponding lower CI was selected as the threshold for edge hypoconnectivity. Adjacency matrix estimation for relative hyper- and hypoconnectivity. Based on the above thresholds, two sets of adjacency matrices, with elements ( i , j ) for edges connecting nodes i and j , for each oscillation-specific undirected graph, were estimated for the CAUG and FCG: 1 ) the hyperconnectivity adjacency matrices, with elements that were equal to 1 for edges that exceeded the upper CI for median connectivity of the NIG and zeros elsewhere, and 2 ) the hypoconnectivity adjacency matrices, with elements that were equal to 1 for edges that were below the lower CI for median connectivity of the NIG and 0 elsewhere. Estimation of node centrality. The maximum number of possible connections of each node in the estimated networks is 12 (a self-connection and 11 connections to all other nodes). There are several ways to define node centrality, i.e., the importance of a node in a network. Here it is defined in two ways: 1 ) in terms of node strength, i.e., the ratio of the sum of all edge weights for a node over the maximum possible sum of weights, so for node ; and 2 ) in terms of node connectedness, i.e., the ratio of the sum of all binary edge values for a node over the maximum possible sum of weights, i.e., . Based on these topological measures it is possible to identify potential hubs, i.e., highly connected nodes that are critical for information processing through the network. Note that the adjacency matrices for the CAUG and FCG were estimated as described above. The adjacency matrices for subjects in the NIG were estimated assuming the median (across subjects and electrodes) mutual information as the corresponding connectivity threshold. Statistical Analysis Differences in network characteristics at individual ages were assessed using ordinary linear regression models, with edge connectivity or node centrality as the dependent variable, and group (using criterion coding to avoid including several group variables given the relatively small sample), time spent in institutions, birth weight, head circumference, age at foster care placement, and sex (categorized as female = 0, male = 1) as independent variables. In individual models (ordinary or mixed effects models used to assess age-related parameter changes), each edge or node parameter was assessed independently of each others, although part of a network and thus effectively correlated. Corrections for multiple comparisons were not necessary, particularly in mixed effects models ( Gelman et al. 2012 ). Combinations of independent variables were included in separate models. Logistic regression models with group as the dependent variable (assuming the NIG as the reference category) and network measures as independent variables were also developed. Finally, in cases where network parameters were found to be statistically distinct among the three groups, their relationship was also investigated through logistic regression models that included only the CAUG ( = 0) and FCG ( = 1), i.e., the groups in the two arms of the randomized trial. All modeling approaches yielded consistent results. Note that at baseline (before the randomization) there were only two groups: institutionalized and never-institutionalized. Linear mixed-effects models were developed to investigate temporal trajectories of network characteristics. For all children randomized to the intervention arm, foster care placement occurred before 42 mo of age. Therefore, to assess intervention-related effects we focused on changes in network parameters between 42 and 96 mo. Thus the models included a subject-specific intercept and a subject-specific age slope, to account for potential subject-specific variabilities. Independent variables included sex, birth weight, head circumference, group, age at foster care placement, and percent time spent at institutions. Given the sample size, only relatively small models were developed with combinations of 1\u20133 independent variables. All analyses were done using the software MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, MA). RESULTS We investigated oscillation-specific network properties at all four age assessments and their developmental changes from 42 to 96 mo. We first examined spatially averaged (global) connectivity followed by edge-specific connectivity and node centrality. We conducted two complementary analyses: 1 ) Using connectivity thresholds derived from the NIG, we compared the FCG and the CAUG relative to NIG. We thus present results on abnormal networks in the FCG and CAUG that were found to be hyperconnected or hypoconnected relative to the NIG; and 2 ) we compared all three groups to each other via statistical models that included adjustments for birth weight or head circumference. We report network measures only for subnetworks that were found to be statistically distinct in the three groups. As previously noted, regression models were also developed to compare only the CAUG and FCG, separately from the NIG. Statistically significant group differences in network parameters identified in these models were consistent with those identified using models that included the NIG. Brainwide (Spatially Averaged) Connectivity First, median (over electrodes) mutual information that had been averaged in time was compared between groups for each estimated oscillation at each assessment age, to assess potential differences in brain/hemisphere-wide connectivity. Corresponding frequency-connectivity relationships at these ages (unadjusted for confounders or other covariates) are shown in Fig. 1 . Interquartile ranges (vertical bars for mutual information and horizontal bars for frequency) are shown. In these unadjusted connectivity data, no significant differences were found between groups except for the gamma oscillation at 96 mo ( P = 0.012), and the alpha and theta oscillations at baseline (study entry) ( P = 0.002 and P = 0.016 for alpha and theta connectivity, respectively). When adjusted for birth weight or head circumference, significant differences in whole brain and hemisphere-specific connectivity were estimated between institutionalized and never-institutionalized children in the theta band at baseline ( P = 0.006 for the entire brain, P = 0.002 for the left hemisphere and P = 0.034 for the right hemisphere). When adjusted for age at foster care placement, significant group differences in left-hemisphere theta connectivity were estimated at 96 mo ( P = 0.035). When adjusted for head circumference, significant group differences in beta connectivity were also estimated in the left hemisphere at 96 mo ( P = 0.044).

In the present study, the temporal alteration of the jaw-opening reflex excitability was investigated to determine if orthodontic treatment affects orofacial motor function. The excitability of jaw-opening reflex evoked by electrical stimulation on the gingiva and recorded bilaterally in the anterior digastric muscles was evaluated at 1 (D1), 3 (D3), and 7 days (D7) after orthodontic force application to the teeth of right side; morphological features (e.g., osteoclast genesis and tooth movement) were also evaluated. To clarify the underlying mechanism of orthodontic treatment-induced alteration of orofacial motor excitability, analgesics were administrated for 1 day. At D1 and D3, orthodontic treatment significantly decreased the threshold for inducing the jaw-opening reflex but significantly increased the threshold at D7. Other parameters of the jaw-opening reflex were also evaluated (e.g., latency, duration and area under the curve of anterior digastric muscles activity), and only the latency of the D1 group was significantly different from that of the other groups. Temporal alteration of the jaw-opening reflex excitability was significantly correlated with changes in morphological features. Aspirin (300 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 ) significantly increased the threshold for inducing the jaw-opening reflex, whereas a lower dose (75\u2013150 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 ) of aspirin or acetaminophen (300 mg\u00b7kg \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 ) failed to alter the jaw-opening reflex excitability. These results suggest that an increase of the jaw-opening reflex excitability can be induced acutely by orthodontic treatment, possibly through the cyclooxygenase activation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY It is well known that motor function is affected by pain, but the effect of orthodontic treatment-related pain on the trigeminal motor excitability has not been fully understood. We found that, during orthodontic treatment, trigeminal motor excitability is acutely increased and then decreased in a week.

Proper, context-dependent coupling among the neural networks underlying leg movement is necessary for generating intersegmental coordination. In the slow-walking stick insect, local sensory information is very important for shaping coordination. However, central coupling mechanisms among segmental central pattern generators (CPGs) may also contribute to this. Here, we analyzed the interactions between contralateral networks that drive the depressor trochanteris muscle of the legs in both isolated and interconnected deafferented thoracic ganglia of the stick insect on application of pilocarpine, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. Our results show that depressor CPG activity is only weakly coupled between all segments. Intrasegmental phase relationships differ between the three isolated ganglia, and they are modified and stabilized when ganglia are interconnected. However, the coordination patterns that emerge do not resemble those observed during walking. Our findings are in line with recent studies and highlight the influence of sensory input on coordination in slowly walking insects. Finally, as a direct interaction between depressor CPG networks and contralateral motoneurons could not be observed, we hypothesize that coupling is based on interactions at the level of CPG interneurons.

The relative importance of central mechanisms vs. sensory feedback in this process is not well understood.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether the time interval required to discriminate between two stimuli varies according to the number of stimuli in the task. We used the third-stimulus temporal discrimination threshold (ThirdDT), defined as the shortest time interval at which an individual distinguishes a third stimulus following a pair of stimuli delivered at the STDT. The STDT and ThirdDT were assessed in 31 healthy subjects. In a subgroup of 10 subjects, we evaluated the effects of the stimuli intensity on the ThirdDT. In a subgroup of 16 subjects, we evaluated the effects of S1 continuous theta-burst stimulation (S1-cTBS) on the STDT and ThirdDT. Results show that ThirdDT is shorter than STDT. We found a positive correlation between STDT and ThirdDT values. As long as the stimulus intensity was within the perceivable and painless range, it did not affect ThirdDT values. S1-cTBS significantly affected both STDT and ThirdDT, although the latter was affected to a greater extent and for a longer period of time. We conclude that the interval needed to discriminate between time-separated tactile stimuli is related to the number of stimuli used in the task. STDT and ThirdDT are encoded in S1, probably by a shared tactile temporal encoding mechanism whose performance rapidly changes during the perception process.

In addition, the chance of developing insulin resistance and diabetes is increased in obesity. No study has examined the impact of obesity or diabetes on the biophysical properties of MN. Lean Zucker rats and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats were separated into lean, obese (ZDF fed standard chow), and diabetic (ZDF fed high-fat diet that led to diabetes) groups. Glass micropipettes recorded hindlimb MN properties from identified flexor and extensor MN. MN were separated within their groups on the basis of input conductance, which created high- and low-input conductance subpopulations for each. A significant shorter (20%) afterhyperpolarization half-decay (AHP 1/2 ) was found in low-conductance MN for the diabetic group only, whereas AHP\u00bd tended to be shorter in the obese group (19%).

Precise reaching to visual targets depends on our ability to localize and foveate the target. Despite this, how the saccade system contributes to improvements in reach accuracy remains poorly understood. To assess spatial contributions of eye movements to reach accuracy, we performed a series of behavioral psychophysics experiments in nonhuman primates ( Macaca mulatta ). We found that a coordinated saccade with a reach to a remembered target location increases reach accuracy without target foveation. The improvement in reach accuracy was similar to that obtained when the subject had visual information about the location of the current target in the visual periphery and executed the reach while maintaining central fixation. Moreover, we found that the increase in reach accuracy elicited by a coordinated movement involved a spatial coupling mechanism between the saccade and reach movements. We observed significant correlations between the saccade and reach errors for coordinated movements. In contrast, when the eye and arm movements were made to targets in different spatial locations, the magnitude of the error and the degree of correlation between the saccade and reach direction were determined by the spatial location of the eye and the hand targets. Hence, we propose that coordinated movements improve reach accuracy without target foveation due to spatial coupling between the reach and saccade systems. Spatial coupling could arise from a neural mechanism for coordinated visual behavior that involves interacting spatial representations. NEW & NOTEWORTHY How visual spatial representations guiding reach movements involve coordinated saccadic eye movements is unknown. Temporal coupling between the reach and saccade system during coordinated movements improves reach performance. However, the role of spatial coupling is unclear. Using behavioral psychophysics, we found that spatial coupling increases reach accuracy in addition to temporal coupling and visual acuity. These results suggest that a spatial mechanism to couple the reach and saccade systems increases the accuracy of coordinated movements. reach", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T19:34:40.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "61da091734630a0f5430c709782b91af4e5d2aa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21T_XeTaoON4HM9qnveI0_Vlipi3l0P.q1k-", "site_full": "advan.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://highwire.stanford.edu/rss/journalsbydate.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HighWire-hosted journals, sorted by date of last publication", "title": "Advances in Physiology Education", "title_full": "Advances in Physiology Education", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "61da091734630a0f5430c709782b91af4e5d2aa1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21T_XeTaoON4HM9qnveI0_Vlipi3l0P.q1k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Advances in Physiology Education", "text": "Nominate a colleague for the 2018 Arthur C.

The phrenic motor system controlling diaphragm contraction receives and processes descending commands to produce orderly, synchronous, and cycle-to-cycle-reproducible spatiotemporal firing. Multiple investigators have studied PhMNs in an attempt to shed light on local mechanisms underlying phrenic pattern formation. We recorded PhMNs in unanesthetized, decerebrate rats and related their activity to simultaneous phrenic nerve (PhN) activity by creating a time-frequency representation of PhMN-PhN power and coherence. Based on their temporal firing patterns and relationship to PhN activity, we categorized PhMNs into three classes, each of which emerges as a result of intrinsic biophysical and network properties and organizes the orderly contraction of diaphragm motor fibers. For example, early inspiratory diaphragmatic activation by the early coherent burst generated by high-frequency PhMNs may be necessary in order to prime it to overcome its initial inertia. We have also demonstrated the existence of a prominent role for local intraspinal inhibitory mechanisms in shaping phrenic pattern formation. The objective of this review is to relate and synthesize recent findings with those of previous studies with the aim of demonstrating that the phrenic nucleus is a region of active local processing, rather than a passive relay of descending inputs. breathing", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:37:01.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5c7bc42ef65fb7485fcec08b022a84c2fe7b606d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZdaNHtfonzdSDNx0r0gjEfyqMI5pC7Tn1A--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Saccades and reaches curve away from the other effector's target in simultaneous eye and hand movements.", "title_full": "Saccades and reaches curve away from the other effector's target in simultaneous eye and hand movements.", "published": "2017-10-11T22:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5c7bc42ef65fb7485fcec08b022a84c2fe7b606d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZdaNHtfonzdSDNx0r0gjEfyqMI5pC7Tn1A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nissens, T., Fiehler, K.", "published": "2017-10-11T22:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saccades and reaches curve away from the other effector's target in simultaneous eye and hand movements.", "text": "PDF Abstract Simultaneous eye and hand movements are highly coordinated and tightly coupled. This raises the question whether the selection of eye and hand targets relies on a shared attentional mechanism or separate attentional systems. Previous studies have revealed conflicting results by reporting evidence for both a shared as well as separate systems. Movement properties such as movement curvature can provide novel insights into this question as they provide a sensitive measure for attentional allocation during target selection. In the current study, participants performed simultaneous eye and hand movements to the same or different visual target locations. We show that both saccade and reaching movements curve away from the other effector's target location when they are simultaneously performed to spatially distinct locations.

In natural circumstances, active gaze shifts often accompany hand movements when exploring targets of interest, but how eye and hand movements are coordinated during manual interception and their dependence on visual prediction remain unclear. Here, we trained gaze-unrestrained monkeys to manually intercept targets appearing at random locations and circularly moving with random speeds. We found that well-trained animals were able to intercept the targets with adequate compensation for both sensory transmission and motor delays. Before interception, the animals' gaze followed the targets with adequate compensation for the sensory delay, but not for extra target displacement during the eye movements. Both hand and eye movements were modulated by target kinematics, and their reaction times were correlated. Moreover, retinal errors and reaching errors were correlated across different stages of reach execution. Our results reveal eye-hand coordination during manual interception, yet the eye and hand movements may show different levels of prediction based on the task context.

Regulation by NE has been demonstrated extensively in mammalian sensory cortices, but whether NE-dependent modulation in sensory cortex alters response properties in downstream sensorimotor regions is less clear. Here, we examine this question in male zebra finches, a songbird species with complex vocalizations and a well-defined neural network for auditory processing of those vocalizations. We test the hypothesis that NE modulates auditory processing and encoding using paired extracellular electrophysiology recordings and pattern classifier analyses. We report that a NE infusion into the auditory cortical region NCM (caudomedial nidopallium; analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortex) enhances the auditory responses, burst firing, and coding properties of single NCM neurons. Furthermore, we report that NE-dependent changes in NCM coding properties, but not auditory response strength, are transmitted downstream to the sensorimotor nucleus HVC. Lastly, NE modulation in the NCM of males is qualitatively similar to that observed in females: in both sexes, NE increases auditory response-strengths. However, we observed a sex difference in the mechanism of enhancement: whereas NE increases response strength in females by decreasing baseline firing rates, NE increases response strength in males by increasing auditory-evoked activity. Therefore, NE signaling exhibits a compensatory sex difference to achieve a similar, state-dependent enhancement in signal-to-noise ratio and coding accuracy in males and females. In summary, our results provide further evidence for adrenergic regulation of sensory processing and modulation of auditory/sensorimotor functional connectivity. noradrenaline", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ncm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:37:06.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "cf3c9c10f12cc619c1cc1c93d0dfef7555a5724a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZdaNHtfonzdSN.kLd2jtFeAhhign_ALUCg--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "In vivo beta and gamma subthreshold oscillations in rat mitral cells: origin and gating by respiratory dynamics", "title_full": "In vivo beta and gamma subthreshold oscillations in rat mitral cells: origin and gating by respiratory dynamics", "published": "2017-10-11T22:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "cf3c9c10f12cc619c1cc1c93d0dfef7555a5724a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZdaNHtfonzdSN.kLd2jtFeAhhign_ALUCg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Fourcaud-Trocme, N., Briffaud, V., Thevenet, M., Buonviso, N., Amat, C.", "published": "2017-10-11T22:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "In vivo beta and gamma subthreshold oscillations in rat mitral cells: origin and gating by respiratory dynamics", "text": "PDF Abstract In mammals, olfactory bulb (OB) dynamics are paced by slow and fast oscillatory rhythms at multiple levels: local field potential, spike discharge, and/or membrane potential oscillations. Interactions between these levels have been well studied for the slow rhythm linked to animal respiration. However, less is known regarding rhythms in the fast beta (10-35Hz) and gamma (35-100Hz) frequency ranges, particularly at the membrane potential level. Using a combination of intracellular and extracellular recordings in the OB of freely breathing rats, we show that beta and gamma subthreshold oscillations (STO) coexist intracellularly and are related to extracellular LFP oscillations in the same frequency range. However, they are differentially affected by changes in cell excitability and by odor stimulation. This leads us to suggest that beta and gamma STOs may rely on distinct mechanisms: gamma STOs would mainly depend on mitral cell intrinsic resonance while beta STOs could be mainly driven by synaptic activity. In a second part, we found that STO occurrence and timing are constrained by the influence of the slow respiratory rhythm on mitral/tufted cells. First, respiratory-driven excitation seems to favor gamma STOs while respiratory-driven inhibition favors beta STOs. Second, the respiratory rhythm is needed at the subthreshold level in order to lock gamma and beta STOs in similar phases as their LFP counterparts and to favor the correlation between STO frequency and spike discharge. Overall, this study helps to understand how the interaction between slow and fast rhythms at all levels of OB dynamics shapes its functional output. mammalian olfactory bulb", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ob", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lfp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sto", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-13T18:37:07.020+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a917adca05e4c9e3161abc29c41258b3073230d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TIsm2ps15KZMbHGmun7VNa3E6bywm2ZL8-", "site_full": "ajpgi.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://highwire.stanford.edu/rss/journalsbydate.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "HighWire-hosted journals, sorted by date of last publication", "title": "American Journal of Physiology - Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology", "title_full": "American Journal of Physiology - Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology", "published": "2017-10-12T10:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a917adca05e4c9e3161abc29c41258b3073230d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TIsm2ps15KZMbHGmun7VNa3E6bywm2ZL8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T10:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "American Journal of Physiology - Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology", "text": "10.1152/ajpgi.00041.2017 About AJP-GI \nThe American Journal of Physiology-Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology publishes papers on digestion, secretion, absorption, metabolism, motility, microbiology and colonization, growth and development, and neurobiology relevant to these organs as well as those dealing with neural, endocrine, and circulatory control mechanisms.

We previously demonstrated that 1% isoflurane markedly reduces the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) in adult mice in vivo and masks serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] neuron chemosensitivity in vitro. Here we investigated effects of 0.5% isoflurane on breathing in adult mice and also found a large reduction in the HCVR even at this subanesthetic concentration. We then tested the effects on breathing of ketamine-xylazine and urethane, anesthetics widely used in research on breathing. We found that these agents altered baseline breathing and blunted the HCVR at doses within the range typically used experimentally. At lower doses ventilation was decreased, but mice appropriately matched their ventilation to metabolic demands due to a parallel decrease in O 2 consumption. Neither ketamine nor urethane decreased chemosensitivity of 5-HT neurons. These results indicate that baseline breathing and/or CO 2 chemoreception in mice are decreased by anesthetics widely viewed as not affecting respiratory control, and even at subtherapeutic doses. These effects of anesthetics on breathing may alter the interpretation of studies of respiratory physiology in vivo. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Anesthetics are frequently used in animal research, but their effects on physiological functions in mice have not been well defined. Here we investigated the effects of commonly used anesthetics on breathing in mice. We found that all tested anesthetics significantly reduced the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR), even at subtherapeutic doses. In addition, ketamine-xylazine and urethane anesthesia altered baseline breathing.

The RFs of TE neurons are known to be large, but it is largely unknown how large RFs are shaped along the ventral visual pathway. In this study, we addressed this question in two aspects, static and dynamic mechanisms, by recording neural responses from macaque area TE and V4 to object stimuli presented at various locations in the visual field. As a component related to static mechanisms, we found that in area TE, but not in V4, response latency to objects presented at fovea were different from objects in periphery. As a component of the dynamic mechanisms, we examined effects of spatial attention on the RFs of TE neurons. Spatial attention did not affect response latency but modulated response magnitudes depending on attended location, shifting of the longitudinal axis of RFs toward the attended locations. In standard models of large RF formation, downstream neurons pool information from nearby RFs, and this process is repeated across the visual field and at each step along the ventral visual pathway. The present study revealed that this mechanism is not that simple: 1 ) different circuit mechanisms for foveal and peripheral visual fields may be situated between V4 and area TE, and 2 ) spatial attention dynamically changes the shape of RFs. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Receptive fields (RFs) of neurons are progressively increased along the ventral visual pathway so that an RF at the final stage, area TE, covers a large area of the visual field. We explored the mechanism and suggested involvement of parallel circuit mechanisms between V4 and TE for foveal and peripheral parts of visual field. We also found a dynamic component of RF shape formation through attentional modulation of responses in a location-dependent manner. inferior temporal cortex", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T07:03:59.041+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8ba42d6c8350a1f4b797875cadc13b42c72bc9ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtzv.frM5ajdYoXxaO6Sv.Mv", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/current.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology current issue", "title": "High-frequency epidural stimulation across the respiratory cycle evokes phrenic short-term potentiation after incomplete cervical spinal cord injury", "title_full": "High-frequency epidural stimulation across the respiratory cycle evokes phrenic short-term potentiation after incomplete cervical spinal cord injury", "published": "2017-10-17T19:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8ba42d6c8350a1f4b797875cadc13b42c72bc9ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtzv.frM5ajdYoXxaO6Sv.Mv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gonzalez-Rothi, E.

We tested the hypothesis that high-frequency epidural stimulation (HF-ES) would potentiate ipsilateral phrenic output after subacute and chronic C2Hx. HF-ES (300 Hz) was applied to the ventrolateral C4 or T2 spinal cord ipsilateral to C2Hx in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated adult rats. Stimulus duration was 60 s, and currents ranged from 100 to 1,000 \u00b5A. Bilateral phrenic nerve activity and ipsilateral hypoglossal (XII) nerve activity were recorded before and after HF-ES. Higher T2 stimulus currents potentiated ipsilateral phasic inspiratory activity at both 2 and 12 wk post-C2Hx, whereas higher stimulus currents delivered at C4 potentiated ipsilateral phasic phrenic activity only at 12 wk ( P = 0.028). Meanwhile, tonic output in the ipsilateral phrenic nerve reached 500% of baseline values at the high currents with no difference between 2 and 12 wk. HF-ES did not trigger inspiratory burst-frequency changes. Similar responses occurred following T2 HF-ES. Increases in contralateral phrenic and XII nerve output were induced by C4 and T2 HF-ES at higher currents, but the relative magnitude of these changes was small compared with the ipsilateral phrenic response. We conclude that following incomplete cervical spinal cord injury, HF-ES of the ventrolateral midcervical or thoracic spinal cord can potentiate efferent phrenic motor output with little impact on inspiratory burst frequency. However, the substantial increases in tonic output indicate that the uninterrupted 60-s stimulation paradigm used is unlikely to be useful for respiratory muscle activation after spinal injury. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous studies reported that high-frequency epidural stimulation (HF-ES) activates the diaphragm following acute spinal transection. This study examined HF-ES and phrenic motor output following subacute and chronic incomplete cervical spinal cord injury. Short-term potentiation of phrenic bursting following HF-ES illustrates the potential for spinal stimulation to induce respiratory neuroplasticity. Increased tonic phrenic output indicates that alternatives to the continuous stimulation paradigm used in this study will be required for respiratory muscle activation after spinal cord injury. spinal cord injury", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T07:03:59.048+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c231b79713c2ec1035bb391e5e645f5152d680e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtzv.frM5ajdYsYDfe0FgtlP", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/current.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology current issue", "title": "Altered modulation of sensorimotor rhythms with chronic paralysis", "title_full": "Altered modulation of sensorimotor rhythms with chronic paralysis", "published": "2017-10-17T19:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c231b79713c2ec1035bb391e5e645f5152d680e1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtzv.frM5ajdYsYDfe0FgtlP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Foldes, S.

However, it is unclear how chronic paralysis specifically impacts cortical oscillations associated with attempted movement of impaired limbs. We hypothesized that \u03bc- (8\u201313 Hz) and \u03b2- (15\u201330 Hz) event-related desynchronization (ERD) would be less modulated for individuals with hand paralysis due to cervical spinal cord injury (SCI). To test this, we compared the modulation of ERD from magnetoencephalography (MEG) during attempted and imagined grasping performed by participants with cervical SCI ( n = 12) and able-bodied controls ( n = 13). Seven participants with tetraplegia were able to generate some electromyography (EMG) activity during attempted grasping, whereas the other five were not. The peak and area of ERD were significantly decreased for individuals without volitional muscle activity when they attempted to grasp compared with able-bodied subjects and participants with SCI,with some residual EMG activity. However, no significant differences were found between subject groups during mentally simulated tasks (i.e., motor imagery) where no muscle activity or somatosensory consequences were expected. These findings suggest that individuals who are unable to produce muscle activity are capable of generating ERD when attempting to move, but the characteristics of this ERD are altered. However, for people who maintain volitional muscle activity after SCI, there are no significant differences in ERD characteristics compared with able-bodied controls. These results provide evidence that ERD is dependent on the level of intact muscle activity after SCI. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Source space MEG was used to investigate sensorimotor cortical oscillations in individuals with SCI. This study provides evidence that individuals with cervical SCI exhibit decreased ERD when they attempt to grasp if they are incapable of generating muscle activity. However, there were no significant differences in ERD between paralyzed and able-bodied participants during motor imagery.

However, this information is ambiguous: because the otoliths sense the gravitoinertial force, they cannot distinguish gravitational and inertial components. As a consequence, prolonged linear acceleration of the head can be interpreted as tilt, referred to as the somatogravic effect. Previous modeling work suggests that the brain disambiguates the otolith signal according to the rules of Bayesian inference, combining noisy canal cues with the a priori assumption that prolonged linear accelerations are unlikely. Within this modeling framework the noise of the vestibular signals affects the dynamic characteristics of the tilt percept during linear whole-body motion. To test this prediction, we devised a novel paradigm to psychometrically characterize the dynamic visual vertical\u2014as a proxy for the tilt percept\u2014during passive sinusoidal linear motion along the interaural axis (0.33 Hz motion frequency, 1.75 m/s 2 peak acceleration, 80 cm displacement). While subjects ( n =10) kept fixation on a central body-fixed light, a line was briefly flashed (5 ms) at different phases of the motion, the orientation of which had to be judged relative to gravity. Consistent with the model\u2019s prediction, subjects showed a phase-dependent modulation of the dynamic visual vertical, with a subject-specific phase shift with respect to the imposed acceleration signal. The magnitude of this modulation was smaller than predicted, suggesting a contribution of nonvestibular signals to the dynamic visual vertical. Despite their dampening effect, our findings may point to a link between the noise components in the vestibular system and the characteristics of dynamic visual vertical. NEW & NOTEWORTHY A fundamental question in neuroscience is how the brain processes vestibular signals to infer the orientation of the body and objects in space.

Here, we explore perceptual constancy in the sense of touch. Specifically, we investigate the invariance of tactile texture perception across changes in scanning speed. Texture signals in the nerve have been shown to be highly dependent on speed: temporal spiking patterns in nerve fibers that encode fine textural features contract or dilate systematically with increases or decreases in scanning speed, respectively, resulting in concomitant changes in response rate. Nevertheless, texture perception has been shown, albeit with restricted stimulus sets and limited perceptual assays, to be independent of scanning speed. Indeed, previous studies investigated the effect of scanning speed on perceived roughness, only one aspect of texture, often with impoverished stimuli, namely gratings and embossed dot patterns. To fill this gap, we probe the perceptual constancy of a wide range of textures using two different paradigms: one that probes texture perception along well-established sensory dimensions independently and one that probes texture perception as a whole. We find that texture perception is highly stable across scanning speeds, irrespective of the texture or the perceptual assay. Any speed-related effects are dwarfed by differences in percepts evoked by different textures. This remarkable speed invariance of texture perception stands in stark contrast to the strong dependence of the texture responses of nerve fibers on scanning speed. Our results imply neural mechanisms that compensate for scanning speed to achieve stable representations of surface texture. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our brain forms stable representations of objects regardless of viewpoint, a phenomenon known as invariance that has been described in several sensory modalities.

The flexibility of this alignment between motor signals and feedback has been demonstrated for movement recalibration to visual manipulations, but the alignment dependence for adapting movement dynamics is largely unknown. Here we examined the effect of visual feedback manipulations on force-field adaptation. Three subject groups used a manipulandum while experiencing a lag in the corresponding cursor motion (0, 75, or 150 ms). When the offset was applied at the start of the session (continuous condition), adaptation was not significantly different between groups. However, these similarities may be due to acclimation to the offset before motor adaptation. We tested additional subjects who experienced the same delays concurrent with the introduction of the perturbation (abrupt condition). In this case adaptation was statistically indistinguishable from the continuous condition, indicating that acclimation to feedback delay was not a factor. In addition, end-point errors were not significantly different across the delay or onset conditions, but end-point correction (e.g., deceleration duration) was influenced by the temporal offset. As an additional control, we tested a group of subjects who performed without visual feedback and found comparable movement adaptation results. These results suggest that visual feedback manipulation (absence or temporal misalignment) does not affect adaptation to novel dynamics, independent of both acclimation and perceptual awareness. These findings could have implications for modeling how the motor system adjusts to errors despite concurrent delays in sensory feedback information.

Object recognition involves stimulus similarity responses in ventral visual areas and task-related responses in prefrontal cortex. We tested whether neurons in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of posterior parietal cortex could form an intermediary representation, collating information from object-specific similarity map representations to allow general decisions about whether a stimulus matches the object being looked for. We hypothesized that responses to stimuli would correlate with how similar they are to a sample stimulus. When animals compared two peripheral stimuli to a sample at their fovea, the response to the matching stimulus was similar, independent of the sample identity, but the response to the nonmatch depended on how similar it was to the sample: the more similar, the greater the response to the nonmatch stimulus. These results could not be explained by task difficulty or confidence. We propose that LIP uses its known mechanistic properties to integrate incoming visual information, including that from the ventral stream about object identity, to create a dynamic representation that is concise, low dimensional, and task relevant and that signifies the choice priorities in mental matching behavior.

Klein-Hennig et al. ( J Acoust Soc Am 129: 3856, 2011) demonstrated the envelope attack (the rate at which stimulus energy in the envelope increases) and the duration of the pause (the interval between successive envelope pulses) as important factors affecting sensitivity to envelope ITDs in human listeners. Modulated sounds with rapid attacks and long pauses produce the lowest ITD discrimination thresholds. The duration of the envelope\u2019s sustained component (sustain) and the rate at which stimulus energy falls at the offset of the envelope (decay) are only minor factors. We assessed the responses of 71 single neurons, recorded from the midbrains of 15 urethane-anesthetized tri-colored guinea pigs, to envelope shapes in which the four envelope components, i.e., attack, sustain, decay, and pause, were systematically varied. We confirmed the importance of the attack and pause components in generating ITD-sensitive responses.

These characteristics are typically studied in isolation, leaving the interaction largely unknown. Here we examined how the temporal decay of visuomotor adaptation influences the spatial generalization of the motor recalibration. First, we quantified the extent to which adaptation decayed over time. Subjects reached to a peripheral target, and a rotation was applied to the visual feedback of the unseen motion. The retention of this adaptation over different delays (0\u2013120 s) 1 ) decreased by 29.0 \u00b1 6.8% at the longest delay and 2 ) was represented by a simple exponential, with a time constant of 22.5 \u00b1 5.6 s. On the basis of this relationship we simulated how the spatial generalization of adaptation would change with delay. To test this directly, we trained additional subjects with the same perturbation and assessed transfer to 19 different locations (spaced 15\u00b0 apart, symmetric around the trained location) and examined three delays (~4, 12, and 25 s). Consistent with the simulation, we found that generalization around the trained direction (\u00b115\u00b0) significantly decreased with delay and distance, while locations >60\u00b0 displayed near-constant spatiotemporal transfer. Intermediate distances (30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0) showed a difference in transfer across space, but this amount was approximately constant across time.

The objectives of this study were to perform the clinical and genetic characterization of the proband and his family and to examine the functional consequence of the Kir4.1 mutation. The mutant and wild-type KCNJ10 constructs were generated and heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and whole cell K + currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. The KCNJ10 mutation c.652C>T resulted in a p.L218F substitution at a highly conserved residue site. Wild-type KCNJ10 expression yielded robust Kir current, whereas currents from oocytes expressing the mutation were reduced, remarkably. Western Blot analysis revealed reduced protein expression by the mutation. Kir5.1 subunits display selective heteromultimerization with Kir4.1 constituting channels with unique kinetics. The effect of the mutation on Kir4.1/5.1 channel activity was twofold: a reduction in current amplitudes and an increase in the pH-dependent inhibition. We thus report a novel loss-of-function mutation in Kir4.1 found in a patient with a coexisting mutation in SLACK channels that results in a fatal disease. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We present and characterize a novel mutation in KCNJ10 . Unlike previously reported EAST/SeSAME patients, our patient was heterozygous, and contrary to previous studies, mimicking the heterozygous state by coexpression resulted in loss of channel function. We report in the same patient co-occurrence of a KCNT1 mutation resulting in a more severe phenotype. This study provides new insights into the phenotypic spectrum and to the genotype-phenotype correlations associated with EAST/SeSAME and MMFSI.

However, whether and how such a model is also used to estimate the spatial location of interception is still an open question. Here we addressed this issue by asking 25 participants to intercept balls projected from a fixed location 6 m in front of them and approaching along trajectories with different arrival locations, flight durations, and gravity accelerations (0 g and 1 g ). The trajectories were displayed in an immersive virtual reality system with a wide field of view. Participants intercepted approaching balls with a racket, and they were free to choose the time and place of interception. We found that participants often achieved a better performance with 1 g than 0 g balls. Moreover, the interception points were distributed along the direction of a 1 g path for both 1 g and 0 g balls. In the latter case, interceptions tended to cluster on the upper half of the racket, indicating that participants aimed at a lower position than the actual 0 g path. These results suggest that an internal model of gravity was probably used in predicting the interception locations. However, we found that the difference in performance between 1 g and 0 g balls was modulated by flight duration, the difference being larger for faster balls. In addition, the number of peaks in the hand speed profiles increased with flight duration, suggesting that visual information was used to adjust the motor response, correcting the prediction to some extent. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here we show that an internal model of gravity plays a key role in predicting where to intercept a fast-moving target. Participants also assumed an accelerated motion when intercepting balls approaching in a virtual environment at constant velocity. We also show that the role of visual information in guiding interceptive movement increases when more time is available. gravity", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T07:04:01.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd87957027b98a1375da1f384c153e88dfe353e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtzv.frM5ajdYvxPSQKexaPE", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/current.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology current issue", "title": "Modulation of corticospinal input to the legs by arm and leg cycling in people with incomplete spinal cord injury", "title_full": "Modulation of corticospinal input to the legs by arm and leg cycling in people with incomplete spinal cord injury", "published": "2017-10-17T19:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bd87957027b98a1375da1f384c153e88dfe353e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtzv.frM5ajdYvxPSQKexaPE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zhou, R., Alvarado, L., Kim, S., Chong, S.

The goals of this study were to investigate the effect of active rhythmic arm movements on the corticospinal drive to the legs ( study 1 ) and assess the effect of simultaneous arm and leg training on the corticospinal pathway after incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) ( study 2). In study 1 , neurologically intact (NI) participants or participants with iSCI performed combinations of stationary and rhythmic cycling of the arms and legs while motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from the vastus lateralis (VL) muscle. In the NI group, arm cycling alone could facilitate the VL MEP amplitude, suggesting that dynamic arm movements strongly modulate the corticospinal pathway to the legs. No significant difference in VL MEP between conditions was found in participants with iSCI. In study 2 , participants with iSCI underwent 12 wk of electrical stimulation-assisted cycling training: one group performed simultaneous arm and leg (A&L) cycling and the other legs-only cycling. MEPs in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle were compared before and after training. After training, only the A&L group had a significantly larger TA MEP, suggesting increased excitability in the corticospinal pathway. The findings demonstrate the importance of arm movements in modulating the corticospinal drive to the legs and suggest that active engagement of the arms in lower limb rehabilitation may produce better neural regulation and restoration of function. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study aimed to demonstrate the importance of arm movements in modulating the corticospinal drive to the legs. It provides direct evidence in humans that active movement of the arms could facilitate corticospinal transmission to the legs and, for the first time, shows that facilitation is absent after spinal cord injury. Active engagement of the arms in lower limb rehabilitation increased the excitability of the corticospinal pathway and may produce more effective improvement in leg function. motor evoked potential", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "a&l", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T07:04:01.031+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "48f7ccd5c56317fad5464c6c0b432bee4189ce24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZdaNHtfonzdSx2X18kLI4si99nHYEZHygg--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "A dual-axis rotation rule for updating the head direction cell reference frame during movement in three dimensions", "title_full": "A dual-axis rotation rule for updating the head direction cell reference frame during movement in three dimensions", "published": "2017-10-11T22:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "48f7ccd5c56317fad5464c6c0b432bee4189ce24", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZdaNHtfonzdSx2X18kLI4si99nHYEZHygg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Page, H.

On a horizontal surface, rotations of the head around the dorso-ventral (D-V) axis, called yaw, correspond to changes in azimuth, and elicit appropriate updating of the HD 'compass' signal to enable large-scale navigation. However, if the animal moves through three-dimensional (3D) space then there is no longer a simple relationship between yaw rotations and azimuth changes, and so processing of three-dimensional rotations is needed. Construction of a global 3D compass would require complex integration of 3D rotations, and also a large neuronal population, most neurons of which would be silent most of the time since animals rarely sample all available 3D orientations. We propose that instead, the HD system treats the 3D space as a set of interrelated 2D surfaces. It could do this by updating activity according to both yaw rotations around the D-V axis and rotations of the D-V axis around the gravity-defined vertical axis. We present preliminary data to suggest that this rule operates when rats move between walls of opposing orientations. This dual-axis rule, which we show is straightforward to implement using the classic one-dimensional 'attractor' architecture, allows consistent representation of azimuth even in volumetric space, and thus may be a general feature of mammalian directional computations even for animals that swim or fly. navigation", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-18T12:17:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "959cc984af9709959d58bf11f91a5d75c83563ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3QaO10CcWMAWsncCSqSzzkLw--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Path Perturbation Detection Tasks Reduce MSTd Neuronal Self-Movement Heading Responses", "title_full": "Path Perturbation Detection Tasks Reduce MSTd Neuronal Self-Movement Heading Responses", "published": "2017-10-18T22:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "959cc984af9709959d58bf11f91a5d75c83563ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3QaO10CcWMAWsncCSqSzzkLw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Page, W.

Some of these changes coincide with hearing onset, suggesting that sound-driven neural activity produces developmental plasticity of ion channel expression. While it is known that the coding properties of excitatory neurons are modulated by inhibition in the mature system, it is unknown whether there are also developmental changes in the membrane properties of brainstem inhibitory neurons. We investigated the primary source of inhibition in the avian auditory brainstem, the superior olivary nucleus (SON). The present studies test the hypothesis that, as in excitatory neurons, the membrane properties of these inhibitory neurons change following hearing onset. We examined SON neurons at different stages of auditory development: embryonic days 14-16 (E14-16), a time at which cochlear ganglion neurons are just beginning to respond to sound, later embryonic stages (E18-19), and after hatching (P0-P2). We used in vitro whole-cell patch electrophysiology to explore physiological changes in SON. Age-related changes were observed at the level of a single spike and in multi-spiking behavior. In particular, tonic behavior, measured as a neuron's ability to sustain tonic firing over a range of current steps, became more common later in development. Voltage-clamp recordings and biophysical models were employed to examine how age-related increases in ion currents enhance excitability in SON. Our findings suggest that concurrent increases in sodium and potassium currents underlie the emergence of tonic behavior.

Evidence suggests that sensorimotor processes may synchronize visual rhythmic activity in preparation of action performance. Indeed, we recently reported periodic fluctuations of visual contrast sensitivity which are time-locked to the onset of an intended movement of the arm. However, the origin of the observed visual modulations has so far remained unclear due to the endogenous (and thus temporally undetermined) activation of the sensorimotor system that is associated with voluntary movement initiation. Here, we activated the sensorimotor circuitry involved in the hand control in an exogenous and controlled way by means of peripheral stimulation of the median nerve and characterized the spectrotemporal dynamics of the ensuing visual perception. The stimulation of the median nerve triggers robust and long-lasting (1 s) alpha-band oscillations in visual perception, whose strength is temporally modulated in a way that is consistent with the changes in alpha power described at the neurophysiological level after sensorimotor stimulation.

Microelectrode arrays were used to monitor neuronal spike trains simultaneously in the VRC, peri-nucleus tractus solitarius-medial medulla (p-NTS-MM), the dorsal parafacial region of the lateral tegmental field (FTL-pF), and medullary raph\u00e9 nuclei together with phrenic nerve activity during selective stimulation of carotid chemoreceptors or transient hypoxia in 19 decerebrate, neuromuscularly-blocked, and artificially ventilated cats. Of 994 neurons tested, 56% had a significant change in firing rate. A total of 33,422 cell pairs were evaluated for signs of functional interaction; 63% of chemoresponsive neurons were elements of at least one pair with correlational signatures indicative of paucisynaptic relationships. We detected evidence for post-inspiratory neuron inhibition of rostral VRC I-Driver (preB\u00f6tzinger) neurons, an interaction predicted to modulate breathing frequency, and for reciprocal excitation between chemoresponsive p-NTS neurons and more downstream VRC inspiratory neurons for control of breathing depth.

To determine whether similar changes occur for high threshold motoneurones, we tested whether maximal voluntary activation and force can be affected by PCMS in healthy individuals. On two separate days, healthy participants (n=14) performed brief thumb adduction MVCs before and after a control protocol (TMS only) or PCMS designed to facilitate corticospinal transmission to adductor pollicis. Peripheral nerve stimulation alone was not performed. During each MVC, a superimposed twitch was elicited by a supramaximal stimulus delivered to the ulnar nerve. With muscles relaxed following the maximal contraction, a similar stimulus elicited a resting twitch. Voluntary activation was calculated as (1- superimposed twitch/resting twitch)*100%. While voluntary activation decreased over time in both conditions, the decrease was less after PCMS (-0.4 \u00b1 4.1%) than after the control protocol (-4.9 \u00b1 4.9%, p = 0.007). This was supported by a greater increase in EMG after PCMS than control (7 \u00b1 13% vs. -3 \u00b1 10%; p = 0.043). However, maximal force was not affected. The findings indicate a modest effect of PCMS on maximal neural drive to adductor pollicis, suggesting that PCMS can affect corticospinal transmission to high threshold motoneurones. spinal", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T06:01:31.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae92e2c96277c603c3da4b234a14fbd2bdccf991", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3QcH5itmCmggwIWmBJUNuF.Q--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "The fate of non-selected activity in saccadic decisions: distinct goal-related and history-related modulation.", "title_full": "The fate of non-selected activity in saccadic decisions: distinct goal-related and history-related modulation.", "published": "2017-10-18T22:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae92e2c96277c603c3da4b234a14fbd2bdccf991", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3QcH5itmCmggwIWmBJUNuF.Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Megardon, G., Sumner, P.", "published": "2017-10-18T22:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "The fate of non-selected activity in saccadic decisions: distinct goal-related and history-related modulation.", "text": "PDF Abstract The Global Effect (GE) traditionally refers to the tendency of effectors (e.g. hand, eyes) to first land in between two nearby stimuli - forming a unimodal distribution. By measuring a shift of this distribution, recent studies used the GE to assess the presence of decision-related inputs on the motor map for eye movements. However, this method cannot distinguish whether one stimulus is inhibited or the other is facilitated and could not detect situations where both stimuli are inhibited or facilitated. Here, we detect deviations in the bimodal distribution of landing positions for remote stimuli, and find that this bimodal GE reveals the presence, location and polarity (facilitation or inhibition) of history-related and goal-related modulation of the non-selected activity (e.g. the distractor activity in correct trials, and the target activity in error trials). We tested, for different inter-stimulus distances, the effect of the rarity of double-stimulus trials, and the difference between performing a discrimination task compared to free choice. Our work shows that the effect of rarity is symmetric and decreases with inter-stimulus distances, while the effect of goal-directed discrimination is asymmetric - occurring only when the distractor is selected for the saccade - and maintained across inter-stimulus distances.

TBI has been reported to significantly increase the phosphorylation of glial gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43), which in turn propagates damages into surrounding brain tissues. However, the neuroprotective and anti-apoptosis effects of glia-derived exosomes have also been implicated in recent studies. Therefore, we detected whether TBI-induced phosphorylation of Cx43 would promote exosome release in rat brain. To generate TBI model, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to lateral fluid percussion injury. Phosphorylated Cx43 protein levels and exosome activities were quantified using western blot analysis following TBI. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was also tested in rat hippocampal slices. TBI significantly increased the phosphorylated Cx43 and exosome markers expression in rat ipsilateral hippocampus, but not cortex. Blocking the activity of Cx43 or ERK, but not JNK, significantly suppressed TBI-induced exosome release in hippocampus. Furthermore, TBI significantly inhibited the induction of LTP in hippocampal slices, which could be partially but significantly restored by pretreatment with exosomes. The results implicated that TBI-activated Cx43 could mediate a nociceptive effect by propagating the brain damages, as well as a neuroprotective effect by promoting exosome release. traumatic brain injury", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T06:01:31.039+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8e97e61fb6684fe9558fa403d91ecde2aa261de0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3Qg18anNp.VrwNTz_YefdNig--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Different Contributions of Primary Motor Cortex, Reticular Formation and Spinal Cord to Fractionated Muscle Activation", "title_full": "Different Contributions of Primary Motor Cortex, Reticular Formation and Spinal Cord to Fractionated Muscle Activation", "published": "2017-10-18T22:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8e97e61fb6684fe9558fa403d91ecde2aa261de0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3Qg18anNp.VrwNTz_YefdNig--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zaaimi, B., Dean, L.

In this study we examined differences in selective activation of primate upper limb muscles by cortical and sub-cortical regions. Five macaque monkeys were trained to perform a reach and grasp task, and electromyogram (EMG) was recorded from 10-24 muscles while weak single-pulse stimuli were delivered through microelectrodes inserted in the motor cortex (M1), reticular formation (RF) or cervical spinal cord (SC). Stimulus intensity was adjusted to a level just above threshold. Stimulus-evoked effects were assessed from averages of rectified EMG. M1, RF and SC activated 1.5\u00b10.9, 1.9\u00b10.8 and 2.5\u00b11.6 muscles per site (mean\u00b1SD); only M1 and SC differed significantly. In between recording sessions, natural muscle activity in the home cage was recorded using a miniature data logger. A novel analysis assessed how well natural activity could be reconstructed by stimulus-evoked responses. This provided two measures: normalized vector length L, reflecting how closely aligned were natural and stimulus-evoked activity, and normalized residual R, measuring the fraction of natural activity not reachable using stimulus-evoked patterns. Average values for M1, RF and SC were L=119.1\u00b19.6, 105.9\u00b16.2 and 109.3\u00b18.4 and R=50.3\u00b14.9, 56.4\u00b13.5 and 51.5\u00b14.8 respectively. RF was significantly different from M1 and SC on both measures. RF is thus able to generate an approximation to the motor output with less activation than required by M1 and SC, but M1 and SC are more precise in reaching the exact activation pattern required. Cortical, brainstem and spinal centers likely play distinct roles as they cooperate to generate voluntary movements. motor cortex", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T06:01:31.042+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a7222c3734885cd0cce49ba5c0f21e11f8b4c41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3Q5IB1RHrqB7nLjJ_DZIJkRg--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Spatio-temporal characteristics of retinal response to network-mediated photovoltaic stimulation", "title_full": "Spatio-temporal characteristics of retinal response to network-mediated photovoltaic stimulation", "published": "2017-10-18T22:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a7222c3734885cd0cce49ba5c0f21e11f8b4c41", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZVeiPcS75I3Q5IB1RHrqB7nLjJ_DZIJkRg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ho, E., Smith, R., Goetz, G.

Today, such implants deliver visual information with low-frequency stimulation, resulting in discontinuous visual percepts. We measured retinal responses to complex visual stimuli delivered at video rate via a photovoltaic subretinal implant and by visible light. Using a multielectrode array to record from retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the healthy and degenerated rat retina ex-vivo, we estimated their spatio-temporal properties from the spike-triggered average (STA) responses to photovoltaic binary white noise stimulus with 70\u03bcm pixel size at 20Hz frame rate. The average photovoltaic receptive field size was 194\u00b13\u03bcm (S.E.M.), similar to that of visual responses (221\u00b14\u03bcm), but response latency was significantly shorter with photovoltaic stimulation. Both visual and photovoltaic receptive fields had an opposing center-surround structure. In the healthy retina, ON RGCs had photovoltaic OFF responses, and vice versa. This reversal is consistent with depolarization of photoreceptors by electrical pulses, as opposed to their hyperpolarization under increasing light, although alternative mechanisms cannot be excluded. In degenerate retina, both ON and OFF photovoltaic responses were observed, but in the absence of visual responses, it is not clear what functional RGC types they correspond to. Degenerate retina maintained the antagonistic center-surround organization of receptive fields. These fast and spatially localized network-mediated ON and OFF responses to subretinal stimulation via photovoltaic pixels with local return electrodes raise confidence in the possibility of providing more functional prosthetic vision. retinal prosthesis", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-21T06:01:31.051+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "08eaa2dd04c11faea7bf871f9969696c4468480c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGTr0cF5N7RkuX8Nin5DNS4g--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Six-legged walking in insects: how CPGs, peripheral feedback, and descending signals generate coordinated and adaptive motor rhythms", "title_full": "Six-legged walking in insects: how CPGs, peripheral feedback, and descending signals generate coordinated and adaptive motor rhythms", "published": "2017-10-26T02:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "08eaa2dd04c11faea7bf871f9969696c4468480c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGTr0cF5N7RkuX8Nin5DNS4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bidaye, S.

Aspects of importance are the generation of single leg stepping, the generation of interleg coordination, and how descending signals influence walking. We first review how CPGs interact with sensory signals from the leg in the generation of leg stepping. Next, we summarize how these interactions are modified in the generation of motor flexibility for forward and backward walking, curve walking, and speed changes. We then review the present state of knowledge with regard to the role of CPGs in intersegmental coordination and how CPGs might be involved in mediating descending influences from the brain for the initiation, maintenance, modification, and cessation of the motor output for walking.

Locomotor activity becomes functionally mature in the second postnatal week and is heralded by the onset of weight-bearing locomotion on the 8th-9th postnatal day. Concomitantly there is a maturation of intrinsic properties and key conductances mediating plateau potentials. In this review, we discuss spinal neuronal excitability, descending modulation, and afferent modulation in the developing rodent spinal cord. In the adult, plastic mechanisms are much more constrained but become more permissive following neurotrauma such as spinal cord injury.

However, the mechanisms that control emergence of active exhalation, and its silencing in restful breathing, are not completely understood. We hypothesized that inputs from the K\u00f6lliker-Fuse nucleus (KF) control the emergence of late E activity during hypercapnia. Previously, we reported that reversible inhibition of the KF reduced post-inspiratory (post-I) motor output to laryngeal adductor muscles and brought forward the onset of hypercapnia-induced late-E abdominal activity. Herein, we explored the contribution of the KF for late-E abdominal recruitment during hypercapnia by pharmacologically disinhibiting the KF in in situ decerebrate arterially-perfused rat preparations. These data were combined with previous results and incorporated into a computational model of the respiratory central pattern generator. Disinhibition of the KF through local parenchymal microinjections of gabazine (GABA A receptor antagonist) prolonged vagal post-I activity and inhibited late-E abdominal output during hypercapnia. In silico, we reproduced this behavior and predicted a mechanism where the KF provides excitatory drive to post-I inhibitory neurons, which, in turn, inhibit late-E neurons of the pFRG. Although the exact mechanism proposed by the model requires testing, our data confirm that the KF modulates the formation of late-E abdominal activity during hypercapnia. abdominal activity", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T18:45:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "40ef69581d91d8b75065a6566647905f446e1e0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssG4Tlr82ZHitMU_tfDfCBcTw--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Experience-Dependent Trends in CA1 Theta and Slow Gamma Rhythms in Freely Behaving Mice", "title_full": "Experience-Dependent Trends in CA1 Theta and Slow Gamma Rhythms in Freely Behaving Mice", "published": "2017-10-26T02:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "40ef69581d91d8b75065a6566647905f446e1e0d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssG4Tlr82ZHitMU_tfDfCBcTw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gereke, B.

Theta (~5-12 Hz), slow gamma (~25-50 Hz), and fast gamma (~50-100 Hz) rhythms are thought to route spatial information in the hippocampal formation and to coordinate place cell ensembles. Yet, it is unknown whether these rhythms exhibit experience-dependent changes concurrent with those observed in place cells. Slow gamma rhythms are thought to indicate inputs from CA3 to CA1, and such inputs are thought to be strengthened with experience. Thus, we hypothesized that slow gamma rhythms would become more evident with experience. We tested this hypothesis using mice freely traversing a familiar circular track for three ten-minute sessions per day. We found that slow gamma amplitude was reduced in the early minutes of the first session of each day, even though both theta and fast gamma amplitudes were elevated during this same period. However, in the first minutes of the second and third sessions of each day, all three rhythms were elevated. Interestingly, theta was elevated to a greater degree in the first minutes of the first session than in the first minutes of later sessions. Additionally, all three rhythms were strongly influenced by running speed in dynamic ways, with the influence of running speed on theta and slow gamma changing over time within and across sessions.

Such processes of amodal completion rely on the generation and maintenance of a mental image that renders the completed object in visual working memory (VWM). The present study examined this relationship between VWM storage and processes of object completion. We recorded event-related potentials to track VWM maintenance by means of the contralateral delay activity (CDA) during a change detection task in which to-be-memorized composite objects (notched shapes abutting an occluding shape) were primed to induce either a globally completed object or a non-completed, mosaic representation. The results revealed an effect of completion in VWM despite physically identical visual input: Change detection was more accurate for completed as compared to mosaic representations when observers were required to memorize two objects, and these differences were reduced with four memorized items. At the electrophysiological level, globally completed (versus mosaic) objects gave rise to a corresponding increase in CDA amplitudes. These results indicate that, while incorporating the occluded portions of the presented shapes requires mnemonic resources, the complete-object representations thus formed in VWM improve change detection performance by providing a more simple, regular shape. Overall, these findings demonstrate that mechanisms of object completion modulate VWM, with the memory load being determined by the structured representations of the memorized stimuli. visual working memory", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "cda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T18:45:56.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ea2b72e1a1b252650da37add5b57f723155022b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssG4Tlr82ZHitNQhDbm3scx8Q--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF THREE CUES THAT \"PERVADE\" THE BRAIN: ELECTRO-MAGNETIC FIELD, OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE", "title_full": "FUNCTIONAL ROLES OF THREE CUES THAT \"PERVADE\" THE BRAIN: ELECTRO-MAGNETIC FIELD, OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE", "published": "2017-10-26T02:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ea2b72e1a1b252650da37add5b57f723155022b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssG4Tlr82ZHitNQhDbm3scx8Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Agnati, L.

Hence, such a phenomenon plays the key role in driving the complex dynamics of central nervous system (CNS), in which true computations interact with non-computational dynamical processes to generate brain representations of the body in the external world, hence the finalistic behaviour of the organism. In this context, it should be pointed out that beside the intercellular interactions mediated by classical electro-chemical signals also other types of interactions, namely 'cue' and 'coercion' appear to be exploited by the system to achieve its function. Actually, the main focus of the present paper will be on cues present in the environment as well as produced by cells of the body, that \"pervade\" the brain contributing to its dynamics. These cues can also be metabolic substrates and in most cases, they are of a fundamental importance for the brain function and for the entire organism survival. Three of these highly pervasive cues will be analysed more in detail, namely oxygen, carbon dioxide and electromagnetic fields (EMF). A special emphasis will be given to EMF since it has been proposed by several authors that these highly pervasive energy fluctuations could play an important role in the global integrative actions of the brain, hence EMF signalling may transcend purely connectionist models of brain function. Thus, the new concept of \"Broadcasted Neuro-Connectomics\" (BNC) has been introduced that transcends the current connectomics view of the brain.

Speech and language therapy (SLT) is considered effective in treating aphasia, but due to time constraints, improvements are often limited. Non-invasive brain stimulation is a promising adjuvant strategy to facilitate SLT. However, stroke might render \"classical\" language regions ineffective as stimulation sites. Recent work showed the effectiveness of motor-cortex stimulation together with intensive naming therapy to improve outcomes in aphasia (Meinzer et al., 2016). Although, this study highlights the involvement of the motor cortex, the functional aspects by which it influences language are yet unclear. In this study, we focus on the role of motor cortex in language, investigating its functional involvement in access to specific lexico-semantic (object- vs. action related) information in post-stroke aphasia. To this end, we tested effects of anodal tDCS to the left motor cortex on lexical retrieval in 16 patients with post-stroke aphasia in a sham-controlled, double-blind study design. Critical stimuli were action and object words, and pseudowords. Participants performed a lexical-decision task, deciding whether stimuli were words or pseudowords. Anodal tDCS improved accuracy in lexical decision, especially for words with action-related content and for pseudowords with an \"action-like\" ending (t15 = 2.65, p = 0.036), but not for words with object-related content and pseudowords with \"object-like\" characteristics. We show as a proof-of-principle that the motor cortex may play a specific role in access to lexical-semantic content. Thus, motor-cortex stimulation may strengthen content-specific word-to-semantic concept associations during language treatment in post-stroke aphasia. aphasia", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meinzer", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T18:45:59.024+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "97f27d15d65be2995ded5866808cf5ac6a545bcf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGA8YXazVywqX_jgVkRJFVBw--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Momentary level of slow default mode network activity is associated with distinct propagation and connectivity patterns in the anesthetized mouse cortex", "title_full": "Momentary level of slow default mode network activity is associated with distinct propagation and connectivity patterns in the anesthetized mouse cortex", "published": "2017-10-26T02:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "97f27d15d65be2995ded5866808cf5ac6a545bcf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGA8YXazVywqX_jgVkRJFVBw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kang, M., Lee, Y.-B., Gohel, B., Yoo, K., Lee, P., Chung, J., Jeong, Y.", "published": "2017-10-26T02:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "Momentary level of slow default mode network activity is associated with distinct propagation and connectivity patterns in the anesthetized mouse cortex", "text": "PDF Abstract Complex spatiotemporal changes of slow spontaneous activity occur in the form of propagating waves in the cortex, leading to the transient formation of a specific activation topography, followed by a transition in the topography. The topographies resemble the stimulation-induced activation patterns and the underlying structural projections, suggesting that they contain motifs of task-related activation. However, little is known about how propagation-mediated transitions between topographies are structured in terms of functional connectivity. Therefore, we investigated whether specific topographies or regions are associated with transitions involving long-range connections and hub modulation. We hypothesized that the activity level of the default mode network (DMN) at a given topography would affect the pattern of upcoming transitions, since high activity levels of the DMN are a distinct feature of the brain at rest. Using mesoscale voltage-sensitive dye imaging in the cortex of lightly anesthetized mice, we revealed that momentary levels of DMN activity are associated with distinct patterns of activity propagation and functional connectivity. High levels of DMN activity led to activity propagation across secondary and association cortices, increasing the centrality of a main hub region, while low level activity led to global, diffuse, yet efficient changes in functional connectivity. Furthermore, low levels of activity resulted in increased long-range connectivity between frontal and posterior regions of the cortex. Our results indicate that DMN activity is associated with functional connectivity and wave propagation patterns, raising the possibility that the DMN may be involved in the modulation of long-range information processing associated with upcoming transitions. default mode network", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dmn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T18:46:01.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "da627cf7555f5e5e33f9739f20f7ff0dfaf1d570", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGA8YXazVywqUNeoKbRQkIIw--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "Individualized tracking of self-directed motor learning in group-housed mice performing a skilled lever positioning task in the home cage", "title_full": "Individualized tracking of self-directed motor learning in group-housed mice performing a skilled lever positioning task in the home cage", "published": "2017-10-26T02:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "da627cf7555f5e5e33f9739f20f7ff0dfaf1d570", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGA8YXazVywqUNeoKbRQkIIw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Silasi, G., Boyd, J., Bolanos, F., LeDue, J., Scott, S.

We developed a skilled lever positioning task that mice can perform within their home cage. The task requires mice to use their forelimb to precisely hold a lever mounted on a rotary encoder within a rewarded position in order to dispense a water reward. A Raspberry Pi microcomputer is used to record lever position during trials, and to control task parameters, thus making this low-footprint apparatus ideal for use within animal housing facilities. Custom Python software automatically increments task difficulty by requiring a longer hold duration, or a more accurate hold position in order to dispense a reward. The performance of individual animals within group-housed mice is tracked through RFID implants, and data stored on the microcomputer may be accessed remotely through an active internet connection. Mice continuously engage in the task for over 2.5 months, and perform ~500 trials/24 hrs. Mice required approximately 15,000 trials to learn to hold the lever within a 10\u00b0 range for 1.5s, and were able to further refine movement accuracy by limiting their error to a 5\u00b0 range within each trial. These results demonstrate the feasibility of autonomously training group housed mice on a forelimb motor task.

Responders were identified based on differences from the typical error of baseline total MSNA; 7 negative, 12 positive, and 10 non-response patterns. Positive responders demonstrated larger total MSNA responses during HG1 (p<0.01) and HG2 (p<0.0001), however, the increases in blood pressure throughout handgrip exercise were similar between all groups, as were the changes in heart rate, stroke volume, cardiac output, total vascular conductance, and respiration (All p>0.05).

This involves stopping rules that specify the requirements for decision commitment. Flexibility of decision stopping rules provides an important means of control over decision-making processes. In many situations, these stopping rules establish a balance between premature decisions and late decisions. In this study we use a novel change detection paradigm to examine how subjects control this balance when invoking different decision stopping rules. The task design allows us to estimate the temporal weighting of sensory information for the decisions, and we find that different stopping rules did not result in systematic differences in that weighting. We also find bidirectional post-error alterations of decision strategy that depend on the type of error and effectively reduce the probability of making consecutive mistakes of the same type. This is a generalization to change detection tasks of the widespread observation of unidirectional post-error slowing in forced-choice tasks. On the basis of these results, we suggest change detection tasks as a promising paradigm to study the neural mechanisms that support flexible control of decision rules. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Flexible decision stopping rules confer control over decision processes. Using an auditory change detection task, we found that alterations of decision stopping rules did not result in systematic changes in the temporal weighting of sensory information. We also found that post-error alterations of decision stopping rules depended on the type of mistake subjects make. These results provide guidance for understanding the neural mechanisms that control decision stopping rules, one of the critical components of decision making and behavioral flexibility. adaptive behavior", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-01T23:14:26.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bde91471e8d850b291802f197d8a25f20fdcd075", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtymJV9SrDRvk9FO5sRP_EGX", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/recent.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology recent issues", "title": "Altered visual strategies and attention are related to increased force fluctuations during a pinch grip task in older adults", "title_full": "Altered visual strategies and attention are related to increased force fluctuations during a pinch grip task in older adults", "published": "2017-11-01T12:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://jn.physiology.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jn/118/5.cover-source.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bde91471e8d850b291802f197d8a25f20fdcd075", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtymJV9SrDRvk9FO5sRP_EGX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Keenan, K.

Eye movements of 23 older adults (>65 yr) were monitored during a low-force pinch grip task while subjects viewed three common visual feedback displays. Performance on the Grooved Pegboard test and an attention task (which required no concurrent hand movements) was also measured. Visual strategies varied across subjects and depended on the type of visual feedback provided to the subjects. First, while viewing a high-gain compensatory feedback display (horizontal bar moving up and down with force), 9 of 23 older subjects adopted a strategy of performing saccades during the task, which resulted in 2.5 times greater force fluctuations in those that exhibited saccades compared with those who maintained fixation near the target line. Second, during pursuit feedback displays (force trace moving left to right across screen and up and down with force), all subjects exhibited multiple saccades, and increased force fluctuations were associated ( r s = 0.6; P = 0.002) with fewer saccades during the pursuit task. Also, decreased low-frequency (<4 Hz) force fluctuations and Grooved Pegboard times were significantly related ( P = 0.033 and P = 0.005, respectively) with higher (i.e., better) attention z scores. Comparison of these results with our previously published results in young subjects indicates that saccadic eye movements and attention are related to force control in older adults. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The significant contributions of the study are the addition of eye movement data and an attention task to explain differences in hand motor control across different visual displays in older adults. Older participants used different visual strategies across varying feedback displays, and saccadic eye movements were related with motor performance. In addition, those older individuals with deficits in attention had impaired motor performance on two different hand motor control tasks, including the Grooved Pegboard test. visual strategies", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-01T23:14:30.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5128bc5d16ab8ba62d8a647714ddeaeb0655b68f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtymJV9SrDRvkzk44bOfktJ_", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/recent.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology recent issues", "title": "Limbic-motor integration by neural excitations and inhibitions in the nucleus accumbens", "title_full": "Limbic-motor integration by neural excitations and inhibitions in the nucleus accumbens", "published": "2017-11-01T12:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://jn.physiology.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jn/118/5.cover-source.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5128bc5d16ab8ba62d8a647714ddeaeb0655b68f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtymJV9SrDRvkzk44bOfktJ_", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Morrison, S.

However, there is little direct evidence that the signaling of individual NAc neurons combines information about predicted reward and behavioral response. We report that cue-evoked neural responses in the NAc form a likely physiological substrate for its limbic-motor integration function. Across task contexts, individual NAc neurons in behaving rats robustly encode the reward-predictive qualities of a cue, as well as the probability of behavioral response to the cue, as coexisting components of the neural signal. In addition, cue-evoked activity encodes spatial and locomotor aspects of the behavioral response, including proximity to a reward-associated target and the latency and speed of approach to the target. Notably, there are important limits to the ability of NAc neurons to integrate motivational information into behavior: in particular, updating of predicted reward value appears to occur on a relatively long timescale, since NAc neurons fail to discriminate between cues with reward associations that change frequently. Overall, these findings suggest that NAc cue-evoked signals, including inhibition of firing (as noted here for the first time), provide a mechanism for linking reward prediction and other motivationally relevant factors, such as spatial proximity, to the probability and vigor of a reward-seeking behavioral response. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is thought to link expected rewards and action planning, but evidence for this idea remains sparse. We show that, across contexts, both excitatory and inhibitory cue-evoked activity in the NAc jointly encode reward prediction and probability of behavioral responding to the cue, as well as spatial and locomotor properties of the response. Interestingly, although spatial information in the NAc is updated quickly, fine-grained updating of reward value occurs over a longer timescale. nucleus accumbens", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-01T23:14:38.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "593cb9e55bbbcdeb51ca068ca1824bd5e3002cc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtymJV9SrDRvk7.RpaDlcagj", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/recent.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology recent issues", "title": "Altered tactile sensitivity in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder", "title_full": "Altered tactile sensitivity in children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder", "published": "2017-11-01T12:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://jn.physiology.org/sites/default/files/highwire/jn/118/5.cover-source.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "593cb9e55bbbcdeb51ca068ca1824bd5e3002cc6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHtymJV9SrDRvk7.RpaDlcagj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Puts, N.

The literature on tactile impairments in ADHD is limited, with most work employing clinical observations or questionnaires. We studied tactile processing in children with ADHD and hypothesized that children with ADHD would show reduced performance in tasks closely linked to inhibition. Sixty-seven children with ADHD and 62 typically developing children (TDC) performed a battery of tasks grouped in domains: simple and choice reaction time; static and dynamic detection threshold (probing feedforward inhibition); amplitude discrimination without adaptation and with dual and single-site adaptation (probing lateral inhibition and adaptation); sequential and simultaneous frequency discrimination (previously linked to GABA); and temporal order judgment with and without a synchronous carrier stimulus. Children with ADHD could discriminate different amplitudes without adaptation, suggesting lateral inhibition is intact, but were negatively affected in all adaptation conditions, whereas TDC were only affected during single-site adaptation. Children with ADHD also showed normal frequency discrimination. Children with ADHD showed slower reaction times and higher detection threshold, likely driven by IQ and inattention, because reaction time and detection thresholds correlated with IQ and subtle motor signs. Children with ADHD showed a pattern of altered tactile processing on specific tasks, suggesting that higher cognitive function and cortical mechanisms related to adaptation are affected in ADHD, but no clear conclusion can be drawn toward impaired inhibition. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This manuscript presents the first tactile psychophysical study testing different aspects of tactile processing in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), using large cohort sizes of 67 children with ADHD and 65 Typically Developing Children. This study demonstrates impaired tactile processing in children with ADHD, on some, but not all tasks (showing this is not just due to attention), related to impaired cortical mechanisms. Furthermore, both IQ and soft motor skill abnormalities (common in ADHD) are correlated with tactile abnormalities. attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder somatosensory touch attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is principally defined by inattention as well as an increased presence of impulsive and off-task and hypermotoric behavior. Sensory problems (e.g., touch processing abnormalities) in children with ADHD are also relatively common; Ben-Sasson et al. (2014) suggest that one in six children with ADHD has sensory impairments that have a negative impact on everyday function. Tactile processing in specific is important in development, because it supports exploration of the physical world as well as playing an important role in forming physical relationships and development of communication ( Cascio 2010 ; Parham and Mailloux 2010 ). Altered tactile processing could therefore contribute to the developmental issues observed in ADHD. Assessments of tactile impairments in ADHD are limited. The majority of work has employed clinical observations or questionnaires to sensory function as a whole ( Ghanizadeh 2009 ). Pfeiffer et al. (2015) showed associations between the Sensory Processing Measure (SPM) and hyperactivity, but not with inattention (as measured with the Conners scale; Conners 2008 ). Although clinical observations and questionnaires can be useful for focusing interventions and assessing the extent of various sensory impairments, these assessments are not designed to investigate the underlying neurophysiological nature of these impairments, particularly those that relate to primary sensory regions. It is possible that higher levels of inattention and overarousal play an important role ( Dunn and Westman 1997 ; McIntosh et al. 1999 ), but it remains unclear how alterations in primary somatosensory processes contribute to behaviorally altered tactile function. Studies have shown increased \u201ctactile defensiveness\u201d in ADHD, a common symptom of hyperresponsiveness ( Ghanizadeh 2008 ), but to date, there has been no extensive investigation of specific tactile abnormalities in children with ADHD. By using psychophysics, it is possible to measure tactile thresholds in a controlled and objective manner. Tactile psychophysical studies in ADHD are limited. In previous studies, we have shown that tactile detection and discrimination thresholds can be measured in pediatric cohorts (8\u221212 yr; Puts et al. 2013 ), and in subsequent follow-up studies, we have shown that these methods also can be applied to study tactile function in children with developmental disorders such as autism and Tourette syndrome ( Puts et al. 2014 , 2015 ). There is little known about the underlying neurophysiology of ADHD, but several studies have shown that the GABA system might be altered in ADHD, through edited MRS of GABA work showing reduced GABA levels in ADHD ( Bollmann et al. 2015 ; Edden et al. 2012 ) and transcranial magnetic stimulation studies ( Gilbert et al. 2011 ; Wu et al. 2012 ) showing reduced GABA-mediated short-interval cortical inhibition in children with ADHD. However, there have been no studies showing associations between altered GABA systems and ADHD symptomatology. There are a number of tactile tasks probing tactile function that are inspired by animal and in vitro work and make predictions on the involvement of the inhibitory system. Given that there is evidence that impaired functioning of cortical inhibitory mechanisms may contribute to the pathophysiology of ADHD, these tasks may provide insight into the potential contribution of inhibition to tactile function in ADHD. Although other mechanisms, including attention and the dopamine/noradrenergic system ( Bonvicini et al. 2016 ; Rubia et al. 2009 ), play a role, these tactile tasks are likely to probe inhibition more directly ( Puts et al. 2014 , 2015 ). Detection Threshold The ability to detect weak static tactile stimuli is associated with GABRB3 (a GABA receptor subunit) gene expression ( Tavassoli et al. 2012 ). Behaviorally, detection threshold can be measured by applying a static weak static stimulus that participants are asked to detect or by asking participants to respond as soon as a dynamically increasing amplitude stimulus is perceived. It is thought that when a subthreshold stimulus is applied before detection of weak stimuli, such as in the latter example, feedforward inhibitory mechanisms are recruited ( Blankenburg et al. 2003 ; Zhang and Sun 2011 ), raising the detection threshold. Indeed, when a tactile stimulus is applied while amplitude is slowly increased from below the detection threshold, the detection threshold is typically higher in a healthy population than when static weak stimuli are applied ( Puts et al. 2013 , 2014 ; Tavassoli et al. 2016 ). As a result, the difference between the static and dynamic stimulus thresholds can be a marker of feedforward inhibition (and indeed, correlates with brain GABA levels; Puts et al. 2017 ). Adaptation to Amplitude Discrimination The ability to discriminate simultaneously applied stimuli of different amplitude on the fingers relies on the ability to separate spatially distinct signals that represent the tactile stimuli. This separation of signals relies on GABA-mediated lateral inhibition between adjacent cortical representations ( Tommerdahl et al. 2010 ; Whitsel et al. 1989 ). Indeed, blocking GABA in animal models reduces the spatially separate activation patterns when two stimuli are applied simultaneously ( Whitsel et al. 1989 , 2003 ). Furthermore, performance on a simultaneous amplitude discrimination task is worse when the higher amplitude stimulus is preceded by a longer (adapting) stimulus ( Puts et al. 2013 ; Tannan et al. 2008 ). In healthy adults, when both fingers receive an adapting stimulus, performance improves ( Puts et al. 2013 ; Tannan et al. 2007 ), but there appears to be no such effect in children ( Puts et al. 2013 ). Adapting stimuli are thought to modulate processing of subsequent stimuli in two manners. First, an adapting stimulus reduces the firing rate of neurons through inhibitory mechanisms. Because firing rate decreases are related to perceived intensity ( Tommerdahl et al. 2010 ; Whitsel et al. 2003 ), adaptation will make the subsequent stimuli feel weaker. Second, the contrast by which individual stimuli are encoded \u201csharpens\u201d due to increased inhibition of neighboring regions. Therefore, when a single adapting stimulus is presented before the \u201cstronger\u201d test stimulus, the test stimulus is now perceived as weaker and the task is more difficult. When two adapting stimuli are presented simultaneously, this same effect holds true, but by applying stimuli on both fingers, contrast is also increased for both stimuli, either having no net effect on performance or making performance better. Frequency Discrimination Animal work suggests that tactile frequencies are encoded through periodic and synchronous encoding reflecting stimulus frequency ( McLaughlin and Juliano 2005 ). We have shown that brain sensorimotor GABA levels in both adults ( Puts et al. 2011 ) and typically developing children ( Puts et al. 2015 ) correlate with their ability to discriminate the frequencies of two sequentially applied tactile stimuli. When tactile stimuli that differ in frequency are applied simultaneously, it is thought that confabulation of the frequencies, through synchronization of neuronal ensembles, makes discrimination more difficult. Temporal Order Judgment In healthy adults, the ability to discriminate the order of two sequentially applied, high-amplitude pulses on two fingers gets worse when a low-amplitude stimulus is synchronously applied on both fingers. It is thought that this low-amplitude \u201ccarrier\u201d stimulus synchronizes the neuronal activity between the two fingers, having a negative effect on the ability to temporally separate signals from the two fingers, and may reflect local connectivity within the primary somatosensory cortex ( Tommerdahl et al. 2008 ), although the role of GABA in this synchronization is unclear. Few studies have investigated tactile processing in ADHD. Previous work has suggested alterations in the GABA system in ADHD. Using a battery of tasks, we aim to explore different aspects of tactile function in children with ADHD. Given previous work showing altered inhibition in ADHD, these data may point to a link between reduced inhibition and altered tactile function in ADHD. On the basis of this link, we hypothesized that children with ADHD would show 1 ) increased static detection thresholds, reflecting abnormal GABA function, and a reduced effect of subthreshold stimulation on detection threshold, reflecting reduced feedforward inhibition; 2 ) increased amplitude discrimination threshold, reflecting abnormal lateral inhibition, and an absence of adaptation, reflecting an inability of the cortex to modulate activity based on repetitive stimulation; 3 ) impaired frequency discrimination, reflecting reduced ability to encode tactile frequencies; and 4 ) based on previous work in autism, intact temporal order judgment. Finally, given that ADHD is defined by inattention, we expect children with ADHD to show worse performance in task requiring higher attentional load (reaction time task with and without a choice component and when \u201cdistracted\u201d by a carrier stimulus in the temporal order judgment task. By identifying key patterns of tactile processing in ADHD, it will become possible to probe the underlying mechanisms of tactile impairments in ADHD that could potentially help target interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Participants Sixty-two typically developing children (TDC) and 67 children with ADHD, aged 8\u201312 yr, were tested on a tactile battery consisting of 11 tasks. A subset of the TDC group (32) was included from a previous study reporting on tactile abnormalities in autism spectrum disorder ( Puts et al. 2014 ). Informed consent was obtained from a parent of each child (who themselves assented to testing), under the approval of the Kennedy Krieger Institute and the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Institutional Review Boards. Screening was performed via a telephone interview with the parent, and all reported participant numbers are for participants that cleared screening. Children with a history of intellectual disability, seizures, brain injury, or other neurological illnesses were excluded. Intellectual ability was assessed using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. Children with full-scale IQ scores below 80 were excluded from participation in all studies unless there was a 12-point or greater index discrepancy, in which case either the Verbal Comprehension Index or Perceptual Reasoning Index (PRI) was required to be \u226580 and the lower of the two was required to be \u226565. All children performed the basic reading subtest from the Wechsler Individual Achievement Test (WIAT) or the WIAT-II ( Wechsler 2009 ) to rule out a learning disability in reading. Children were excluded from the study if they demonstrated a significant discrepancy between full-scale IQ and the WIAT or WIAT-II score or a basic reading subtest score below 85. Diagnosis of ADHD was verified using the Diagnostic Interview for Children and Adolescents-IV (DICA-IV). An ADHD diagnosis was confirmed or established on the basis of the following criteria: 1 ) T score of 60 or higher on scale L (DSM-IV: inattentive) or M (DSM-IV: hyperactive-impulsive) on the Connors (ADHD 35; TDC 28) or Conners 3 (ADHD 26; TDC 30), when available, or a score of 2 or 3 on at least 6/9 items on the inattentive or hyperactivity/impulsivity scales of the ADHD-Rating Scale-IV; and 2 ) an ADHD diagnosis on the DICA-IV. Further information was obtained through the Conners or Conners 3 Parent and Teacher Rating Scales\u2013Revised: Long Form [ADHD-specific broad behavior rating scales ( Conners 2008 ) and the ADHD Rating Scale-IV, home and school versions (ADHD-RS, or DuPaul scale)]. The information was then reviewed, and the diagnosis was verified by a child neurologist with over two decades of experience in diagnosing ADHD in clinic and research settings (S. H. Mostofsky). Additional assessment consisted of the physical and neurological examination for soft signs, PANESS ( Camp et al. 1977 ), which assesses for subtle motor signs such as overflow movements and dysrhythmia. Children taking psychotropic medications other than stimulants were excluded from participation, and all children taking stimulants were asked to withhold medication the day before and the day of testing. The DICA-IV was also used to assess the presence of other psychiatric disorders. Children who met the criteria for conduct disorder, mood disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder were excluded from the study, but not those with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), because family studies suggest that ADHD-associated ODD does not represent a separate subtype of ADHD. No participant had a history of other neurological disorders, including Tourette syndrome or autism spectrum disorder. All TDC were free of criteria for psychiatric disorders on the DICA-IV. No children in the TD group were on psychoactive medications. Children included in the TD group also could not have an immediate family member diagnosed with ADHD. The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory was used to assess handedness ( Oldfield 1971 ). Behavioral These methods are described in detail elsewhere ( Puts et al. 2013 , 2014 , 2015 ). All children underwent a battery of vibrotactile tasks consisting of 11 tasks. Tasks were grouped as follows: reaction time, detection threshold, amplitude discrimination, frequency discrimination, and temporal order judgment. Stimulus delivery. A CM4 four-digit tactile stimulator (Cortical Metrics) was used for stimulation ( Holden et al. 2012 ). All stimuli were delivered and limited to the glabrous skin of the left hand, on digit 2 (LD2-index finger) and digit 3 (LD3-middle finger), using a cylindrical probe (5 mm in diameter) in all tasks. All stimuli were presented within the flutter range (25\u201350 Hz). Visual feedback, task responses, and data collection were performed on an Acer One Netbook computer running CM4 software ( Holden et al. 2012 ). Experimental design. The vibrotactile testing battery consisted of 11 separate tasks, grouped into five domains (reaction time, detection threshold, amplitude discrimination, frequency discrimination, and temporal order judgment), with three conditions in the amplitude discrimination domain and two conditions for each of the other domains. Tasks are shown in schematic form in Fig. 1 and described in detail below. The whole battery was performed in ~40 min, and breaks were allowed as needed. To confirm that participants understood the instructions, each task was preceded by three practice trials, which had to be answered correctly to proceed to the testing stage. Feedback was only given during practice trials. All responses were obtained via a mouse-click using the participants\u2019 right hand. The left mouse button corresponded to LD3 and the right mouse button to LD2. For threshold determination, a stepwise tracking protocol was used (except for the reaction time and dynamic detection threshold tasks, as detailed in the sections below) with two-alternate forced-choice tasks (2AFC; LD2 or LD3). In tasks where stimuli were presented sequentially, the order of the two stimuli was pseudorandomized between trials. In all tasks, stimulus location was pseudorandomized between trials. The variable parameter was modulated with one-up/one-down tracking for the first 10 trials and two-up/one-down tracking for the remainder of the task.

Such a hypothesis raises the question to what extent oscillations are coherent across spatially distant neural populations. To address this question, we obtained local field potential (LFP) and membrane potential recordings from the visual cortex of turtle in response to visual stimulation of the retina. The time-frequency analysis of these recordings revealed pronounced bursts of oscillatory neural activity and a large trial-to-trial variability in the spectral and temporal properties of the observed oscillations. First, local bursts of oscillations varied from trial to trial in both burst duration and peak frequency. Second, oscillations of a given recording site were not autocoherent; i.e., the phase did not progress linearly in time. Third, LFP oscillations at spatially separate locations within the visual cortex were more phase coherent in the presence of visual stimulation than during ongoing activity. In contrast, the membrane potential oscillations from pairs of simultaneously recorded pyramidal neurons showed smaller phase coherence, which did not change when switching from black screen to visual stimulation. In conclusion, neuronal oscillations at distant locations in visual cortex are coherent at the mesoscale of population activity, but coherence is largely absent at the microscale of the membrane potential of neurons.

Although specific mechanisms underlying SUDEP are not well understood, evidence suggests most SUDEP occurs due to seizure-induced respiratory arrest. SUDEP also tends to happen at night. Although this may be due to circumstances in which humans find themselves at night, such as being alone without supervision or sleeping prone, or to independent influences of sleep state, there are a number of reasons why the night (i.e., circadian influences) could be an independent risk factor for SUDEP. We explored this possibility. Adult male WT mice were instrumented for EEG, EMG, and EKG recording and subjected to maximal electroshock (MES) seizures during wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the nighttime/dark phase. These data were compared with data collected following seizures induced during the daytime/light phase. Seizures induced during the nighttime were similar in severity and duration to those induced during the daytime; however, seizures induced during the nighttime were associated with a lesser degree of respiratory dysregulation and postictal EEG suppression. Seizures induced during REM sleep during the nighttime were universally fatal, as is seen when seizures are induced during REM during the daytime. Taken together, these data implicate a role for time of day in influencing the physiological consequences of seizures that may contribute to seizure-induced death.

SUDEP frequently occurs during the night, which has been attributed to an effect of sleep. We have shown that sleep state does indeed influence survival following a seizure.

We measured broadband electrocorticographic changes from implanted electrodes on the ventral temporal brain surface while showing patients noise-degraded images of faces and houses. In a subset of posterior fusiform gyrus face-selective regions, cortical activity decreased parametrically with noise increase, until the perceptual threshold was surpassed. At noise levels higher than the perceptual threshold, and for house stimuli, activity remained at baseline. We propose that this convergence of proportional and thresholded response may identify active areas where face percepts are extracted from simple visual features.

This topological organization suggests a physiological basis for the anatomy of face perception, explaining different perceptual deficits following temporal lobe injury.

While the regions that underlie motor learning have been well described, neurophysiological factors underlying differences in response to motor practice are less well understood. The present study examined both resting state and event-related EEG coherence measures of connectivity as predictors of response to motor practice on a motor sequencing task using the dominant hand. Thirty-two healthy, young, right-handed participants underwent resting EEG prior to motor practice. Response to practice was evaluated both across the single session of motor practice, and 24-hours later at a retention test of short-term motor learning. Behaviorally, the group demonstrated statistically significant gains both in single-session motor improvement and across-session motor learning. A resting-state measure of whole brain coherence with primary motor cortex (M1) at baseline robustly predicted subsequent motor improvement (validated R 2 =0.55) and motor learning (validated R 2 =0.68) in separate partial least squares regression models. Specifically, greater M1 coherence with left frontal-premotor cortex (PMC) at baseline was characteristic of individuals likely to demonstrate greater gains in both motor improvement and motor learning. Analysis of event-related coherence with respect to movement found the largest changes occurring in areas implicated in planning and preparation of movement, including PMC and frontal cortices. While event-related coherence provided a stronger prediction of practice-induced motor improvement (validated R 2 =0.73) it did not predict the degree of motor learning (validated R 2 =0.16).

Tonic NE release in the forebrain is essential for maintenance of vigilant states and increases the signal-to-noise ratio of cortical sensory responses. The impact of phasic NE release on cortical activity and sensory processing is less explored. We have previously reported that LC microstimulation caused a transient desynchronization of the population activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), similar to noxious somatosensory stimuli. The LC receives nociceptive information from the medulla and therefore may mediate sensory signaling to its forebrain targets. Here, we performed extracellular recordings in LC and mPFC while presenting noxious stimuli in urethane-anesthetized rats. A brief train of foot shocks produced a robust phasic response in the LC and a transient change in the mPFC power spectrum with the strongest modulation in gamma (30-90 Hz) range. The LC phasic response preceded prefrontal gamma power increase and cortical modulation was proportional to the LC excitation. We also quantitatively characterized distinct cortical states and showed that sensory responses in both LC and mPFC depend on the ongoing cortical state. Finally, cessation of the LC firing by bilateral local iontophoretic injection of clonidine, \u03b12-adrenoreceotor agonist, completely eliminated sensory responses in the mPFC without shifting cortex to less excitable state. Together, our results suggest that the LC phasic response induces gamma power increase in the prefrontal cortex and is essential for mediating sensory information along ascending noxious pathway. noradrenaline", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-02T05:35:47.018+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "929a085b107f28be74ff8bc282ae829a8a6d3ce4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGSXGVhtIVZrUEjhaleP3OUA--", "site_full": "jn.physiology.org", "site": "physiology.org", "site_section": "http://jn.physiology.org/rss/ahead.xml", "site_categories": ["education"], "section_title": "Journal of Neurophysiology: Ahead of Print RSS feed", "title": "AGE- AND SPEED-DEPENDENT MODULATION OF LOCOMOTOR GAITS IN DSCAM2J MUTANT MICE", "title_full": "AGE- AND SPEED-DEPENDENT MODULATION OF LOCOMOTOR GAITS IN DSCAM2J MUTANT MICE", "published": "2017-11-01T20:25:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40451, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "929a085b107f28be74ff8bc282ae829a8a6d3ce4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/GiCaV2xJNYvaNgoDNxczt8Q_n2V4VtZ9fyN.m3lNHty4Mq2WwNXHZX3_Y_91dssGSXGVhtIVZrUEjhaleP3OUA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Thiry, L., Lemieux, M., Bretzner, F.", "published": "2017-11-01T20:25:00.000+02:00", "title": "AGE- AND SPEED-DEPENDENT MODULATION OF LOCOMOTOR GAITS IN DSCAM2J MUTANT MICE", "text": "PDF Abstract Locomotor gaits depend on the interplay between distributed spinal neural networks termed central pattern generators generating rhythmic and coordinated movements, primary afferents and descending supraspinal inputs. Recent studies demonstrated that the mouse display a rich repertoire of locomotor gaits. Changes in locomotor gaits occur in mutant mice lacking particular neurons or molecular signaling pathways implicated in the normal establishment of these neural networks Given the role of the Down Syndrome Cell Adherence Molecule (DSCAM) to the formation and maintenance of spinal interneuronal circuits and sensorimotor integration, we have investigated its functional contribution to locomotor gaits over a wide range of locomotor speeds using freely walking mice. We show here that the DSCAM 2J mutation, while not precluding any gait, impairs the age- and speed-dependent modulation of locomotor gaits. It impairs the ability of mice to maintain their locomotion at high treadmill speeds. DSCAM 2J mutation induces the dominance of lateral walk over trot and the emergence of aberrant gaits for mice, such as pace and diagonal walk. Locomotor gaits were also more labile in DSCAM 2J mutant mice, i.e. less stable, less attractive and less predictable than their wild-type littermates. Our results suggest that the DSCAM mutation affects the behavioral repertoire of gaits in an age- and speed-dependent manner.

Such plasticity can contribute to improvements in volitional motor recovery, such as walking function, although similar mechanisms underlying this recovery may also contribute to the manifestation of exaggerated responses to afferent input, or spastic behaviors. Rehabilitation interventions directed towards augmenting spinal excitability have shown some initial success in improving locomotor function. However, the potential effects of these strategies on involuntary motor behaviors may be of concern. Here, we provide a brief review of the mechanisms underlying recovery of volitional function and exaggerated reflexes, and the potential overlap between these changes. We then highlight findings from studies that explore changes in spinal excitability during volitional movement in controlled conditions, as well as altered kinematic and behavioral performance during functional tasks. The initial focus will be directed towards recovery of reflex and volitional behaviors following incomplete SCI, followed by recent work elucidating neurophysiological mechanisms underlying patterns of static and dynamic muscle activation following chronic incomplete SCI during primarily single-joint movements. We will then transition to studies of locomotor function and the role of altered spinal integration following incomplete SCI, including enhanced excitability of specific spinal circuits with physical and pharmacological interventions can modulate locomotor output. The effects of previous and newly developed strategies will need to focus on changes in both volitional function and involuntary spastic reflexes for the successful translation of effective therapies to the clinical setting. - locomotor", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sci", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-02T05:35:50.010+02:00"}], "totalResults": 77, "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1509593750010&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Aphysiology.org&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 613}
