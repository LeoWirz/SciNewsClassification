But now, through four regular-season games, several of those moves haven't yielded the expected results. \nIn particular, cornerback Stephon Gilmore (five years, $65 million) has acknowledged his struggle with pre-snap communication and been part of some crushing breakdowns, while linebacker David Harris ($1.25 million guaranteed) has not carved out a role on defense, which makes him an expensive insurance policy with little value on special teams. On offense, tight end Dwayne Allen has been targeted six times but doesn't have a reception. \nWhile each of those players could eventually turn things around, the current snapshot serves as a reminder that positive offseason headlines don't always translate to on-field success. \nTwo weeks ago, with a focus on Patriots imports (including rookies), a 2017 \" newcomer power ranking \" was unveiled. It was well-received, which sparked the idea to update it, potentially as frequently as a bi-weekly basis. Brandin Cooks has already become a reliable target for Tom Brady. Maddie Meyer/Getty Images \n1. WR Brandin Cooks (previous ranking: 4). He makes the leap to the top spot after he had five catches for 131 yards and two touchdowns -- which included a terrific toe-tap on the game-winning drive -- in a thrilling 36-33 comeback over the Texans in Week 3. Cooks has been durable and mostly reliable, having played 253 of a possible 291 offensive snaps (86.9 percent). He has totaled 13 catches for 294 yards with two touchdowns. \n2. DE Deatrich Wise Jr . (previous ranking: 1): The 2017 fourth-round pick from Arkansas slips one spot but continues to make a mark as a pass-rusher, as evidenced by his work against the Texans in Week 3, which included 2 tackles, 2 hits and 1 pass defended. He's mostly playing in obvious passing situations. \n3. DT Lawrence Guy (previous ranking: 3): The workmanlike 6-foot-4, 305-pound free-agent signing from Baltimore is starting over Alan Branch . While Guy doesn't always show up big on the stat sheet, he has been competitive in his role. Specifically, he was part of a third-and-1 stop against the Texans that gave the ball back to the offense for Tom Brady 's comeback drive. \n4. RB Mike Gillislee (previous ranking: 2):The Patriots haven't truly turned him loose, but he remains the top power option filling LeGarrette Blount 's old role. The holes aren't always there, and he slips a few spots after being stopped on a third-and-1 rush in the fourth quarter against the Texans. Gillislee has 57 carries for 194 yards (3.4 avg.) with four touchdowns. \n5. DE Cassius Marsh (previous ranking: 10): This is the biggest jump of the week in the rankings, due to a combination of a strong performance against the Texans in Week 3 -- when he had four tackles, one sack and one forced fumble -- and the rest of the newcomer field faltering a bit. \n6. WR Phillip Dorsett (previous ranking: 5): He slides one spot, as he hasn't been involved as much the last two games (16 of 134 snaps) since Danny Amendola returned from a concussion. Dorsett has four catches for 85 yards on the season. \n7. RB Rex Burkhead (previous ranking: 6): He was coming on early in the team's Week 2 game against the Saints before being knocked out with an injury to his ribs. He hasn't played the last two games, which slides him down the board one spot. On the season, Burkhead has five rushes for 18 yards and four catches for 49 yards and one touchdown. \n8. DT Adam Butler (previous ranking: 8): The undrafted free agent from Vanderbilt earned the trust of the coaching staff early, as he's started in the base package. But his playing time slipped against the Panthers (just 11 snaps). \n9. TE Jacob Hollister (previous ranking: 11): The undrafted free agent from Wyoming moves up a few spots after showing his toughness with a 19-yard catch against the Texans in Week 3 in which he absorbed a big hit. His presence on the game-day roster has opened up the playbook for coordinator Josh McDaniels to manipulate some matchups out of the three-tight end set.

It\u2019s as if there is a flaming pile of trash coming in Marshall's direction when New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning targets his newest receiver so far this season. \nIt\u2019s a quarter of the way into the campaign, and Marshall doesn\u2019t look anywhere near the Pro Bowl receiver the Giants were expecting when they signed him to a two-year deal in the offseason. He had a pair of drops in Sunday\u2019s 25-23 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and caught another ball with his legs after a bobble. \nIt has been that kind of struggle for Marshall. Brandon Marshall failed to exploit his matchup with Vernon Hargreaves, despite having a 7-inch, 30-pound advantage. Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports \n\u201cJust not playing well right now,\u201d he said after finishing with six catches on 10 targets for 46 yards in the Giants\u2019 fourth straight loss. \u201cI haven\u2019t played a solid game since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d \nMarshall\u2019s next touchdown will be his first this year. His next drop will be (at least) his fourth, depending who is counting. \nAlthough Marshall has never exactly been known for having the surest of hands -- his 55 drops since the start of 2010 blow away the competition by 14 or more -- the start of this season has been especially trying. The problem might be in his head. \n\u201cI think catching is confidence. Confidence is catching,\u201d coach Ben McAdoo said. \u201c... We just need to get through a clean game with him. He\u2019s been catching it well in practice. We need to carry it over to game day. And that\u2019s a part of the game for receivers.\u201d \nThe Giants are hoping it happens soon. Their season is already slipping away, and Marshall was supposed to be the ideal complement to star Odell Beckham Jr. on the outside. But the marriage the Giants were hoping would put their offense over the top has done little to inspire confidence. Marshall has looked like a bigger, taller version of Victor Cruz . It has been a mismatched union since Week 1. \nMaybe it\u2019s the shoulder Marshall dinged in the preseason. Maybe it\u2019s the new offense or that the best years are behind the 33-year-old receiver. The early returns after a promising training camp are that Marshall hasn\u2019t looked like the physical receiver who has scored the most red zone touchdowns since 2012. \nMarshall, who has two red zone targets this season, isn\u2019t making excuses. He knows his play has been subpar. He has 16 catches for 139 yards in four games. \nMcAdoo seems to have a theory. \n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a new offense. He\u2019s doing a lot of learning,\" McAdoo said. \"He\u2019s still doing a lot of learning. Playing with a different quarterback. He hasn\u2019t caught the ball cleanly in games.\u201d \nIt might be wishful thinking. This wasn\u2019t a problem for Marshall in the past. He had productive first seasons with the Dolphins, Bears and Jets. He\u2019s on pace for 64 catches, 556 yards and no touchdowns in his first season with the Giants. \n\u201cJust have to get better,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cHave to find ways to get better.\u201d \nMarshall doesn\u2019t appear to be playing with the physicality that made him such a force in the past. He didn\u2019t force a missed tackle on any of his six receptions Sunday, even though most were against cornerback Vernon Hargreaves , who was giving up 7 inches and about 30 pounds. There appeared to be sloppy routes, a lack of physicality and a constant battle with the football. \nThe rare positive was that Marshall used his size on one key catch late in the third quarter on a third down. It was almost like a basketball post-up, but even that wasn\u2019t a clean grab. \nIt has been rare that Marshall has used his 6-foot-5, 230-pound frame as an asset this season. He has 44 yards after the catch on 16 receptions for an average of 2.75 yards after catch this season. \nIt has been that kind of start to Marshall's Giants career, which as of right now is best remembered for a costly drop deep down the right sideline that could\u2019ve changed the game against the Detroit Lions . Instead, it ended it. Two plays later, Detroit returned a punt for a touchdown, and the contest was out of reach. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to put a complete game together. All I can do is find a way to get better.\u201d \nMarshall has 12 weeks for redemption. He doesn't have nearly that much time to get it right with the Giants still winless and in desperate need of a bigger contribution. They're tied for 30th in the NFL, averaging 15.0 points per game. \nMarshall and the football need to quickly make amends. That fight needs to end now. The Giants need more from their top offseason acquisition.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brandon marshall", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben mcadoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vernon hargreaves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odell beckham jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eli manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcadoo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "giants", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tampa bay buccaneers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall's giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:26:32.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c6ba6b2a389bf875146fcbf3256d7e05f451e152", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4jQzK_31Y8.Q4419HqyHxU0Y2NWM0O5IwQ8nI9RmCmUSPLoVLyuo.RwH3wqpFNR.pUup6lrDPFOMvwn5A02wmp_wFWosWZu_o", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=nflnation", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - NFL Nation", "title": "Jets' formula: Different roster, new personality, better chemistry", "title_full": "Jets' formula: Different roster, new personality, better chemistry", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0924%2Fr263302_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c6ba6b2a389bf875146fcbf3256d7e05f451e152", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4jQzK_31Y8.Q4419HqyHxU0Y2NWM0O5IwQ8nI9RmCmUSPLoVLyuo.RwH3wqpFNR.pUup6lrDPFOMvwn5A02wmp_wFWosWZu_o", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jets' formula: Different roster, new personality, better chemistry", "text": "comment \nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- The smart folks at ESPN Stats & Information can research a statistic for every conceivable scenario, but not everything about football can be quantified with numbers. They can't rate a team's chemistry (at least I don't think they can). It's the ultimate X factor, part of what makes sports fun. \nSo, no, I don't have any hard evidence on the subject; you'll have to take my word for it when I say the New York Jets have better team chemistry than last season. This is a more together group than the fractured group from 2016 that tapped out at the first sign of adversity. The seminal moment was the Brandon Marshall - Sheldon Richardson confrontation in Week 3, which created a toxic environment for the remainder of the season. \nGive credit to general manager Mike Maccagnan and coach Todd Bowles for cleaning up the mess. Applying the addition-by-subtraction philosophy to many of their offseason moves, they cleansed the locker room of the \"me\" guys and set-in-their-ways veterans. Some decisions were based on economics, but the vast majority were football/attitude moves. Josh McCown, the one veteran added to the Jets' young roster, has emerged as a leader -- a camp counselor, in essence. Rich Schultz/Getty Images \nFour weeks into the season, there's not one player you wish they had back. It's a long year and things can change, but you can't second-guess them for any of the pink slips. \nMarshall and Eric Decker are averaging less than 10 yards per catch for the New York Giants and Tennessee Titans , respectively. Richardson still is looking for his first sack with the Seattle Seahawks . David Harris was inactive last Sunday and has played only seven defensive snaps for the New England Patriots . \nRyan Fitzpatrick and Geno Smith are backups for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Giants, respectively.

A significant upgrade at left tackle : Perhaps no team improved at one position more than the Rams did at one of the game's most important spots. They replaced Greg Robinson , one of the game's worst left tackles, with Andrew Whitworth , one of the game's best. They guaranteed $15 million to a 35-year-old offensive lineman, but it was worth it. \nWhitworth has allowed one pressure through his first four games, according to Pro Football Focus. His presence at left tackle, not to mention his willingness to mentor others, has made the entire offensive line better. Jared Goff has taken only four sacks in four games after taking 26 of them in seven games last season. Gurley is averaging 4.2 yards per carry after averaging 3.2 yards per carry last season. John Sullivan has also been a nice addition at center. \n3. Gurley got better : Yes, Gurley was victimized by a bad offensive line and a nonthreatening passing attack that made it easy for defenses to stack the box. But Gurley also missed his fair share of holes. Dating back to training camp, though, Gurley has been hitting holes quickly and decisively. He's running with a lot more confidence , and he has developed into a major threat as a receiver. \nGurley gained only 885 rushing yards last season, the lowest ever by someone with at least 275 carries. He made up for it somewhat by making 43 catches for 327 yards. This season, though, Gurley has hauled in 20 of his 22 targets for 234 yards. He has gained more than 100 yards on the ground in back-to-back games after going 20 straight games without reaching triple-digit rushing yards. And he leads the NFC in scrimmage yards with 596. \n2. Goff got way better : Goff bought in from day one, since the afternoon of Jan. 5, when he studied film with McVay a week before he was hired. When NFL rules kept him from interacting with his new coaches in the winter, Goff ironed out his throwing mechanics at the acclaimed 3DQB. In the spring, he basically lived at the facility, studying the new playbook and familiarizing himself with new teammates. \nSo far this season, Goff has done nothing but make sound decisions and execute precise throws. He leads the NFL with 9.2 yards per attempt and has a 61.5 Total QBR, eighth-highest in the NFL through the first four weeks. Goff has seven touchdowns, two more than he had all of the previous season, and only one interception. His quarterback rating is 112.2, nearly double the 63.6 mark from his rookie season. \n1. McVay implemented a great system : McVay has made the game a lot easier for Goff and has designed creative ways to get Gurley touches, whether it's creating the threat of a jet sweep with Austin or drawing up deceiving wheel routes or setting up screens off play fakes. The biggest key, in the words of McVay, are \"plays that start out the same but are different.\" \nA key staple of that is bunch formations that have receivers lining up tight with the offensive line, with an ability to run an assortment of passing and running plays off that. Because of that, play-action has been very effective as well.

He was rated as the eighth-best cornerback in the NFL by Pro Football Focus in Week 3 and the fifth-best in Week 4 (when he and Lattimore both ranked in the top five). \n\u201cI was proud of him,\u201d Payton said of the 6-foot-1, 180-pound Crawley. \u201cHe played very well. He\u2019s done a real good job. From Year 1 to Year 2 ... we\u2019ve seen him in training camp, you\u2019ve seen him really locate the ball.\u201d \nCrawley said he feels like he has matured a lot from his rookie year, when he was admittedly adjusting to zone coverages after playing mostly man coverage in college. \nAnd he said it was tough to be inactive the first two weeks. \n\u201cBut I was visualizing me being out there and making plays and just being on the sideline, helping my teammates out and telling \u2018em what to see,\" Crawley said. \u201cIt was motivation for me when I come back out there to just show \u2018em what I got.\u201d \nCrawley insisted that neither he nor the rest of the Saints\u2019 defense will get complacent after two good weeks that followed two awful ones. The Saints allowed a combined 793 passing yards and six passing touchdowns to quarterbacks Sam Bradford and Tom Brady in the first two weeks. \n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I just can\u2019t get happy off these first two. Our goal is the Super Bowl, playoffs. So we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do,\u201d said Crawley, who said he thinks the defense lost focus in the first two games after playing so well in the preseason. \u201cI feel like we were kind of getting too hyped up about preseason, about how we shut out a lot of teams and (made) progress from years back. We just lost track. But I feel like now we\u2019re getting somewhere. \n\u201cWe took the first step last week. This was the second step.

Didn\u2019t I tell you we\u2019d bounce (back)? I told you,\u201d Vaccaro said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t on our details. And we just got back to the basics, our fundamentals.

He had been on the practice squad of the Carolina Panthers as recently as a week before his NFL debut. He was looking forward to having the players' normal day off last Tuesday, but his phone rang, and his plans changed. \nIt was his agent telling him to get on the plane to Kansas City. \nHe had a few days to work with holder Dustin Colquitt and snapper James Winchester and introduce himself to his new teammates, though all of the introductions weren't finished before Monday's game. \n\"It was awesome,\" Butker said. \"What a way to start -- Monday Night Football.\" \nHe missed his first field goal try, from 46 yards near the end of the first half.

I wouldn't say I was nervous. I would say excited. It was a fun environment to play in. \n\"I didn't have butterflies. I felt confident ... I felt pretty calm.

Later that season, he hit a 53-yard kick to send a game against Georgia into overtime. \nBut he has nothing to match what he did Monday night. He made the final kick twice, the first time moments after Washington called timeout to try to disrupt his timing. \nNo matter. Butker came through in the clutch for a second time, and in doing so, he made the Chiefs look good for summoning him as the replacement for Santos. \n\"He's got a good head on his shoulders,\" Winchester said. \"He'll keep this up.

Or will it be Bad Bortles, who has four turnovers and only two touchdown passes in two losses? \nMore of the former, and the Jaguars (2-2) will have a chance to compete in what seems to be a pretty winnable AFC South. More of the latter, and the team could be staring at a seventh consecutive season of double-digit losses and an 11th consecutive season without a winning record. Blake Bortles completed just 15 of 35 passes, with a passer rating of 52.1, in Jacksonville's loss to the Jets. Dennis Schneidler/USA Today Sports \nBut since Bortles can fluctuate from game to game -- and sometimes even within games -- it\u2019s hard for the Jaguars to be consistent on offense. That\u2019s the main reason they aren\u2019t winning. \n\u201cWhen you lose a game, it\u2019s hard to say anyone played well,\u201d coach Doug Marrone said after the Jaguars\u2019 overtime loss to the New York Jets on Sunday. \u201cI think everyone will want to play better, want to get plays back, and want to do those types of things. No different than me. I want to get some calls back and obviously everyone else [does]. So I think when you don\u2019t perform well, you\u2019re going to look back and obviously you want to do a better job than what happened.\u201d \nIt clearly was Bad Bortles at MetLife Stadium. He completed 15 of 35 passes, which marked the second-lowest completion percentage of his career (42.9 percent). His passer rating of 52.1 was the sixth-lowest of his career. \nThat came one week after he posted his second-highest passer rating and threw for four touchdowns in a rout of Baltimore. \nThe Jaguars don\u2019t have top receiver Allen Robinson (torn ACL) and have gotten almost no production out of the tight end position other than Marcedes Lewis\u2019 three TD catches against Baltimore. Opposing defenses are ganging up to stop the run (an NFL-high 48 carries have come against eight or more defenders in the box). That puts a lot of pressure on Bortles to make good decisions, be accurate with the ball and not commit turnovers. \nWhen he does that, the Jaguars can win games. When he doesn\u2019t, their chances drop significantly. \nBortles in the Jaguars\u2019 two victories: 59.6 percent completions, 369 yards, five TDs, no turnovers, no sacks. \nBortles in the Jaguars\u2019 two losses: 50.7 percent completions, 363 yards, two TDs, four turnovers (three INTs), three sacks. \nBortles\u2019 erratic play makes it hard on offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett. The Jaguars spend the week implementing a game plan and going over how Hackett will call the game, but they may have to junk it not because of anything the defense is doing, but because Bad Bortles shows up on Sunday. \nUnfortunately for the Jaguars, there\u2019s not much they can do because Bortles\u2019 Jekyll & Hyde identity is well established at this point in his career. He\u2019ll be making his 50th career start on Sunday in Pittsburgh, and the Jaguars just have to hope Good Bortles shows up at Heinz Field. \nAnd for much of the rest of the season.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blake bortles", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcedes lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug marrone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ake bortles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hackett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bortles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathaniel hackett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jacksonville jaguars", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york jets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metlife stadium", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heinz field", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:26:32.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6f9fd21ddf9da915586f6f1929a12c26992b02f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4rxBAIMZbvQWu5oz6VB7Wdxqk4PZtZ_ko0IkALeSY70kBIqy4bRJOAzbyXY5slUzIO7VwnI1JHpDPXmEDVoJK1QCSoSYoRXZM", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=nflnation", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - NFL Nation", "title": "Mitchell Trubisky can't 'wave fairy dust' and solve Bears' problems", "title_full": "Mitchell Trubisky can't 'wave fairy dust' and solve Bears' problems", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0920%2Fr261491_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6f9fd21ddf9da915586f6f1929a12c26992b02f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4rxBAIMZbvQWu5oz6VB7Wdxqk4PZtZ_ko0IkALeSY70kBIqy4bRJOAzbyXY5slUzIO7VwnI1JHpDPXmEDVoJK1QCSoSYoRXZM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mitchell Trubisky can't 'wave fairy dust' and solve Bears' problems", "text": "Mitchell Trubisky can't 'wave fairy dust' and solve Bears' problems play Can Trubisky improve the Bears' offense? (1:52) \nLouis Riddick and Ryan Clark speak to Mitchell Trubisky's ability to extend and create plays, which should give the Bear's offense hope. (1:52) comment \nLAKE FOREST, Ill. -- New Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky won't fix every problem on offense. Even head coach John Fox admitted as much on Monday night. \n\"He's not going to wave fairy dust on it [and solve all the issues],\" Fox said on his weekly coaches' show on WBBM Newsradio 780. \nFox is smart to somewhat temper expectations for Trubisky, who will be Chicago's first rookie quarterback to start a game since Kyle Orton in 2005. \nIn fact, the last quarterback whose first career start came on Monday Night Football was Colin Kaepernick against the Bears in Week 11 of 2012. \nAnd the last first-year quarterback whose first career start came on Monday Night Football was Shaun King for the Buccaneers in 1999, according to ESPN Stats & Information. King and the Bucs came out with a 24-17 win over the Vikings. \nMaybe Trubisky plays like Kaepernick did against Chicago five seasons ago -- 243 passing yards and two touchdowns -- but don't be shocked if Trubisky doesn't achieve that level of instant success. \nThe Bears have a shortage of weapons on offense. \nTrubisky isn't walking into the same situation Dak Prescott did last season in Dallas. \nSurrounded by one of the league's best offensive lines, wide receiver Dez Bryant , tight end Jason Witten and running back Ezekiel Elliott , Prescott helped the Cowboys win 13 games a rookie. \nThe Bears do have a talented backfield in Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen , but that's basically where the similarities end. \nDeshaun Watson -- picked 10 spots after Trubisky -- is off to an impressive start in Houston, but the Texans are a perennial playoff team. \nDeShone Kizer -- drafted in the second round -- is off to a shaky start in Cleveland because the Browns, much like the Bears, have been perennial cellar-dwellers. \nA rookie quarterback's supporting cast often determines his likelihood of success. \nSince 2015, four quarterbacks taken in the top 2 started as rookies.

His 17 catches through four games are tied for seventh among all tight ends. \nBut Bennett has yet to have the big game the Packers wanted when they gave him a three-year, $21 million deal in free agency this past spring. In fact, Lance Kendricks , the other (and cheaper) free-agent tight end, has the longest pass play from that position this year -- a 51-yarder against the Bengals. Kendricks also caught a 1-yard touchdown in that game. Bennett doesn\u2019t have a scoring play yet. \nIt probably would be a mistake to pass judgement on any of the Packers' skill-position players, because all the injuries along the offensive line have forced McCarthy to significantly alter his game plan and playcalling. The Packers have started a different offensive line combination in each of the first four games, while tackles David Bakhtiari and Bryan Bulaga have been injured. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a long season,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cThe season\u2019s still getting started. For me, I left a couple of plays on the field here and there, but it\u2019s just getting used to and getting acclimated to playing in a game-type situation with Aaron and the team and the flow of things.

If my impact on this week\u2019s game is chipping a lot, I\u2019m going to try to do the best job I can do chipping. If they need me to catch 10 balls, I\u2019m going to try to go catch 10 balls.

Beathard . \n\"No, I wouldn't,\" Shanahan said. \"I look at each game where, I know we're 0-4 and it feels extremely bad when you're 0-4, I've been in that situation in the NFL and it doesn't feel good, but you don't want to lose perspective. So you try to look at each game as it is, and I know we're 0-4 right now, but when you lose a total of three games by eight points -- I know we very easily could be 3-1 -- and you don't want to make drastic changes just for one reason, as there's a lot of things that go into losing games. It's never just one guy, and I try to put all that into thought.\" \nShanahan has taken note of some of Hoyer's struggles, but he's also keeping in mind that Hoyer hasn't gotten much help from pass-catchers not named Pierre Garcon and has also had inconsistent protection upfront, particularly on the interior. The first four games have mostly been a struggle for 49ers quarterback Brian Hoyer. Norm Hall/Getty Images \nNone of which is to say that Shanahan feels like Hoyer is playing as well he can right now, just that it would help Hoyer if he had guys around him helping out. \n\"I think he needs to play better, and I think we need to play better around him,\" Shanahan said. \"It's similar to what I said [Sunday] night, when you have the time and you've got guys open, you need to hit them. And I thought he struggled with that at times last night, which I know he can do better, and he does also, but I also know when he did make some key throws, guys weren't great at catching them for him, either. \n\"I think it's a two-way street. I think it takes everyone, coaches included. We all need to do better, and that's what we've got to do.\" \nHoyer's misfires on Sunday resulted in a 24-of-49 for 234 yards with an interception performance that left the Niners able to muster just five field goals in a game that was there for the taking. \nThe loss to Arizona had to be a bit disheartening for Hoyer after he took a big step forward in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Rams . But through his first four games as the 49ers quarterback, that effort against the Rams has been the outlier, which probably shouldn't be a surprise given Hoyer's journeyman status. \n\u201cObviously, I probably missed a few throws,\" Hoyer said. \"I have to get that figured out and then just keep going.\" \nHoyer is completing 58 percent of his passes for 858 yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions for a passer rating of 67.9 and a QBR of 23.7 this season. Among 32 starters, he ranks 30th in completion percentage, passer rating and yards per attempt and is 31st in total QBR. \nAfter a strong preseason and training camp, it's fair to wonder if Hoyer's confidence has been shaken by the lack of that translating into real games.

I think it's more focused in its details. It's plays that we've covered in practice that have hurt us. We have to be better with our focus and details.

That\u2019s where the Bengals hope Burfict will make a difference this time. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a physical presence in there,\u201d defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said of Burfict. \nThe Bengals aren\u2019t quite ready to say it out loud yet, but the game against the Bills could be a make-or-break week for their season. \nThat\u2019s what Bengals coach Marvin Lewis alluded to in his post-game speech after the Bengals beat the Browns. \n\"Let's get ready for the Buffalo Bills ,\u201d Lewis told his team. \u201cThat could put us... you know where that could put us.\" \nWhere that could put the Bengals is at 2-3 before their bye week. \nThe Bengals, coming off their first win, need this one badly. It would mean they go into their bye week 2-3 before traveling to Pittsburgh to try to chip into the Steelers\u2019 hold on the AFC North. \nBut the Bills, considered to be in a rebuilding year prior to their surprising 3-1 start, aren\u2019t going to make that easy. They\u2019ll come into Cincinnati with the league\u2019s top-scoring defense, allowing only 13.5 points-per-game. \nBuffalo is capable of making the Bengals\u2019 inconsistent offense miserable, and the defense is going to have to pick up the slack. Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther figures he\u2019s got the entire unit clicking at just the right time, and Burfict is just one more addition to his bag of tricks this season. \n\u201cWe've got guys at all three levels of the defense that can play multiple positions because I tell them every week: It's Week 4 and I think every guy on our defense that's been active has played some snaps,\u201d said defensive coordinator Paul Guenther. \u201cSo it's like those video games those guys play, the warrior games they play. You've got a bunch of weapons in your bag so each week it might be a different weapon to knock that opponent down, and it may be more base snaps or more nickel snaps.

You're not alone", "text": "Includes offset, accepted and declined Source: ESPN Stats & Information \nFor the most part, pass-catchers still hold a substantial rule advantage over the defensive players trying to stop them. For every OPI foul this season, officials have called four for defensive pass interference, defensive holding or illegal contact. But as the chart indicates, OPI was once a relatively rare occurrence, called less than five times per week in the NFL. \nIn 2014 , the NFL shifted in an effort to equalize at least parts of the interaction between receivers and defenders. Via a public point of emphasis, teams were warned that officials would focus on contact that receivers initiated at the top of their routes for signs of a push-off -- precisely what Boger appeared to target Sunday. When you add an increase in teams using \"pick plays,\" essentially designed to be legal pass interference, you get a better idea of why OPI numbers doubled between 2013 and 2014 before falling back slightly. \nPick plays have accounted for what was probably an unanticipated portion of this increase. Short, quick throws have grown increasingly popular in an age of poor pass protection and undertrained quarterbacks. Routes designed for one receiver to knock the coverage off another through \"inadvertent\" contact have grown in popularity. \nThe NFL rulebook exempts inadvertent contact, but officials are watching closely for receivers who appear to adjust their direction to ensure contact. They are also trying to strictly enforce another rule that prohibits blocking prior to the pass being thrown 1 yard beyond the line of scrimmage; receivers also can't block while the ball is in the air if they are in the vicinity of the intended receiver. \nOther than those blocking edicts, the published rules for pass interference are the same for offensive and defensive players. The standard for a penalty is on plays where contact \"significantly hinders an eligible player's opportunity to catch the ball.\" In the case of OPI, officials focus on Rule 8, Section 5, Article 2(g), which states that it is illegal for a player to initiate \"contact with an opponent by shoving or pushing off, thus creating separation\" \nIs that what Gronkowski did Sunday? \nWhen you look at the replay, you see his left arm raised and in contact with Kuechly's chest area. But did he push off as he made the cut? To me, that is an entirely subjective question. It's fair to ask how frequently similar contact occurs on a standard NFL passing play. On the Fox broadcast, analyst and Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman said: \"If you're going to call that, we're going to be here all day.\" \nSpeaking Monday morning on WEEI's \"Kirk and Callahan Show,\" Brady said: \"I think [Gronkowski] is doing what he\u2019s got to do to get open; there was such minimal contact.\" \nSome of the answers can be found in history. Gronkowski has long been a target of this point of emphasis, dating back to 2015 when he was called for OPI six times. The Patriots were penalized for it a league-high 12 times that season. \nBoger, meanwhile, has been particularly active on this front. He and his 2016 crew called OPI an NFL-high 14 times, and his 2017 crew ranks second with six. For perspective, consider that while Boger was calling 14 last season, fellow referee Jeff Triplette called one. Referees Bill Vinovich and John Hussey called three apiece. Further context: Boger's 14 OPI calls in 2016 are double what referee Craig Wrolstad has called since the start of the 2015 season. \nIndeed, as we have noted many times before , referee tendencies are real and sometimes carry over from season to season despite the NFL's shuffling of individual crew members. Suffice it to say, the teams whose games Boger is assigned should prepare for a more tightly called game. \n\"Some weeks you get those calls,\" Brady said on WEEI. \"Some weeks you don't.\" \nTo be clear, defensive players have a far greater rule challenge to navigate and are much more likely to be called for a penalty while covering on a pass play. Many of us pay more attention to the plight of offensive players, for fantasy or other reasons, but generally speaking they still have a decided advantage. The NFL, however, appears intent once again on limiting those boundaries.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "luke", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "rob gronkowski", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bill vinovich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luke kuechly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "troy aikman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerome boger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff triplette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vikings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brady", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuechly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig wrolstad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fred kfoury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gronkowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john hussey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hall of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn stats & information", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sportswire espn.com nfc north", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weei", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis star tribune", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina panthers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:43:27.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0ea7bd5a5766c0f82189e10d073e67bd6fda30bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4FXham5t15la9GvuSjN8VJ49JbZEcFd.BH3p5RD8YGRwKbBR0Ep3d5hA78q3DnNLKZBTvFv4Unm7LtoIfPsHu1nCUnadnevVP15CVlCgIPti0yLofUSHltQ--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=nflnation", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - NFL Nation", "title": "Vontaze Burfict's return timely for Bengals with points hard to find vs. Bills", "title_full": "Vontaze Burfict's return timely for Bengals with points hard to find vs. Bills", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0830%2Fr251320_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0ea7bd5a5766c0f82189e10d073e67bd6fda30bc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4FXham5t15la9GvuSjN8VJ49JbZEcFd.BH3p5RD8YGRwKbBR0Ep3d5hA78q3DnNLKZBTvFv4Unm7LtoIfPsHu1nCUnadnevVP15CVlCgIPti0yLofUSHltQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vontaze Burfict's return timely for Bengals with points hard to find vs. Bills", "text": "comment \nCINCINNATI -- When Vontaze Burfict returned after his three-game suspension last season, the expectation was that he would immediately lift the run defense to another level. \nUnfortunately for the Bengals, they ran into Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott -- a red-hot rookie who ran all over Cincinnati for 134 yards and two touchdowns in a 28-14 loss to the Cowboys. \nWith so much resting on this game against the Bills this week, a similar performance by a running back would be a disaster. \nThe Bills don\u2019t have an Elliott-type rookie this year, but they do have LeSean McCoy , and they attempt to run the ball more than anyone in the league. \nWith Jordan Matthews , one of their top receivers, out with an injury for the next few weeks, it\u2019s a good bet they\u2019ll be leaning heavily on the run game again. That\u2019s where the Bengals hope Burfict will make a difference this time. \n\u201cHe\u2019s a physical presence in there,\u201d defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said of Burfict. \nThe Bengals aren\u2019t quite ready to say it out loud yet, but the game against the Bills could be a make-or-break week for their season. \nThat\u2019s what Bengals coach Marvin Lewis alluded to in his post-game speech after the Bengals beat the Browns. \n\"Let's get ready for the Buffalo Bills ,\u201d Lewis told his team. \u201cThat could put us... you know where that could put us.\" \nWhere that could put the Bengals is at 2-3 before their bye week. \nThe Bengals, coming off their first win, need this one badly. It would mean they go into their bye week 2-3 before traveling to Pittsburgh to try to chip into the Steelers\u2019 hold on the AFC North. \nBut the Bills, considered to be in a rebuilding year prior to their surprising 3-1 start, aren\u2019t going to make that easy. They\u2019ll come into Cincinnati with the league\u2019s top-scoring defense, allowing only 13.5 points-per-game. \nBuffalo is capable of making the Bengals\u2019 inconsistent offense miserable, and the defense is going to have to pick up the slack. Defensive coordinator Paul Guenther figures he\u2019s got the entire unit clicking at just the right time, and Burfict is just one more addition to his bag of tricks this season. \n\u201cWe've got guys at all three levels of the defense that can play multiple positions because I tell them every week: It's Week 4 and I think every guy on our defense that's been active has played some snaps,\u201d said defensive coordinator Paul Guenther. \u201cSo it's like those video games those guys play, the warrior games they play. You've got a bunch of weapons in your bag so each week it might be a different weapon to knock that opponent down, and it may be more base snaps or more nickel snaps.

He would benefit from being fed the ball three, four or five times in a row to wear down defenses with his smashmouth approach. \nThat\u2019s when the Carolina Panthers veteran is at his best. \nBut Stewart, 30, doesn\u2019t keep track of carries. \n\u201cI like winning,\u2019\u2019 he said after Carolina's 33-30 victory at New England on Sunday. \u201cAt the end of the day, I trust coaching. That\u2019s kind of been my motto all my life. I trust coaching and the position God puts you in to make things work.\u2019\u2019 Jonathan Stewart's carries have been reduced, but the veteran has managed to make an impact in other ways, including passing on his wisdom to rookie RB Christian McCaffrey. \"He's so selfless. He's willing to do whatever it takes,\" McCaffrey said. Fred Kfoury III/Icon Sportswire \nThat outlook has been a constant in Stewart\u2019s career, and the results speak for themselves. \nIn the fourth quarter against the Patriots, he became Carolina\u2019s all-time leading rusher, surpassing the 6,846 yards DeAngelo Williams had from 2006-14. \nIt happened with little fanfare as quarterback Cam Newton stole the show with four touchdowns, three passing and one rushing. \nStewart had a modest 68 yards rushing on 14 carries to run his career total to 6,868 yards. He played only 28 snaps, 20 fewer than rookie running back Christian McCaffrey because of his ability to play multiple positions. \nThis season, Stewart is averaging only 14.75 carries and 57.5 yards per game. That\u2019s down from the 18.6 carries and 76 yards per game he had in 2015 when he helped the Panthers reach the Super Bowl. \nThat isn\u2019t likely to change with McCaffrey averaging almost eight carries and 7.25 passes thrown his way per game. \nBut Stewart doesn\u2019t complain about his lack of carries now any more than he did during his first seven seasons when he shared the backfield with Williams. Stewart wasn\u2019t the starter most of that time, yet he took advantage of the opportunities he had. \nIn 2009, Stewart and Williams -- then known as \u201cDouble Trouble\u2019\u2019 -- became the first pair of backs on the same team to rush for 1,100 yards in a season. \nStewart got his on 13.8 carries a game, compared to 17 for Williams. \nStewart\u2019s role has been reduced even more this year with the addition of McCaffrey as the Panthers attempt to become more dynamic offensively. \n\u201cHe\u2019s so selfless,\u2019\u2019 McCaffrey said. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes. The best teams have guys like that, where it\u2019s not about their individual success. \n\u201cFor me to come in as a rookie, for him to help me along the way like he has, it speaks highly of him as a player and a person, too.\u2019\u2019 \nStewart simply feels blessed at his age to contribute, particularly after it appeared his career was all but done in 2012 and 2013, when ankle injuries limited him to 15 games over a two-year span. \n\u201cI just thank God for being able to have gone through all the things I\u2019ve gone through as far as injuries and the highs and lows of this team,\u2019\u2019 Stewart said. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet.\u2019\u2019 \nStewart is not done yet. During the offseason, the Panthers signed him to an extension through 2018. He\u2019s still counted on to get that tough third-down or goal-line carry.

He had 412 yards on 94 carries in the Cowboys\u2019 3-1 start a year ago. Through the Cowboys' four games this season, he has 277 yards on 76 carries with the nine-carry, 8-yard performance against the Denver Broncos , greatly skewing the numbers. \nBut looking inside those numbers, there isn\u2019t that much of a difference. \nElliott actually had more negative runs in the first four games last year (eight) than this year (seven). He has 27 carries of 1 yard or fewer this season; he had 26 through the first four games last season. \nIf those are the negative numbers, Elliott must have had more big runs in the first four games last year. He had six carries of 10 yards or more through the first four games in 2016. He has four through the first four games this season. He had three runs of 20 yards or more in the first four games last year. He has two in the first four games this year. \nThere is a difference when it comes to runs of five yards or more. Thirty-five percent of Elliott\u2019s first 94 runs went for five yards or more in the first four games in 2016. This year, 31 percent (24 of 77) have gone for 5 yards or more. \nAgainst the Rams, eight of Elliott\u2019s 27 carries went for one yard or less, but none were worse than minus-one yard. He had seven carries of five yards or more, including three that went for 10 or more yards. \n\u201cIt was one of the better rushing outputs that we had, but again we try to go back and evaluate it play by play, player by player and just keep getting better and better,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThat\u2019s what our focus is.\u201d \nThe Cowboys\u2019 search for consistency has focused attention on the offensive line, where they are breaking in new starters at left guard ( Chaz Green , Jonathan Cooper ) and right tackle (La\u2019el Collins).

One that might haunt him for a few days, or a little longer. But the same play also came oh so close to showing what the Redskins' offense can become now that he's throwing to Josh Doctson more often. \nThe play occurred on a third-and-2 with 57 seconds left in Washington's 29-20 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs . At the time, they trailed by only three points. They had driven down the field, hoping to cap the drive with a touchdown and, perhaps, a win. \nIn the past, the play likely would have been an automatic pass to the other side. The Redskins went with their favored three-by-one alignment, with tight end Jordan Reed singled up wide to the right. Cousins loves throwing to Reed, particularly in a clutch situation. Reed had an outside release and solo coverage with a safety down the middle. He probably could have hit him. \"I just took my chance with Josh [Doctson],\" Kirk Cousins said. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel \nInstead, Cousins turned back to a guy he has just started to click with: Doctson, the second-year pro and 2016 first-round pick. It's not as though they've had been overly productive together, but Doctson is capable of making excellent catches. There was the acrobatic 52-yard touchdown catch against Oakland last week. \nOn Monday, Doctson caught only two passes for 27 yards but one of them was a diving 20-yard grab, the sort of play that results in confidence. \n\"I just took my chance with Josh,\" Cousins said. \nReed was the first look. \n\"We had a double move to Jordan. He actually won, but Kirk thought he was doubled by the safety and he worked Josh,\" Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. \"He made a great opportunity to throw the football for Josh. Josh almost had it. He made an unbelievable effort for the ball.\" \nYes, he did. Doctson turned as he jumped for the ball, grabbed it only to have it squirt free as he hit the ground. Technically, a drop; it would have been a terrific catch. \n\"He has a [vertical] that's out of this world and it showed,\" Redskins corner Josh Norman said. \"His time will come again to make that play and I know he'll make it 110 percent. \u2026 You'll be immortalized. Seriously. You make that play and it's ballgame.\" \nInstead, it's second-guess time for Cousins. \n\"The safety came down low and was just looking to double anyone that came across the middle,\" Cousins said. \"We didn't complete it, but that's where you go back on the plane ride home. You talk about, 'Could I have worked Jordan? Should I have worked Jordan?' Those are the games you play always, whether you win or lose. Certainly, after a tough loss like this you're going to go back and have some hindsight there and look at what you could've done.\" \nThe soothing aspect for Cousins: He goes home to his son, born Friday, making this an emotional weekend. It was nearly a perfect ending. Nearly. \nBut the flip-side is what this could mean for the future. Doctson is starting to flash his talent in the games, after displaying it in practice. What he's starting to do now doesn't surprise a single person at Redskins Park. \nHowever, it has been a tough road for him thus far in Washington because he hasn't done what has been expected, thanks largely to injuries. He hasn't felt like sharing much with the media and, really, who can blame him? Most of what anyone wants to know always boils down to some variation of: How is the latest injury? And are you frustrated with not doing more? So Doctson has been polite, but reticent. \nIf the Redskins' offense is going to do a whole lot, it must get more from Doctson and Terrelle Pryor , who had three catches for 70 yards -- one for a 44-yard score. Doctson, though, is important, so the fact that Cousins looked for him on a pivotal play could be something to watch after the bye week. \nThe Redskins lost and you can't assume to know yet what this game means. They've had a rougher-than-anticipated stretch to open the season. The teams they've played have a combined record of 12-4, yet the Redskins are 2-2. The future will reveal exactly who they are. For now, if they are to build on this loss offensively, it'll have to be off their start and the final drive. Toss out most of the rest in between. \nThat final drive was led by Cousins, showing the poise and confidence he discussed throughout camp. He operated calmly in a tense environment; he kept the ball alive when he scrambled, creating more room to run. Maybe he should have thrown to Reed. Had he done so, maybe the Redskins would have won. \nThe key, now, though, is to keep trying to connect with Doctson. At some point, it's going to be worth it for Washington. If not, the offense just won't go where it must.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kirk cousins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "josh doctson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "josh norman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay gruden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terrelle pryor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doctson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington redskins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "redskins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas city chiefs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doctson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:09:10.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ea2a15a3cf975dc2c3d59cb64ce6ac7b942f55a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbmJB5NeyHG9euOIxew.RmNzU2dpmEHmX1pFqSGmlk1wKgKpy3qGrBQwqJF8Ee2EgZUnhH3k34pbGbKGgiGaqtyc8BgxguQgTzPyFNckq61JmNZKguoW5A_WXbtqJELOl0", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://baetrice.org/feed", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "FINDER TIPS", "title": "Chiefs win in dramatic fashion to stay NFL\u2019s lone unbeaten team \u2013 Kansas City Chiefs Blog", "title_full": "Chiefs win in dramatic fashion to stay NFL\u2019s lone unbeaten team \u2013 Kansas City Chiefs Blog", "published": "2017-10-03T11:05:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://baetrice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/r268244_1296x729_16-9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ea2a15a3cf975dc2c3d59cb64ce6ac7b942f55a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbmJB5NeyHG9euOIxew.RmNzU2dpmEHmX1pFqSGmlk1wKgKpy3qGrBQwqJF8Ee2EgZUnhH3k34pbGbKGgiGaqtyc8BgxguQgTzPyFNckq61JmNZKguoW5A_WXbtqJELOl0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DAVID FLYING", "published": "2017-10-03T11:05:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chiefs win in dramatic fashion to stay NFL\u2019s lone unbeaten team \u2013 Kansas City Chiefs Blog", "text": "Homepage / Fashion / Chiefs win in dramatic fashion to stay NFL's lone unbeaten team - Kansas City Chiefs Blog Chiefs win in dramatic fashion to stay NFL\u2019s lone unbeaten team \u2013 Kansas City Chiefs Blog KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 About 10 minutes into Monday night\u2019s game, the Chiefs looked like they were toast.

Middlesex, stocked with Championship batsmen (although their relegation suggests not as stocked as they imagine) have been unable to offer the openings that Higgins expects to achieve with Gloucestershire. \nHiggins' departure is a big blow for a T20 side that was packed with big names but which failed to gell and did not achieve the expectations generated by the arrival of Dan Vettori as a specialist T20 coach - Middlesex being one of only two English counties to go down that route. \nAngus Fraser, Middlesex's director of cricket, suggested that the county could not give Higgins the guarantees about regular cricket that he wanted, an echo - if a gentle one - of Surrey's inability to keep Dom Sibley earlier in the summer. \nSibley joined Warwickshire with Alec Stewart, Surrey's director of cricket, not disguising his irritation at Sibley's seeking of a promise that he would bat top-order in all formats. \nFraser was more measured in his comments. \"It is obviously disappointing to lose a young cricketer who has come through your system that you would like to keep at the club,\" he said. \n\"In the past couple of years Ryan has shown glimpses of the cricketer he could become and he was very much part of our plans moving forward. What we couldn't do was guarantee Ryan the batting positions he wanted. \n\"Everybody at Middlesex wishes Ryan well at his new club and we look forward to playing against him in 2018.\" \nA county season now played in blocks has added to the frustrations of players not chosen across all formats. T20 specialists are limited to a two-month season whilst players used only in the Championship figure only at the beginning and end of the season and sit idle in midsummer when cricket is at its most attractive. \nSuch practical considerations are limiting the extent in which counties can field two specialised sides as well as contributing to a quickening transfer market with mid-season moves much more common. \nNo wonder that the ECB is currently looking into whether current levels of compensation to counties who commit heavily to producing players and then see them move on before they have provided many benefits in return are outdated and inadequate. \nNow 22, Higgins burst onto the scene in 2014 with an outstanding unbeaten 44 in his senior debut to help Middlesex to victory in their first NatWest T20 Blast victory that season. \nGloucestershire will keenly anticipate Higgins' arrival after feeling his potential in the opening match of the Cheltenham Cricket Festival.In front of a sold-out NatWest T20 Blast crowd, Higgins was the star man hitting a magnificent 68 off 28 balls, including six sixes, to salvage an unlikely tie. \nGloucestershire head coach Richard Dawson said: \"He has a lot of potential in all formats of the game and has already shown that he is a very dangerous T20 and one-day player.\" \nHiggins said: \"I'm really excited to be joining Gloucestershire. I enjoyed working with Richard Dawson during my time with the England Under-19's and am aware of the young talent within the squad he has put together. \n\"I am keen to continue with the development of my game in the next few years with a special emphasis on my red ball batting. The key though, of course, is to contribute to team success which I am confident can be achieved.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan higgins", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "higgins", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "gett", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "dan vettori", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alec stewart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard dawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus fraser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sibley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fraser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dom sibley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "middlesex", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlesex for gloucestershire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gloucestershire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "surrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warwickshire", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlesex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:24:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85918f9b417aa6d9c9b8e533e995e6d9e23130d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4KL3sBTKxjqS2lMHpEMvfn0qS6J8BT6bWcep3VielgKfqfwdDkAmykTIzfiRiNqqkDRI8QHLx3wsSoWQdOXMSCw--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=nflnation", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - NFL Nation", "title": "After 'good start,' Falcons ready for second quarter of season", "title_full": "After 'good start,' Falcons ready for second quarter of season", "published": "2017-10-03T16:20:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0917%2Fr260204_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85918f9b417aa6d9c9b8e533e995e6d9e23130d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbn5PPejvK5QDn03jtBl04qA0EYBrYxbf4KL3sBTKxjqS2lMHpEMvfn0qS6J8BT6bWcep3VielgKfqfwdDkAmykTIzfiRiNqqkDRI8QHLx3wsSoWQdOXMSCw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:20:00.000+03:00", "title": "After 'good start,' Falcons ready for second quarter of season", "text": "comment \nFLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- Center Alex Mack paused when asked to reflect on how his 3-1 Atlanta Falcons fared through the first quarter of the season. \n\"It's a good start,\" Mack said. \"You want to win all the games at home, so coming off this loss (at home to Buffalo) is not what you want. Sucks to have that sad feeling all bye week. I think we can turn that into the positive. Every team is hard, and it's going to be a battle every week. With that knowledge going into the last three quarters of the season, it's going to be a grind every day, every week.\" \nThe Falcons and Carolina Panthers both stand at 3-1 in the NFC South. After this week's bye, the Falcons continue a three-game stretch against AFC East opponents following their loss to Buffalo with games against Miami (1-2), New England (2-2) and the New York Jets (2-2), the latter two on the road. Then division play starts with a Nov. 5 meeting with the Panthers in Charlotte, and coach Dan Quinn always emphasizes winning the division first. \n\"It's in the mind, and it's important that you need to win the division,\" Mack said. \"It's a very real thing. But really, it's about winning each week. You can't control what other teams do. You can't control how everything else shakes out. If you play the best of your ability and you take care of each game each week, you'll put yourself in the best position.\" \nThe Falcons certainly have some issues to fix once they return from the week off. Here's a look back at how they fared in all areas through the first quarter of the season. \nOffense: The Falcons averaged a league-best 33.8 points per game a year ago and are currently sixth at 26 points per game while going 8 for 13 in the red zone. Devonta Freeman sits third in the NFL with five touchdowns, Tevin Coleman ranks third at 6.3 yards per rush and the Falcons average a league-best 6.69 yards per play. Although reigning MVP Matt Ryan ranks in the top 5 at 8.2 yards per pass play, he has five interceptions to go with five touchdowns and has a passer rating of 87.5 -- 22nd among quarterbacks. On passes thrown 20-plus yards down the field, Ryan is 3 of 15 for 161 yards with a touchdown, an interception and a passer rating of 66.3. Julio Jones , though leading the team with 19 catches for 295 yards, doesn't have a touchdown. He is currently banged up along with Mohamed Sanu . Eleven Falcons have receptions, and nine have at least three or more. The Falcons are 13th in sacks allowed per pass attempt, which could be worse considering starting right tackle Ryan Schraeder (concussion) missed the past two games. After four games, Falcons running back Devonta Freeman sits third in the NFL with five touchdowns. AP Photo/David Goldman \nQuinn talked about the positives as well as areas in need of improvement with new offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian. \n\"The part that I like is the ability to utilize guys in different ways,\" Quinn said of Sarkisian. \"I\u2019ve loved seeing the packages where we\u2019ve featured both Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman together, creating opportunities for guys in space to make plays. I\u2019ve been encouraged that we\u2019ve been a really committed running game. \n\"For sure we want to improve on our chances when we can take some shots down the field. Sometimes that comes with a little more time, but to be at our best, that\u2019s where some of the explosive plays happen on some of the play-action plays, so I think that part can come, but I have been impressed by his utilization of the guys.\" \nDefense: The Falcons, without reigning NFL sack champ Vic Beasley Jr . (hamstring) the past two games, are tied for third in the NFL with 12 sacks, led by Brooks Reed with three. They ranked 13th in total defense in allowing 318.3 yards per game, down from last year's average of 371.2. Opposing teams are scoring 22.3 points per game against the Falcons, though offensive turnovers have contributed to that total. The defense has created just two turnovers, part of the reason they rank 28th in the league in turnover ratio at minus-4, with those five interceptions and a fumble lost on offense. The Falcons are tied for fourth in goal-to-goal defense and tied for 15th in red zone defense. Missed tackles have been an issue, with rookie linebacker Duke Riley being a primary culprit. But Quinn said Riley is on the same missed-tackle pace that Deion Jones had at the start of last season before finishing third in the Defensive Rookie of the Year voting. Jones leads the team with 27 combined tackles, followed by Brian Poole and Keanu Neal with 24 each. \nQuinn assessed new defensive coordinator Marquand Manuel, who installed some new red zone defensive coverages this season. \n\"Man, I\u2019ve been impressed by him in game,\" Quinn said of Manuel. \"He\u2019s really clear-headed. The calls are in quickly, and here\u2019s why I called it. Sometimes we\u2019ll talk in between a series and he\u2019s able to have good recall on what happened and here\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do based on that. I\u2019ve been impressed by that so far.\" \nSpecial teams: Kicker Matt Bryant is 9 for 9 on field goals, with a long of 53 yards, and is 11 for 11 on extra points.

Wall-thumb? Am I saying that right?\" Kyrie Irving wondered.\nTwice during his first week on the job with the Boston Celtics , Irving has stopped news conferences to ask reporters how to properly say the name of the Boston suburb that hosts the team's practice facility. For the record, the town of Waltham is pronounced \"Wall-tham,\" though history suggests that has more to do with New England accents than the original intent.\nNevertheless, this is the sort of thing that weighs heavily on Irving's mind right now. This is a man who has repeatedly explained his decision to request a trade from the Cleveland Cavaliers by suggesting that he wants to \"perfect his craft\" and he is likewise obsessed with adapting to his new surroundings.\nBeyond pronunciations, Irving is still trying to settle into his new home. He playfully detailed the frustration of trying to furnish his new place, and the challenge of picking the right paint colors. He'd also like to find some good restaurants where he might be able to blend into the scenery, as unlikely as that seems as the new face of the Celtics franchise.\nYes, there's plenty to work through here, both on and off the court, and yet one thing has been consistent with Irving since he first came to Boston last month for an introductory news conference: his smile. It's ever-present. He smiles throughout interview sessions, he smiles at the notion of what the Celtics might become. He smiles even after putting unleaded gas into the new diesel-craving engine of his beloved Jeep that broke down on his way to his first Celtics practice .\nA bunch of Bentley University students were willing to help Irving fix his car, in the rain no less. Instead, Irving called his new employer to say that (1) he was going to be a little late for a meeting with coach Brad Stevens and (2) ask if someone could come fetch him. Sure, he was told, the Celtics would send equipment manager John Connor to get him. But where was Irving?\n\"Wall-tham? Wall-thumb?\" said Irving. \"Am I saying that right?\"\nKyrie Irving has been smiling often since landing in Boston. Winslow Townson/USA TODAY Sports Al Horford is a four-time All-Star and a veteran entering his 11th NBA season; which is to say, it's hard to impress him on a basketball court. And yet, Horford stood transfixed on the sideline at Boston's practice facility last month while watching Irving go through his first on-court workout with the team.\n\"I was just blown away,\" Horford said. \"I've played against him over the years. You see him on the court, you see some of the moves, you're impressed like, yeah, he's an All-Star player. He's a really good player. But when you see him work at what he does in practice and how easy he's able to score the ball and handle it and do certain things, it just really blew my mind.\n\"I don't think people really understand how good a player he is. He's gonna showcase that this year. He needs time to get acclimated and to catch up to speed with everything we have. His ability is unreal. I'm very intrigued to see how the season's gonna develop. He's gonna be great for us.\"\nHorford admitted it was jarring to watch as the Celtics overhauled the roster of a 53-win team this summer. And just as he was coming to grips with the initial batch of changes, Celtics president of basketball operations Danny Ainge traded Isaiah Thomas , Jae Crowder , Ante Zizic and a couple of future draft picks (including the Brooklyn Nets' unprotected 2018 first-round pick) to the Cavaliers in exchange for Irving.\nBoston brought back just four players overall. Even after adding the All-Star talents of Gordon Hayward and Irving, Horford needed to digest the overhaul. Horford knew how good Irving was -- heck, he played a huge role in ending Boston's season in May -- but they also had given up a lot to obtain Irving.\nHorford's excitement spiked when he got to watch Irving up close. Now, Horford is certain Irving is going to take his game to another level with the Celtics this season.\n\"I just think that, playing with LeBron, Kyrie probably couldn't be everything that he possibly could be,\" Horford said. \"Just because LeBron is such a great player that he just kinda -- Kyrie could have a great game and everybody focuses on LeBron because he had a triple-double and he was awesome.\n\"I just think now, Kyrie will be in a position where people will see him and it's going to be like, 'This guy is elite .' That's what I sense with him.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kyrie irving", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gordon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaylen brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordon hayward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "horford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny ainge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isaiah thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ante zizic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry] rozier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kyrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al horford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jae crowder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayward", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles krupa/ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad stevens", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "espn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cleveland cavaliers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cavaliers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "celtics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn nets", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waltham", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:41:24.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "992e0c12a50d4b03ee5b951202f17d4c5fc9d4c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeM5WWaUJckE45zS.oXUdxeOK4fSV2asEuVepIOO6G6xYEL3uIVCOgOUUBeb5_1o8aK7nv8gT6tSLzrHu9xK0m0UTqaHAF9OJLRCHL289Y4L6DdsjPuushKo-", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/rpm/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Haas hopes to be compensated for $750,000 drain-cover-crash damage", "title_full": "Haas hopes to be compensated for $750,000 drain-cover-crash damage", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0929%2Fr266369_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "992e0c12a50d4b03ee5b951202f17d4c5fc9d4c0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeM5WWaUJckE45zS.oXUdxeOK4fSV2asEuVepIOO6G6xYEL3uIVCOgOUUBeb5_1o8aK7nv8gT6tSLzrHu9xK0m0UTqaHAF9OJLRCHL289Y4L6DdsjPuushKo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Nate Saunders", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Haas hopes to be compensated for $750,000 drain-cover-crash damage", "text": "Haas hopes to be compensated for $750,000 drain-cover-crash damage play Social story of the Malaysian Grand Prix (1:47) \nCheck out all of the social media reaction surrounding the Malaysian Grand Prix. (1:47) \u2022 Previously worked in rugby union and British Superbikes \u2022 History graduate from Reading University \u2022 Joined ESPNF1 in February 2014 comment \nHaas is hoping to be financially compensated for the estimated $750,000 (\u00a3500,000) worth of damage to Romain Grosjean's car caused by a faulty drain system during the Malaysian Grand Prix weekend. \nGrosjean was pitched into a scary spin and a heavy collision with a barrier when his car hit a cover which had come loose when other cars had passed by earlier. The incident prompted the FIA to re-weld the drain in question and conduct checks on the remaining installations around the circuit. \nThe crash left the Haas car with extensive damage and, given the circumstances, the team was allowed to break overnight curfew to carry out repairs as the events were \"entirely and clearly beyond the control of the driver and the competitor\". That allowed Haas to get the car out for FP3 on Saturday and the car completed the weekend. \nThe issue was even raised in the Friday evening drivers' briefing, snippets of which were filmed and uploaded to F1's official website. In it, championship leader Lewis Hamilton asks FIA race director Charlie Whiting who is expected to foot the bill in a situation where neither team nor driver was at fault, pointing out that the American team is on the lower end of the F1 budget scale. Rubio/Sutton Images \nThough it is currently unclear who would pay any bill, Haas has made enquiries of its own. \nWhen asked during his post-race media session if the team had raised the issue of compensation to the FIA, team boss Guenther Steiner replied: \"Oh yeah absolutely, you have to. \n\"It was completely out of our hands. I cannot say 'OK we now let three quarters of a million go because somebody forgot to weld something in', it's all good. We pay a fee to come here and it's like, guys [come on]....\" \n\"We discuss it, they were very professional about it. They have insurance so let's see what we can do.\" \nA spokesman told ESPN the $750,000 quoted by Steiner is a rough \"ballpark\" figure and that the team won't know the total overall cost for a while.

Despite enjoying a recent run of three consecutive victories, Hamilton fears his team could fall behind next season if it cannot solve the faults with its car. \n\"We've done an exceptional job with what we have,\" Hamilton said. \"There are some really big problems which I can't really explain to you. But we really need to make sure we rectify them for next year's cars if we really want to fight both Ferrari and Red Bull when they step up their game. Lewis Hamilton extended his championship lead over Sebastian Vettel to 34 points in Malaysia. Sutton Images \n\"There is a lot of work for us to do -- but there's nothing we can do, it's the way the car is. People have been saying all year long that we've got the best car. It's a fact at some races that the car has turned out to be better but overall, globally, I think it's worked out that we haven't.\" \nThe upcoming Japanese Grand Prix at the power-hungry Suzuka Circuit should suit Mercedes' 2017 challenger and could go a long way in easing some of the reigning world champions' worries about being beaten to the title by Vettel's Ferrari. However, Hamilton is taking nothing for granted in the remaining five rounds. \n\"Suzuka is a much cooler circuit generally and the corners are a little bit different to what we experienced here, and we'll be on a different aero package as well so we should be better there,\" he explained. \"But Mexico where it's full downforce will be a place of concern and we will probably struggle there, but there's not a massive amount of corners so maybe we will be OK. \n\"I think that's the only one -- this one and Mexico -- that has the high downforce and the others I'm hoping will be more similar to Spa and Silverstone.

PETER KOHALMI/AFP/Getty Images Kubica recently joined forces with reigning world champion and former Williams driver Nico Rosberg -- who set off the initial 2017 driver market chain reaction by retiring days after winning his maiden title -- in a managerial-based tie-up to boost his chances of an F1 return.\nMassa is open to extending his four-year stint at the team into a fifth season, with Williams grateful the Brazilian reversed his decision to retire at the end of 2016 to return as Mercedes-bound Valtteri Bottas' replacement.\nDi Resta recently acted as a last-minute replacement for Massa when he fell ill during the Hungarian Grand Prix and impressed to put himself in contention for a drive next year. The Scot, who had not raced in F1 since 2013, qualified just 0.7s behind Stroll despite having never driven Williams' 2017 challenger before qualifying.\nAt last weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix, Toto Wolff suggested that Mercedes junior Pascal Wehrlein is also in the frame with his options for 2018 becoming increasingly limited following Ferrari's renewed engine deal with Sauber.\nHowever, such a move for the 22-year-old appears unlikely, as Williams requires one of its drivers to be over the age of 25 as part of its agreement with title sponsor and alcohol brand Martini.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0729%2Fr237489_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375,", "http://facebook.com/dialog/send?link=http://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/20902598&next=http://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/20902598&app_id=116656161708917", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Ff1%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F20902598&app_id=116656161708917", "http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?lang=en&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Ff1%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F20902598&text=Williams%20to%20assess%20Kubica,%20di%20Resta%20over%202018", "https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Ff1%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F20902598%2Fwilliams%2Dgive%2Dkubica%2Ddi%2Dresta%2Dtest%2Ddays%2D2018%2Df1%2Dseat&description=Williams+to+give+Kubica%2C+di+Resta+test+days+over+2018+F1+seat&media=http%3A%2F%2Fa.espncdn.com%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1003%2Fr268403_1296x729_16-9.jpg", "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0729%2Fr237489_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570,", "http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/opinion/f1/exclusive-kubica-and-di-resta-contest-williams-seat", "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0729%2Fr237489_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40", "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0729%2Fr237489_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40", "http://espn.go.com/espn/print?id=20902598"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lewis larkam robert kubica", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "kubica", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "lance stroll", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlos sainz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nico rosberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "felipe massa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul di resta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valtteri bottas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pascal wehrlein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toto wolff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jolyon palmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter kohalmi/afp/getty images kubica", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "paul di resta", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renault", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sauber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "resta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "di resta", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hungaroring", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silverstone", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:53:38.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e254f4a7e0663d2923b9c4b82f43fa845886c94d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeM5WWaUJckE45zS.oXUdxeO0p4O0Qh4mEHRFf8wWrTkxCupdo5vjJ.XeDngxkOTETcBv8m7iSbWXAe5lHuTd8iEAY1yboZiG0iqynR0lwpNL", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/rpm/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Jos Verstappen -

He really needs it. I mean it was tough, this year for him was really tough.\n\"He had a lot of things to learn of course and I think this is the result when you never give up, keep motivated and keep concentrated, and that's what he does.\"\nMax Verstappen is the youngest-ever driver to win a Formula One grand prix. Lars Baron/Getty Images Red Bull was able to capitalise on engine issues which all-but ended Ferrari's chances of challenging for the win, with Sebastian Vettel starting last and Kimi Raikkonen unable to take the start after encountering a turbo failure on his way to the grid.\nVerstappen took full advantage of Ferrari's misfortune by settling into second place, before passing pole-sitter Hamilton on lap four, an overtake which impressed his father.\n\"You could see in the first two laps, he could stay with Lewis [Hamilton], you could see that we had the grip,\" Jos said. \"He did a nice move on him I think, a proper one. Of course Lewis is fighting for the championship as well, we all know that.\n\"But he did it in a nice way and the car looked a bit stronger than the Mercedes. Lap times were consistent and he was controlling the pace, so he did a really did a good job.\"\nJos reckons his son's commanding performance proves to any doubters that he is ready to win world championships.\n\"You need the equipment to show it, but he knows what he can do and I think more people know also inside the team and this is good. It is also very good for the team, they never give up, they keep developing and this is the result of everybody as well in the factory at home.

This is the hardball testament of me -- \"Grady Little\" -- who bears no relation to any actual manager who might have carried that name and/or faced just such a situation.\nNational League Los Angeles Dodgers : Clayton Kershaw\nIt takes an awfully special pitcher to edge Kenley Jansen , who might turn out to be the best closer of all time (at least in the non-Rivera division). The real question here is whether for one hitter, you think that Kershaw would be able to dial up the dominance to a higher level than what Jansen brings night after night after night.\nI think so. According to FanGraphs , which I leaned on heavily for this piece, Kershaw's slider carries about the same value as Jansen's famous cut fastball, both in total and on a per-unit basis. However, as a starter, Kershaw has more tools with which to carve up hitters.\nBoth pitchers are consistent and both have exceptional command, the latter a must-have for these spots. Finally, in terms of FanGraphs' clutch rating, which measures high-leverage pitching, Kershaw has outperformed Jansen over the last couple of years. If there were fewer than two outs in our scenario, you might be tempted to go with Jansen because of his higher strikeout rate. Might.\nLet's face it, the answer to almost any question of which pitcher you'd want in which hypothetical situation is going to be Clayton Kershaw.\nWashington Nationals : Max Scherzer\nThis was a tough pick and the quandary I refer to probably isn't the one that leaps to your mind. You're thinking Scherzer or Stephen Strasburg , right? Sure, that had to be considered and was. But my final choice came down to Scherzer or Sean Doolittle , and not just because of a surname-related form of nepotism.\nThere's a good argument to be made for Doolittle. His strikeout rate is in the same vicinity as Scherzer's and Strasburg's, but his walk rate is better. If you like K%-BB% as a proxy for dominance -- and I do -- Doolittle comes closest to Scherzer on the Nationals staff. They are also in a dead heat by the aforementioned clutch rate.\nThe deciding factor for me was that if you're asking Scherzer to just get one big out, his already fierce stuff is going play up that much more. You just hope his wicked movement doesn't take him out of the strike zone. But I don't worry about Scherzer becoming over-adrenalized. He's kind of like that all the time.\nChicago Cubs : Wade Davis\nWhat you really want is the 2015 version of Jake Arrieta , or at least the Jon Lester we've grown accustomed to over the years. Recency has to play into this though -- we're talking about this postseason, not a generic one. Arrieta's sore hammy is a concern and Lester's recent results have been worrisome as well, which is why Kyle Hendricks might end up starting Chicago's first playoff game.\nHendricks might be my favorite pitcher in the game right now, but he's too hittable for the spots we're describing. Hittable might not be the right term, but even soft contact is contact. I want a bat-misser. Carl Edwards Jr . has the filthiest stuff on the Cubs' staff, but he walks too many guys.\nThat leaves us with Davis, who is sort of the best of all worlds. He's implacable and owns a good track record of getting outs in the highest of high-leverage spots. That said, Davis isn't as purely dominant as Lester when the latter is right; if Lester hadn't been up and down lately, he'd be my pick.\nArizona Diamondbacks : Zack Greinke\nAgain, while Greinke is the Diamondbacks' ace and is paid like it, this wasn't an immediate, clear-cut choice. Robbie Ray and Archie Bradley merit close consideration as well. As with much of the Arizona staff, you have to give a little extra weight to 2017, while with most teams I looked at 2016 numbers as well. With the D-Backs, Greinke, Ray and Bradley are only three of a number of pitchers who have looked like different guys this season. In a good way.\nBradley was the first eliminated. His track record isn't as long as the other two and his high-leverage numbers aren't as great as you might expect. Ray has the elite strikeout rate, but Greinke and Bradley aren't too far off his mark. Greinke's pinpoint command is ultimately the deciding factor for me.\nGreinke's high-leverage indicators this season are based on a relatively small sample size. But for his career, Greinke's .279 wOBA allowed in clutch spots suggests a guy who can dial it up when he needs to. When in doubt, go with the future Hall of Famer.\nColorado Rockies : Pat Neshek\nWait, where is our hypothetical game being played? I don't know, but just to be safe, we'll want someone who is relatively unfazed by Coors Field. That narrows the pool considerably.\nThere aren't a lot of great options, at least in relation to some of the other postseason teams. Greg Holland used to be just the kind of stopper we're looking for, but he nibbles a lot more than he used to and his walk rate shows it. Jon Gray has the best stuff from the rotation and maybe that plays up in a one-batter scenario. It's definitely worth a consideration.\nNeshek gets the nod because of his swing-and-miss ability, long track record of high-leverage relief (though not much as a closer) and his minuscule walk rates. That high-leverage record includes a career .266 wOBA in clutch spots.\nYou do have to waver once the specter of lefty-righty matchups comes into the equation. However, Neshek's .306 career wOBA allowed to lefties is impressive and not as stark as you might think given his side-arming delivery. That said: We're forcing ourselves to go with one pitcher in one key spot. The real answer for Bud Black would depend on who's at the plate and if it's a lefty, Rockies reliever Jake McGee might get the call.\nAmerican League Cleveland Indians : Andrew Miller\nIt's good to be Terry Francona these days. When looking at two-year stats, Francona has four contenders for this spot sporting a K-BB% of 20 percent or better -- Miller (at nearly 37 percent!), Corey Kluber , Cody Allen and Carlos Carrasco . I would be more than satisfied to throw any of that foursome out there in a must-get situation.\nHowever, Miller might be the best option in all of baseball, and I write that knowing about his recent physical problems. Miller is pure dominance, posting a K-rate of nearly 42 percent and a batting average allowed of .152 going back to the beginning of last season. He leads all current Cleveland pitchers in win probability added during that span. He has done all that with teeny-tiny walk rates, so you can trust him to deliver that stuff in the strike zone.\nIf you're looking for that one knockout pitch, Kluber's curveball might be baseball's best current offering. And if you're talking demeanor, he's actually nicknamed Klubot because of his autotronic ways. On most teams, Kluber would be the easy choice. Francona simply can't go wrong.\nMiller is my pick for this reason: Opposing batters have swung at just 56.8 percent of his pitches that hit the strike zone. When they do swing, they make contact on just 80.7 percent of those swings. He just makes guys look bad.\nHouston Astros : Justin Verlander\nThe Astros have some relievers with really impressive K-BB% rates, including Chris Devenski , Will Harris and Ken Giles . Brad Peacock 's new slider would be a tantalizing pick as well.\nLet's face it: it has to be Verlander, especially given how lights-out he has been over the second half of this season. What you especially like is Verlander's ability to crank it up when he needs to, and he always has plenty in reserve. As of yore, he gets stronger the deeper he gets into a game and if he needs that one big out, you know he can reach back and touch triple digits.\nVerlander's clutch rating is easily the best of the current Astros pitchers, including last season. Since he has joined Houston, Verlander has been fine-tuning his little-used changeup. As good as the sliders are for Peacock and Giles, or the changeup is for Devenski, I'll take Verlander's high fastball and live with the results any day of the week.\nBoston Red Sox : Craig Kimbrel\nThis is really not close. Which is an amazing declaration to make for a pitcher wearing the same uniform as Chris Sale . For starters, according to FanGraphs, Kimbrel has produced nearly as much value with his fastball as Sale has with his, in a fraction of the innings.\nSale struck out over 300 batters this season and yet his strikeout percentage (36.2) is dwarfed by Kimbrel's (49.6), and both pitchers walk less than six percent of opposing hitters. If you're scoring at home, that translates to a 44.1 K-BB% for Kimbrel, which is just ridiculous.\nSale can hit triple digits when he goes full-max but even so, he's probably going to be a couple of K's per nine innings shy of Kimbrel. Both are mean-spirited guys in the best way possible. In the real world, maybe it would depend on whether a lefty or righty is at the plate. In a generic context, few, if anyone, can match Kimbrel's combination of dominance and reliability.\nNew York Yankees : Aroldis Chapman\nLots of good choices for Joe Girardi, who would probably be best served to rely on multiseason data to sort out this problem. Chapman has had his moments of sub-dominance this season but has rediscovered it lately. In September, he faced 41 batters, gave up three hits and struck out 17 in 12 innings with only two walks.\nThat makes me feel better about his edge in two-season performance over fellow fire ballers Dellin Betances , Chad Green , Tommy Kahnle and David Robertson . Green, especially, is intriguing. However, there is one additional option: starter Luis Severino .\nSeverino has a 22.9 K-BB% this season, his breakout campaign, and is less likely to walk a hitter than Chapman. Still, what I'd need to see is if Severino could breach the raw stuff gap with his bullpen aces if he was in a max-effort situation. As it is, his fastball reaches into the upper 90s and he matches that with a knock'em-out slider. When he has worked out of the bullpen in the past, that's about where he has been.\nBetances' high walk rate almost certainly rules him out. And Kahnle's track record isn't as long as the other options. You can say the same about Green, but what a track record. In the end, in Chapman, you have a guy who can rear back at throw 102 mph and above throughout an entire key plate appearance and hit the zone while he's doing it. Chapman it is.\nMinnesota Twins : Trevor Hildenberger\nYou kind of have to chuck track record when it comes to the Twins' staff. All the teams above have multiple options when it comes to guys with a K-BB% greater than 20. The Twins have one: Hildenberger, who has also performed well in high-leverage spots.\nJose Berrios would be another option, but his walk rate is twice that of Hildenberger's. Same for Matt Belisle . What you see here is an overachieving pitching staff and a really good argument that Paul Molitor is this year's AL Manager of the Year.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

\nConsider his 52 home runs (most ever by a rookie) and 114 RBIs and 1.049 OPS. His 208 strikeouts (also the most ever by a rookie) and 127 walks. Consider the Home Run Derby, when he hit the Marlins Park roof twice. Consider his 10 home runs in April. And in June. Consider the 37-game strikeout streak, which tied another major-league record, when the story of Aaron Judge's season was being erased and rewritten, when the New Face of Baseball was becoming just another face. And finally, consider his 15 home runs in September, when the playoff-chasing Yankees needed their newest star to step up -- and he did. \nOn the precipice of Tuesday's one-game playoff against the Twins, on the biggest stage of his brief major-league career, Judge -- all 6-foot-7, 282 pounds of him -- has the chance to make history for a team that is both reviled and envied unlike any other in professional sports. And among playoff teams, there is perhaps no offensive player who improves his team's chance to win more than Judge -- which makes no team more desperate to have its star hitting than the New York Yankees . \nThe team is 31-14 on the season when he records a home run and 26-13 when he has two or more hits. During Judge's September resurgence -- when he recorded an inconceivable 1.352 OPS and drove in 32 runs after weeks of playing like one of the game's worst hitters -- his team was 19-8 when he was on the field. \n\"Every at bat Aaron goes up there, he's confident he's going to get a hit,\" says Yankees assistant hitting coach Marcus Thames, who has worked with Judge for three years. \"It doesn't mean a hard swing. It means a solid approach and a good swing. We're not telling him to hit the Bank of America sign. We're saying take your best swing, because if he makes solid contact, what do you think is gonna happen?\" \nOf course, if he doesn't? Judge's game has always been yin and yang, his alpha bomb to his omega K. It's impossible to talk about Judge's prodigious blasts without also mentioning his equally prodigious strikeout totals. This season, he struck out in nearly 31 percent of his plate appearances on his way to leading the majors in K's. As his sub-.200 BA in August reminds us, the rookie is still a work in progress -- his true value won't be determined until more time has passed. But for the Yankees -- who went 25-21 when Judge goes hitless and 6-10 when he fails to get on base at all -- Judge could be the key to their postseason chances, in 2017 and well beyond. \nSo which Aaron Judge is the real one? So far, he appears to be a lot of both. \"He's going to be a dynamic player,\" Thames says. \"[But] you have to take the good with the bad and let this kid understand who he is.\" \nIt's June 10, and the Orioles are in town. Judge has 18 homers and 41 RBIs. He's about to hit four more in the next three days. In the bottom of the first inning, none on, two out, Judge steps into the batter's box digs a size-17 cleat into the faded chalk line and waits. On his second pitch of the night, a center-cut changeup from Baltimore starter Chris Tillman , Judge sweeps his massive left leg forward and plants it in the dirt. It is so quick and fluid, the bat looks like a buggy whip in his hands. The aptly named launch angle off his bat is 24.6 degrees and the ball travels 382 feet, a hooking laser that sneaks fair along the left-field pole and sends fans scattering. The ball's exit velocity is a then-major-league-leading 121.1 mph -- topping the 119.8 mph single he'd hit two days earlier, which topped the 119.4 mph home run he hit in April. \nOver at second base, Orioles All-Star Jonathan Schoop doesn't need to watch the ball to know it's leaving the field. He hears it. Weeks later, months later, he'll still hear it. \"That sound the ball makes off his bat?\" Schoop says of Judge. \"That sounds like a baaad dude.\" In July, Judge was on top of the world. But his incredible start took a turn in August. Steve Mitchell-USA TODAY Sports \nLast year, Judge spent just a month in the majors, where he hit an abysmal .179 with 42 strikeouts in 95 plate appearances. It was the most overmatched Judge had been in his life. He'd flailed at pitches that he had been roping out of the park only a couple months earlier in Triple-A Scranton. He couldn't catch up to the high fastball. On top of that, it was like he'd forgotten his strike zone. Major-league fastballs seemed to have more heat and movement. Curveballs were tighter. Each pitcher knew what he was trying to do, how to attack this big rookie from Northern California. \nNear the end of the season, he met with Thames and Yankees hitting coach Alan Cockrell. With the offseason approaching, he was worried: In 2017 -- a year the Yankees had a real chance to make a push deep into the playoffs -- there wasn't a guarantee Judge would have a starting role on the team, if he even made the team at all. \nBoth Cockrell and Thames told Judge his future as a big-league hitter depended on how he used the lower half of his body when he was in the batter's box. Tall hitters -- especially those predisposed to 500-foot home runs -- are already prone to be loose and long with their swings, bobbling heads and flying legs and arms everywhere. \"The more you try to do big-guy things, that's when you get out of whack and lose your mechanics,\" says Tony Clark, who topped out at 6-foot-7 and hit 251 home runs in a 15-year major league career. Getting Judge's right hip anchored -- the back end of his body for his right-handed swing -- was the key. \nJudge turned his offseason into a massive cram session. While current and former coaches describe him as a sponge who's adept at taking off-the-field instruction and translating it into production on the field, there's no road map for a player Judge's size. Nearly every day, Judge would open YouTube and search for swings. He watched Giancarlo Stanton , Josh Donaldson , Miguel Cabrera , Alex Rodriguez and Barry Bonds -- larger power hitters he admired who used all parts of the field, men he knew who had put in their own serious work. \nHe watched that back hip, the anchor, and worked on shortening his swing, compacting the distance between his bat's movement from anticipation to impact. Judge flew to New York to work with his coaches. He moved off the plate, which allowed him more coverage on strikes on the inside edge while allowing his long arms to grab balls on the outside half and shoot them to the opposite field. \"We were trying to get him to stay on the ball a little better, stay through the baseball a lot longer,\" Thames says. During spring training, Judge noticed he was having better at-bats, getting into 3-1 hitter's counts rather than falling behind 0-2. He posted a 21.7 percent strikeout rate in the spring -- less than half his rate from the previous year. \nHe went back to his phone. This time, Judge opened his notes app. In it, at the very top, he wrote \".179.\" \nJudge hit 10 home runs in April, to go with a .411 on-base average. Through May, he'd hit seven more homers and bumped his OBP to .441. It wasn't just the stats that made everyone take notice. Just like the hitters he'd watched in the offseason, Judge was drilling balls to all parts of the field. Sure, there was a 496-foot homer against Baltimore and a 460-foot blast against the Pirates, but there was also the 119-mph double, the 117.3-mph single, the 117.2-mph out. During a short series in May, Reds first baseman Joey Votto studied Judge, watched how his limbs worked together at the plate. \"There's a quickness and directness to his swing, very Point A to Point B,\" says Votto, one of the preeminent hitters in the game. \"Often times, power's generated with a little more length, but it doesn't seem like Judge has that. It's almost like he should be playing in a ballpark 10 to 20 percent bigger because he's so skilled.\" \nThrough June 12, Judge was hitting .347 with a league-leading 22 home runs and 39 walks. Five of the major's six highest-velocity hits at the time came off Judge's bat in the season's first half. He'd gone 4-for-4 with two homers and a walk in a game against Baltimore; 2-for-3 with two homers and two walks against Toronto. \nIn every way possible, Judge had become baseball's Paul Bunyan, the giant whose on-field exploits were becoming things of legend. Media, fans, teammates wondered what he might do next. Would he become the first Yankee since Roger Maris to hit at least 60 home runs in a season? Could he be the greatest rookie of all time? And this: Might Aaron Judge overtake Mike Trout as baseball's best player? \nFor about 60 seconds, it looks like Aaron Judge might not win the Home Run Derby. His first-round opponent, Marlins first baseman Justin Bour , dropped a first-round-high 22 homers, and Judge has just seven in his first two and a half minutes. Is he nervous? Has the pressure finally caught up to him? With just more than two minutes remaining, he calls time out, wipes his face, catches his breath. He steps into the box. Yankees BP pitcher Danilo Valiente throws. From that moment, there's an ease to Judge's movements, all fast-twitch muscle, a catapult of strength. He sprays the outfield stands. They're foul-pole-to-foul-pole shots. He puts one over the Marlin statue in center field. He smacks one off the concourse floor in left. He shoots one into the right-field seats. He hits the retractable roof 170-feet high with a non-homer to deep left-center, something Marlins Park architects never thought was possible. \nThe rest of the derby is anticlimactic. In the last round, Judge faces gassed slugger Miguel Sano , who hits a disappointing 10 homers then slinks off to the side to make room. Judge's finals-tying shot is so high that it takes nearly eight seconds before landing beyond the center-field wall. After just two more pitches, Valiente raises his hands above his head in victory before No. 11 hits the second deck in right-center. Judge makes his way to his coach as his competitors mob him. \nThe final tally: 47 home runs. Of the eight men in the Derby, Judge is the only one to hit a ball at least 500 feet. He does it four times. In August, Judge hit .185, the victim of an impossibly high .426 first-half BABIP crashing down to earth. Jim McIsaac/Getty Images \nOf course, we know what happened next. That weekend in Miami, Judge was prescient: \"This game will humble you in a heartbeat,\" he said. \"I just try to keep going out there and play my best game every day because I could hit .179 in a couple of weeks.\" \nHe hit .185 in August. \nFor anyone who was looking, there were signs a slowdown was coming. Most obvious was that a first-half BABIP of .426 was impossibly high. Sure, he was rocketing balls all over the field, but he was due for a correction. Still, no one could have predicted how drastic the fall would be. The crash actually began before the Derby. In the final seven games before the break, Judge had 10 hits and three home runs, but he also struck out 13 times in 27 at-bats. When he returned to the Yankees, he was two games into the 37-game strikeout streak that would haunt him for much of the second half. \nOvernight, Judge turned himself from baseball's darling into one of its worst offensive players. Everything he'd done in the offseason seemed to disappear. Opponents used Judge's size against him, using breaking balls low in the zone to get him reaching out (dissipating his power) and turning him into a puddle at the plate. The low reach on breaking balls also made him susceptible to high fastballs, when Judge's bat struggled to catch up. \nIn the batter's box, Judge looked tentative and unsure. A man hardwired to hit balls hard and far, it was as if the link between his brain and his body had suddenly gone haywire. His strikeouts came in bunches, and they felt more than just one out. They'd become rally killers and game-enders. \nThat psychic effect seemed to reach beyond any single at bat. His early success amplified all the failures that followed, twisted his statistics like a fun-house mirror in ways that could make a potential 40-home-run, 120-walk season seem like a failure. It was one thing to slump as a run-of-the-mill rookie. It was entirely different to do it during one of the greatest rookie seasons in baseball history. \nJudge is famous among teammates and coaches for suffering quietly. As a college sophomore at Fresno State, he accidentally brought two left cleats to a game and didn't tell his coaches. (He hit a double and made a diving catch in the outfield.) Before an early September game against the Red Sox, Thames sat in the dugout before batting practice and thought about his hitter. \"He's tough to read,\" the coach admits. \"He's got a big guard up. A big shield. It's sometimes tough to get to know him.\" \nHeading into a Sunday night game against Boston, Judge had homered only twice in his previous 75 at bats (both during Yankees wins) and struck out 32 times. After sitting out a game against the Indians on Aug. 28, Judge was called off the bench in the ninth inning two days later. With two outs and the Yankees down 2-1, Judge struck out. \n\"He wants to be out there every single day, and that's what I love about him,\" Thames says. \"I'm leaning on him. I'm telling him, `You're going to be fine. You're going to scuffle a little but you're going to learn how to make adjustments.' I think he's starting to realize that the experiences he goes through in these at bats can only help him.\" \nThe two had been huddling daily, talking about that night's starting pitcher before moving to hitting mechanics. They talked about all the things that Judge had learned months earlier that had turned him into a one-time MVP favorite -- the anchored hip, the short, direct swing. Thames continued to preach staying on the ball and keeping the bat's barrel in the strike zone a split-second longer. He wanted Judge to remember his zone, to have confidence he could reach any strike and drive it. Day after day, the pair worked together in the Yankees' underground batting cage. They'd talk again in the clubhouse. Thames had split-screen videos prepared that put Judge's recent at bats next to his ones from the season's first half. \"He's got to feel that again,\" Thames says. \"You can show him, but as a hitter, he's got to feel that. So we have to keep working, keep pounding. Feed him positive stuff so he can go out there and win us ball games.\" \nAfter hitting Thames' underhand tosses in the cage before the Boston game, Judge returned to the Yankees' clubhouse and sat quietly at his locker, his back to the reporters who eyed him from the edge of the room. Sweat ran down his forehead. He pulled his pinstripe pants over his long legs, then put on his jersey and his cleats. He placed his Yankees hat atop his head, closed his eyes and rolled his neck. \n\"I'm not going to get too mad or too excited or too anything,\" Judge said before heading to the field for batting practice with the team. \"With every out, I feel like I'm closer to becoming a hotter hitter in my next at bat. I'm one step closer to a home run or a base hit. What I'm going through is part of what it means to be a baseball player.\" \nThat night, by the sixth inning, the Yankees had broken the game open. Starlin Castro laced a bases-loaded double into right field to push the New York lead to 7-1 with two outs. Judge -- 0-for-3 on the night -- strolled from the batter's circle to the box, kicked some dirt at home plate before digging in against reliever Addison Reed . Judge took the first pitch for a ball, then fouled the second into the catcher. He just missed. \nThe third pitch, Judge did not miss. \nFrom the moment the ball was struck, everyone in the stadium knew it was gone. Reed didn't even look back. Left fielder Andrew Benintendi jogged a few steps and stopped. The ball landed 469 feet from home. Cheers rose through the stadium, delirium tinged with a bit of cathartic relief. It was Judge's first home run in 16 games, the longest drought of his major league career. \nBy Sept. 25, he's the old Aaron Judge. The swing, the confidence, all of it, is back. Just a few weeks earlier, there were questions if the guy should be starting. Now, he's an MVP candidate again, one pitch from tying Mark McGwire's rookie record of 49 home runs. The improbability of the year is compounding itself again. \nJudge chomps hard on his gum in the bottom of the third inning with a runner on base, waiting for the full-count pitch. Royals starter Jake Junis delivers the kind of high fastball that would have confounded Judge a month earlier. Instead, he clips this one and drives the ball toward the Judge's Chambers seats in right field. He sprints around the bases as if he can't wait to get back to the dugout and hit again. \nFour innings later, the buzz is palpable in the stadium, a low hum when Judge assumes his wide stance in the box and looks toward the mound at Trevor Cahill . Judge takes a ball outside. He smiles and digs in again. Judge waves through a low breaking ball for strike one, then takes a high fastball for a ball. Judge doesn't break his crouch, just slaps the plate with his bat and waits. The next pitch is a low changeup over the middle of the plate. Judge flicks his bat. The stadium explodes. \nHe rounds the bases while his teammates cheer from the dugout. After he makes his way down the dugout steps, Judge is engulfed. There are handshakes and forearm smashes and hugs and high-fives. He works his way to the end of the dugout and up the stairs to the field. The fans haven't sat down. He raises a hand in celebration, the most anyone could expect. Judge looks around the stadium, taking it in. \nFor a moment, finally, the moment is bigger than him.

Kluber's Indians rode a record-breaking 22-game win streak into becoming AL favorites. Sale's Red Sox held off the Yankees to win their second straight AL East crown.

All four will be Cy Young Award candidates in November.\nWhat separates these four October aces from the rest of baseball's top pitchers? To find out, we dove into the numbers, went inside the scouting reports and got a firsthand account of what it's like to face them -- from the very hitters they'll square off against when it counts this postseason.\nClayton Kershaw\nAP Photo/Alex Gallardo Clayton Kershaw by the numbers 2017 Career W-L 18-4 144-64 ERA 2.31 2.36 WHIP 0.95 1.00 SO 202 2,120 BB 30 507 OPS against .604 .568 WAR 4.6 56.9 Scouting Kershaw: Kershaw is the perfect blend of power and finesse, an ace who gets strikeouts without elite velocity if he needs to. His curveball has long been a devastating pitch, but he has been increasingly reliant on a slider that he honed over the years. It all works off Kershaw's 93-ish mph fastball, which doesn't always blow people away but is always just where he wants to throw it and moves just how he wants to move it. Kershaw has pinpoint command, changes arm angles and is always working on new secondary pitches. He is always prepared and out-thinks opposing batters. He is as complete as it gets. -- Bradford Doolittle\n\"He's the best pitcher in the game. He competes. He locates well. At times, all pitchers fall into patterns, but he knows how to execute a plan so well. His slider down and in, he locates it so well to righties. And of course, his curveball can get you anytime.\"\nKris Bryant on facing Clayton Kershaw Defining Kershaw's greatness: Kershaw plays in an era more tilted against starting pitchers than any in baseball history. And yet, through 10 big league seasons, Kershaw is No. 52 all time in WAR. When you zero in on pitchers through their age-29 seasons, Kershaw jumps to No. 6, just behind Tom Seaver. When you add the protection he has received through his career as a 21st-century hurler and hopefully the longevity that should come with it -- not to mention his competitiveness and constant tweaking of his repertoire -- Kershaw could eventually chase down No. 1 Walter Johnson. I mean, wow. -- Doolittle\nCorey Kluber\nStephen Brashear/Getty Images Corey Kluber by the numbers 2017 Career W-L 18-4 76-48 ERA 2.25 3.13 WHIP 0.87 1.09 SO 265 1,201 BB 36 243 OPS against .556 .647 WAR 8.0 26.8 Scouting Kluber: This guy is the complete package, starting with a 92-94 mph two-seamer that often starts off the plate (inside to lefties, outside to righties) and then breaks back over the corner. His fastball has a higher spin rate this season, translating to a little better strikeout rate (21.3 percent to 24.2 percent). His two breaking balls put him on the next level. There's his cutter/slider hybrid and a curveball -- sometimes referred to as a slurve -- that is one of the most dominant pitches in the game. It has both horizontal and vertical movement, and Kluber manipulates the speed and angles. He'll also mix in a few changeups per game. -- David Schoenfield\n\"He has a really good fastball -- with movement. Very sharp curveball. I think he mixes in a little changeup. He throws a cutter as well. And he's able to pitch for effect -- not necessarily trying to throw strikes in certain spots but more for crowding to get you looking in a certain direction. And then everything kind of comes out of the same arm angle.\"\nJackie Bradley Jr. on facing Corey Kluber Defining Kluber's greatness: Since he came off the DL on June 1 after a back issue sidelined him for a month, Kluber has pitched the best baseball of his career. He's 15-2 in 23 starts with a 1.62 ERA and 224 strikeouts in 166.1 innings as batters have hit .175. In that stretch, he has allowed more than two runs just four times (with a high of four just one time). For the season, his strikeout rate has increased from 26.4 percent in 2016 to 34.1 percent. That curveball? Batters are hitting .105 against it. And good luck with two strikes: Batters are hitting .110 -- only Max Scherzer has a lower average among qualified starters -- and Kluber's 59 percent K rate is the highest of any starter. -- Schoenfield", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/intent/tweet?lang=en&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fmlb%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F20824709&text=The%20four%20aces%20of%20October%3A%20Inside%20the%20dominance%20of%20Kershaw,%20Kluber,%20Sale%20and%20Scherzer", "http://espn.go.com/espn/print?id=20824709", "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0723%2Fr235230_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375,", "http://facebook.com/dialog/send?link=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/20824709&next=http://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/20824709&app_id=116656161708917", "https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fmlb%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F20824709%2Fthe%2Dfour%2Daces%2Doctober%2Ddominance%2Dkershaw%2Dkluber%2Dsale%2Dscherzer&description=The+four+aces+of+October%3A+The+dominance+of+Kershaw%2C+Kluber%2C+Sale+and+Scherzer&media=http%3A%2F%2Fa.espncdn.com%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0929%2Fmlb_4Aces_16x9.jpg", "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0926%2Fr263970_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375,", "https://www.facebook.com/dialog/share?href=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.espn.com%2Fmlb%2Fstory%2F_%2Fid%2F20824709&app_id=116656161708917", "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0926%2Fr263970_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40", "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0723%2Fr235230_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40", "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0926%2Fr263970_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40", "http://a.espncdn.com/photo/2017/0929/postseason_16x9_576x324.jpg", "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0723%2Fr235230_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570,", "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0926%2Fr263970_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570,", "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0723%2Fr235230_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:58:41.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a1137d35052ecd322f6d0d26c27f83e7da9ee15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeFtbFAMX3WaTV_kH51HsSb.UYTPa9kcXSFnQtDq.CeHB6PB5x_ssm_2Wc_1Qob6_ghSxnqmnmCHfjpaDYsjnms9Q9LE2JaeBCPY.2rTJeK7wRR7BKTwaOLNPIV3szoN1G8uMtXlFn3dMJQPt_G0pIRQ-", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/nfl/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "2017 NFL season's biggest surprises through four games, and what could come next - Bill Barnwell", "title_full": "2017 NFL season's biggest surprises through four games, and what could come next - Bill Barnwell", "published": "2017-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 200, "participants_count": 144, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1001%2Fr267909_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4c665faf2d1244661028265ba42e7639d2409a0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeFtbFAMX3WaTV_kH51HsSb.UYTPa9kcXSFnQtDq.CeHB6PB5x_ssm_2Wc_1Qob6_ghSxnqmnmCHfjpaDYsjnms9Q9LE2JaeBCPY.2rTJeK7wRR7BKTwaOLNPIV3szoN1G8uMtXlFn3dMRjo.RJOvMAlzyRJ4Ssk3bQ--", "ord_in_thread": 194, "author": "Terry Welsh", "published": "2017-10-03T10:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "", "text": "Sorry but takeaways are nice the Lion's defense has stopped teams be fore they could score.

There's a couple of other old adages that apply here: The scoreboard never lies. And then this one, which is less well known: 20 points is a good barometer for a good scoring defense. It's that last one, 20 points or less, that i've focused on. Here's a Quote: from the article, \"The Lions were a bad team with incredibly great timing last season. Despite the fact that they finished a lowly 27th in DVOA, Detroit rode a league-record eight fourth-quarter comebacks ...\". Now how could they do that. The statement in the article pretty much admits they don't get it. Watch this: DVOA complicates the obvious, or rather, ignores the obvious due to insignificant details. Last year the Lions were 30th in sacks, gave up a record 72 percent completion percentage, one of the worst third down defenses, and only had 14 turnovers, one of the worst in the NFL. However, none of these stats are on the scoreboard. Consider this: In 2016 the Detroit Lions were 13th in Scoring Defense and they were 20th in scoring offense. Because of Stafford's late game heroics, the defense was easily overlooked when in fact the defense out performed the offense all season. See what you think: I did some homework and found that playoff teams who held their opponent to 20 points or less last year won 85 percent of those games. Detroit held 10 teams to 20 or less last year. The ONLY team to better that mark were the New England Patriots. But they said the Lions defense was bad. Not on the scoreboard they weren't. The simple reason that Stafford could manage all those comebacks is because even though they were behind in the 4th quarter most of the time, Detroit's defense didn't let the opposition run away and hide. They kept the games within one score in 12 of those games which gave Stafford his opportunites. Don't get me wrong, Stafford was great, but since Lions owner, Martha Firestone Ford, fired everybody in the middle of the 2015 season, the Detroit Lions defense had held 19 of their last 27 opponents to 20 points or less. That is one of the NFL's best defensive stats during that time frame. So when I read or hear about how good Detroit's defense is now, this is my answer to the over analytics of DVOA. I guess it's like another old adage: You can't see the forest for the trees. In other words, you spend too much time lookinga at the individual stats and details and you miss the big picture ... the scoreboard, because the scoreboard never lies. So, watch your team this year and see how many times the defense holds the opponent to 20 points or less. Then just track how many times they win those games. Remember, defense wins championships. Does your team have a championship defense?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:59:12.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5a1137d35052ecd322f6d0d26c27f83e7da9ee15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeFtbFAMX3WaTV_kH51HsSb.UYTPa9kcXSFnQtDq.CeHB6PB5x_ssm_2Wc_1Qob6_ghSxnqmnmCHfjpaDYsjnms9Q9LE2JaeBCPY.2rTJeK7wRR7BKTwaOLNPIV3szoN1G8uMtXlFn3dMJQPt_G0pIRQ-", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/nfl/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "2017 NFL season's biggest surprises through four games, and what could come next -

The Packers have generated pressure at the fourth-highest rate this season -- on 31 percent of dropbacks -- even with injuries to Mike Daniels , Ahmad Brooks and Nick Perry .\n3. Atlanta Falcons 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 1\nThe defense forced two takeaways against Aaron Rodgers but failed to force any against Mike Glennon , Matthew Stafford or Tyrod Taylor . The offense has committed six turnovers the past two games, so if the defense can't force any themselves, Atlanta will be facing an uphill battle.\n4. Denver Broncos 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 5\nThe Broncos' rushing defense has allowed 2.4 yards per rush and 50.8 rushing yards per game through the first four weeks -- and that was done against backs such as Ezekiel Elliott , LeSean McCoy , Marshawn Lynch and Melvin Gordon (among others). Defense has won Denver a title before, and if it keeps this up, it might be able to do it again.\n5. Pittsburgh Steelers 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 6\nThe offense was supposed to make all the headlines, but the Steelers have quietly allowed the second-fewest points per game (14.8) this season. It might not be the \"Steel Curtain,\" but it has led to a 3-1 record and first place in the AFC North.\n6. Seattle Seahawks 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 12\nAside from a hiccup against the Titans in Week 3, the Seattle defense has held opponents to 18 or fewer points three times so far this season. The Seahawks are 45-7-1 (.858) when holding opponents fewer than 20 points during the Russell Wilson era, which is the most such games in that time.\n7. New England Patriots 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 3\nIt's a great advantage having Tom Brady , but it's not so great when your defense turns opponents into Tom Brady. The Patriots' defense has allowed a higher completion percentage, more passing touchdowns and more yards per attempt than Brady has thrown this season.\n8. Philadelphia Eagles 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 13\nThe Eagles have allowed the fewest points in the first three quarters of games this season but have allowed the second-most in fourth quarters. Philadelphia has three wins, but the past two were by a combined five points. If the Eagles can tighten up in the fourth quarter, they could start winning more comfortably.\n9. Detroit Lions 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 8\nThe best offense is sometimes a good defense. The Lions are tied for the league lead with 11 takeaways, which has led to 47 points off turnovers. Last season, Detroit had 14 takeaways, leading to only 28 points off turnovers.\n10. Houston Texans 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 17\nJ.J. Watt doesn't even have a sack this season, but it hasn't mattered much for Houston thanks to rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson and a still-potent defense. They struggled to stop Tom Brady -- who hasn't? -- but in all other games, they've allowed just one passing touchdown with four picks.\n11. Oakland Raiders 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 7\nThe Raiders are bending this season, but the defense has yet to really break. Oakland has held opponents to just three touchdowns on 12 red zone trips through four weeks, the lowest touchdown percentage allowed in the red zone so far in 2017.\n12. Dallas Cowboys 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 9\nDeMarcus Lawrence has been a force so far this season with an NFL-leading 7.5 sacks. Unfortunately for Dallas, no other defensive player has been nearly as disruptive; the rest of the team has combined for just 4.5 sacks and two picks.\n13. Carolina Panthers 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 22\nThere's no place like home. The 37-year-old Julius Peppers , a North Carolina native, is playing like he's 27 with a team-leading 4.5 sacks through four games. Opponents are still completing 71 percent of their passes against Carolina, but Peppers is at least knocking them back a bit.\n14. Washington Redskins 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 14\nThe Redskins entered Week 4 with the third-best opponent Total QBR. Alex Smith 's big Monday night knocked Washington down a few pegs, but Josh Norman 's injury could knock them down even further if he ends up out for an extended period.\n15. Buffalo Bills 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 15\nOne. That's how many passing touchdowns the Bills have allowed through four games. It's no wonder Buffalo has allowed the fewest points per game and currently owns sole possession of first place in the AFC East.\n16. Los Angeles Rams 2017 record: 3-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 16\nIf you think Todd Gurley is off to a great start, then you should see what opposing running backs have done against Los Angeles. The Rams have allowed 4.9 yards per rush and a league-worst seven rushing touchdowns so far this season. They'll have to shore up the rushing defense if they have want to contend.\n17. Minnesota Vikings 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 11\nSam Bradford and Dalvin Cook are hurt, which means the Minnesota offense might not be as explosive moving forward, but the defense is still intact. The Vikings are allowing 19.0 points per game this season and 19.8 since 2014, sixth best in that time.\n18. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 2017 record: 2-1\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 19\nThe Buccaneers might have cause for concern considering their defense has just one sack through three games. Perhaps even more concerning is the pass rush has generated pressure on just 16 percent of dropbacks, the worst in the NFL. This probably won't bode well against Tom Brady and the Patriots on Thursday night.\n19. Tennessee Titans 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 10\nPass defense was one of the Titans' biggest weaknesses last season, and it doesn't appear much has changed in 2017. Tennessee has allowed 11 passing touchdowns this season, tied for most in the NFL, including eight in the past two games. If Marcus Mariota 's injury is serious, the burden will fall even more on the defense for Tennessee to compete.\n20. New Orleans Saints 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 24\nThe Saints entered Week 4 with the second-worst defense, according to FPI, and then pitched their first shutout since 2012. FPI isn't buying into the one-off performance, though, as it only slightly improved New Orleans to the fourth-worst defense.\n21. Arizona Cardinals 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 21\nThe Cardinals allowed Total QBRs of 75 or better to Matthew Stafford and Dak Prescott , and QBRs of 25 or worse to Jacoby Brissett and Brian Hoyer . In other words, they've struggled against the good and thrived against the not-so-good. Carson Wentz , Jameis Winston and Jared Goff are up next for Arizona.\n22. Baltimore Ravens 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 18\nAfter recording eight interceptions and eight sacks between the first two games of the season, the Ravens have recorded just one pick and one sack in the two games since. With the offense sputtering, Baltimore will need the defense to be as disruptive as possible.\n23. Cincinnati Bengals 2017 record: 1-3\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 25\nCincinnati's three-loss start can't be blamed on its defense. The Bengals have allowed 16.8 points per game through four weeks, the third best in the NFL. The problem is the offense has scored a paltry 16.0 points per game.\n24. Jacksonville Jaguars 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 20\nThe Jaguars have shown flashes of good and bad this season, and the defense is no exception. The pass rush has generated a league-best 18 sacks through four weeks, but the rushing defense has allowed a league-worst 5.7 yards per rush.\n25. Los Angeles Chargers 2017 record: 0-4\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 27\nTackling has been an issue for the Chargers' defense so far in 2017. It has allowed 2.6 yards per rush after first contact, the worst in the NFL. To put it in perspective, the Broncos have allowed 2.4 yards per rush overall .\n26. New York Jets 2017 record: 2-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 31\nRaiders quarterback Derek Carr lit up the Jets with an 82 completion percentage in Week 2 with three touchdowns and no picks. All other quarterbacks who have played the Jets this season? Four touchdowns, four picks and a 53 completion percentage. New York is already halfway to matching its interception total from 2016.\n27. Miami Dolphins 2017 record: 1-2\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 26\nJay Cutler is struggling, but so is the pass defense. The Dolphins have allowed opponents to complete 76 percent of their passes, the worst in the NFL. Miami is also one of four teams without a pick this season.\n28. Chicago Bears 2017 record: 1-3\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 23\nMitchell Trubisky will make his NFL debut on Monday Night Football against the Vikings, and if he wants to win, he'll have to put a bunch of points on the board. FPI has the Bears with the fifth-worst defense so far this season.\n29. San Francisco 49ers 2017 record: 0-4\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 29\nThe 49ers are building for the future. The good news is all the young pass-rushers San Francisco has drafted appear to be paying off. The Niners are pressuring quarterbacks at the sixth-highest rate through four weeks. They did so at the fifth-lowest rate last season. Progress.\n30. New York Giants 2017 record: 0-4\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 28\nThe blame for the Giants' start should extend well past the offensive struggles. The defense has faced the most passes (129) without an interception this season and has generated just two takeaways, tied for second fewest in the NFL.\n31. Indianapolis Colts 2017 record: 1-3\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 30\nThe Colts have allowed the most points so far. But to the defense's credit, the offense was on the field for four of the 16 touchdowns allowed. Take those out, and the Colts' defense has allowed the fourth-most points.\n32. Cleveland Browns 2017 record: 0-4\nWeek 4 ranking: No. 32\nMaybe when first overall pick Myles Garrett takes the field, things will improve for the defense. But for now, the Browns rank 31st in defensive FPI and last in opponent QBR.

Not when he became a pro in the New York Yankees ' minor league system. Never. \nLuis Severino says he has never started a playoff game. \nAt any level. Anywhere. Never. \nStill, he is not sweating his first win-or-go-home start Tuesday night in the American League wild-card game against the Minnesota Twins . \n\"It's the same game,\" Severino, 23, said with a big belly laugh, seemingly unworried and unfazed as he stood in front of his locker. \"I just have to go out there and have fun.\" Adam Hunger/USA TODAY Sports \nSeverino has done a lot in 2017, moving from a career crossroads to becoming the Yankees' ace. A year ago, Severino regressed, with demotions to Triple-A and to the bullpen. If he didn't perform this season, the Yankees might have made him a full-time reliever. He credits his improvement,which has meant more precision with his fastball/slider/changeup combo, to his work with Hall of Famer Pedro Martinez in the Dominican last winter. \n\"He told me that if I change my mechanics a little bit, I'll be more consistent in my strike zone,\" Severino said. \"That's what I did, and that's how that worked out and helped me.\" \nIn the regular season, the right-hander with a 100 mph fastball went 14-6 with a 2.98 ERA. That won't win him a Cy Young Award, but he very well could place in the top three in voting. And if he's the Severino of the regular season, opposing Twins starter Ervin Santana will have a tough time going pitch-for-pitch with him. \n\"Hopefully, he is mentally tough enough to do the exact same thing,\" said Al Leiter, an analyst for the YES and MLB networks who appeared in 21 postseason games and won two rings during parts of 19 seasons in the big leagues. \"That is the separator. You don't rise to the occasion. You just continue to do what you've been doing. \n\"If your ERA is a 2.8, pitch like a 2.8 in the postseason and you are a stud. Don't have your 2.8 become a 3.5. Everyone is bananas, the bunting is up, that all goes into the mind, 'Gulp, don't mess this one up.' Does that affect your performance? It could. He hasn't done it yet so we don't know, but stuff-wise, he can dominate.\" 2017 MLB Postseason \n\u2022 Schedule \u00bb | Complete coverage \u00bb \nOf the Baby Bombers, Severino has always been the most important of the bunch. The Yankees have been trying and failing to grow an elite starter since a kid named Andy Pettitte rose to prominence in the mid-1990s. \nFrom Phil Hughes to Joba Chamberlain to Ivan Nova , the Yankees have had limited success developing starters, but none of them became an ace or good enough to be trusted in a big game. That's why Severino's development has always been a big deal -- even bigger than the development of Aaron Judge or Gary Sanchez . \nTuesday night is the next step in a process that has had Space Mountain-type dips for Severino. Last year's failures made him hungrier. \n\"He's had a little roller-coaster ride there,\" Yankees backup catcher Austin Romine said. \"I saw a change in his focus. You could tell he really wanted it.\" \nWhat is really amazing about Severino is his ability to pump his fastball from the first to the seventh inning. He often touches 100 on the speed gun late in games. \nSaid Leiter: \"Stud.\" \nAnother starter with big-game experience, CC Sabathia , downplayed Severino's lack of playoff experience. For Sabathia, the fact that the Yankees play so many big regular-season games, especially against the Red Sox, it should be an easier transition for Severino. \n\"It helps us that we play the Red Sox so many times a year,\" Sabathia said. \"That could be a big game in April. It could be a big game in June. All those games count. All those games feel the same, so that helps us.\" \nSabathia is the leader of the staff. He could get in Severino's ear to remind him to just keep it simple. \n\"Just be yourself,\" Sabathia said he'd advise Severino. \"Don't try to do anything extra. Go out and do what you've always done and keep us close in the game and let the team do the rest.\" \nIf Severino does struggle, Yankees manager Joe Girardi will have a pretty quick hook, as Chad Green , Dellin Betances and Aroldis Chapman could be called on for multiple innings in the do-or-die game. \nSeverino has the stuff to escape trouble -- especially his ability to strike out opponents -- so, even if the Twins put some runners on, he still could be Girardi's best option to get out of it. \nOn Tuesday night, Severino will use his talent to combat his inexperience. It has worked pretty well so far.

Doug brings a little bit of everything -- energy, Doug is funny, smart -- just everything. He's knowledgeable, he can be physical when you need him to, he can do anything.\" \nBarber and several teammates helped keep Martin in the loop with group chats, while Martin watched every one of their games out in California, where he was training. He purposely went through harder workouts on Sundays to keep his body on the NFL schedule. Then, he'd go to a restaurant with his family so he could watch his other family -- his Buccaneers family -- play. \n\"It was weird. It was different,\" said Martin, who admitted that Sunday's last-second 25-23 win over the New York Giants was especially nerve-wracking. \"As I am watching my heart is going and things like that. But I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m back now. \n\"I love these guys and these guys love me,\" Martin said. \"I know that [when] I wasn\u2019t here, I know they were thinking of me and they can\u2019t wait for me to get back here.

When you watch him practice, he practices and plays hard. Everybody feeds off his energy.\" \nThe Bucs could have cut Martin last spring. They were under no obligation to pay him since a PED suspension is considered \"conduct detrimental to the team.\" Instead, the organization chose to stick by him. \nIt only reinforced what left tackle Donovan Smith always felt. \n\"I believe in second chances,\" Smith said. \"One moment doesn't define someone's life or who they are as a person or anything like that. It's just a testament to the brotherhood we have in this facility -- [from] all the way up top, to the equipment room, the training room, the weight room, everything. \n\"Any time you go through anything in life like family does, you're their support, backbone and everything,\" Smith said. \"You're welcomed back with open arms.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "doug martin", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "barber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donovan smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jameis winston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peyton barber", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles sims", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerald mccoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sims", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russell hansbrough", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new york giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buccaneers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug martin tampa bay buccaneers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bucs", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tampa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "one buccaneer place", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:24:07.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80eee05ed02f51767004d89ef346094609c9899b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeDs6EcHSckHKh7OxlWAfW5SIdiNdiGvEGQDPWbqhI3i6ItWI.GqpHt4-", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://www.espnfc.co.uk/rss", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "ESPN FC News", "title": "LISTEN: Assessing the Premier League", "title_full": "LISTEN: Assessing the Premier League", "published": "2017-10-03T16:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a.espncdn.com/i/espnradio/podcast/ESPNFC/ESPN_FC_300x300.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80eee05ed02f51767004d89ef346094609c9899b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeDs6EcHSckHKh7OxlWAfW5SIdiNdiGvEGQDPWbqhI3i6ItWI.GqpHt4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "LISTEN: Assessing the Premier League", "text": "Sep 30, 2017 Premier League Recap \nThe ESPN FC crew recap the Premier League weekend and discuss the future of Ronald Koeman at Everton.

I don't have any timeline on that at all, but we're going to take care of him and make sure that we take our time and do this really well to look after him.\" Seattle defensive end Marcus Smith made his presence felt against the Colts in Week 4. AP Photo/Elaine Thompson \nAvril led Seattle with a career-high 11.5 sacks last season to earn his first trip to the Pro Bowl. Frank Clark will likely take over as the starter at Seattle's Leo position, the weakside end who lines up opposite Michael Bennett in base defense. Newcomer Marcus Smith will take on a larger role as well. \nThe Seahawks also brought back Quinton Jefferson on Monday, signing their 2016 fifth-round pick off the Los Angeles Rams ' practice squad. Jefferson has the versatility to play both end and tackle and will reinforce Seattle's depth. But Clark and Smith will get the majority of the playing time in Avril's absence. \nBoth stood out in Seattle's win against Indianapolis. \nSmith beat the Colts' right tackle off the edge and hit Brissett as he was throwing, forcing a fumble that linebacker Bobby Wagner returned for a touchdown in the third quarter. He had another half sack earlier in the game and played 27 defensive snaps, considerably more than what he averaged over his first two games of the season. \nThe Seahawks signed Smith in July after he was waived by the Philadephia Eagles, who made him a late first-round pick in 2014 but never saw the expected return on that investment. At 6-foot-3 and 258 pounds, Smith has the size and athleticism that Seattle looks for in a Leo end. Carroll said Smith reminded him a lot of Chris Clemons, who filled that role during Carroll's first four seasons with the Seahawks. \n\"He got a legitimate shot yesterday with a lot of play time and was a factor and made a huge play in the game,\" Carroll said. \"We feel very fortunate to have him.\" \nClark had four tackles and a quarterback hit in 40 snaps while playing with his typically relentless effort. On one of his tackles, he hurdled a would-be cut block to bring down running back Frank Gore . That play and others from Clark stood out to Carroll. \n\"Boy, he played hard last night. Holy cow,\" Carroll said on 710 ESPN Seattle . \"It's a spectacular film to watch, just to watch him. His effort was just off the charts.\" \nClark, a 2015 second-round pick, is coming off a 10-sack season. He and Smith were part of a pass-rush that came alive Sunday night, particularly in the second half. \nThe Seahawks entered the game having generated pressure on only 17.9 percent of their opponents' dropbacks over the first three weeks, which ranked 30th in the league and was partly a product of a lot of short, quick passes designed to get the ball out quickly. Seattle pressured Brissett on 26 percent of his dropbacks in the first half and then 55 percent in the second half, according to ESPN Stats & Information. The Seahawks finished with three sacks after recording six over the first three games. \nCarroll believes you can never have enough edge rushers. Clark and Smith will have to be enough to withstand Avril's absence. \n\"We feel pretty good about that.

Follow on Twitter Facebook Twitter Facebook Messenger Pinterest Email print comment Now for more of my NBA League Pass Rankings for 2017-18.\nClick here for Part 1 and all the rules.\nLet's get back to it.\n15. WASHINGTON WIZARDS (31.5) Barroom debate: Who is more fun to watch, John Wall or Russell Westbrook ? For me, it might be Wall. Westbrook plays with sneering, physical force Wall can't match. Westbrook flies a little higher, and comes down looking to inflict pain. His leaps carry a hint of danger.\nBut Wall might be faster with the ball, with a better eye for long-range, crosscourt passes to shooters flanking him. When he goes coast-to-coast, he is a little more artful finishing around the rim -- even with half his body flying out of bounds as he releases the ball. Wall was more efficient on transition chances by a wide margin, per Synergy stats.\nEditor's Picks The Lowe Post\nZach talks to Jeff Van Gundy about roster upgrades in Cleveland and Oklahoma City, chasing the Warriors, the bottom of the Western Conference playoff race, and more.\nNight to night, how many players are more reliably watchable? LeBron, Stephen Curry , Kevin Durant , Westbrook (depending on your taste) and Giannis Antetokounmpo -- is that the whole list? On the right night, you could add Anthony Davis , Kyrie Irving , Kawhi Leonard , Joel Embiid , Nikola Jokic , James Harden , Karl-Anthony Towns , Dion Waiters and a few others, but Wall is more consistently high wattage. You cannot take your eyes off of him.\nThe rest of the League Pass experience is average, especially since the Wizards are on (at least) a one-year delay incorporating the stars-and-stripes uniforms they wore at home down the stretch of last season. Those are glorious.\nMarkieff Morris ' angry, clubbing forays into foul trouble make for good TV. Jason Smith morphing into a 3-point shooter was a surprise turn, and Marcin Gortat 's mohawk scored some late bonus points. Kara Lawson is going to bring keen insight every night as Washington's new TV analyst.\n14. MIAMI HEAT (32) We are officially in the Very Watchable section of the rankings. Miami lacks that one change-the-channel star, but the collective is strong: Goran Dragic , head down, sprint-dribbling into a whirring series of weirdo pivots; Hassan Whiteside swallowing shots instead of just blocking them; Kelly Olynyk accidentally hurting people with his herky-jerky game; James Johnson , ninja warrior, running inverted pick-and-rolls with Dragic and threading impossible passes; Erik Spoelstra waving his arms like a crazy person; and Dion Waiters, always Dion Waiters, forever calling for the ball, hoisting bananas shots, and acting like the true goddamned megastar he is.\nThey play so hard. There is a perverse joy in watching Miami, frothing at the mouth, pulverize some poor team coming off a back-to-back or a hard night out on South Beach. You almost see the victim pleading: \"Can you guys just take it easy, once?\" No. No, they cannot.\nThere are some interesting basketball subplots here, too . And, Spo: For the love of the basketball gods, please stop calling timeouts in the last 30 seconds of every quarter. Sometimes, a guy just wants to get to the bathroom.\n13. SAN ANTONIO SPURS (33) You're rolling your eyes. The Spurs are dull again, with a slow-poke offense heavy on midrange shots and lurching LaMarcus Aldridge post-ups. A whopping 33 percent of the possessions Aldridge finished came via post-ups, the third-highest such share among all players, per Synergy. He shot 44 percent from the block, and drew few fouls. Blech. (Maybe that's why Aldridge is talking about shooting 3-pointers again ?) The NBA cognoscenti turned on poor Aldridge faster than Chicago fans turned on the Bulls. And who wants to listen to two-plus hours of broadcast homerism?\nBut, man, the Spurs are polished . They still throw more passes than almost anyone ; if you are not prepared for sustained cooperation on defense, they will humiliate you. If you play selfishly on the other end, without much zip or imagination, they will smother you. Watching the Spurs run circles around some underprepared, low-IQ Eastern Conference mediocrity is to see two teams living on different planes of existence. They are barely playing the same sport, and it somehow doesn't even look like the Spurs are trying that hard.\nAnd if the Spurs are off, we get Cranky Pop, with his instant hockey line substitutions. (Poor Danny Green remains his favorite victim for solo scoldings.)\nOh, yeah: Kawhi Leonard. He doesn't leap off the screen or jack off-the-bounce triples, but he can cinch the entire game in a vice grip for 90-second Kawhigasms. It has been almost a year since Leonard just took the ball from Ben McLemore 's hands on two straight possessions, and McLemore still hasn't recovered. It was like a horror movie.\nThe bench units take us back to the nirvana of 2014 -- Manu Ginobili and Patty Mills playing give-and-go-and-give-again with a flair and cleverness that is all their own.\nThis also feels, finally, like a pivotal year for San Antonio. Aldridge has a player option for next season, and the murmurs of at least mild mutual discontent never cease. Green and Rudy Gay both have player options for 2018-19. Tony Parker is in the last year of his contract, returning from a serious injury. If this team can't sniff the Warriors, what does it look like in a year?\n12. LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS (33.5) Uncertainty can inspire intrigue or anxiety, and the uncertain Clippers in their first season without Chris Paul fall a little toward the \"anxiety\" end of the scale.\nIt might be exciting to see Blake Griffin take on more playmaking duty, and display the full breadth of his skill amid a wackadoo supporting cast. It could also fall flat without a guard to crack holes in the defense before kicking the ball to Griffin at the foul line. Do those Griffin-to- DeAndre Jordan tic-tac-toe lobs materialize without Paul? What, exactly, is Jordan without an all-time point guard floating feathery lobs? The Clips managed well in rare minutes when both bigs played sans Paul. Will that hold up?\nThe roster is overstuffed with tweener forwards and centers; the guard rotation is fragile. If the Clips are just a blah 43-win team, the intrigue fades.\nThey do sport some classic NBA characters. It's a trip watching Austin Rivers wave off advice from his elders. Lou Williams owns the 2-for-1 -- the Lou-for-1 -- and will flail his way to points until he's 40. And get ready for Milos Teodosic , a passing savant from Serbia with a permanent three-day beard and giant, giant balls.\nRalph Lawler is a joy on the mic. Their new blue uniforms are perhaps the best in franchise history.\n11. DENVER NUGGETS (33.5) Denver is a few splashes of powder blue from the top eight. Powder blue is awesome! Everyone loves it! The Nuggets have shoved it to the fringes of their art -- the new jerseys, and their newish court, with those shaded pickaxes and the ham-handed reminder painted along the sideline that Denver (allegedly) gets 300 days of sunshine. Shame on you, Nuggets. Shame!\nBut you can fall only so far when you have Nikola Jokic, the league's best passing big man, slinging fire from every conceivable release point: two-handers from above his head, and bending, skimming bounce passes flicked from ankle level to sneak them under enemy arms. Jokic has a wink-wink backdoor cut mind-meld with Gary Harris , a slippery cutter and sneaky-explosive baseline finisher.\nJokic isn't just a passer. He shot 58 percent (!) on post-ups, second-best among 73 guys who recorded at least 75 shots from the block, per Synergy. He can bait behemoths off their feet with wicked fakes, and bulldoze smaller dudes. If he stays in shape and avoids ticky-tack fouls, Jokic is a superstar -- at least on offense.\nPaul Millsap will improve the defense, second-worst in the league last season, but not enough to prevent a ton of shootouts. Jamal Murray has no conscience. Juancho Hernangomez is shifty, with a nice stroke, even if the Nuggets -- stocked with a gazillion power forwards -- will have to play him out of position on the wing.\nMike Malone is like a sixth defender, stomping along the sidelines. I can't decide whether to deduct points for Will Barton 's bogus no-look passes, where he jerks his head to a side of the floor containing zero teammates -- and thus no passing target -- just to show off. It's almost avant garde in its absurdism. It also works sometimes!\n10. MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES (34) This is probably lower than you expected. The Wolves will win with brute force, not style. The starting lineup features four guys who like to control the ball, and shoot from inside the arc -- and (likely) Taj Gibson . They are going to lower their shoulders, drive into crowds, and bludgeon people until they find an open shot or burrow to the rim.\nKarl-Anthony Towns brings needed panache. He might be the only big man in history who can overpower some patsy with a jump hook on one possession, and then run off a baseline screen, like a mutant Kyle Korver , for a catch-and-shoot 3 on the next. He has soft touch, and he accelerates through the lane with shocking speed and ferocity.\nJimmy Butler amped up his passing last season, and he doesn't even need to beat his guy off the bounce to draw help; he dribbles into their chests, knocks them sideways, and forces the next defender to slide over -- unlocking passing lanes. He has a knack for high-wire midair dishes. Gibson toying with a corner 3 is spicy.\nTom Thibodeau is a sideline burlesque show -- a bellowing, wing-flapping penguin perfectionist who by the fourth quarter emits mostly guttural grunts. The Wolves might want to turn down their courtside mics, or slap a PG-13 rating onto their broadcasts.\nThe first two new Nike uniforms are different without treading near gaudy. The muted blues and grays give off a cool, arctic feeling.\nOn the other hand:\nCourtesy of the Timberwolves My eyes! The goggles do nothing!\nDave Benz and Jim Petersen combine for the league's smartest broadcast, and the Wolves have finally scrapped their hideous two-toned butterscotchy court.\n9. MILWAUKEE BUCKS (34.5) Variety is good. Antetokounmpo alone represents variety. There has never been anyone quite like him, covering the entire court in a few giant lunges, and reaching his extend-o arms out of bounds along the baseline to sling bullets across impossible diagonals. He has a chance to be the best player in the league when LeBron, Durant and the rest fade.\nOn defense, the Bucks favor a frenzied trapping blitzkrieg that has gone out of vogue. It might not work; Milwaukee's defense has regressed since 2014-15 as teams figured out how to pass around the traps -- and produce a bounty of 3s and shots at the rim. But as a viewing experience, it makes for a refreshing change of pace.\nThe half-court offense is vanilla, though it's fun watching Jason Kidd shift Antetokounmpo between stations -- the elbows, the corners, the baseline -- in trying to figure out what works best. Thon Maker 's development as a stretch center is crucial for an organization short on cap flexibility. When Jabari Parker returns, Kidd will have access again to super-funky lineups featuring Antetokounmpo (or Parker) as the nominal center. That is the future.\nOne day, Mirza Teletovic is going to drop a pass because he's brushing his hair back into place after the gel wears off. The courts and uniforms are all tidy.\n8. PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS (35) Portland runs much of the same beautiful, flowing read-and-react offense the Mavericks use, though the Blazers have superstars who punctuate it with flair -- or bust the hell out of it when they feel like doing their thing.\nDamian Lillard has Curry range. C.J. McCollum is a fast-twitch phantom, always on the move, knees bent, ready to change direction. He might tote the league's deepest arsenal of dribble moves and in-between shots; McCollum hit an incredible 52.2 percent of shots taken between 8 and 16 feet from the rim, second-best among 105 rotation players who tried at least 1.5 shots per game from that ultra-tricky range, per NBA.com. There's a reason I've called him the NBA's Dean Malenko.\nJusuf Nurkic brought some needed brutality and scoring, and nearly matched Mason Plumlee as a pick-and-roll playmaker. The Blazers' art is all great, though their new red jersey, with monochrome black lettering, shares the Kevin-Arnold-In-Gym-Class look with Indiana's yellow duds:\nMaurice Harkless earns a bonus again if he shoots 35 percent from deep, per ESPN.com's Bobby Marks, raising all sorts of hilarious possibilities if he's on the border late in the season. Kevin Calabro is an NBA legend on play-by-play, and his partner, Lamar Hurd, is going to be an industry star.\n7. CLEVELAND CAVALIERS (35) This is Cleveland's lowest ranking since the second coming of LeBron, and a little surprising for a three-time NBA Finalist that turned over half its roster in a spasm of classic Cavs melodrama. JR Smith alone is worth a minimum score of \"7\" in the comedy category.\nThe churn brought in more bricky shooters, and capsized a stable rotation. Ty Lue's first solution is a shocker that bends the fundamental identity of the team in exciting new directions: shifting Kevin Love to center, starting Jae Crowder next to LeBron, and bringing Tristan Thompson off the bench.\nThat leaves Smith and Dwyane Wade to battle for the last starting spot. Lue still has to decide who closes games, and what happens when Isaiah Thomas comes back. Building an above-average defense will be tough, and Cleveland's apathy last season on that end explains their drop here: We should all know by now that nothing really matters with these guys until April.\nWatching Wade and LeBron team up stokes warm Heatles nostalgia. Wade became a master at leveraging LeBron's gravity. He skulks through the backdoor like a cat burglar. He knows what he wants to do before he catches a pass, and that mental head start helps him glide through narrow crannies for soft old-school floaters.\nIt is apparently impossible to design a single appealing piece of art using wine and gold as primary colors. I always worry when I disagree with Paul Lukas, our resident uniform guru, but I kinda dig the new black alternates with a giant slanted \"C\" above the numbers:\nCourtesy of the Cavaliers 6. NEW ORLEANS PELICANS (35.5) Oh, hell yes. DeMarcus Cousins and Anthony Davis, twin-towering against the NBA grain, with Cousins heading into free agency and basically every job in the organization on the line. Toss in Rajon Rondo and Tony Allen , and the Pelicans are wired with the league's most combustible set of personalities. Even abject failure would be spectacular, and set off another round of trade talks surrounding the league's preeminent grump.\nThere will be nights when it clicks despite the alarming lack of shooting around the big guys -- nights when you wonder how anyone keeps them from pillaging at the rim, and whether New Orleans might have stumbled upon the Warriors antidote. Cousins will rumble coast-to-coast, Davis will swat jumpers before the ball even leaves the victim's hand, and they'll take turns drawing double-teams down low. Hell, they might even grab some offensive rebounds for a team that has been allergic to the concept under Alvin Gentry.\nGentry knows that spacing will be tight, and he has already told me he plans to plop both big guys in unconventional spots -- including the corners -- at the start of some half-court sets. The rotating jigsaw puzzle will be fascinating.\nIf Jordan Crawford sticks on a non-guaranteed deal, we might have to nudge the Pelicans up one spot. Crawford owns the biggest gap between actual skill and self-perceived skill of any player, ever. Even Waiters is impressed with Crawford's preposterous shot selection. Watch Boogie's face whenever Crawford bricks two straight insane slide-step jumpers.\n5. PHILADELPHIA 76ers (36) I mean, look at this dude:\nLOOK AT HIM!\nIf Joel Embiid were slated to play more, the Sixers could make a run to the No. 2 spot. But I would be surprised if he logs 60 games even if he's healthy, which means we should prepare for an almost-best-case-scenario of 50. That leaves 30-plus for the rest of the Philly roster, still glowing with starry potential.\nBut the lure of the unknown -- Ben Simmons , Markelle Fultz -- can only take you so far. Most rookies are bad. We have to see a little something before slotting Philly any higher.\nThe Sixers have the best top-to-bottom collection of iconography in the league. They know it, too. They don't overthink with design overhauls or crazy colors. They search out small tweaks that build on historic themes, and they almost always nail them: stars mounted on a blue stripe down the side of one jersey; cursive writing across another ; the persistence of that Wilt-era \"PHILA\" wordmark; and their new Liberty Bell-themed alternate court (complete with crack). Everything is simple, and gorgeous.\nDon't sleep on the Dario Saric , a young and vaguely villainous Boris Diaw:\nPhilly is eager to investigate how it fares when Saric and Simmons -- both power forward-ish players with shaky jumpers -- play alongside Embiid.\n4. HOUSTON ROCKETS (36.5) Preemptive Rockets schadenfreude is flowing through the league. People love when Team Smartypants collapses amid farty chemistry, and critics are not ready to revise the narrative that Chris Paul and James Harden quake on the biggest stages. They are tapping their fingers together, Mr. Burns-style, in anticipation of the first time Paul undresses Harden for some comatose defensive blunder, grabs the ball, walks it up, and runs the slow-poke set he wants.\nThat will happen. But this team is going to be awesome, and a killer watch even beyond the puzzle-solving Harden and Paul have to do in learning to share the joystick.\nHouston's free throw frequency fell from \"unwatchable\" to \"normal high-volume\" last season after they ditched Dwight Howard and jacked more 3s early in the shot clock. It might fall further if the league really cracks down on those fraudulent three-shot fouls, when Harden dances around a pick, feels contact, and vomits up a brick.\nPaul and Harden get to flex different muscles. Paul can stand on the wing while Harden runs a pick-and-roll, wait for his defender to sag inside to help, and zoom into a slicing drive when Harden kicks him the ball. Paul sometimes runs into airborne passes, so that he's already at full speed by the time he catches it.\nDaryl Morey has amassed enough long-armed wings in PJ Tucker , Trevor Ariza , Luc Richard Mbah a Moute, and Troy Williams that he can play one of them at center in super-small, Warriors-specific lineups. When they play traditionally, Clint Capela and Nene Hilario -- one of the all-time angry dunkers -- make for ideal Mike D'Antoni centers.\nD'Antoni makes funny faces. Bring back the Pringles 'mustache!\n3. BOSTON CELTICS (38.5) The Carmelo Anthony deal triggered a dramatic last-second flip-flop between the second and third spots. It was intense! Kyrie Irving became the individual story of the season the moment he summoned the pluck to request a separation from LeBron James . Everyone wants to see if Irving, carrying zero record of NBA success without the world's greatest player, can manage as a pseudo-alpha dog and adapt to Brad Stevens' motion-heavy system. People will be watching every night, and a lot of them are rooting for Irving to fail.\nBoston is almost literally a brand new team after imploding its roster of gritty, overlooked gems to nab two A-listers in Irving and Gordon Hayward . Expectations are high, but integration takes time. Every game will be an experiment -- new lineups, new sets, new wrinkles.\nStevens favors a pleasing egalitarian style, and he's ratcheting up the pace; Boston is pushing hard off rebounds and zipping around in a blur of cuts. They will play smaller, five-out lineups a ton.\nThe Celtics trail only Philly in the overall art department. The parquet floor is iconic, and their green jerseys might be the best in all of U.S. sports. They should just wear them 82 times, and waste zero nights on their black-for-black's-sake alternates. Boston should be above such rote design trends.\nJayson Tatum exudes throwback smoothness, and Boston will need him to contribute right away -- a tough ask for any rookie. I've always had a soft spot for Shane Larkin 's zig-zaggy roadrunner game.\nIf you can't laugh with Tommy Heinsohn, I don't know what to tell you.\n2. OKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER (39) How do you overcome the league's worst collection of art? By teaming an MVP who just chucked his way to the highest usage rate in league history with Carmelo Anthony and Paul freaking George -- using only bad contacts and low-upside kiddos to do it! This is going to be wild .\nI loved the Thunder before the Melo deal. Paul George is the apex sidekick for Westbrook. He may have to play third banana now. He's most comfortable of the three working off the ball, and the Westbrook-Anthony pick-and-roll is more likely than the Westbrook-George version to produce exploitable mismatches; Melo can bully little guys switched onto him, and Westbrook will roast unlucky power forwards on the other end of that switch.\nWatching three superstars split one ball is always fascinating. Billy Donovan can fiddle with lineups that include all three, with just one of Andre Roberson and Steven Adams -- groups so heavy on shooting, they will be impossible to guard. Patrick Patterson can replace Adams at center in switchy alignments. The Thunder should at least try going ultra-big, with George as the nominal shooting guard in lineups featuring the big three and the Patterson-Adams front-line.\nAlex Abrines and Jerami Grant would unlock more versatility if either rounds off the weak spots of his game -- shooting for Grant, defense for Abrines. If they fizzle, the Thunder could be thin. Grant plays with a springy anger that makes him a threat to himself and everyone around him. No one dunks harder, or swings for blocked shots with more fury.\nThe Thunder's newest Nike jersey is by far the best in franchise history -- a low bar -- and portends well for a potential makeover.\n1. GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS (44) What can I do? I deducted points due to the likelihood that a bunch of their games are over by the end of the third quarter. But the Warriors, League Pass Rankings champs in four of the past five seasons, have turned the process of blowing teams out into high art. They have a snappy color scheme, and their new charcoal-gray Oakland-themed \"The Town\" jerseys, with Oakland's native tree logo, are perhaps the very best of the Nike alternates.\nThey even have the two players -- JaVale McGee and Nick Young -- for whom the comedy category was invented! Zaza Pachulia layups are stumbling, ground-bound adventures, punctuated by the basket mic amplifying Pachulia's baritone groaning. It's so loud, it's almost uncomfortable.\nI tried to fight the Warriors juggernaut. I failed. Now the other 29 teams get their turn.\nBack to Part 1.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "markieff morris",

The Kansas City Chiefs sent their kicker out for the most important field goal attempt of his young career and were confident, considering the circumstances. That's because that kicker, rookie Harrison Butker , projects an air of self-belief no matter the situation. \n\"I was confident because he was confident,\" coach Andy Reid said of Butker, who hit the game-winning field goal from 43 yards out with four seconds left on Monday night in his NFL debut. \"He kind of gives you that feeling that everything is going to be OK.\" \nThe Chiefs tacked on a touchdown when Justin Houston returned a fumble on the remaining play from scrimmage to take a 29-20 win against the Washington Redskins and raise their record to 4-0. Harrison Butker reacts after making the go-ahead field goal with four seconds left on Monday. EPA/LARRY W. SMITH \nBut the winning points went to Butker, who joined the Chiefs only last week as an injury replacement for Cairo Santos . He had been on the practice squad of the Carolina Panthers as recently as a week before his NFL debut. He was looking forward to having the players' normal day off last Tuesday, but his phone rang, and his plans changed. \nIt was his agent telling him to get on the plane to Kansas City. \nHe had a few days to work with holder Dustin Colquitt and snapper James Winchester and introduce himself to his new teammates, though all of the introductions weren't finished before Monday's game. \n\"It was awesome,\" Butker said. \"What a way to start -- Monday Night Football.\" \nHe missed his first field goal try, from 46 yards near the end of the first half. But he got three more chances and made them all, from 26, 32 and then 43 yards. \n\"After I missed that first kick, I was kind of dwelling on it a little too long, but once it goes off your foot, you've got to forget about it,\" he said. \"I knew I was going to get another opportunity. I wouldn't say I was nervous. I would say excited. It was a fun environment to play in. \n\"I didn't have butterflies. I felt confident ... I felt pretty calm. I hit the ball well.\" \nAs a sophomore at Georgia Tech, Butker made a 24-yard field goal to win a game against Virginia Tech as time expired. Later that season, he hit a 53-yard kick to send a game against Georgia into overtime. \nBut he has nothing to match what he did Monday night. He made the final kick twice, the first time moments after Washington called timeout to try to disrupt his timing. \nNo matter. Butker came through in the clutch for a second time, and in doing so, he made the Chiefs look good for summoning him as the replacement for Santos. \n\"He's got a good head on his shoulders,\" Winchester said. \"He'll keep this up. He's got the focus and the ability to get the job done. We trust him, and he trusts us.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harrison butker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "butker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james winchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy reid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dustin colquitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winchester", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kansas city chiefs", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "georgia tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiefs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington redskins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cairo santos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina panthers", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:37:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "103eee4920d53c110b6b91b8a4ccf2ae64302250", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEb236.rAa_PL2RoBMH1ibw7NW.QFetAeKTIp_lootr3hGvtxr36r1neWQtfs41s1ypwMbgcVaZN4ckRZVOXMURD798XRIh03VnRAUb1uG1HOSeOjIb3eTMp2V1SKdPCGpm", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "NFL on Yahoo!

He would benefit from being fed the ball three, four or five times in a row to wear down defenses with his smashmouth approach. \nThat\u2019s when the Carolina Panthers veteran is at his best. \nBut Stewart, 30, doesn\u2019t keep track of carries. \n\u201cI like winning,\u2019\u2019 he said after Carolina's 33-30 victory at New England on Sunday. \u201cAt the end of the day, I trust coaching. That\u2019s kind of been my motto all my life. I trust coaching and the position God puts you in to make things work.\u2019\u2019 Jonathan Stewart's carries have been reduced, but the veteran has managed to make an impact in other ways, including passing on his wisdom to rookie RB Christian McCaffrey. \"He's so selfless. He's willing to do whatever it takes,\" McCaffrey said. Fred Kfoury III/Icon Sportswire \nThat outlook has been a constant in Stewart\u2019s career, and the results speak for themselves. \nIn the fourth quarter against the Patriots, he became Carolina\u2019s all-time leading rusher, surpassing the 6,846 yards DeAngelo Williams had from 2006-14. \nIt happened with little fanfare as quarterback Cam Newton stole the show with four touchdowns, three passing and one rushing. \nStewart had a modest 68 yards rushing on 14 carries to run his career total to 6,868 yards. He played only 28 snaps, 20 fewer than rookie running back Christian McCaffrey because of his ability to play multiple positions. \nThis season, Stewart is averaging only 14.75 carries and 57.5 yards per game. That\u2019s down from the 18.6 carries and 76 yards per game he had in 2015 when he helped the Panthers reach the Super Bowl. \nThat isn\u2019t likely to change with McCaffrey averaging almost eight carries and 7.25 passes thrown his way per game. \nBut Stewart doesn\u2019t complain about his lack of carries now any more than he did during his first seven seasons when he shared the backfield with Williams. Stewart wasn\u2019t the starter most of that time, yet he took advantage of the opportunities he had. \nIn 2009, Stewart and Williams -- then known as \u201cDouble Trouble\u2019\u2019 -- became the first pair of backs on the same team to rush for 1,100 yards in a season. \nStewart got his on 13.8 carries a game, compared to 17 for Williams. \nStewart\u2019s role has been reduced even more this year with the addition of McCaffrey as the Panthers attempt to become more dynamic offensively. \n\u201cHe\u2019s so selfless,\u2019\u2019 McCaffrey said. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes. The best teams have guys like that, where it\u2019s not about their individual success. \n\u201cFor me to come in as a rookie, for him to help me along the way like he has, it speaks highly of him as a player and a person, too.\u2019\u2019 \nStewart simply feels blessed at his age to contribute, particularly after it appeared his career was all but done in 2012 and 2013, when ankle injuries limited him to 15 games over a two-year span. \n\u201cI just thank God for being able to have gone through all the things I\u2019ve gone through as far as injuries and the highs and lows of this team,\u2019\u2019 Stewart said. \u201cWe\u2019re not done yet.\u2019\u2019 \nStewart is not done yet. During the offseason, the Panthers signed him to an extension through 2018. He\u2019s still counted on to get that tough third-down or goal-line carry.

He was placed on injured reserve. \nArizona has a few options to replace Golden, who's developed into a feared pass-rusher. He had 12.5 sacks last season, but had yet to record one through four games this season. \nFiguring out who should fill Golden's roster spot dominated coach Bruce Arians' time on Monday, but he said the Cardinals won't make a roster move for a couple of days. Linebacker Markus Golden, who had 12.5 sacks last season, needs season-ending surgery on his right knee. Norm Hall/Getty Images \nHere's a look at potential replacements for Golden, according to Arians: \nKareem Martin : The fourth-year converted outside linebacker is the natural choice to replace Golden -- at least in Arizona's base 3-4 defense. He's finally grown into his position and has been active on defense when he's gotten a chance to play behind Golden and Chandler Jones . Arians says Martin has played \"extremely well\" this season after getting \"stronger.\" Martin was drafted in 2014 as a defensive tackle, playing with his hand in the dirt. As an outside linebacker, he had to learn how to play standing up. \"When he first got here, he always had his hand in the dirty,\" Arians said. \"That's hard to do, but he's getting more physical.\" \nHaason Reddick : Arizona's first-round pick this year played defensive end during his senior year at Temple and converted to inside linebacker at the Senior Bowl in January, so he'd just have to combine the two positions and he'll be ready to play outside linebacker. He has the pass-rusher mentality and the quickness to get off the edge and past a tackle, but he can also drop in coverage, as he showed numerous times this season covering running backs or tight ends from inside. With Deone Bucannon 's return to inside linebacker on Sunday, Reddick's snap count might decrease over the next few weeks as Bucannon gets back into football shape. \nA player from the practice squad : Arians called the idea of signing one of the practice squad outside linebackers \"a possibility\" because they have \"looked very good.\" They are Bryson Albright, Obum Gwachum and Earl Okine. All three have the size coveted by NFL teams at outside linebacker. Albright, 6-foot-5 and 235 pounds, played in one game last season for the Buffalo Bills . Gwachum, 6-5 and 246 pounds, had 2.5 sacks in 10 games with the Saints the past two seasons. Okine, 6-6 and 262 pounds, had five tackles in five games with Indianapolis in 2015. He spent the first three weeks of this season on the Lions\u2019 practice squad. \nSign a free agent : There's one name that comes to mind rather quickly if the Cardinals are looking for a free agent pass-rusher -- Dwight Freeney.

A significant upgrade at left tackle : Perhaps no team improved at one position more than the Rams did at one of the game's most important spots. They replaced Greg Robinson , one of the game's worst left tackles, with Andrew Whitworth , one of the game's best. They guaranteed $15 million to a 35-year-old offensive lineman, but it was worth it. \nWhitworth has allowed one pressure through his first four games, according to Pro Football Focus. His presence at left tackle, not to mention his willingness to mentor others, has made the entire offensive line better. Jared Goff has taken only four sacks in four games after taking 26 of them in seven games last season. Gurley is averaging 4.2 yards per carry after averaging 3.2 yards per carry last season. John Sullivan has also been a nice addition at center. \n3. Gurley got better : Yes, Gurley was victimized by a bad offensive line and a nonthreatening passing attack that made it easy for defenses to stack the box. But Gurley also missed his fair share of holes. Dating back to training camp, though, Gurley has been hitting holes quickly and decisively. He's running with a lot more confidence , and he has developed into a major threat as a receiver. \nGurley gained only 885 rushing yards last season, the lowest ever by someone with at least 275 carries. He made up for it somewhat by making 43 catches for 327 yards. This season, though, Gurley has hauled in 20 of his 22 targets for 234 yards. He has gained more than 100 yards on the ground in back-to-back games after going 20 straight games without reaching triple-digit rushing yards. And he leads the NFC in scrimmage yards with 596. \n2. Goff got way better : Goff bought in from day one, since the afternoon of Jan. 5, when he studied film with McVay a week before he was hired. When NFL rules kept him from interacting with his new coaches in the winter, Goff ironed out his throwing mechanics at the acclaimed 3DQB. In the spring, he basically lived at the facility, studying the new playbook and familiarizing himself with new teammates. \nSo far this season, Goff has done nothing but make sound decisions and execute precise throws. He leads the NFL with 9.2 yards per attempt and has a 61.5 Total QBR, eighth-highest in the NFL through the first four weeks. Goff has seven touchdowns, two more than he had all of the previous season, and only one interception. His quarterback rating is 112.2, nearly double the 63.6 mark from his rookie season. \n1. McVay implemented a great system : McVay has made the game a lot easier for Goff and has designed creative ways to get Gurley touches, whether it's creating the threat of a jet sweep with Austin or drawing up deceiving wheel routes or setting up screens off play fakes. The biggest key, in the words of McVay, are \"plays that start out the same but are different.\" \nA key staple of that is bunch formations that have receivers lining up tight with the offensive line, with an ability to run an assortment of passing and running plays off that. Because of that, play-action has been very effective as well. Another thing McVay and the new coaches did: Hammer home the fundamentals and demand perfection. \nSaid Austin: \"He works us to death in practice. He works us 'til we get it. ... He demands professionalism.

Or will it be Bad Bortles, who has four turnovers and only two touchdown passes in two losses? \nMore of the former, and the Jaguars (2-2) will have a chance to compete in what seems to be a pretty winnable AFC South. More of the latter, and the team could be staring at a seventh consecutive season of double-digit losses and an 11th consecutive season without a winning record. Blake Bortles completed just 15 of 35 passes, with a passer rating of 52.1, in Jacksonville's loss to the Jets. Dennis Schneidler/USA Today Sports \nBut since Bortles can fluctuate from game to game -- and sometimes even within games -- it\u2019s hard for the Jaguars to be consistent on offense. That\u2019s the main reason they aren\u2019t winning. \n\u201cWhen you lose a game, it\u2019s hard to say anyone played well,\u201d coach Doug Marrone said after the Jaguars\u2019 overtime loss to the New York Jets on Sunday. \u201cI think everyone will want to play better, want to get plays back, and want to do those types of things. No different than me. I want to get some calls back and obviously everyone else [does]. So I think when you don\u2019t perform well, you\u2019re going to look back and obviously you want to do a better job than what happened.\u201d \nIt clearly was Bad Bortles at MetLife Stadium. He completed 15 of 35 passes, which marked the second-lowest completion percentage of his career (42.9 percent). His passer rating of 52.1 was the sixth-lowest of his career. \nThat came one week after he posted his second-highest passer rating and threw for four touchdowns in a rout of Baltimore. \nThe Jaguars don\u2019t have top receiver Allen Robinson (torn ACL) and have gotten almost no production out of the tight end position other than Marcedes Lewis\u2019 three TD catches against Baltimore. Opposing defenses are ganging up to stop the run (an NFL-high 48 carries have come against eight or more defenders in the box). That puts a lot of pressure on Bortles to make good decisions, be accurate with the ball and not commit turnovers. \nWhen he does that, the Jaguars can win games. When he doesn\u2019t, their chances drop significantly. \nBortles in the Jaguars\u2019 two victories: 59.6 percent completions, 369 yards, five TDs, no turnovers, no sacks. \nBortles in the Jaguars\u2019 two losses: 50.7 percent completions, 363 yards, two TDs, four turnovers (three INTs), three sacks. \nBortles\u2019 erratic play makes it hard on offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett. The Jaguars spend the week implementing a game plan and going over how Hackett will call the game, but they may have to junk it not because of anything the defense is doing, but because Bad Bortles shows up on Sunday. \nUnfortunately for the Jaguars, there\u2019s not much they can do because Bortles\u2019 Jekyll & Hyde identity is well established at this point in his career. He\u2019ll be making his 50th career start on Sunday in Pittsburgh, and the Jaguars just have to hope Good Bortles shows up at Heinz Field. \nAnd for much of the rest of the season.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blake bortles", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hyde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcedes lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allen robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug marrone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ake bortles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hackett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bortles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathaniel hackett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jacksonville jaguars", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york jets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metlife stadium", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heinz field", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:43:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a26b0fd731a281ec936279e39832cebf71ab14f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbRCVCQ1iqRTjfRP73pM2mnmQMvcpjK4nfLofnMAeKghjMEvfugZwmkeykd_KxHk1ShbPBuBUxssRN.6z7CPUVozilaqYri0hRyp.INAgf4vmc6CAwGz4zTxzA0rkI6qAC", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "NFL on Yahoo!

Beathard . \n\"No, I wouldn't,\" Shanahan said. \"I look at each game where, I know we're 0-4 and it feels extremely bad when you're 0-4, I've been in that situation in the NFL and it doesn't feel good, but you don't want to lose perspective. So you try to look at each game as it is, and I know we're 0-4 right now, but when you lose a total of three games by eight points -- I know we very easily could be 3-1 -- and you don't want to make drastic changes just for one reason, as there's a lot of things that go into losing games. It's never just one guy, and I try to put all that into thought.\" \nShanahan has taken note of some of Hoyer's struggles, but he's also keeping in mind that Hoyer hasn't gotten much help from pass-catchers not named Pierre Garcon and has also had inconsistent protection upfront, particularly on the interior. The first four games have mostly been a struggle for 49ers quarterback Brian Hoyer. Norm Hall/Getty Images \nNone of which is to say that Shanahan feels like Hoyer is playing as well he can right now, just that it would help Hoyer if he had guys around him helping out. \n\"I think he needs to play better, and I think we need to play better around him,\" Shanahan said. \"It's similar to what I said [Sunday] night, when you have the time and you've got guys open, you need to hit them. And I thought he struggled with that at times last night, which I know he can do better, and he does also, but I also know when he did make some key throws, guys weren't great at catching them for him, either. \n\"I think it's a two-way street. I think it takes everyone, coaches included. We all need to do better, and that's what we've got to do.\" \nHoyer's misfires on Sunday resulted in a 24-of-49 for 234 yards with an interception performance that left the Niners able to muster just five field goals in a game that was there for the taking. \nThe loss to Arizona had to be a bit disheartening for Hoyer after he took a big step forward in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Rams . But through his first four games as the 49ers quarterback, that effort against the Rams has been the outlier, which probably shouldn't be a surprise given Hoyer's journeyman status. \n\u201cObviously, I probably missed a few throws,\" Hoyer said. \"I have to get that figured out and then just keep going.\" \nHoyer is completing 58 percent of his passes for 858 yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions for a passer rating of 67.9 and a QBR of 23.7 this season.

With quarterback Jay Cutler under center, Miami was shut out for the first time since Dec. 22, 2013. \nAfter a decent regular-season debut in Los Angeles, Cutler has put together back-to-back poor performances. After studying the film, here is a breakdown of Cutler\u2019s outing against the Saints: \nStats: 20 of 28, 164 yards, one interception, 71.1 passer rating. \nBest throw : Cutler had 20 completions. But similar to last week, most of them didn\u2019t make much of an impact. Cutler\u2019s best throw was a smart read to tight end Julius Thomas over the middle on a busted play by New Orleans. Thomas was left open in the middle, and Cutler found him in stride to allow Thomas to get yards after the catch in what turned out to be a 23-yard completion. Jay Cutler is completing a high percentage of his passes, but it hasn't led to much. Photo by Shaun Brooks/Actionplus/Icon Sportswire \nWorst throw: Cutler threw an interception for the second straight game, and it was another bad throw that took the air out of the offense. The Dolphins were in the process of driving for a touchdown on their first drive, and on the 15th play of the drive Cutler threw a bad lob to Thomas from the 4-yard line that was intercepted by Saints corner Ken Crawley . Cutler failed to set his feet and threw a flat pass inside, which made it tough for Thomas to make a play. \nWhat I liked overall: Cutler is completing passes at a pretty high clip. He had a 71.4 completion percentage against the Saints. Cutler continues to have a solid chemistry with receiver DeVante Parker , who had six receptions for 69 yards. Their slant routes are among the best plays Miami has had on offense this season. \nWhat I didn\u2019t like overall: Cutler didn\u2019t look confident for the second straight week. Bad body language is showing more and more as the offense struggles. There was a Wildcat play in the first quarter where Cutler looked completely disinterested in being a decoy. Despite a solid completion percentage, Cutler\u2019s accuracy still needs to improve. He is not putting the ball in spots for his receivers to make bigger gains. Cutler also is not challenging defenses deep, which is a strength of his, and isn\u2019t handling the blitz with consistency because at times he holds the ball too long. Cutler was sacked a season-high four times against New Orleans. He also fumbled, but it was recovered by Miami. \nGrade: D-minus \nWhat\u2019s next: Cutler and the Dolphins (1-2) will play their first game of the season at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans (2-2). Tennessee is coming off its worst loss of the season, a 57-14 drubbing by the Houston Texans .

But when you see the same thing often enough, it will start to disappear. \nIt would have been impossible to be inside Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday afternoon and miss Wisconsin safety D'Cota Dixon take off from his spot in the secondary to meet Thorson in the end zone on what amounted to the last significant play of a 33-24 Wisconsin win. \nThe battered Wildcats quarterback said he should have thrown the ball away, \"no ifs, ands, or buts.\" Instead, Dixon dragged him down in the end zone for Wisconsin's eighth sack of the day and a game-clinching safety. \n\"This is our defense,\" said senior linebacker Garret Dooley , who contributed three of the eight sacks that kept Thorson on the run and looking over his shoulder. \"I think it's similar to the last couple years. That's kind of how we've always been.\" \nWisconsin's defense is once again a Wisconsin defense. The Badgers held veteran running back Justin Jackson to a total of 25 rushing yards and kept Northwestern's offense more or less dormant until a late scoring surge in the final five minutes of the fourth quarter. Garret Dooley had three of Wisconsin's eight sacks in its victory over Northwestern this past Saturday. Dan Sanger/Icon Sportswire \nDespite introducing its third defensive coordinator in as many years, Wisconsin enters October in its normal position among the nation's 10 best units in scoring defense, rushing defense, total defense and third-down defense. \nThe strength of this iteration of the Badgers' defense under Jim Leonhard is, as usual, its balance and variety. Saturday was Dooley's day at center stage, but on any given day that spotlight could just have easily belonged to Dixon, T.J. Edwards , Ryan Connelly or any number of other plug-and-play, high-energy, low-visibility defenders wearing a red jersey. \nSix different Badgers contributed to the sack total against Northwestern -- two linemen, two linebackers and two defensive backs. Wisconsin players said they could feel momentum start to build in their favor after a third-down stop on the first series of the game and steadily increase as Thorson and company tried to sort out where the pressure would come from next. It felt familiar. \n\"It was a bunch of energy plays with guys not giving up on the backside and getting to the quarterback,\" Edwards said. \"I think [that comes from] just the start of Big Ten season. It's so fun to get out there with physical football.\" \nWisconsin heads into the thick of its league schedule as the No. 9 team in the nation and a heavy favorite to play for a Big Ten title for the second straight year. There is a good chance you'll hear less about them than any other program in a similar position during the next six weeks due to a combination of an uninspiring slate of opponents and the rest of the college football world perhaps falling victim to the same trap that snared Thorson late in Madison this weekend. \nWe've seen this Wisconsin plenty of times before. We won't know for sure if this group is capable of getting over the hump that separates 10-win seasons from championship seasons until mid-November when another top-10 team, Michigan, comes to town. \nThe formula of a strong running game and a suffocating defense -- \"complementary football\" is what head coach Paul Chryst calls it -- is 5-5 against ranked opponents in the past three-plus seasons, a coin flip. Maybe that's why it's easy to overlook the threat Wisconsin could be to the East Division juggernauts and others beyond the Big Ten. If you see something often enough, it starts to disappear. \nChryst's Badgers have never been far from climbing that last bit of the mountain, though. His record in Madison is 25-6 and -- save for a loss to No. 3 Alabama in his debut -- his teams have never lost by more than a touchdown. They've never been more than one or two big plays -- such as a game-clinching safety in the fourth quarter -- away from victory. Defenders such as Edwards and Dooley said in their minds that making sure they finish strong is the key to taking the next leap forward as a program. \nDixon's sack on Saturday was fueled a bit by revenge. Thorson shucked an earlier tackle attempt from the safety with a strong stiff arm. Dixon tracked down the quarterback during postgame handshakes to let him know he wasn't going to let them happen to him twice. \n\"I had to get you on that one, brother,\" he said. \nPerhaps that's why Thorson hung on to the ball while he watched Dixon streaking toward him at full speed. Maybe he thought he could escape. Maybe he didn't see the threat barreling forward in broad daylight, hidden in plain sight.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "clayton thorson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jim leonhard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan connelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d'cota dixon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dooley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garret dooley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul chryst", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dixon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "t.j. edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thorson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chryst", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "badgers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildcats", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wis.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camp randall stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:01:49.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "19be1d912919509f7df31bd0cc9210b037736656", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbveKV7t4WLDBa99vSusKh.StlT7MNf.BmiP5KP2jXmY.wcWXT262xHm3n4QxEumreZpNqILDpiJEX10WeN4uUgr_Z_Ocu1v2QV_3hhFsjL5n4OtWqq9a6xUKcxsdpC8nP8OJDhpe4gZY-", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=dallas-cowboys", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - Dallas Cowboys", "title": "Anthony Hitchens' return should affect Jaylon Smith's snap count", "title_full": "Anthony Hitchens' return should affect Jaylon Smith's snap count", "published": "2017-10-03T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1002%2Fr268195_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "19be1d912919509f7df31bd0cc9210b037736656", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbveKV7t4WLDBa99vSusKh.StlT7MNf.BmiP5KP2jXmY.wcWXT262xHm3n4QxEumreZpNqILDpiJEX10WeN4uUgr_Z_Ocu1v2QV_3hhFsjL5n4OtWqq9a6xUKcxsdpC8nP8OJDhpe4gZY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Anthony Hitchens' return should affect Jaylon Smith's snap count", "text": "comment \nFRISCO, Texas -- Since the Dallas Cowboys did not lose their second game in 2016 until December, many are wondering if the 2017 Cowboys are staring at 8-8 even with 12 games to play. \nIt might be a tad early to wonder that, but there are signs that the Cowboys\u2019 start looks a lot like their 8-8 finishes from 2011-13. \nThere\u2019s other wonders. Five of them actually. \nAway we go: Jaylon Smith has exceeded expectations in what he has done in the first month, but he probably shouldn't be an every-down linebacker. Andrew Dieb/Icon Sportswire \n** Jaylon Smith played every snap of Sunday\u2019s loss to the Rams. He was forced to do so because Sean Lee was out with a hamstring strain. Smith\u2019s comeback from a serious knee injury has been almost miraculous, but I wonder if his time as an every-down linebacker needs to come to an end. Anthony Hitchens is closing in on a return from a knee injury suffered in the preseason. Truth be told, Hitchens probably was the Cowboys\u2019 best defender in the preseason. He is a three-down linebacker and instinctive. Smith has exceeded expectations in what he has done in the first month, but the Rams isolated him in coverage and he was unable to shed blocks well enough in the run game. That doesn\u2019t mean Smith won\u2019t be a big playmaker down the road, but he doesn\u2019t look to be moving great. Hitchens\u2019 return will help this defense. \n** Raise your hand if you put a \u201cW\u201d next to the Rams game when the schedule came out in the spring. So did I. The Rams are improved and Sean McVay is doing an excellent job with his offense, but that was a game the Cowboys should have won. And now I wonder where the Cowboys steal a game down the road. Sunday\u2019s game against the Green Bay Packers will be difficult because of Aaron Rodgers even if his offense is beat up. Do the Cowboys beat the Kansas City Chiefs ? At the Atlanta Falcons ? Hey, Buffalo won there Sunday. At Oakland? Against Seattle? The Cowboys have to win the games \u201cthey\u2019re supposed to win,\u201d whatever that means in a league that is so tightly contested, but now they have to win a game \u201cthey\u2019re not supposed to win.\u201d \n** Not only are Cole Beasley\u2019s catches way down compared to last year, but in the last two weeks so are his snaps. And I wonder why. As much as Ezekiel Elliott is the key to the Cowboys\u2019 offense, Beasley and Jason Witten are big reasons why the Cowboys move the chains and neither has been involved much the last two games. Beasley had 23 catches in the first four games last year. He has 11 through the first four games this year. After playing in 109 of the 145 snaps in the first two games, he has played in 56 of 118 snaps in the last two. That\u2019s a huge drop off in play-time percentage. As much as people want to make of the Dak Prescott -to- Dez Bryant connection, the lack of success of the Prescott-to-Beasley connection is hurting this offense. \n** I wonder if we started to see the rotation of safeties with Kavon Frazier getting more defensive snaps against the Rams. He took a series from Byron Jones and Jeff Heath in both halves. I\u2019m not so sure the move was made because of what Frazier had done defensively or what Jones and Heath had not done in the first three games. The Cowboys went with a rotation at safety at times in 2015 when J.J. Wilcox struggled. It\u2019s not been the best of starts for Jones or Heath. Jones had a strong spring and summer, but he has not been able to make the impact plays on the back end through the first month of the season. Heath took a bad angle on Todd Gurley\u2019s touchdown catch and things have not gone great for him either. \n** If the Cowboys want to add David Irving to the active roster to play Sunday against Green Bay, they would need to release a player, but they have a one-game exemption for Irving, who is coming off a suspension for violating the substance-abuse policy. If the Cowboys do make the move, I wonder if they would release cornerback Bene Benwikere ? In order for the Cowboys to give the Cincinnati Bengals their sixth-round pick in 2019 to complete the trade, Benwikere will have to be on their 46-man roster for two more games.

He had 412 yards on 94 carries in the Cowboys\u2019 3-1 start a year ago. Through the Cowboys' four games this season, he has 277 yards on 76 carries with the nine-carry, 8-yard performance against the Denver Broncos , greatly skewing the numbers. \nBut looking inside those numbers, there isn\u2019t that much of a difference. \nElliott actually had more negative runs in the first four games last year (eight) than this year (seven). He has 27 carries of 1 yard or fewer this season; he had 26 through the first four games last season. \nIf those are the negative numbers, Elliott must have had more big runs in the first four games last year. He had six carries of 10 yards or more through the first four games in 2016. He has four through the first four games this season. He had three runs of 20 yards or more in the first four games last year. He has two in the first four games this year. \nThere is a difference when it comes to runs of five yards or more. Thirty-five percent of Elliott\u2019s first 94 runs went for five yards or more in the first four games in 2016. This year, 31 percent (24 of 77) have gone for 5 yards or more. \nAgainst the Rams, eight of Elliott\u2019s 27 carries went for one yard or less, but none were worse than minus-one yard. He had seven carries of five yards or more, including three that went for 10 or more yards. \n\u201cIt was one of the better rushing outputs that we had, but again we try to go back and evaluate it play by play, player by player and just keep getting better and better,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThat\u2019s what our focus is.\u201d \nThe Cowboys\u2019 search for consistency has focused attention on the offensive line, where they are breaking in new starters at left guard ( Chaz Green , Jonathan Cooper ) and right tackle (La\u2019el Collins). Elliott still is finding that balance between patience and urgency with the zone scheme, which was something that clicked after his first two games. He also is having to deal with the threat of a six-game suspension, which has to have an effect on him at some level. Opposing defenses have altered their approach, and the Cowboys\u2019 adjustments have been slow or not fruitful. \nSunday\u2019s production was closer to 2016, but that doesn\u2019t mean it was perfect. \nBut it wasn\u2019t always perfect last year, either.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "elliott", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "garrett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chaz green", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la\u2019el collins", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver broncos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:07:43.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "514adf41a5d1fc530c3a36adb998d44518f90d84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdePytePgHeNeeE_kw4xOqccKbGKl4gVJ_1AvxX_0qe8dPFeKKIKjSpDl.k8_ZiQdjOuDkmRTgsm1zhXnnj0jUokZ5fRygqwS2FcQb_NIYxnxAjhkSAPC7Lnk-", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/mlb/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - MLB", "title": "Yankees rookie Judge tops MLB jersey sales", "title_full": "Yankees rookie Judge tops MLB jersey sales", "published": "2017-10-03T18:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0807%2Fr241044_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "514adf41a5d1fc530c3a36adb998d44518f90d84", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdePytePgHeNeeE_kw4xOqccKbGKl4gVJ_1AvxX_0qe8dPFeKKIKjSpDl.k8_ZiQdjOuDkmRTgsm1zhXnnj0jUokZ5fRygqwS2FcQb_NIYxnxAjhkSAPC7Lnk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Yankees rookie Judge tops MLB jersey sales", "text": "\nNew York Yankees rookie slugger Aaron Judge has finished the regular season with the best-selling jersey in baseball. \nIn fact, Judge has the best-selling rookie jersey ever, according to Major League Baseball. \nJudge bested Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs , who finished second and third, according to MLB, which released the list on Tuesday morning. \nLos Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw and Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper rounded out the top five of the list based on sales from MLBShop.com from opening day through the last day of the season. \nFour teams have multiple players on the top 20 best-selling list: The Cubs with four (Bryant, Rizzo, Javier Baez and Kyle Schwarber ), the Dodgers with three (Kershaw, Corey Seager and Cody Bellinger ), the Boston Red Sox with two ( Mookie Betts and Dustin Pedroia ) and the Yankees with two (Judge and Gary Sanchez ). Yankees rookie slugger Aaron Judge has the best-selling rookie jersey ever, according to Major League Baseball. Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports \nAt 25, Judge is not the youngest to find himself at the top of the list. Two years ago, Bryant finished the season as No. 1 at the age of 23. \nThe Yankees, not surprisingly, were always near the top of the list, including Mariano Rivera and Derek Jeter, who finished No. 2 and No. 2 in 2013 and 2014, respectively -- the years in which they retired. \nLast year the Yankees didn't have a single player in the season-ending top 20 list. \nAlong came Judge, who, amid all the hype, won the All-Star Home Run Derby in Miami and broke the rookie record for home runs with 52. \nThe collecting public couldn't get enough. His signed 2013 Bowman rookie cards sold for thousands of dollars, the price of his autograph on a ball, with an exclusive autograph deal with Fanatics, rose to $350, and Topps sold a record 16,138 cards of Judge in the 24 hours after he broke the home run mark. \nJudge's game-used jerseys sold for astronomical prices. The jersey he wore in his major league debut in August 2016 sold in July for $157,366, the highest price paid for a jersey worn in the past 15 years. Judge's jersey from the Players Weekend with \"All Rise\" on the back was recently sold by MLB for $19,999, with 100 percent of net proceeds going to charity.

Sanchez is an offensive monster relative to others at his position, and he has powerful throwing arm. He also had a tendency to let balls get through him this year, sometimes in key spots, an issue that festered to the degree that Girardi benched him and challenged him to work. \nSanchez had 16 passed balls this year, a remarkable number for a catcher who doesn\u2019t team with a knuckleball pitcher, and the 53 wild pitches charged to his pitchers when Sanchez was behind the plate were the most in the AL. The damage report: runners took 69 bases on wild pitches and passed balls in the 104 games Sanchez was behind the plate. \nOn Tuesday night, the Yankees will face a great baserunning team: Minnesota ranked No. 1 in MLB this year in this FanGraphs baserunning efficiency metric . \nThis is worth remembering when there\u2019s a runner on third base, or when Luis Severino or David Robertson or Aroldis Chapman is thinking about burying a breaking ball in the dirt in a big spot. \nByron Buxton vs. the wide-open spaces of Yankee Stadium in center field and left-center: Buxton\u2019s name is now commonly raised in the debate about the game\u2019s best center fielder, with those of Kevin Kiermaier , Billy Hamilton and Jackie Bradley Jr. Buxton led all center fielders in defensive runs saved this season with 24, and he is fully capable of ending a rally by running down a ball in the gap. \nThe strike zone of plate umpire Alfonso Marquez vs. Jason Castro\u2019s framing ability: Dallas Keuchel shut down the Yankees in the AL wild-card game in 2015 partly because his catcher, Castro, did excellent work in framing pitches at the edge of the strike zone. Castro will be behind the plate for another wild-card game on Tuesday, catching Santana, and Castro mentioned in conversation Monday afternoon that some teammates had asked him what the wild-card game is like. \nThe conditions may be right for Castro to have another good night of presentation. Santana has good command and walked only 61 batters in 211&frac13; innings during the regular season, and he likes to pitch inside, as Molitor said, to make hitters uncomfortable, to keep them off-balance. \nMarquez will be the plate umpire, and he is known as a hitters\u2019 ump, calling a smaller zone. But statistics indicate that he\u2019ll call a ball on inside pitches to right-handed batters more often than other umpires, but less often than he does when a left-handed hitter is at the plate. Marquez has been behind the plate for nine of Santana\u2019s starts, and the right-hander has a 3.39 ERA in those innings. \nSantana will probably need any advantage that Castro can provide. Key National League wild-card matchups Can Zack Greinke overcome his recent struggles on the mound? Joe Camporeale/USA Today Sports \nZack Greinke vs. his recent slump: This will be the 10th postseason start for Greinke, and the soon-to-be 34-year-old right-hander is coming off another strong season. His past two starts, however, have been among his worst. He started against the Marlins with an extra day of rest on Sept. 22 and surrendered nine hits, eight runs and three homers in four innings. He got a week off before his next start, on Friday, and struggled again, allowing six hits and two walks over four innings. \nWas this a case of a veteran pitcher pacing himself in preparation for October, with the Diamondbacks locked into the wild-card game? Or was this an older starter with more than 2,500 innings in his career somewhat tired at the end of a long season? His velocity was down slightly in his last starts, but was that more about a lack of adrenaline? \nWe\u2019ll see. By the way: The Rockies\u2019 Carlos Gonzalez has a lot of success against Greinke, with five homers among 14 hits in 42 at-bats. Neither Charlie Blackmon nor Nolan Arenado has a homer against Greinke, in 49 and 47 at-bats, respectively. \nBud Black vs. the incredible force that is J.D. Martinez: In August and September, Martinez mashed enough to actually inject himself into the chatter about the NL MVP race despite playing only two months for the Diamondbacks. Martinez clubbed 29 homers in 62 games with Arizona, and in September he had 16 homers in 24 games while batting .404. \nHe\u2019s so dangerous right now that it will be interesting to see if Black chooses to simply bypass Martinez in a big spot. \nPaul Goldschmidt vs. whatever ails him (and Jon Gray ): He has been incredibly consistent in his career, a steady source of hits and power and runs, and at the All-Star break he appeared to be a runaway favorite to win the NL MVP Award. But Goldschmidt has been bothered by an elbow problem, the details of which the Diamondbacks have not wholly revealed. Goldschmidt sat out some games down the stretch and when he was in the lineup, he wasn\u2019t himself -- Goldschmidt batted only .175 with three homers in 80 at-bats, with a .569 OPS in September. \nBaseball lore is filled with examples of players stepping up and finding a way to succeed through injuries, like Kirk Gibson in 1988, and Goldschmidt will have that opportunity now. He also will have to try to do damage against a young pitcher who has beaten him in the past -- he is 0-for-11 with five strikeouts and one walk in his career while facing Gray. \nNick Piecoro of the Arizona Republic writes here about Paul Goldschmidt\u2019s recent struggles. \nFernando Rodney vs. his command: This postseason is saturated with superstar shutdown relievers -- Kenley Jansen , Wade Davis , Craig Kimbrel , Andrew Miller , etc. Most of the bullpens are loaded. \nThen there is the matter of Rodney and the Diamondbacks. Rodney is the Arizona closer, and he posted an ERA of 4.23 during the season, with 39 saves in 45 chances. In a year in which record-setting home run numbers piled up all over the place, Rodney allowed just three homers in 55 &frac13; innings, and that\u2019s good. The current Colorado hitters have 53 at-bats against Rodney and have no homers, a remarkable statistic given the venues where most of those at-bats have taken place. \nHe also allowed 26 walks in 55 &frac13; innings in 2017. His stubborn habit of refusing to give in to hitters is in keeping with some of the greatest closers of all time, but it also means that Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo could have some tense moments in the wild-card game if Rodney falls behind some great Colorado hitters who can mash. \nThe Diamondbacks vs. their shortstop depth: Nobody would have imagined coming into this month that Arizona would have had to reach so far for shortstop help, but Nick Ahmed got hurt, and Chris Owings got hurt. Ketel Marte has filled in at the spot since early August, and has played well effectively, batting .260 and playing good defense. But in the sixth inning of Sunday\u2019s game, he had to leave the game with left hamstring tightness on this play . \nThe Diamondbacks continue to say that Marte is going to be OK, and that what happened wasn\u2019t a major injury.

They are the only active pitchers in the major leagues to have played 13 seasons or more without a single playoff appearance.\nThe longest playoff drought for any active pitcher (14 seasons) belongs to De La Rosa. The native of Monterey, Mexico, made his big league debut with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2004 and has spent most of his career (2008-16) with the Colorado Rockies .\nPrior to De La Rosa's arrival in Colorado, the Rockies were swept by the Red Sox in the 2007 World Series. Since then, the Rockies' only other postseason appearance was in 2009, when they won only one game in the NL Division Series against Philadelphia. De la Rosa was unable to play in that series because of an injured left groin. Colorado didn't return to the playoffs until this season.\n2017 MLB Postseason\nKeep up with the latest as baseball's top teams contend for the title.\n\u2022 Complete postseason guide &#187 | Picks &#187\n\u2022 Meet the four aces of October &#187\n\u2022 Judge rises to occasion in WC win &#187\n\u2022 Kurkjian: NL wild card questions &#187\n\u2022 Who throws each team's key pitch? &#187\n\u2022 Miller: Grading playoff team memes &#187\n\u2022 Quiz: Who should you root for? &#187\n\u2022 Insider ranks: Lineups &#187 | Rotations &#187\n\u2022 Schedule &#187 | Complete coverage &#187\nHernandez, who made his debut in 2005, has spent his entire 13-year career with Seattle. The Mariners haven't been to the playoffs since 2001, and they have the longest active postseason drought in the major leagues.\nHall of Famer Ferguson Jenkins, who played for the Cubs, Rangers, Phillies and Red Sox over 19 seasons, is widely considered the best pitcher to never reach the postseason, earning 284 career wins while making 594 starts.\nNow 31, Hernandez is still lagging far behind Jenkins with 160 wins in 375 starts. \"King Felix\" has pitched 2,502\u2153 innings in the big leagues, and not a single one has been in the month of October after the regular season. For De La Rosa, that number stands at 1,465\u2154 innings pitched.\nBy way of comparison, reliever Hunter Strickland pitched just seven regular-season innings for the San Francisco Giants in 2014, his first MLB season, before pitching in Game 1 of the NLDS vs. the Nationals. The Giants went on to win the World Series.\nWhile Hernandez will have to wait until next year for another crack at reaching the postseason, De La Rosa's drought may finally come to an end when the Diamondbacks host his former team, the Rockies, in the National League wild-card game on Wednesday.\n\"Ever since the team starting doing well this season, I've thought about it. I said to myself, 'I believe this is going to be my chance'. So hopefully I can pitch a bit in the playoffs. ... I think it's something everyone dreams of,\" said De La Rosa. He signed a minor league contract with Arizona prior to the start of the 2017 season after struggling last year with the Rockies, going 8-9 with a 5.51 ERA.\nWith Arizona, De La Rosa was moved to the bullpen and posted a 4.21 ERA with a 3-1 record and 17 holds, and he stranded 33 of 34 inherited baserunners. The 36-year-old made 65 appearances out of the bullpen this season, second on the D-backs to Andrew Chafin (71 games).\nAsked about his past near miss at getting his first postseason experience in 2009 and his opportunity to finally get a chance this October, De La Rosa was direct about what it will mean to him.\n\"In 2009 (the Rockies) made it to the playoffs, but in the last game I pitched in Los Angeles I got injured; I pulled my groin,\" De La Rosa said. \"I was already scheduled to pitch, but after the groin injury I couldn't pitch in the playoffs.\n\"It's something I'm really looking forward to. I want to be in the playoffs and pitch in a game. I think it will be unforgettable.\n\"You start every year thinking you will (make it to the playoffs). I was in Colorado for many years and we had good teams, but there were always injuries and we didn't have a chance to make it to the playoffs. This year I have felt really good in my new role and I think I have helped the team to get where it did, and I am really happy about that.\"\nDe La Rosa's veteran presence has been a mainstay in the Diamondbacks' bullpen this season. It's the first time De La Rosa has been a full-time reliever after spending his entire career with Colorado as a member of the starting rotation. With Colorado, he posted an 86-61 record and is the franchise's all-time leader in wins.\nAs to his possible first career playoff appearance coming on the heels of the Rockies also returning to the postseason, De La Rosa said he is happy for his former teammates, who he believes are more than worthy opponents.\n\"Well, it's a coincidence, but I know that they also have a good team. Since last year you could see that they were building a good team, and I am very happy for them. I have many friends that I left behind in Colorado and I'm really happy for them, but certainly happier for me and for my team,\" De La Rosa said.\n\"I know that they are friends of mine, but as much as they will try to get a hit against me or hit a home run, I try to get them out or strike them out. That's part of the game. As they say, there are no friends inside the lines. It's all about competing and always trying to win.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:14:07.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d6a283d4bf073d6365418619dba482866c47b86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeFtbFAMX3WaTYaCEEAObHqkP1bz5xKnFqPHT9USwdDwr", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Redskins vs. Chiefs - Game Recap - October 2, 2017 - ESPN", "title_full": "Redskins vs. Chiefs - Game Recap - October 2, 2017 - ESPN", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.774, "main_image": "http://s.espncdn.com/stitcher/sports/football/nfl/events/400951752.png?templateId=espn.com.share.1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d6a283d4bf073d6365418619dba482866c47b86", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeFtbFAMX3WaTYaCEEAObHqkP1bz5xKnFqPHT9USwdDwr", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Associated Press", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Redskins vs. Chiefs - Game Recap - October 2, 2017 - ESPN", "text": "comment \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. -- After Harrison Butker missed the first field-goal attempt of his NFL career, Chiefs coach Andy Reid walked over to the rookie and prepared to instill a little bit of confidence. \n\"He said, `I got it. I got it. I was just off a tad,\" Reid recalled of their brief exchange. \"He kind of gives you that feeling that everything's going to be OK.\" \nBetter than just \"OK.\" \nButker responded to his first-half miss Monday night by drilling three field goals in the second half, the last a go-ahead 43-yarder with 8 seconds remaining that helped Kansas City beat the Washington Redskins 29-20 and remain the only unbeaten team in the NFL. \n\"I didn't have butterflies. I felt confident,\" said Butker, who was claimed off the Carolina practice squad to replace injured kicker Cairo Santos. \"I knew it was going to come down to a field goal. I felt pretty calm. I was excited; I wasn't nervous.\" \nThe Chiefs (4-0) an exclamation point on the win when linebacker Justin Houston picked up a fumble as the Redskins (3-2) were trying to keep the game alive and returned it for a game-ending touchdown. \nThe last time there was only one unbeaten team through the first four weeks of the season was 2010, when the Chiefs were the final team standing. They went on to win the AFC West. \n\"I mean, it's the NFL. It's any given Sunday for a reason,\" said Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , who had seven catches for 111 yards and a score. \"All these teams are scheming everybody up. It's a testament to this team for especially not only being 4-0, but the way we've won.\" \nAlex Smith threw for 293 yards with touchdowns on the ground and through the air, and his 37-yard strike to Albert Wilson on a broken play that set up Butker's go-ahead kick. Kareem Hunt added 101 yards on the ground for the rookie's fourth straight 100-yard effort. \n\"Winning is more meaningful,\" Hunt said with a smile. \"I could have 50 yards as long as we win.\" \nKirk Cousins had 220 yards passing and two touchdowns for Washington, but his throw to the end zone with 50 seconds left was dropped by Josh Doctson and forced the Redskins to kick a field goal. \nThat missed opportunity came back to haunt them less than a minute later. \n\"We'll go back and try to look at different plays throughout the game that could have made a big difference,\" Cousins said. \"A tough one to lose. Felt like we had a chance there and didn't get it done.\" \nThe Redskins stunned the Chiefs early when Cousins found Terrelle Pryor over star cornerback Marcus Peters for a 44-yard touchdown pass, then drove to the goal line before settling for a field goal. \nBut the plucky Chiefs slowly fought their way back into the game. \nSmith started to find his athletic tight end down the seam, then hit Kelce with a 17-yard TD strike late in the first half. The two connected again on third down shortly after the break, and Smith scored a few plays later when he fooled the defense with a quarterback-keeper. \nThe Redskins needed fewer than 2 minutes to answer: Cousins' 69-yard pass to Vernon Davis set up a short throw to Ryan Grant , who also beat Peters, for a touchdown and a 17-14 lead. \nBut that's when injuries began to take their toll: The Redskins lost cornerbacks Josh Norman , Montae Nicholson , Kendall Fuller and Quinton Dunbar along with safety Deshazor Everett , and in the fourth quarter had just four available defensive backs. \n\"I was looking up and I'm like, `Man, we've got all backups in,\" Redskins safety D.J. Swearinger said. \"If you're number is called, you've got to step up. We've got to get better at that as well.\" \nIt was 17-all after Butker made his first field goal, and his 32-yard kick gave Kansas City the lead back. The Redskins tied the game once more when Dustin Hopkins hit from 40 yards with 47 seconds left, but that turned out to be enough time to get Butker in position for the winning kick. \n\"He has a leg,\" Hunt said, \"so I wasn't too worried. Just make it routine. He had a rough start but honestly, I believed in him, that he was going to bounce back.\" \nPREGAME TRIBUTE \nFlags flew at half-staff and there was a moment of silence before the game for victims of the Las Vegas shooting. The Redskins then locked arms for the national anthem, while everyone on the Chiefs side stood with the exception of cornerback Peters and linebacker Ukeme Eligwe . \nINJURY WATCH \nNorman left in the second quarter with a rib injury and could miss several ribs, while running back Rob Kelley joined the Redskins' defensive guys on the sideline with an ankle injury. The Chiefs lost right guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif was sidelined by a left knee injury on their second offensive play. \nUP NEXT \nWashington gets a bye week before hosting San Francisco on Oct. 13. \nKansas City returns to the road to face Houston on Sunday night. \n--- ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harrison butker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ukeme eligwe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirk cousins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terrelle pryor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cairo santos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "travis kelce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deshazor everett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montae nicholson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kendall fuller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dustin hopkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hunt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy reid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert wilson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob kelley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan grant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcus peters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh norman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.j. swearinger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vernon davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quinton dunbar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laurent duvernay-tardif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kareem hunt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh doctson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "redskins", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chiefs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington redskins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:29:45.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebe0c07c421f40386beb3ebb49f3d5fe40d153c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEb236.rAa_PL2RoBMH1ibw7NW.QFetAeKTzC9KJx84mTbHjzNOWJABAbZWcX6wmbw4Cb00qvkwOekOp5a8UuS4gurmcNWgE.p9ZeAFcmK1oUdu8ap.ZEbR4w--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "After 'good start,' Falcons ready for second quarter of season -

A turnover would almost certainly mean defeat, and indeed the Chiefs two years ago lost a game under almost identical circumstances on a fumble returned for a touchdown in the final seconds by the Denver Broncos . \nThis year, though, driving for the winning score seems almost like a sure thing for the Chiefs. They've been remarkably efficient in the fourth quarter and Monday night was no different. The Chiefs went 50 yards in 43 seconds, the winning points coming on Harrison Butker 's 43-yard field goal. \nThe Chiefs would go on to score a defensive touchdown on the final play from scrimmage to make the final score 29-20 . \nThe final offensive drive is another in a series of fourth-quarter heroics from the Chiefs. Kansas City has taken possession 13 times in the fourth quarter this season -- not counting a final kill-the-clock possession in the opener against the Patriots -- and has scored eight times. That includes six touchdowns and two field goals. The Chiefs were 2-for-2 in the final period against Washington, both scores coming on field goals. \nThe Chiefs lead the NFL with 54 points in the fourth quarter. The Eagles are next best with 41. Wide receiver Albert Wilson was one of the unexpected stars of the Chiefs' game-winning drive late in the fourth quarter. AP Photo/Charlie Riedel \n\"We practice a lot at situational football,\" said quarterback Alex Smith , who was 6-of-8 for 73 yards during the two fourth-quarter possessions Monday night. \"On offense, sometimes you have a drive to finish off a game and sometimes you've got to go get the points to win one. We've spent a lot of time in all those situations practicing them. \n\"So I think time on task is the biggest thing. We've spent a lot of time working on that stuff. I think the results have paid off for us thus far.\" \nThe smallest margin of victory for the 4-0 Chiefs is seven points, so it's easy to forget Kansas City has trailed or been tied in the final period in three of the games. \nThe Chiefs wouldn't be the NFL's last remaining unbeaten team without some big offensive fourth quarters. Smith is the NFL's third-rated passer in the final period with 321 yards and two touchdowns. \nRookie running back Kareem Hunt has been the Chiefs' other offensive star late in games. He has four of their six fourth-quarter touchdowns. \nBut the Chiefs have been getting plenty of help from role players as well. Charcandrick West scored the final touchdown against the Patriots. Chris Conley caught a 35-yard pass to set up Hunt's clinching touchdown against the Eagles. \nMonday night's unexpected fourth-quarter star was Albert Wilson . On the second play of the drive that led to Butker's field goal, Smith was forced by defensive pressure to scramble to his right. He threw on the run to Wilson, who bobbled the ball momentarily but pulled it in for a 37-yard gain. \n\"Just trying to see it, make a good decision,\" Smith said. \"Earlier I had a really similar scramble. I was coming up to the right and everybody was turning and running and I had backs to me and had a big run. I just try to play that game sometimes when I get out to the edge. \n\"I felt that time around I got some attention on me and Albert was able to hit the seam there. It's tough [because] there are a lot of times you look back on scrambles and guys are open. It's hard to see the whole field when you're moving fast and the game gets sped up a little bit on the edge. You just try to have your eyes up and make the best decision there.

Did you go bad?\nSome things will never wash away\nDid you go bad? Did you go bad?\n-- \"Fog,\" Radiohead\nOn Saturday morning I stood on The Hill in Knoxville, Tennessee. The weather was beautiful. And yet, there was a fog.\nI was there to participate in the live broadcast of SEC Network's SEC Nation. There were cheerleaders and Smokey the hound was there and the dude in the Volunteer mountain outfit was there and fans with homemade signs were there. And yet, there was a fog.\nI greeted Butch Jones on the SEC Network bus and I reached out not as a writer or reporter, but as a fellow 40-something father with Tennessee ties. I shook his hand and I asked him how he was holding up. And as he talked in coachspeak and rattled off talking points, the bus felt as if it was filling up with fog.\nI stepped off the bus, I took up my microphone, and I stood in my position for my live shot to talk about the glorious, crazy Georgia-Tennessee rivalry. And yet, I felt like if I took a deep enough breath, perhaps I would choke on the fog. But ... wait ... suddenly it wasn't a metaphorical fog. There was an actual cloud enveloping my head and I was indeed beginning to choke.\nI coughed and realized it wasn't a fog at all. It was cigar smoke. There was a tap on my shoulder. I turned to face the source of the smoke. A very old man who looked as if he might have slept on The Hill that night, dressed head-to-toe in Tennessee Big Orange, blew another puff into my face and growled ...\n\"You went to Tennessee, didn't you?\"\nUm, yes.\n\"So did I. I was here when Gen. Neyland and Bobby Dodd were here. Do you believe me?\"\nUm, yes.\n\"Everyone's in a bad mood around here. We're 3-1 and you'd think we're 1-3. You want to know why we're in such a bad mood?\"\nUm ... yes?\n\"Because you put us in that F'ing Bottom 10 of yours two weeks in a row.\"\nWith apologies to Hank Lauricella and Steve Harvey, here's this week's Bottom 10.\n1. Charlotte 0-and-5ers (0-5) Psst ... don't tell this guy sitting across from me in the South Charlotte Starbucks I'm writing in that I have Charlotte ranked at the top (bottom) of our rankings again. He has on a 49ers hat and T-shirt. OK, he just looked up at me and I winked at him. That really freaked him out. But not as much as right this second when he's reading this and realizes that the creepy dude who winked at him in the South Charlotte Starbucks is the same guy who just ranked his team No. 1 in the Bottom 10.\n2. UMess (0-6) I gotta go to New England later this month, so maybe I'll find a guy in Minutemen gear and re-enact what I just did to the 49ers guy, only in a Dunkin Donuts.\n3. UTEP (0-5) The good news: If you had UTEP in your office's First Bottom 10 Coach To Lose His Job betting pool, you win! The bad news: If your office is the kind of place that has a First Bottom 10 Coach To Lose His Job betting pool, then you'd already lost.\n4. Baylor (0-5) It has been so odd this season how Kansas fans have reached out to express their resentment over Baylor being in the Bottom 10 while they aren't. Wrote one reader: \"We're the team that worked so hard to make being the Big 12's Bottom 10 representative a cool thing. Now Baylor is swooping in and taking advantage of that.\" Have no fear, Nayhawk fans. This will be settled on the field in Lawrence four weekends from now. Just in time for Halloween.\n5. LS...ooh The SEC continues to grip the Coveted Fifth Spot like Mike the Tiger with his claws in a side of beef. The Tigers not only lost to Troy, they were never really in the game in the second half. After the game head coach Ed Orgeron said, \"Well, weah gunnado whaddawecan tuh tuhrn dis hoeting uhrownd. Etz canduhlike ya momma win sheez tryunta saveapottabadgumbo.\" So, first Troy took the Tigers' money. Then the Trojans ran up the score on them after the game was over.\nBiggest Paycheck Losses This Year:\nLSU paid Troy $985K\nSyracuse paid MTSU $950K\nRutgers paid E. Michigan $860K\nNebraska paid NIU $820K\n\u2014 Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) October 1, 2017\nHey @LSU , thanks for having us down for homecoming! We really enjoyed it! \ud83d\ude01\n\u2014 Troy University (@TROYUnews) October 1, 2017\n6. Boiling Green (0-5) Saturday's MACtion Pillow Fight Bunkhouse Stampede doubleheader was all that we could have dreamed of, as the Bottom 10 teams successfully circled the wagons and defended their positions. It began with BGSU falling to then-1-3 Akron, which became 2-3 Akron so-0-4 BGSU became 0-5 BGSU.\n7. State of Kent (1-4) Then the 1-3 Flashes lost to 2-2 Buffalo, which became 3-2 Buffalo and 1-4 Kent. And that's when it hit us. If you try to circle the wagons with only two wagons, you aren't circling anything. You've become a real-life version of that spinning update circle my laptop is always getting stuck on.\n8. No-vada (0-5) Heads up, y'all. No-vada travels to San No-se State on Nov. 11 in what is likely to be a Bottom 10 Western Division elimination game. I'm going to go ahead and call it the No Bowl, presented by the Terrible Two-Year-Olds of America.\n9. ECYew (1-3) Pirates fans -- especially the ones I'm related to -- are already complaining that we have moved their school back into the Bottom 10 and moved 1-3 UConn out despite ECU defeating the Huskies head-to-head just two weeks ago. Well, sorry, but life isn't fair. Right, Ruffin McNeill?\n10. UNC Tear Heels (1-4) I was on my way back from Knoxville late Saturday night and stopped in Asheville, North Carolina. I asked a mail carrier who was pumping gas in a U.S. Postal Service truck where he was headed. \"Knoxville, Tennessee,\" he answered. \"This truck is full of thank you notes to Butch Jones from Larry Fedora.\"\nWaiting list: U-Can't (1-3), B-WHY?!-U (1-4), Living on Tulsa Time (1-3), Kansas Nayhawks (1-3), In A Rut-gers (1-4), Minute Rice (1-4), San No-se State (1-4), OH-regon State (1-4), Miss-eww (1-3) and again, basically the entire Fun Belt (12 teams, 1 with a winning record)", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "booger mcfarland", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kent", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry fedora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ruffin mcneill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "troy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hank lauricella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby dodd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed orgeron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren rovell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nayhawk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butch jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smokey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lsu", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sec network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec nation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trojans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utep", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunkin donuts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huskies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south charlotte starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "lolsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "knoxville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san no-se state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neyland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee big orange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asheville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:44:48.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a33795a033434c0e94613b22b69983a1ffebf0c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeBAtK9PAIxjpZZ4PazWm5QPYcjvLfRvYy_2r70pyKkQwOqDwFe3DATeHniGMH4vxERj19MmqjRpRsad9NZlh7xCTFkMVd3ibcyHcGsOuuWY_LZiN89Sv4YBgQD1ORCYntJvkdbNK7l2TBCyNX8vANLL300WVt0ZwOfXSMG_iGDIPoPzBMdzG6Qk-", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - TOP", "title": "Louisville and the history of overcoming scandal", "title_full": "Louisville and the history of overcoming scandal", "published": "2017-10-03T17:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1003%2Fr268429_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a33795a033434c0e94613b22b69983a1ffebf0c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeBAtK9PAIxjpZZ4PazWm5QPYcjvLfRvYy_2r70pyKkQwOqDwFe3DATeHniGMH4vxERj19MmqjRpRsad9NZlh7xCTFkMVd3ibcyHcGsOuuWY_LZiN89Sv4YBgQD1ORCYntJvkdbNK7l2TBCyNX8vANLL300WVt0ZwOfXSMG_iGDIPoPzBMdzG6Qk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Louisville and the history of overcoming scandal", "text": "Oct 3, 2017 John Gasaway ESPN Insider Close ESPN Insider college basketball contributor First began covering college hoops in 2004 Has written for Basketball Prospectus and the Wall Street Journal Follow on Twitter print comment Louisville is far from the first blue-chip basketball program to get into trouble, though the Cardinals do possess the added distinction of being investigated by no less an authority than the federal government. Who knows, maybe that extra level of scrutiny and magnitude will make all the difference and the program will be crippled indefinitely or even discontinued entirely .\nThen again, other top programs have found themselves in serious trouble only to live to tell the tale. Indeed, UCLA, Kansas, Kentucky and Indiana have all run afoul of the rules in the game's modern era. (To say nothing of the Wildcats' brush with point-shaving in the 1950s.)\nWhat do these precedents say about Louisville's future? They say that, absent some sort of federal interdiction or NCAA death penalty, the Cardinals could be back sooner rather than later.\nSome hard days are ahead for Louisville. But just how long will it take for the Cardinals to recover? Ian Johnson/Icon Sportswire Here's a quick review of what happened at other programs:\nUCLA\nIn 1981, the long-rumored (and occasionally documented) activities of booster Sam Gilbert finally caught up with the Bruins basketball program . The NCAA hit UCLA with two years of probation, imposed a one-season NCAA tournament ban and forced the program to vacate its run to the 1980 national championship game. The Bruins' coach at the time, Larry Brown, jumped to the NBA as head coach of the New Jersey Nets.\nScandal hit : 1981\nNext coach : Larry Farmer\nNext NCAA tournament : 1983\nAftermath : In the mid-1980s, UCLA missed three consecutive NCAA tournaments for the first time since 1961. Though the Bruins didn't get back to a Sweet 16 until 1990 under Jim Harrick, the coach subsequently took UCLA to a national title in 1995. The following year, Harrick was fired for lying on an expense report related to a dinner with twin recruits Jason and Jarron Collins .\nKansas\nJust seven months after winning the 1988 national championship, the Jayhawks became the first team in NCAA tournament history to be barred from defending its title. That fall, the NCAA imposed a one-year postseason ban on KU to go along with three years of probation. The penalties were levied in response to recruiting violations related to a potential transfer (who never played in Lawrence), later identified as Vincent Askew . In its ruling, the NCAA pointedly noted that it had seriously considered shutting down the Kansas basketball program entirely for the 1988-89 season. The Jayhawks' coach at the time, Larry Brown, jumped to the NBA as head coach of the San Antonio Spurs .\nScandal hit : 1988\nNext coach : Roy Williams\nNext NCAA tournament : 1990\nAftermath : Few programs have recovered from a postseason ban as quickly as Kansas did under Williams, who had never previously served as a head coach. During his first season, the Jayhawks were ranked as high as No. 16 in the AP poll and finished 19-12. The following season, KU posted a 30-5 record and earned a No. 2 seed in the 1990 NCAA tournament. During his 15-year tenure in Lawrence, Williams won nine conference titles and led Kansas to four Final Fours.\nKentucky\nRumors started to swirl around the Wildcats program in 1988, when a package from an assistant coach addressed to recruit Chris Mills came open in transit and was found to contain $1,000 in cash. The school was hit with an NCAA notice of allegations that October, leading to the resignation of Cliff Hagan as athletic director in November. Head coach Eddie Sutton resigned the following March, after UK had recorded a 13-19 season. Then, on May 19, 1989, the NCAA put Kentucky on a three-year probation, which included a two-year postseason ban. In addition, Eric Manuel was barred from further NCAA competition and Mills was prohibited from playing for the Wildcats.\nScandal hit : 1989\nNext coach : Rick Pitino\nNext NCAA tournament : 1992\nAftermath : UK went 14-14 under Pitino in 1989-90, marking the last time the program has failed to finish over .500 in a regular season. The program quickly rebounded. In its first NCAA tournament appearance under Pitino, UK reached the 1992 Elite Eight, only to lose a rather famous game to Duke and Christian Laettner . Kentucky went on to win two championships and play in three consecutive national title games from 1996 to 1998, the last of those under Tubby Smith.\nIndiana\nWhen Kelvin Sampson was hired by the Hoosiers in 2006, he already was being investigated by the NCAA due to recruiting violations committed while he was head coach at Oklahoma (the sanctions for which hadn't officially been imposed yet). That history replayed itself in Bloomington. Sampson stepped down as the IU head coach in February 2008. And that November, the NCAA hit Indiana with three years of probation as punishment for more than 100 impermissible phone calls made to recruits by Sampson and his staff during his first season with the Hoosiers. Sampson was personally subjected to a five-year show-cause penalty.\nScandal hit : 2008\nNext coach : Tom Crean\nNext NCAA tournament : 2012\nAftermath : Not many blue-chip programs have ever been laid low in terms of roster strength the way Indiana was in 2008-09. That season, the Hoosiers went 6-25 overall and 1-17 in Big Ten play. Nevertheless, IU effectively declared it was back in business as early as the fall of 2010, when Crean won a fierce recruiting battle against the likes of Butler head coach Brad Stevens and North Carolina's Roy Williams and signed in-state prospect Cody Zeller . One year later, Indiana won a game for the ages against eventual national champion Kentucky; it was the same season in which the Hoosiers reached the first of three Sweet 16s under Crean.\nThese prior examples suggest that once the dust settles, Louisville could well attract a top coach who might return the team to elite status in relatively short order. Blue-chip programs have repeatedly demonstrated remarkable recuperative powers.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "larry brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tubby smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent askew", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric manuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pitino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jarron collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "butler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim harrick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eddie sutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cliff hagan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam gilbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom crean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian johnson/icon sportswire  here", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rick pitino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cody zeller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayhawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris mills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry farmer next", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelvin sampson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sampson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hoosiers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayhawks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey nets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bruins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san antonio spurs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildcats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy williams next ncaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lawrence", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:44:51.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0e370e3de49d4c69601e01e2faa57eb0b6ad7f0c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeBAtK9PAIxjpZZ4PazWm5QPYcjvLfRvYy_2r70pyKkQwOqDwFe3DATeHniGMH4vxERj19MmqjRpRsad9NZlh7xCTFkMVd3ibcyHcGsOuuWY_LZiN89Sv4YBgQD1ORCYntJvkdbNK7l2TBCyNX8vANLL300WVt0ZwOfXSMG_iGDIPOtmoPVGFXk9K292Q3AXumw--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaab/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "NCAAB on Yahoo!

(0:27) comment \nAfter a somewhat routine first two weeks of the season, the latter two have upped the excitement level for NFL fans, with a few unexpected losses by several teams with Super Bowl expectations. \nLet's take a look at how players from the diaspora fared in week four, with a number of names shining in wins for their teams. \nNotable performances by African players \nCedric Ogbuehi (Cincinnati Bengals OT #70) - The Bengals left tackle didn't start the game on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns as coach Marvin Lewis decided to rotate his tackles, but in the 48% of offensive snaps that he did play, Ogbuehi had perhaps his best performance of the season. \nThe Texas A&M alum didn't allow a single quarterback pressure or sack in the game, which the Bengals won 31-7 . With his performance against the winless Browns, Ogbuehi may have done enough to give his coaches, and himself, a little confidence boost heading into Sunday's game against the Buffalo Bills. How to get Kwes\u00e9 TV \nKwes\u00e9 TV is changing the way in which African fans consume television with a wide array of sports and entertainment on offer. How can you join the party?

After a big game in the Jags' week one victory over the Houston Texans, Ngakoue was relatively quiet over the next couple of games but showed up in a big way this past Sunday. \nNgakoue, who is Cameroonian, is putting together a quality season while making fans, coaches, and the media learn his name as he makes an impression on the league. \nNelson Agholor (Philadelphia Eagles WR #13) - Nigeria's Agholor didn't have a flashy game by any means but his consistent play so far this season deserves mention. After a rough first couple of seasons in Philadelphia, Agholor is showing signs of becoming a dependable receiver. In the Eagles' 26-24 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers , Agholor caught three passes on four targets for a total of 58 yards. \nLagos-born Agholor currently has two touchdowns, which is already as many as he had all of last season. If he keeps up his level of consistent play, Agholor might just end up with 10 touchdowns by the final week of the season. Derick E. Hingle/USA TODAY Sports \nDavid Onyemata (New Orleans Saints DT #93) - The defensive tackle from Lagos, by way of the University of Manitoba in Canada, got his first NFL sack on this play versus the Dolphins. Onyemata ended up with just one tackle but he provided the Saints with pressure on the Dolphins as he finished with a tackle for a loss and a QB hit on the day. \nThe Saints have made the rebuilding of their defense a major point in the off-season but if Onyemata, drafted in the fourth round of the 2016 NFL draft, can continue providing that level of play from the interior of the defensive line for the rest of the season, the Saints will eagerly take it. \nEmmanuel Ogbah (Cleveland # 90) - The Browns defensive end bettered his performance from last week as he was all over the Cincinnati Bengals backfield this past Sunday. Six tackles, one sack, two QB pressures, 3.5 tackles for a loss, two forced fumbles and one fumble recovery saw Ogbah end up as one of the highest graded Browns players on the day. \nThis strip sack on Cincinnati Bengals QB Andy Dalton was one of the brighter moments for Cleveland. Unfortunately for Ogbah,his superb performance came in another Browns loss, this time to the division rival Bengals. \nAfrican player of the week \"If you're Drew Brees, you're happy to have a guy like him,\" one Panthers player said of Alvin Kamara. Brad Rempel/USA TODAY Sports \nAlvin Kamara (New Orleans Saints #41) - Despite what looked like a crowded backfield for the Saints coming into the season, coach Sean Payton has made no effort to hide his love for the rookie running back selected in the third round of this year's draft. Kamara has steadily been getting more carries in the backfield and more passes thrown to him each week and Sunday in London was no different. \nThe Liberian-American got five carries out of the backfield and was elusive enough to run for 25 yards on his five carries, but it was his receptions that won him praise this week. Kamara saw All-Pro Quarterback Drew Brees throw at him 10 times during the game and the rookie caught all 10 passes for 71 yards and one touchdown in the Saints' 20-0 victory over the Dolphins . \nPayton seems to have realized he has a game-changing running back in Kamara, who can get outside the tackles with his elusiveness yet has secure hands to catch passes out of the backfield and turn short yardage into long gains. If Kamara keeps this up , he might be able to get in the conversation for rookie of the year. \nKamara's post-game quotes to the media \nOn receiving a lot of plays called for him: \nI think it just kinda flowed that way. We had a lot of calls for me and every week I'm just going with the flow, so whichever way the game goes I'm just ready. My number was called a lot tonight and I had to take advantage. \nOn the running back competition: \nWhenever any of our numbers are called, we know what the standard is. The standard was set by Mark (Ingram) and A.D. (Adrian Peterson) That pushed me... we all push each other. So whenever my number is called, I just execute to the best of my abilities. \nOn his touchdown: \nIt was a play we just dialed up this week. That's one of those special plays where you're like, 'Alright we're practicing it but are we gonna run it?'. We dialed it up, ran it. I yelled out to Ted, ...Ted had the jet motion...and I told him to go fast because I knew they would kinda bite down on him. So he went fast and perfect pitch from Drew and we got in the end zone. \nAfrican players to watch in week 5 \nBrian Orakpo (Tennessee Titans OLB #98) - \"Osackpo\" had a quiet game by his standards against the Texans and their patchwork offensive line this past Sunday (five tackles in the 57-14 loss ). Next up for the Titans will be the Miami Dolphins. The Dolphins' offensive line has been substandard (again) to start this season. The Dolphins have failed to open up running lanes and protect QB Jay Cutler while he's in the pocket. If playing at home for the first time all season isn't the tonic the Dolphins need, Orakpo should be able to have his way against the Miami tackles on Sunday. \nPatrick Onwuasor (Baltimore Ravens ILB #48 ) - Onwuasor has been a revelation this season. Not to the Ravens players and coaches (who already knew what they had in him after his performances the past two training camps) but to Ravens fans (and fans of opposing teams) looking to see who would step up at weak side linebacker this season. \nComing off a seven-tackle performance versus the Jacksonville Jaguars, Onwuasor had three tackles (including a tackle for a loss) in the Ravens' loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers . Going up against the Oakland Raiders, featuring running back Marshawn Lynch and tight end Jared Cook, Onwuasor will see his physicality get tested in run defense, as well as his versatility when dropping back to cover. The California-born Nigerian-American is currently being rotated at the weak side linebacker position and will hope a strong performance against the Raiders will help his case for the starting spot next to middle linebacker C.J. Mosley. \nEzekiel Ansah (Detroit Lions DE #94) - Ziggy had an excellent start to the season on Monday Night Football against the New York Giants in week 2, as he tallied up three sacks and a forced fumble while playing a limited number of snaps (28) on his return from injury. Ansah was ineffective the following week despite playing 33 snaps as the Lions lost a close game to the Atlanta Falcons. Coming off a three-tackle performance against the Minnesota Vikings this past Sunday , Ziggy will look to provide the Lions with more consistent pressure on the Carolina Panthers in the next game. \nThe Panthers' offensive line has been poor for the most part this season but got a massive confidence boost with their performance in a victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday. Ansah will provide the Panthers' O-line with another stern test in week 5.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kamara", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dalton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nelson agholor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adrian peterson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean payton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agholor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick onwuasor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jay cutler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ziggy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ogbuehi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ezekiel ansah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ogbah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "payton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian orakpo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cedric ogbuehi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andy dalton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drew brees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "c.j. mosley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ansah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "onwuasor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngakoue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derick e. hingle/usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orakpo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ted", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel ogbah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all-pro quarterback drew brees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshawn lynch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alvin kamara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david onyemata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yannick ngakoue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marvin lewis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nfl africa zone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "minnesota vikings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oakland raiders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raiders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta falcons", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffalo bills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans saints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville jaguars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kwes\u00e9 tv  kwes\u00e9 tv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore ravens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cincinnati bengals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas a&m", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jags", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york jets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pittsburgh steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of manitoba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles chargers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new england patriots", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lagos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "onyemata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:08:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "622914703e51e6ab2d4f790fd1dfbcba32ae30cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdePytePgHeNeeE_kw4xOqccKbGKl4gVJ_1J87eTEEPI8U2dow1DfOE5hSk2w2hXRDnWPV0Oe.e_IHfmmNrDysN6koWk9WvYUM8NuI.WKHtGRYLq0rNUJgMsVqWbXjWF1fTQ--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/rss/mlb/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com -

It's a valid debate and should be a fascinating discussion among the 13 committee members. Will they be more impressed by Alabama's dominance, as it has outscored its opponents 231-43 and leads the FBS in total efficiency at 97.3? Or will they reward Clemson for beating three quality opponents, including two on the road in Louisville and Virginia Tech ?\nAlabama's opponents are all unranked and a combined 11-10, and the Tide have one road win. Clemson's opponents are 15-10. Why does it matter? Seeding. The committee will not put the No. 1 seed at a geographic disadvantage. Seeding could mean the difference between Alabama playing in New Orleans at the Allstate Sugar Bowl or in Pasadena at the Rose Bowl Game Presented by Northwestern Mutual.\nEditor's Picks The soul-crushing dominance of Clemson\nCan anyone stop the Tigers? They've already gone on the road to demoralize two supposed ACC contenders thanks to a suffocating defense and an upstart QB. And here's the scary part: They see room for improvement.\nAlabama-Clemson III? You know you want it After two straight championship-game thrillers, Alabama and Clemson appear on a collision course for another classic. We can only be so lucky.\n1 Related 2. Can Mike Leach do it again? Once again, Leach has an outlier team capable of crashing the party. In 2008, Leach led Texas Tech to an 11-2 season and reached as high as No. 2 in the polls in November, the best in school history, and was named Big 12 Coach of the Year. He has similarly raised the profile of Washington State with his Air Raid offense. Now, with Friday's win over USC , Wazzu is 5-0 and in the CFP conversation. The question is if it can stay there.\n3. Can the new contending coaches build on their September success? Oklahoma's Lincoln Riley and Georgia's Kirby Smart already have earned statement nonconference road wins against Ohio State and Notre Dame , respectively, but no coach wants his team to peak in September. October is about becoming entrenched in the CFP discussion, and both Riley and Smart have worked for predecessors who know how to stay relevant through November. Can they take that blueprint and do the same?\nA loss to Georgia doesn't knock Notre Dame out of the CFP race. Robin Alam/Icon Sportswire 4. Is it too soon to start talking about Notre Dame? Brian Kelly entered this season on the hot seat, and the Irish haven't even qualified as an afterthought in the CFP race. Take a look at their October schedule, though: at North Carolina , vs. No. 14 USC and No. 24 NC State . FPI projects the Irish to be 7-1 heading into the first ranking, with wins over two teams possibly ranked by the committee and their lone loss coming to the SEC East favorites. If Notre Dame can run the table -- a big \"if\" with road trips to Miami and Stanford in November -- would the committee really leave out a one-loss Notre Dame? Especially if that loss is to the SEC East champs?\nFour one-loss teams with no margin for error 1. Ohio State (4-1) : The Buckeyes are favored by FPI to win each of their remaining games, but the Oct. 28 matchup against Penn State looms the largest. The Buckeyes lost this game last season and still finished in the top four, but that wouldn't happen this time because of their Week 2 loss to Oklahoma.\n2. USC (4-1) : The Trojans' toughest remaining game is Oct. 21 at Notre Dame. FPI gives USC just a 26.5 percent chance to win. If they don't, they're likely done.\n3. Oklahoma State (4-1) : The Cowboys can overcome their home loss to TCU , but not if they don't beat Texas on Oct. 21. Yes, Bedlam is the game that gets all of the attention, but Oklahoma State will enter the committee's first rankings having played back-to-back road games against Texas and West Virginia .\n4. Auburn (4-1) : If the Tigers win out, they're a lock for a top four spot, but they have to avoid a letdown in back-to-back road games at LSU and Arkansas heading into the first rankings.\nFour players to watch until the first rankings\nSaquon Barkley returned a kickoff and passed for a touchdown in Penn State's win over Indiana. Rich Barnes-USA TODAY Sports 1. TCU QB Kenny Hill : He's completing 73 percent of his passes and is No. 6 in the nation in Total QBR. Few, if any, would have predicted that he would be orchestrating a potential top-four run for the undefeated Frogs.\n2. Penn State RB Saquon Barkley : The Heisman front-runner has scored a touchdown running, passing, receiving and on special teams. Can he continue to dazzle against Michigan and Ohio State?\n3. Georgia QB Jake Fromm : The freshman earned the spotlight at the expense of injured starter Jacob Eason and has helped catapult the Bulldogs into the playoff debate. Kirby Smart said he's keeping the competition between the two open , but would he really bench Fromm after UGA's 5-0 start?\n4. Auburn QB Jarrett Stidham : He has clearly gotten more comfortable and more efficient since the loss to Clemson and hasn't thrown an interception in two SEC games. He's also giving the Tigers' offense a vertical passing threat. He completed four of six passes thrown more than 20 yards downfield in a win over Mississippi State . If that trend continues, Auburn should be 3-0 this month, including two road wins against LSU and Arkansas.\nFour games that will impact the first rankings 1. Oct. 21 Michigan at Penn State : This will be the Nittany Lions' first ranked opponent of the season and the best defense they will have faced. Michigan already has defeated Florida , but a road win over a top-five league opponent would catapult the Wolverines into serious CFP consideration and change the narrative in the Big Ten.\n2. Oct. 21 USC at Notre Dame : This is the most difficult remaining game on USC's schedule and the only one the Trojans aren't projected to win, per FPI. One more loss, and USC is likely done in the CFP race, barring a complete collapse elsewhere.\n3. Oct. 28 Florida vs. Georgia : If the best team in the East Division goes down in Jacksonville, Florida, so does the league's reputation. Florida has won the past three games in this series, and the Gators have won back-to-back division titles only to be outscored by Alabama 83-31 in the past two SEC championship games.\n4. Oct. 28 Penn State at Ohio State : This game could determine the East Division winner and will tell us whether the Buckeyes can overcome their Week 2 loss to Oklahoma and if Penn State can survive its only road game against a ranked opponent -- one week after playing Michigan. This is the only game ESPN's FPI doesn't favor the Nittany Lions to win.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jarrett stidham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saquon barkley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirby smart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fromm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robin alam/icon sportswire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenny hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jake fromm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacob eason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike leach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wazzu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lincoln riley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "nc state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tcu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cfp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolverines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mississippi state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulldogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frogs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penn state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nittany lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "auburn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirby smart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trojans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lsu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stanford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckeyes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cowboys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas tech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "notre dame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tigers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fpi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arkansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "notre dame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacksonville", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:35:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5d94f0eee062cbcf4ba68c157b292efbe9315974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeJ0h.JOnRM8YBsn.RhCKE1KeXQlNeYRQCIaVuzJmIRcRD1wcdJ37sebpjYPjftLsMI3ywgcaUcJuw1QzXczuAH6ueajBwSBsTBg7_3.jDHOV4DMnuqqn9.NIOAHAsj7NBTpH7C7_sqRDmHqsKwhzSyBkZmOWISZEUg--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/espn/rss/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - TOP", "title": "Deshaun Watson leads fantasy free-agent finds for Week 5", "title_full": "Deshaun Watson leads fantasy free-agent finds for Week 5", "published": "2017-10-03T18:45:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1002%2Fr268118_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5d94f0eee062cbcf4ba68c157b292efbe9315974", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeJ0h.JOnRM8YBsn.RhCKE1KeXQlNeYRQCIaVuzJmIRcRD1wcdJ37sebpjYPjftLsMI3ywgcaUcJuw1QzXczuAH6ueajBwSBsTBg7_3.jDHOV4DMnuqqn9.NIOAHAsj7NBTpH7C7_sqRDmHqsKwhzSyBkZmOWISZEUg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:45:00.000+03:00", "title": "Deshaun Watson leads fantasy free-agent finds for Week 5", "text": "Deshaun Watson , Houston Texans (rostered in 29.6 percent of ESPN leagues) \nDazzling. What more is there to say about Watson's Week 4 performance? He made this list last week. And he will be a wildly popular add. He already is advancing so significantly; Watson looked terrific as a thrower in Week 4; and he has major upside with his running skills (another rushing touchdown on Sunday). Yes, he has top-12 quarterback upside the rest of the way. \nLatavius Murray , RB, Minnesota Vikings (17.1 percent) \nThe Vikings were dealt a devastating blow when Dalvin Cook left their Week 4 game with an ACL injury. That opens the door to Murray taking over as the workhorse back, as he dominated snaps after Cook departed. Murray doesn't have nearly the same ceiling as Cook, but he's a must add in leagues of any size, as he has a legit shot at 20 touches per week. A flex consideration or RB2, depending on league size. \nWendell Smallwood , RB, Philadelphia Eagles (47.2 percent) \nWith Darren Sproles out, we knew Smallwood was due for a larger role. And he delivered in Week 4, carrying 10 times and scoring a touchdown, while adding an encouraging four catches on six targets. He's a good bet to lead Eagles backs in snaps going forward, and he has plenty of value in points per reception leagues. An add in leagues of any size, especially 12 teams or larger. \nAlvin Kamara , RB, New Orleans Saints (42.5 percent) \nThe Saints have been thrilled with Kamara since drafting him in the third round, and it's apparent why. He's a marvel in the passing game, catching a career-high 10 passes in Week 4. The Saints head to their bye in Week 5, but Kamara will be a legit flex play consideration week-to-week in most PPR leagues. Even if not as involved as Mark Ingram in the ground game, he has a chance to challenge for 45 more receptions in his remaining 12 games. He's super talented. \nWill Fuller V , WR, Houston Texans (18.9 percent) \nVolume and talent matter in a major way in fantasy football. Fuller's talent is apparent: He's an exceptional vertical threat with his combination of size and speed, but he shouldn't be pigeonholed as simply that. He hauled in a pair of touchdowns in his season debut in Week 4. With Watson at the control panels, this offense suddenly has me very intrigued in Houston. \nWayne Gallman , RB, New York Giants (0.8 percent) \nHave the Giants finally found their new lead back? Let's not go that far, but Gallman's effort on Sunday surely caught my eyes. He led the team in running back snaps played, and he posted 42 yards on 11 carries, along with a receiving touchdown. His forte coming out of Clemson was being a particularly adept pass-catching back. For a running back-needy owner in 12-team or larger leagues, he's a smart stash, especially if Paul Perkins ' rib injury lingers into Week 5. \nAaron Jones , RB, Green Bay Packers (1.3 percent) \nThis is a bit of a wait-and-see suggestion, as both Ty Montgomery and Jamaal Williams are uncertain for Week 5. That would thrust Jones, a fourth-round rookie, into a potential starting role. For a short-term fill-in, he's a name to know in the Green Bay backfield who would likely garner flex consideration for this Sunday. A third-stringer heading into last week, rookie Aaron Jones could be the lead back in Week 5 if Ty Montgomery and Jamaal Williams are unable to play. Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images \nAlex Collins , RB, Baltimore Ravens (5.9 percent) \nCollins and I have this in common: We both rushed for more yards than Terrance West in Week 4: Collins had 82 yards, I had zero and West had minus-7. Collins has run hard over the past two weeks, posting an identical nine carries for 82 yards both times out. It really feels like just a matter of time until he earns more early-game carries. He's a speculative add for anyone looking to pad running back depth. \nDevin Funchess , WR, Carolina Panthers (24.8 percent) \nFunchess faced a savory two-game slate in Weeks 3 and 4, totaling 19 targets against the Saints and Patriots. He cashed in against the generous Patriots pass defense in Week 4 with seven catches and two touchdowns. If Week 4 builds the confidence of Cam Newton all the way back, the athletic Funchess could have weekly value. \nCooper Kupp , WR, Los Angeles Rams (34.9 percent) \nThis rookie continues to make his mark for the Rams, piling up another touchdown on his five catches in Week 4. While he's the third option for the Rams' passing game, there is plenty to be enthused by with this offense. He's a worthwhile add for a deeper league, where he can be used as the flex in PPR scoring. \nD'Onta Foreman , RB, Houston Texans (23.9 percent) \nLamar Miller was excellent in Week 4, so the threat of Foreman taking over as the starter imminently remains slim. But Foreman added 13 carries for 45 yards in Week 4, and he continues to see a steady role. Again, for anyone with needs for backfield depth in a deeper league, Foreman remains a name of note. \nAndre Ellington , RB, Arizona Cardinals (29.9 percent) \nThe Cardinals are still working to find how to best substitute for David Johnson , with Ellington having emerged as a clear pass-catching favorite. He snagged nine catches in Week 4, posting his second straight double-digit effort in PPR scoring. That's the play here: If you are in a PPR league, he has value in your flex in larger leagues (14 teams or more). \nJaron Brown , WR, Arizona Cardinals (9.8 percent) \nBrown has settled into a steadier role for the Cardinals of late, averaging 9.7 targets over his past three games and posting more than 10 fantasy points in PPR scoring in each of them. For a deep league flex play, Brown fits the bill. \nElijah McGuire , RB, New York Jets (1.3 percent) \nMcGuire is the third-string running back for the Jets, but this sixth-round pick has announced himself over the past couple of weeks. He had 10 carries for 93 yards and a touchdown in Week 4. The Jets will rely on Bilal Powell and Matt Forte (when the latter gets back from a turf toe injury), but this is a back-by-committee offense, and McGuire is a deep, deep league add. \nGeronimo Allison , WR, Green Bay Packers (3.1 percent) \nWe'll see whether Davante Adams misses time following a scary hit in Week 4. If he does, Allison is likely to take on a more prominent role in this offense ( Randall Cobb 's already busy workload will increase too); and when you have Aaron Rodgers as your quarterback, that's noteworthy. He's a deep league add.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "watson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deshaun watson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "darren sproles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lamar miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d'onta foreman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baltimore ravens  collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendell smallwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randall cobb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latavius murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cam newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ellington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devin funchess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vikings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terrance west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smallwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamaal williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bilal powell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron rodgers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "engram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan daniel/getty images  alex collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ty montgomery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark ingram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "davante adams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt forte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foreman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul perkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wayne gallman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan engram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre ellington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geronimo allison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elijah mcguire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cooper kupp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alvin kamara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaron brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalvin cook", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "green bay packers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york giants  have the giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york jets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina panthers  funchess", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles rams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ppr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new orleans saints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona cardinals  brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saints", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "houston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minnesota", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemson", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:35:26.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0b6e8b107c2331b42a3e22cbf17f2f1545be2c3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeJ0h.JOnRM8YBsn.RhCKE1KeXQlNeYRQCEaqpk8T2cki337E65y6eK51uUN6Hx7zSd8_kc9VFqa.Muh0CyqTzoFLVDfnljZ8GMJRLFQaX9bS97bqZUtSZjN9XZPAkLe65lYZw6NKM_R68.MKg59tI.Dbe04So5vtGnL7JGGKW7FvnCumqSTOHFkpd4Tz2jidDPEShO56jwNcGLXv5ULsb.WTwv4.SH7Xtw--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/espn/rss/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com -

Use these tidbits to make the best waiver-wire, trade and lineup decisions for Week 5. Be sure to check back each week of the season for a new version of the Fantasy 32.\nThroughout this piece, I'll be referencing \"OTD.\" OTD stands for opportunity-adjusted touchdowns. It is a statistic that weighs every carry/target and converts the data into one number that indicates a player's scoring opportunity. For example, if a player has an OTD of 3.0, it means that a league-average player who saw the same number of carries/targets in the same area of the field would have scored three touchdowns.\nArizona Cardinals\nJaron Brown caught 8 of 12 targets for 105 yards against the 49ers on Sunday. The big day comes after Brown registered 11 targets in Week 2 and six in Week 3. That total of 29 targets ranks seventh in the NFL over the past three weeks. He ranks 22nd among wide receivers in fantasy points during the span. Granted his production has been boosted by John Brown 's injury struggles, but Jaron has now been on the field for 86 percent of the team's pass plays this year. It's clear he's no lower than third on the target totem pole. Brown should be owned in most formats and is in the WR3 discussion this week against an Eagles defense that is by far the worst in the league at stopping perimeter wide receivers.\nAtlanta Falcons\nLast season, Devonta Freeman registered a 13.2 OTD, which was third-highest in the NFL and helped him to 13 touchdowns. Through Week 4 this season, Freeman again sits third with a 4.5 OTD. The usage has allowed him five touchdowns and the fifth-most fantasy points among running backs. Freeman's usage in the passing game is down slightly this year, but he has been on the field more and his carries per game is up to 17.5 from last year's 14.2. There's not much actionable here, but let this serve as a reminder that Freeman is a stud fantasy back for the third straight year.\nBaltimore Ravens\nIt appears Terrance West has lost his job in Baltimore. Former Seahawk Alex Collins played only 17 snaps (Baltimore trailed throughout) but handled nine of the team's 15 carries in Week 4. He impressed with 82 rushing yards, though he failed to catch either of his two targets. Javorius Allen , meanwhile, played 40 snaps and caught all six of his targets for 37 yards. He carried the ball only twice. West was relegated to four carries for negative-7 yards on 10 snaps. Moving forward, Collins should be viewed as a fringe flex with added value in PPR leagues. Considering his fumbling issues, his lack of work in the passing game and the Ravens' low-scoring offense, don't overspend on waivers. Allen remains the top fantasy play from this backfield in PPR formats.\nBuffalo Bills\nCharles Clay hauled in 5 of 7 targets for 112 yards against Atlanta in Week 4. He has now compiled 18 catches for 227 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 25 targets and sits third among tight ends in fantasy points this season. Clay is handling a career-high 26 percent of the Bills' targets, though he averaged a share over 20 percent when active in both 2015 and 2016. Clay is an every-down player (he has run a route on 87 percent of the team's pass plays this season), and Jordan Matthews ' injury only further locks him into a huge offensive role. Clay also sports elite ratings in my \"last name\" metric. He's a quality TE1 play.\nCarolina Panthers\nThe Panthers have stuck to their plans to utilize a committee in the backfield this season. Rookie Christian McCaffrey has handled 60 looks (carries plus targets) and veteran Jonathan Stewart has 65. The backs have combined for one touchdown, but their usage suggests they should be close to three or four. Stewart sports a 2.1 OTD, and McCaffrey sits at 1.3. Carolina has called pass on 66 percent of McCaffrey's snaps and 31 percent of Stewart's plays. It's clear each back has a defined role on the team, and that's unlikely to change moving forward. McCaffrey is a back-end RB2, and Stewart a flex option.\nChicago Bears\nThe Bears will make the switch from Mike Glennon to rookie Mitch Trubisky in Week 5. This might be good news for tight end Zach Miller . The veteran tight end has caught only 13 passes for 143 yards this season, but he has been on the field for 77 percent of the team's pass plays. That's down only slightly from 79 percent during the weeks he was active last year. The narrative that rookie quarterbacks lean on their tight end more than veterans is false, but Miller's usage combined with Chicago's weak wide receiver unit suggests Miller shouldn't be short a consistent target load. He's a solid TE2 and could push for TE1 numbers if Trubisky proves legit.\nCincinnati Bengals\nAfter opening the season with a combined zero touchdowns and four interceptions against tough Baltimore and Houston defenses, Andy Dalton has a 6:0 TD:INT mark against Green Bay and Cleveland during his past two games. Dalton was 33rd among quarterbacks in fantasy points after Week 2, but he's seventh over the past two weeks. It's easy to be distracted by a poor first impression, but remember that Dalton has finished as a top-12 fantasy quarterback four of the past five seasons (if we include a 2015 campaign in which he was fifth prior to a late-season injury). Dalton might have his hands full with Buffalo's pleasant surprise of a defense this week, but his schedule is manageable moving forward. He's back in the streaming conversation.\nCleveland Browns\nIsaiah Crowell is averaging 33.5 rushing and 12.5 receiving yards per game through four outings this season. He has yet to score a touchdown. Crowell's usage has been pretty close to where it was last year, though he was on the field for only 36 percent of the team's snaps against the Bengals in Week 4. That's his lowest mark since Week 12 in 2015. Crowell's shaky efficiency isn't a surprise when you look at his production during his first three seasons, but he had a lot of perceived fantasy value thanks to a hefty projected role behind a good offensive line. If the team continues to play from behind and shifts more work to Duke Johnson Jr . and Matt Dayes, Crowell will fall off the fantasy radar. He has a shot to get on track this week against a Jets defense that has allowed the third-most fantasy points to running backs.\nDallas Cowboys\nDez Bryant was targeted 13 times against the Rams in Week 4. He caught five of those passes for 98 yards and no touchdowns in the game. It was yet another brutally inefficient game for a player who has faced -- and will continue to face -- a tough cornerback slate. Bryant ranks fourth in the league in targets (40) and first in end zone targets (8) but sits 21st among wideouts in fantasy points. On the plus side, Bryant is handling a massive 29 percent target share and has been on the field for 94 percent of the team's pass plays. As long as he continues seeing this volume, poor efficiency won't be enough to block him from producing WR2 numbers. Bryant has a rare great matchup this week against the Packers' weak cornerback group.\nDenver Broncos\nDemaryius Thomas has yet to score a touchdown this season and was limited to 11 receiving yards against Oakland on Sunday. That's Thomas' lowest yardage total since he was held to 8 yards in Super Bowl 50. Thomas sits 36th among wide receivers in fantasy points, but there's plenty of reason to expect a rebound. Thomas has been on the field for 87 percent of the Broncos' offensive plays, including 91 percent of the pass plays. Both are his highest totals since 2014. He has handled a generous 25 percent target share and ranks 16th among wideouts with 247 receiving yards. Thomas will return to the WR2 ranks once Denver returns from its Week 5 bye.\nDetroit Lions\nThe Lions said all offseason that Ameer Abdullah would be their feature back. They weren't kidding. Abdullah delivered 109 yards and a touchdown on 23 touches against a tough Minnesota defense on Sunday. Abdullah has been on the field for 46 percent of the Lions snaps this season, which has allowed him 16.5 carries and 2.5 targets per game. The volume has helped him to only one touchdown and the 22nd-most fantasy points at the position. Abdullah sports a 1.4 OTD, which suggests his touchdown production is about where it should be. He has carried the ball only three times inside the opponent's 13-yard line, though he's responsible for both of the team's attempts inside the 5. Abdullah's ceiling is limited (as expected), but he's seeing enough work to allow RB2 production.\nGreen Bay Packers\nTy Montgomery and Jamaal Williams both suffered injuries during the Packers' Week 4 win over Chicago. Both are dicey for this weekend's game, which opens the door for rookies Aaron Jones and Devante Mays to lead the Packers' backfield against a Dallas defense that just allowed Todd Gurley 215 scrimmage yards. With Mays inactive, Jones racked up 13 carries on 29 snaps last Thursday. The UTEP product crushed it at April's combine, though he struggled badly after initial contact during his final FBS season and projects as more of a change-of-pace back. Nonetheless, if Montgomery and Williams are out, Jones will be in the mix for 15-plus touches and in the RB2 discussion. Scoop him up on waivers, but don't overspend, as he's only a short-term replacement.\nHouston Texans\nDeshaun Watson exploded for five touchdowns against Tennessee on Sunday and has now posted 300-plus yards of total offensive in back-to-back games. Despite sitting out during the first half of the opener, Watson has thrown seven touchdowns and run for two more in four games. He sits sixth among quarterbacks in fantasy points. Inaccuracy (off-target on 23 percent of his throws, second-worst) and turnovers (four interceptions) have been problem areas, but both are expected for a rookie, and Watson has made up for it with big plays and high-end rushing production (position-high 148 rushing yards). It's impossible to ignore the fact that Houston put up 90 points over the past two games, so Watson is a viable fantasy starter even in a tougher matchup against Kansas City this week.\nIndianapolis Colts\nFrank Gore remains the workhorse in Indianapolis, but his efficiency woes have carried over from last season. Gore is averaging 3.1 yards per carry, including 1.6 after contact. He's 13th in the league in carries, but 30th in fantasy points. Gore will have some flex appeal as long as he's handling 15-plus carries per game, but there's very little fantasy upside here. Especially as the 1-3 Colts fall out of the playoff race, rookie Marlon Mack figures to progressively see more work down the stretch.\nJacksonville Jaguars\nLeonard Fournette is who we thought he'd be. The fourth-overall pick in April's draft paced the Jaguars in both rushing (24 carries, 86 yards) and receiving (4 catches, 59 yards, TD) on Sunday. The rookie has been on the field for only 55 percent of the team's snaps but is still handling 20.3 carries and 3.8 targets per game. Extremely busy near the goal line, Fournette sports a 3.8 OTD (which legitimizes his touchdown total of four) and has handled six carries inside the opponent's 5 yard line. Fournette is a solid RB1 play.\nKansas City Chiefs\nIs Alex Smith in the midst of a breakout fantasy season ... in his 13th year? The veteran passer has never finished a season better than 14th among quarterbacks in fantasy points and has averaged a 20th-place finish over the past eight years. Smith put up 293 passing yards, 56 rushing yards and a pair of touchdowns against Washington on Monday night. That's good enough for a sixth-place fantasy finish this week, his third top-10 week of the season (he had five all of last year). The Chiefs have now scored three-plus touchdowns in every game this year. Smith has been impressive, but his lengthy career resume suggests a return to earth is on tap. He's certainly a viable streaming option going forward, especially with bye weeks on tap, and Smith is a good play this week with a trip to Houston on tap.\nLos Angeles Chargers\nTyrell Williams posted his best game of the season in Week 5. The 6-foot-4 receiver caught 5 of 6 targets for 115 yards and a touchdown against the Eagles' struggling cornerback unit. Williams entered the game with 123 yards and no scores during Weeks 1-3, but he has now seen six-plus targets in three of four outings. He sits 32nd among wide receivers in fantasy points. He's a in the flex mix against the Giants this week, but keep in mind that Mike Williams ' return is imminent. If the rookie is legit, it's only a matter of time until he's chipping away at Tyrell's targets.\nLos Angeles Rams\nGurley put up 215 scrimmage yards and scored a touchdown against Dallas on Sunday. The third-year back is now on pace for 28 offensive scores and a whopping 80 catches. Despite the absurdly strong fantasy production, this is a good week to explore sell-high opportunities. Though the fact that he's at the top of his game is enough to at least explore a trade, Gurley's schedule the rest of the season is the primary factor here. The next six defenses on his slate are Seattle, Jacksonville, Arizona, NY Giants, Houston and Minnesota. During Weeks 14-16 (the fantasy playoffs for most), he faces Philadelphia, Seattle and Tennessee. Gurley's usage and production (albeit against the Colts, Redskins, 49ers and Cowboys) has been exceptional, so it's important to get another stud player back in return, but the Rams' offense is certainly going to have its hands full moving forward.\nMiami Dolphins\nIt's been a miserable start to the 2017 season for Jay Ajayi , but the good news is that volume has not been an issue. Ajayi is averaging 18.7 touches per game after handling 19.1 per game last season. Ajayi has yet to score a touchdown as a product of Miami's dismal offensive showings. He hasn't carried the ball inside the opponent's 6-yard line and sports a 0.6 OTD (183rd). A low-volume, low-scoring offense that has scored only two touchdowns in three games is a giant concern for Ajayi, but his high volume and the high-end efficiency we saw from him in 2016 should lead to increased fantasy production moving forward. He's an intriguing buy-low this week, especially since his bye week is over with.\nMinnesota Vikings\nThis might be the understatement of the column, but Sam Bradford 's absence has been bad news for Kyle Rudolph 's production. Rudolph paced all tight ends with 128 targets and finished second at the position in fantasy points with Bradford under center last season. Bradford also hit Rudolph for a score in Week 1 this season. During three games with Case Keenum , however, Rudolph has totaled seven receptions for 83 yards and no touchdowns on 12 targets. Bradford might be back this week, which should launch Rudolph back into a consistent role in the passing game. If the veteran tight end is cut in your league, scoop him up.\nNew England Patriots\nChris Hogan caught 5 of 9 targets for 60 yards and a touchdown against Carolina on Sunday. He has now caught 15 passes for 214 yards and four touchdowns on the season and is up to ninth among receivers in fantasy points. Hogan is averaging only 6.5 targets per game, but he has been on the field for 95 percent of the pass plays in one of the league's highest-scoring offenses. Not short on scoring opportunities, Hogan is tied for second in the NFL with five end zone targets and his 2.6 OTD ranks 12th. Hogan has finished as a top-15 fantasy wideout each of the past three weeks and is a good bet to make it four in a row this week against a Buccaneers defense that has allowed the most fantasy points per game to wide receivers this season.\nNew Orleans Saints\nThe Saints have all but phased Adrian Peterson out of the offense, instead using Mark Ingram and rookie Alvin Kamara as a two-man committee. Ingram has racked up 42 carries and 20 targets on 132 snaps this season. Kamara sits at 15 carries and 27 targets on 87 snaps. Peterson has managed 27 carries and two targets on 42 snaps and was on the field for only six plays in Week 4. He's well off the fantasy radar. Kamara has been the flashiest of the group, but Ingram is getting a lot more volume and remains the top fantasy play here. Both are top-25 fantasy backs so far this season and that should continue moving forward. Both are RB2 options in PPR and Kamara should be downgraded to flex territory in non-PPR.\nNew York Giants\nEvan Engram was best-positioned among rookie tight ends to defy history and put together a solid statistical season in his first year. So far, he's right on track. Engram caught 6 of 10 targets for 62 yards against the Buccaneers on Sunday. That brings him to 19 catches on 29 targets for 200 yards and a score through four games. Engram sits sixth among tight ends in fantasy points. Engram has been on the field for 83 percent of the Giants' pass plays and is handling a generous 18 percent of the targets. Especially considering the team can't run the ball and Brandon Marshall hasn't brought much to the table, Engram is well on his way to a top-10 finish at the position. Make sure he's owned.\nNew York Jets\nThe Jets running game exploded with Matt Forte out of the mix against Jacksonville on Sunday. Bilal Powell shined on 45 snaps as the feature back with 190 yards and a touchdown on 25 touches. Rookie Elijah McGuire played 19 snaps and posted 131 yards and a score on 12 touches. Both players had a touchdown run of at least 69 yards. Granted Jacksonville has been sliced up by running backs so far this season, but considering how nicely the duo preformed, it's fair to wonder if Forte's role will be reduced once he returns. Powell has been criminally underused throughout his career, but had entered this season top-10 in targets among running backs each of the past two years. Powell should be viewed as a quality RB2 play if Forte remains out this week. McGuire isn't yet seeing enough work to warrant flex consideration.\nOakland Raiders\nWhat to do with Marshawn Lynch ? Following a promising Raiders debut in which he put up 92 yards on 19 touches in Tennessee, Lynch has totaled 87 yards on 29 touches during his past three games. He's scored one touchdown on the year. He sits 39th among backs in fantasy points. Lynch is averaging 3.4 yards per carry, though 2.1 of that has come after contact. That's eighth-best among 30 backs with 40-plus carries. Though that's a sign Lynch's efficiency might improve, his volume is still a problem. He's been on the field for 41 percent of the Raiders' offensive snaps and has been targeted six times in four games. After playing from behind a lot the past two weeks, game script figures to improve for Lynch and the Raiders offense going forward. That will allow his carry totals to rebound behind one of the game's top offensive lines. Lynch's fantasy upside is capped by his limited workload in the passing game, but he remains a fringe top-20 play against Baltimore this week.\nPhiladelphia Eagles\nIn their first full game without Darren Sproles , the Eagles rolled with a three-man committee at running back on Sunday. LeGarrette Blount played 25 snaps and posted 156 yards on 17 touches. Wendell Smallwood touched the ball on 14 of his position-high 31 snaps and posted 79 yards. Rookie Corey Clement managed 10 carries for 30 yards on 19 snaps. Blount has the size and ability to handle early-down and goal line duties, whereas Smallwood is the most well-rounded back on the team, so it's fair to expect this dynamic to continue going forward. Smallwood is the best play in PPR leagues, but Blount gets the nod in non-PPR and should get a boost in value in games in which the Eagles are favored.\nPittsburgh Steelers\nBen Roethlisberger is off to a very slow start at the quarter point of the 2017 season. His passing yardage has trended down each week since he threw for 263 yards at Cleveland in Week 1 and he has totaled six touchdowns in four games. Of course, considering that three of the four games were on the road, we shouldn't be surprised. Roethlisberger has been terrific at home and poor on the road tracing back three seasons. He'll back at home this week and will be at Heinz Field for five of the team's final seven games this season. Roethlisberger should be on benches this week against a Jaguars defense that has allowed the fewest fantasy points to quarterbacks this season, but he'll be a strong streaming option when Pittsburgh is at home moving forward.\nSan Francisco 49ers\nWith four weeks in the book, the 49ers' 0-4 record hasn't slowed Carlos Hyde from producing strong fantasy numbers. Hyde is up to 409 yards and two touchdowns on 82 touches and sits eighth at the position in fantasy points. He's been on the field for 75 percent of the offensive snaps, including 75 percent of the pass plays, and is handling 70 percent of the carries and 14 percent of the targets. All are career highs. With a 5.1 OTD, Hyde trails only Gurley in the category this season and should have more touchdowns than the two already on the board. Hyde has carried the ball seven times inside the opponent's 5-yard line (second-most). Hyde is a fringe top-10 fantasy back moving forward.\nSeattle Seahawks\nChris Carson went down with a gruesome leg injury on Sunday night, which means we've reverted back to a competition between Eddie Lacy and Thomas Rawls for early-down duties in Seattle. Rawls was inactive on Sunday, which allowed Lacy 11 carries for 52 yards (4.7 YPC) on 23 snaps. With C.J. Prosise also out, J.D. McKissic flashed in his change-of-pace role with 65 yards and two touchdowns on five touches (10 snaps). Moving forward, expect Lacy and Rawls to battle for first- and second-down work, with Prosise handling a generous chunk of the receiving work. McKissic is unlikely to see enough work to find his way into fantasy relevance, but he's a good bet to steal a few touches following his impressive game against Indianapolis. Entering Week 5, Lacy should be on the flex radar, whereas Rawls and Prosise should be on benches for now.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\nJacquizz Rodgers exploded for 108 yards on 18 touches against the Giants on Sunday. His best game of the year came at an interesting time, as Doug Martin will return from suspension this week. The Buccaneers have called run on 47 percent of Rodgers' 92 snaps, which has allowed him 40 carries and three targets. That's the role Martin figures to take over. Charles Sims , meanwhile, has registered only five carries and five targets, but the Bucs have called pass on 93 percent of his 67 snaps. Moving forward, we should expect to see Martin on early downs and at the goal line, with Sims continuing to work as the passing-down specialist. Rodgers might get occasional touches, but he's well off the fantasy radar. Martin is a fringe RB2 option this week against a New England defense that has allowed the second-most fantasy points to running backs this season.\nTennessee Titans\nDelanie Walker has flown under the radar throughout his 12-year NFL career, and that's the case in fantasy again this season. Walker has been targeted 26 times in four games, which trails only Rishard Matthews by six for the team lead. Walker has yet to find the end zone, but still sits fifth at the position in fantasy points. Walker is well on his way to his fifth consecutive top-12 fantasy campaign and very well could post his third straight top five.\nWashington Redskins\nLast week, we discussed Chris Thompson , then the No. 3 scoring fantasy running back, as about an obvious a regression-to-the-mean lock as you'll find. That prediction proved true as the Redskins' passing-down specialist was limited to 27 yards on seven touches on Monday night. Thompson was targeted only twice, though Washington attempted 24 passes in the game (they averaged 32.3 per game during Weeks 1-3). Thompson will certainly bounce back, so don't cut him just yet, but this is a simple reminder that he's no more than a flex option in PPR formats.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:35:28.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "302446f1e537c1f9cc456bd08609bbd0b643852e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeIShZYLlTN87CYnoBkiosp4SOL_p81O7H.lix5ltkQkqByrfdc1z9yxYxniLdbK8GuS99WwHfrDYEK34N14.4dJP.clSlo5tjjGmBAoe3OsRfv2YKbvw1LcLkUmCBsnb5sc9N3aHfGmA", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=new-yorkyankees", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - New York Yankees", "title": "How to bet Yankees-Twins AL wild-card game", "title_full": "How to bet Yankees-Twins AL wild-card game", "published": "2017-10-03T01:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1002%2Fr268217_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "302446f1e537c1f9cc456bd08609bbd0b643852e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeIShZYLlTN87CYnoBkiosp4SOL_p81O7H.lix5ltkQkqByrfdc1z9yxYxniLdbK8GuS99WwHfrDYEK34N14.4dJP.clSlo5tjjGmBAoe3OsRfv2YKbvw1LcLkUmCBsnb5sc9N3aHfGmA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T01:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to bet Yankees-Twins AL wild-card game", "text": "comment \nAlthough Major League Baseball's wild-card games are advance-or-go-home contests, lately they've seen as many starting-pitching gems, as they have all-hands-on-deck efforts. Sure, the Blue Jays beat the Orioles last year in the American League wild-card game thanks to better bullpen use in an 11-inning game that featured the use of 13 pitchers, but in the past three years, wild-card games have also featured starting pitching gems from Dallas Keuchel , Jake Arrieta and Madison Bumgarner (twice). \nNeither of Tuesday night's participants, the Minnesota Twins nor the New York Yankees , would appear to have aces of that caliber. Minnesota's Ervin Santana has a lifetime ERA above 4.00, and it was just a year ago that the Yankees' starter, Luis Severino , sported a ghastly 5.83 ERA in mixed work as both a reliever and a starter. There's no question that each qualified as his team's ace this season, though, thanks to team-high starts, innings pitched and rotation-best ERAs, with Severino's besting Santana's 2.98 to 3.28.

(1:52) \nLouis Riddick and Ryan Clark speak to Mitchell Trubisky's ability to extend and create plays, which should give the Bear's offense hope. (1:52) comment \n  New Chicago Bears quarterback Mitchell Trubisky won't fix every problem on offense. Even head coach John Fox admitted as much on Monday night. \n\"He's not going to wave fairy dust on it [and solve all the issues],\" Fox said on his weekly coaches' show on WBBM Newsradio 780. \nFox is smart to somewhat temper expectations for Trubisky, who will be Chicago's first rookie quarterback to start a game since Kyle Orton in 2005. \nIn fact, the last quarterback whose first career start came on Monday Night Football was Colin Kaepernick against the Bears in Week 11 of 2012. \nAnd the last first-year quarterback whose first career start came on Monday Night Football was Shaun King for the Buccaneers in 1999, according to ESPN Stats & Information. King and the Bucs came out with a 24-17 win over the Vikings. \nMaybe Trubisky plays like Kaepernick did against Chicago five seasons ago -- 243 passing yards and two touchdowns -- but don't be shocked if Trubisky doesn't achieve that level of instant success. \nThe Bears have a shortage of weapons on offense. \nTrubisky isn't walking into the same situation Dak Prescott did last season in Dallas. \nSurrounded by one of the league's best offensive lines, wide receiver Dez Bryant , tight end Jason Witten and running back Ezekiel Elliott , Prescott helped the Cowboys win 13 games a rookie. \nThe Bears do have a talented backfield in Jordan Howard and Tarik Cohen , but that's basically where the similarities end. \nDeshaun Watson -- picked 10 spots after Trubisky -- is off to an impressive start in Houston, but the Texans are a perennial playoff team. \nDeShone Kizer -- drafted in the second round -- is off to a shaky start in Cleveland because the Browns, much like the Bears, have been perennial cellar-dwellers. \nA rookie quarterback's supporting cast often determines his likelihood of success. \nSince 2015, four quarterbacks taken in the top 2 started as rookies.

It\u2019s as if there is a flaming pile of trash coming in Marshall's direction when New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning targets his newest receiver so far this season. \nIt\u2019s a quarter of the way into the campaign, and Marshall doesn\u2019t look anywhere near the Pro Bowl receiver the Giants were expecting when they signed him to a two-year deal in the offseason. He had a pair of drops in Sunday\u2019s 25-23 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and caught another ball with his legs after a bobble. \nIt has been that kind of struggle for Marshall. Brandon Marshall failed to exploit his matchup with Vernon Hargreaves, despite having a 7-inch, 30-pound advantage. Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports \n\u201cJust not playing well right now,\u201d he said after finishing with six catches on 10 targets for 46 yards in the Giants\u2019 fourth straight loss. \u201cI haven\u2019t played a solid game since I\u2019ve been here.\u201d \nMarshall\u2019s next touchdown will be his first this year. His next drop will be (at least) his fourth, depending who is counting. \nAlthough Marshall has never exactly been known for having the surest of hands -- his 55 drops since the start of 2010 blow away the competition by 14 or more -- the start of this season has been especially trying. The problem might be in his head. \n\u201cI think catching is confidence. Confidence is catching,\u201d coach Ben McAdoo said. \u201c... We just need to get through a clean game with him. He\u2019s been catching it well in practice. We need to carry it over to game day. And that\u2019s a part of the game for receivers.\u201d \nThe Giants are hoping it happens soon. Their season is already slipping away, and Marshall was supposed to be the ideal complement to star Odell Beckham Jr. on the outside. But the marriage the Giants were hoping would put their offense over the top has done little to inspire confidence. Marshall has looked like a bigger, taller version of Victor Cruz . It has been a mismatched union since Week 1. \nMaybe it\u2019s the shoulder Marshall dinged in the preseason. Maybe it\u2019s the new offense or that the best years are behind the 33-year-old receiver. The early returns after a promising training camp are that Marshall hasn\u2019t looked like the physical receiver who has scored the most red zone touchdowns since 2012. \nMarshall, who has two red zone targets this season, isn\u2019t making excuses. He knows his play has been subpar. He has 16 catches for 139 yards in four games. \nMcAdoo seems to have a theory. \n\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s a new offense. He\u2019s doing a lot of learning,\" McAdoo said. \"He\u2019s still doing a lot of learning. Playing with a different quarterback. He hasn\u2019t caught the ball cleanly in games.\u201d \nIt might be wishful thinking. This wasn\u2019t a problem for Marshall in the past. He had productive first seasons with the Dolphins, Bears and Jets. He\u2019s on pace for 64 catches, 556 yards and no touchdowns in his first season with the Giants. \n\u201cJust have to get better,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cHave to find ways to get better.\u201d \nMarshall doesn\u2019t appear to be playing with the physicality that made him such a force in the past. He didn\u2019t force a missed tackle on any of his six receptions Sunday, even though most were against cornerback Vernon Hargreaves , who was giving up 7 inches and about 30 pounds. There appeared to be sloppy routes, a lack of physicality and a constant battle with the football. \nThe rare positive was that Marshall used his size on one key catch late in the third quarter on a third down. It was almost like a basketball post-up, but even that wasn\u2019t a clean grab. \nIt has been rare that Marshall has used his 6-foot-5, 230-pound frame as an asset this season. He has 44 yards after the catch on 16 receptions for an average of 2.75 yards after catch this season. \nIt has been that kind of start to Marshall's Giants career, which as of right now is best remembered for a costly drop deep down the right sideline that could\u2019ve changed the game against the Detroit Lions . Instead, it ended it. Two plays later, Detroit returned a punt for a touchdown, and the contest was out of reach. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not good,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got to put a complete game together. All I can do is find a way to get better.\u201d \nMarshall has 12 weeks for redemption. He doesn't have nearly that much time to get it right with the Giants still winless and in desperate need of a bigger contribution. They're tied for 30th in the NFL, averaging 15.0 points per game. \nMarshall and the football need to quickly make amends. That fight needs to end now. The Giants need more from their top offseason acquisition.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brandon marshall", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben mcadoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vernon hargreaves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odell beckham jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victor cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eli manning", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcadoo", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "giants - new york giants blog- espn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "new york giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tampa bay buccaneers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marshall's giants", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "detroit lions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "detroit", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:52:11.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "531a72e231ed1abd20c20abf48cee2c28353f34b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeEypH2_34z_JMREdF1pG49SF_Do9fGmXlqfFkj2srANG", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Top pitchers to be showcased in October - ESPN Video", "title_full": "Top pitchers to be showcased in October - ESPN Video", "published": "2017-10-03T16:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.239, "main_image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2017%2F0928%2Fdm_170928_mlb_pitchers_to_watch_postseason%2Fdm_170928_mlb_pitchers_to_watch_postseason.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "531a72e231ed1abd20c20abf48cee2c28353f34b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeEypH2_34z_JMREdF1pG49SF_Do9fGmXlqfFkj2srANG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Top pitchers to be showcased in October - ESPN Video", "text": "MLB Top pitchers to be showcased in October \nFrom Corey Kluber to Clayton Kershaw, some of MLB's best pitchers will be looking to make some noise this postseason.

Four is nothing. Sure, we've learned things in those games, but why throw out the vast quantity of information we had going into the season? That's not a good way to go about predicting what's coming next.\nBelow are five teams FPI thinks are significantly underrated or overrated by ESPN's post-Week 4 Power Rankings .\nNew England Patriots Power rank: 7\nFPI rank: 2\nThe voters really want to bet against Tom Brady ? Against Bill Belichick? After what, two losses?\nFPI thinks that's nuts.\nHow long do we have to watch the Patriots be on top of the world before we forgive a loss here or there? Apparently, 14 straight years of double-digit wins isn't enough.\nLook, we know what this is about: the defense.\nIn four games this season, the defense has added negative expected points every time. It has clearly cost New England so far, and no one would argue that point.\nBut there's also this: Defense is less consistent than offense. Past defensive performances don't predict future defensive performances to the degree that offensive performances predict future offense. In the Patriots' case, that variance works in the favor of their future prospects.\nThat being said, FPI agrees that the defense will be a liability. Going forward it thinks New England's defense is 1.3 points worse than average per game. That's ninth worst in the league (and anyone who thinks the Patriots' defense will be in the same league going forward as those of the Colts or Browns ought to watch a few more Colts or Browns games).\nSo a good offense plus a bad defense equals a mediocre team, right? Not exactly. We all know there's a little more nuance to it than that.\nHow about we try this: An exceptionally strong offense plus a weak defense equals ... the second-best team in football. New England's league-best offense, by FPI's standards, is 8.6 points above average per game, and 3.4 points better than that of the New Orleans Saints, the second-best offense. That makes up for the defensive issues and then some.\nThe Patriots will be just fine. No, much better than fine.\nNew York Giants Power rank: 30\nFPI rank: 17\nHere's what FPI cares about: performance against expectation, while taking into account circumstantial factors such as opponent strength and game location. It has a separate expectation for the offense's strength depending on which quarterback is expected to be under center, and it keeps in mind the information it held on teams in the preseason.\nHere's what it doesn't care about: past wins and losses. Those just aren't the best way to predict football, and that's what we're doing here, forecasting what is to come. We already know what just happened.\nSo consider the case of the 0-4 Giants. Would they have dropped two spots in the power rankings if Bucs kicker Nick Folk's field goal at the end of the game had been off target and Big Blue had won the game? We didn't learn a whole heck of a lot about the Giants in the moment, and that's why FPI doesn't put much stock into it.\nInstead, the model considered the circumstances of the game -- that the Giants were on the road facing a better team and lost by only two -- and actually moved them up by a hair after that one.\nThe Giants have likely put themselves in too deep a hole to reach the postseason (just a 2 percent chance, FPI says), but they aren't one of the worst teams in the NFL.\nHouston Texans Power rank: 10\nFPI rank: 18\nSo far, our numbers are buying Deshaun Watson . He's the NFL leader in Total QBR and clearly has helped the Texans en route to their 2-2 record.\nThe model does account for individual quarterbacks, and it has made significant adjustments for Watson already. It thinks the Houston offense will operate at a higher level with Watson at quarterback now than it did in Week 1. But FPI isn't ready to anoint him yet, and with good reason. It's been just four games for him, too - three-and-a-half, actually -- and that isn't enough time to figure out whether he truly is as good as he has been .\nDespite Deshaun Watson's impressive performances, FPI questions whether he can keep the Texans near the top. Aaron Doster/USA TODAY Sports Also keep in mind that a tremendous amount of Watson's value came from one play -- the 49-yard scramble for a touchdown in Week 2 for which he deserved and received a tremendous amount of credit. Watson's raw, unadjusted QBR for the season is 81.9. Take away that one play and it would drop to 70.1. Still good -- third best, in fact -- but it shows how incredibly valuable that one play is. The good news is FPI is smart enough to cap the impact of extreme plays such as that one when considering information for its predictions.\nAnd remember, Watson isn't alone out there. While the offense was magnificent in the Texans' most recent game, a 57-14 win over the Titans, that hasn't been the case in every game.

The big-serving Canadian has withdrawn from five events this year, and conceded walkovers at two others. \n\"It's been very frustrating,\" said Raonic, who started this year at No. 3 but has slipped to No. 12 in the rankings. \"I think I've had more than a dozen different injuries and reasons that have kept me away from tournaments. That hasn't been fun because I haven't been able to focus on tennis, I've been focusing on `Can I play today or can't I?' rather than, `What do I need to do with my tennis game?\" \n\"I believe out of those of us that finished top five last year, I'm the only guy still trying to play this year, and none of the top five played the U.S. Open,\" Raonic said. \"Maybe it's a testament to some kind of reform being needed for the sake of players' careers, and being able to provide a certain calibre of tennis for spectators. \n\"Scheduling, the length of the year and how spread out -- geographically and throughout the year -- the tournaments are, especially the top tournaments for the top players, is something that deserves a second look. It's hard to peak four times of the year for Grand Slams, let alone for other tournaments.\" \nThe length of the season has long been an issue for players, something the men's and women's tours have taken some steps to address, and Raonic believes that a more compact season would help the competition across the board. \n\"Give the players that really stand out mandatory events, give them a chance to play everything within a seven-month period so they can really focus on themselves health-wise, but also on improving, because you need that time,\" Raonic said. \"We're the only sport, outside of golf maybe, that plays as spread out as we do without any time for rest.\" \nRichard Gasquet, pictured, dumped London hopeful Sam Querry out of the Japan Open. Matt Roberts/Getty Images \nRichard Gasquet also advanced to the second round, with a 6-4, 7-6(2) defeat of sixth-seeded Sam Querrey . \nThe Frenchman missed the opening five ATP 1000 Masters events this year, following appendicitis surgery and subsequent back problems. Those back problems also forced him out of two other events. \n\"I had a lot of injuries this year and now I'm feeling fit, that's why I can compete well,\" Gasquet said. \"I had appendicitis then everything went wrong with my body after that, so it was a tough year for me. The back problems came after that surgery, my recovery was very bad and I started practicing a little bit too quickly, after five weeks -- I wasn't ready. I didn't think it would be so tough to recover -- of course I'm not 20 anymore, I'm 31.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "viktor troicki", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "milos raonic", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "raonic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam querrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gasquet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam querry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard gasquet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atp tour", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:01:07.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "455270911a14592ad7a54ed959d1a8293f68c57e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeJp60TcHJZStsGTvqF2kd8ZTcKCnJsQK4N6mekMMygmDprZOTVQqmeKrnzULrAE5cnSy78WQf9Ks_Y2s1dWq_FzCiO0Zw01yyskXKb7xhlq0pI.sLzJZXdC6lbwZEB5KgQ--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Johanna Konta suffers WTA finals blow with foot injury Hong Kong Open", "title_full": "Johanna Konta suffers WTA finals blow with foot injury Hong Kong Open", "published": "2017-10-03T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.896, "main_image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1001%2Fr267435_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "455270911a14592ad7a54ed959d1a8293f68c57e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeJp60TcHJZStsGTvqF2kd8ZTcKCnJsQK4N6mekMMygmDprZOTVQqmeKrnzULrAE5cnSy78WQf9Ks_Y2s1dWq_FzCiO0Zw01yyskXKb7xhlq0pI.sLzJZXdC6lbwZEB5KgQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Pa Sport", "published": "2017-10-03T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Johanna Konta suffers WTA finals blow with foot injury Hong Kong Open", "text": "comment \nJohanna Konta 's hopes of qualifying for the WTA Finals have suffered another blow after she pulled out of next week's Hong Kong Open with a foot injury. \nThe British No. 1 has lost her last five matches, most recently a 6-1, 6-2 thrashing by Monica Niculescu in the opening round of the China Open on Sunday. \nThe move is said to be precautionary, with Konta still intending to play in the Kremlin Cup in Moscow the following week. \n\"I'm very disappointed to have to withdraw from next week's Prudential Hong Kong Tennis Open,\" Konta said. \"I was really looking forward to being part of this fantastic event again and seeing more of the wonderful city of Hong Kong. \n\"I want to wish everyone involved in the tournament a happy and successful one.

Free-agent hype.\nUndervaluing international players who missed out on March Madness hype. Small-market players who get little to no hype. Players who contribute in underhyped categories ... like free throw percentage.\nMost of all? We make the mistake of not doing enough of our homework. Reading up. Studying trends. Honing our own instincts headed into draft season.\nIf you blindly follow ADP, you're cruising for a fantasy bruising. And you're missing out on the fun of flying in the face of conventional wisdom. And ... you're probably going to lose.\nBecause you're drafting the same team that every other non-homework-doing manager is building. When you fail to challenge conventional wisdom, you are doomed.\nHere are some of conventional wisdom's biggest mistakes so far ... this draft season.\nKarl-Anthony Towns , C, Minnesota Timberwolves ( Average draft position : 9, Cregan draft position: 1)\nI think Towns has a good chance at finishing the season No. 1 overall. About the same chance as James Harden , Kevin Durant , Russell Westbrook , Anthony Davis or Giannis Antetokounmpo . (Hey, it's a deep top 10). Towns has an even better chance of finishing No. 1 in points leagues.\nTowns has no weaknesses. No red flags. No divots in his statistical profile. He's all unfettered upside. Editor's Picks These players will make or break your fantasy hoops season\nShould you believe in Kristaps Porzingis, Gordon Hayward and Hassan Whiteside? Will Joel Embiid be better than Russell Westbrook? Here are 10 players who could build or wreck your title hopes.\n2017-18 fantasy basketball draft kit Mock drafts, roto rankings, points rankings, projections, player profiles, draft strategies, DFS strategies -- we've got everything you need to dominate fantasy basketball from every angle.\n1 Related Monster points per game and rebounds are a given (think 25 PPG and 10-12 RPG). But Towns supports his dominant volume-based stats with a numerical completeness I haven't seen from a big since peak Kevin Garnett.\nMonster volume, supported by secondary stats: 1.5 BPG, 1.5 3PG and 1 steal. Decent assists. Great percentages.\nIf you're picking first in a double-double league? Look no further.\nI'll pause to remind you that Towns hasn't missed a game in his career. No weaknesses.\nAnd here's the kicker: It's early. As in he's 21. As in he's still expanding his value.\nHe's probably four to six seasons away from peak production. I like Towns early. Aside from being dominant in several areas, and reliable in several others ... there's upside here. Major upside.\nFor me, the durability nudges him into the top slot.\nNikola Jokic , PF/C, Denver Nuggets (ADP: 13, CDP: 8)\nEveryone's been crowing about Ben Simmons ' fantasy potential. That he'll be playing point forward as a rookie.\nI'm excited, too. I crave out-of-position stats. I love nothing more than a big who banks you point guard-esque production.\nBut we haven't been talking enough about how special Jokic's actual production has already become. Jokic is already a point center, the complete 7-foot floor general package.\nAnd he isn't just potential. Jokic is game tested.\nTake a gander at Jokic's line for the last month of 2016-17: 19.0 PPG, 11.6 RPG, 6.2 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.7 BPG, 0.6 3PG, 55.6 FG%, 88.2 FT%. Going into 2017-18, he has a nice, young core around him, anchored by Paul Millsap's veteran presence.\nWe project Jokic out at 17.7 PPG and 10.0 RPG. 5.2 APG. About a block, steal, and 3-pointer per night. I think that's conservative.\nJokic shot 58 percent from the field in 2016-17. He shot .825 from the line. The efficiency's there. Now he's going to get more minutes. More touches.\nAnd don't forget Jokic's secret fantasy sauce: dual eligibility. He's a PF/C. Not only is he statistically diverse, but you can plug in Jokic at multiple slots.\nIn 2016-17, Fantasyland sort of pouted on Jokic for half a season. Just because we all touted Jokic as a serious sleeper ... only to watch coach Mike Malone anchor Jokic to the bench.\nIt wasn't us, people. Jokic just needed minutes. Now he's got them.\nAnd you're half a round too late.\nCJ McCollum , SG, Portland Trail Blazers (ADP: 20, CDP: 28)\nWho is the better fantasy pick heading into this season: Bradley Beal or CJ McCollum? Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports McCollum or Beal? It's an interesting debate: two rising young SGs, playing at a thin fantasy position. Both are second options, playing alongside ball-dominant PGs.\nIt's close, but I'd rather have Beal.\nTheir volume-based stats are nearly even. When in doubt, I lean toward efficiency, and Beal's true shooting percentage is just a hair better (60.4 TS% to 58.5 TS%).\nMcCollum's ADP is driven by his eye-popping points-per-game production. Yes, he's going to score points, but you're overrating him by about half a round. Plus, Beal is available for a more sober 26th overall.\nGordon Hayward , SG/SF, Boston Celtics (ADP: 21, CDP: 33)\nThere are a lot of you betting on Hayward improving his fantasy prospects via his free-agent move to Boston.\nThat means a lot of you are about to be wrong.\nHayward goes from being the unquestioned first option in Utah to, at best, a second-banana role in Boston. I have a lot of faith in coach Brad Stevens as a real-life NBA coach, but in fantasy, his deep, democratic rotations lack a certain fantasy friendliness.\nI know ESPN projects Hayward upping his rebounds and assists. But I can't see how he makes this switch and ups fantasy production by more than a full round (Hayward finished 33rd on the Player Rater last season).\nMyles Turner PF/C, Indiana Pacers (ADP: 28, CDP: 22)\nAll the signs point toward Turner making a substantial leap in his third season.\nLast season's 3-point production was cute (0.5 per game at 34.8 3FG%). But I'd prefer two-plus blocks and a steal to go with double-digit rebounds. Above all ... I'd really like 10-plus rebounds.\nThe lack of rebounds (just 7.3 per game in 2016-17) trouble me. Rebounds tend to be a good hustle stat. If you're battling consistency issues -- like Turner -- improving rebounding is a good place to start.\nStill, Turner is the future. He's a nice upside pick in the early third round.\nMarc Gasol , C, Memphis Grizzlies (ADP: 32, CDP: 23)\nWhy aren't fantasy owners giving Marc Gasol more respect in drafts this season? AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis Like Turner, Gasol has always been a soft rebounder. Except Gasol supplements the weak boards with out-of-position stats. He racks up more assists per game than most backup shooting guards. And unlike Turner, who's still at the dabbling stage with his 3-point shot? Gasol has become a real threat from deep (1.4 3-pointers per game at a 38.8 3FG%)\nQuality centers start to become scarce after the third round. You're better off locking down a C before heading into the reeds of the middle rounds. Turner, Gasol and this next big finish off the third-round run.\nJoel Embiid , C, Philadelphia 76ers (ADP: 37, CDP: 27)\nI wrote at length recently on Embiid being fantasy's ultimate risk-reward player. First-round upside ... surrounded by dozens of little red flags.\nHere's the thing: If you're going into your draft with an eye toward seriously taking Embiid, don't wait until 37. If you're comfortable enough with the attendant risks, don't wait. He's worth the extra round in draft value. Otherwise, you're looking at a block-less (but otherwise solid Nikola Vucevic ) and overrated bigs like this next big.\nDeAndre Jordan , C, LA Clippers (ADP: 39, CDP: 49)\n\"Wow factor\" versus \"scare factor.\" With Jordan, his awe-inspiring blocks need to cancel out his night sweat-inducing free throw percentage.\nIn 2016-17, Jordan averaged 1.7 blocks per game. That's elite.\nHe shot 48.2 percent from the line. That's not elite.\nAs careers advance ... blocks drop. And bigs (outside of Tim Duncan) don't tend to suddenly, radically improve their free throw shooting.\nI just can't envision a scenario where I take a player who punts an entire category by default. I've never drafted Jordan or Andre Drummond (another overrated player in ADP). Let someone else take the poison pill and move on.\nRicky Rubio , PG, Utah Jazz (ADP: 61, CDP: 41)\nShould fantasy owners be concerned about Ricky Rubio's fantasy value now that he's with the Utah Jazz? EPA/ROBERT GHEMENT Assists are a position of extreme scarcity. Next to blocks, there isn't a tougher category to acquire during the season.\nRubio quietly had himself a little career year in 2016-17, finishing 35th on the Player Rater and fifth in assists per game at 9.1. As his ESPN profile will tell you, he averaged 16 points and 10.5 assists per game after the All-Star break. He finished the season with the best assist-to-turnover ratio of his career (3.50).\nRubio is still only 26. He's just entering his peak years. And while he'll never be a 3-point juggernaut, he managed to chip in a respectable (for him) 1.1 per game, along with an always gaudy (89.1%) free throw percentage last season.\nAnd then ... there are the steals. It's an underrated section of Rubio's resume. He's elite. His 1.7 thefts per game last season was good for ninth in the NBA.\nRubio is going to a very slow-paced team in Utah. But it's still a borderline playoff team that needs Rubio to give it a ton of quality point guard minutes.\nElite assists. Elite steals. Good rebounding (about four per game) for a PG. Non-terrifying 3-point production.\nAnd you're making him only 61st overall? Wake up!\nGary Harris , SG, Denver Nuggets (ADP: 109, CDP: 60)\nShooting guard is looking like a position of big-time scarcity. Harris isn't at the Beal/McCollum third-round level, but he's closer to them than any other player going in the 11th and 12th round.\nHarris shot 42 percent from deep in 2016-17. Players who post that type of efficiency as rookies tend to take a jump in Year 2.\nDenver is going to be a fantasy hotbed this 2017-18. Taking ADP into account, Harris, Jokic, Millsap, Jamal Murray and Wilson Chandler will comprise one of fantasy's most upside-laden lineups.

We had them backed up both times ... Defensively we're playing pretty good, but we could play better, especially in two-minute defense,\" Joseph said. \"We've been really soft there. We have to improve there.\" \nSome of that can be traced to opponents having to throw more than they want, because the Denver run defense, in surrendering just over 50 yards per game, has suffocated teams on early downs. \nThe Broncos have also built double-digit leads in two of their wins and had a 9-point lead in the third quarter of Sunday's win. So offenses have had little choice but to be in pass-first mode much of the time. \n\"I don't think offenses want to throw all the time against us,\" said cornerback Chris Harris Jr . \"... We're not going to stay the same, we're going to keep working and we can be even better. And with our guys up front and our run defense, we can make it tougher.\" \nThe Broncos have made some tweaks in coverage as they have transitioned from Wade Phillips' defense to the scheme of Joe Woods, who was the team's secondary coach in the two years Phillips was coordinator. Denver was almost exclusively a man-to-man team under Phillips, but since Joseph's arrival as head coach, Woods has implemented some zone concepts. \nAsked if that transition has played a role in some of the big plays the Broncos have allowed, Joseph said, \"No, it's not that. I think it's more focused in its details. It's plays that we've covered in practice that have hurt us. We have to be better with our focus and details. To your question, as far as it being more zone now, yes. I mean, we're playing a lot more zone than we played in the past. When you're a zone team, you have to be really focused and detailed on your keys. ...

ESPN's Matt Bowen breaks down why his 8-yard TD pass to DeAndre Hopkins was a success. (0:38) Covered the Packers for ESPN Milwaukee Marquette University graduate comment \nHOUSTON -- Along with the football education Deshaun Watson received at Clemson, he gives his alma mater credit for another skill that has already helped him greatly at the NFL level. \n\"Being a quarterback, especially at this level, you have to be able to communicate with all the guys,\" said Watson, the Houston Texans ' rookie quarterback. \"You have to know how to communicate with all the guys, when to communicate with all the guys, what type of mood they're in, and I guess your vibe and energy that you give off. That's why I went to Clemson.\" \n\"I graduated with a communications degree, so I guess that helped too,\" Watson quipped. \nAlthough Watson is just a rookie, he has a long list of attributes that have already impressed the Texans' coaching staff and players. Atop that list is his ability to communicate on and off the field. \n\"Even from his first snap out there, he looked confident, like he belonged out there, like he'd been there before,\" wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins said. \"Just the way he was talking to everybody, joking and commanding things from us as wideouts and offensive line.\" On the field \nHopkins and Watson are constantly communicating during a game. On the three occasions the Texans didn't score a touchdown in the red zone in Sunday's 57-14 rout of the Tennessee Titans , Hopkins said the pair immediately discussed what they saw and what they could take advantage of in the future. In the fourth quarter, they were talking about what could help them in the upcoming game against the Kansas City Chiefs . Deshaun Watson and DeAndre Hopkins are quickly becoming a dynamic duo for the Texans. Shanna Lockwood/USA TODAY Sports \n\"Deshaun's telling [the receivers], \u2018Hey, look, I expect you to do this if it's that,'\" Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. \"There's some good give-and-take there, and it's important that the players communicate so they're not confusing each other. \u2018If it's this look, I'm doing that. OK, but hold on now, if it's this, what are you going to do?' It's a constant communication that the coaches oversee, but that's important, and I think they're doing a good job of that.\" \nThe connection on the field between Watson and Hopkins is only getting stronger, according to the numbers. In Watson's first two games (which includes his relief of former starter Tom Savage in Week 1), the QB completed 54.2 percent of his passes when targeting Hopkins for an average of 5 yards per attempt. That has increased to 85 percent and 9.2 yards per attempt over the past two games, according to ESPN Stats & Information. \nWatson has started only three NFL games, but he doesn't act like a rookie when it comes to talking a good game. \n\"He's able to really just communicate with you just what he's thinking, what he expects from a defense based on what we've told him going into it, how he feels he would react to certain plays,\" quarterbacks coach Sean Ryan said. \"There's a lot of calm communication coming from the guy.\" \nWhat especially stands out, Ryan said, is the way Watson communicates during the game. Whether it's a good series or bad, Watson is \"able to come over, explain what he saw, what happened, and be able to look at the pictures and kind of get it right and come up with solutions, when there were problems, moving forward. \n\"I came off the field feeling after the game like this guy's seeing and communicating with us what he's going through in the game, and it's helping us to adjust with him throughout the game.\" \nThe ability to communicate well is not always a given with young quarterbacks. \n\"Being a rookie, I realize it's tough to talk to the older guys like that, but he's doing a good job just stepping in there and taking control,\" Savage said. \nAdded left tackle Chris Clark : \"Watching him out there, the way he holds himself, the way he carries himself, his playcalling abilities -- he's doing really well, and I'm proud of the person he's becoming, and he can only grow from here.\" Off the field \nOff the field, the Texans quarterback and his star receiver have developed a bond. Hopkins, who also played at Clemson, said the night the Texans drafted Watson, it was \"one of the best feelings I've had since I've been here.\" WATSON WOWS VS. TITANS \nListen to Deshaun Watson and the Texans describe his historic performance in a 57-14 win over the Tennessee. Story \u00bb \n\u2022 Texans' confidence soars with Watson \u00bb \nThey met when Clemson was recruiting Watson out of high school, and the quarterback said he \"was all big eyes in shock\" seeing all the athletes Clemson had, especially Hopkins. But they didn't play together at Clemson. Hopkins turned pro after his junior year and the Texans drafted him in the first round in 2013, while Watson's freshman year at Clemson was 2014. The QB also turned pro after his junior year, and the Texans made him a first-round draft pick in 2017. \n\"Since I've gotten here our relationship has grown and has continued to grow each and every day,\" said Watson, who graduated from Clemson in three years. \"The trust and loyalty we have on and off the field, and just the way we can be able to communicate while we're on the field and off the field, too.\" \nAlthough just 25, Hopkins said he feels some responsibility to help his rookie quarterback. But he was quick to point out that Watson is \"a pro's pro\" and he already \"does all the great things that every great quarterback needs to do to be in this league and to be successful.\" \nThe biggest way he can help Watson, Hopkins said, is to \"just be there whenever he throws me the ball.\" \n\"[It's important] so he can build that confidence with me because we only get a certain amount of plays at practice, so in the game, make every opportunity count when [he] and I are connecting. \n\"And just talking to him on the sideline, telling him things that he might not be able to see. The coaches, they do a good job of helping him once he's on the sideline. But kind of just telling him what I think this player is going to do before the game, just from experience of playing against the player, and how we can attack him.\" \nWatson's desire to win has really helped him succeed in this area, O'Brien said, and an important part of that mindset is helping his teammates succeed as well. \n\"He's a great teammate. He really understands what his role is,\" O'Brien said. \"He's the exact opposite of a selfish person. He's all about the team, and really all he cares about is winning, when it comes to football. He just wants the team to win. He doesn't care about stats. \n\"We've learned that about him from the day we met him. He just wants to win. I think part of that wanting to win is really realizing where your teammates are lined up, what they're thinking, what you're thinking, communicating with your teammates.

Editor's Picks Steelers' Brown flips cooler, shrugs off coach \nAfter Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger threw an incomplete pass toward another player while wide receiver Antonio Brown was open, Brown flipped over a cooler on the team's sideline. \n\"That goes a lot further than throwing a temper tantrum,\" Roethlisberger said on his weekly radio spot with 93.7 the Fan. \nIn the second quarter of the Steelers' 26-9 victory over the Ravens, Brown broke free on a double move, but Roethlisberger worked the other side of the field, resulting in an incompletion intended for running back Le'Veon Bell . \nFrom the sideline after the play, Brown flipped a Gatorade bucket and shrugged off offensive coordinator Todd Haley as the coach tried to calm him. Brown said after the game he's a passionate player and the chance to unwrap that particular play made him feel like a kid excited at Christmas. \nRoethlisberger told 93.7 he was simply following his read on the play based on the Ravens' pre-snap coverage, noting that he's never going to find every open receiver. \nRoethlisberger said Brown's attitude didn't set a good example for young players and undermines his \"superhuman\" talent. \n\"AB is the best receiver in the world, maybe one of the best to ever play the game,\" Roethlisberger told 93.7. \"I'd like to think him and I together may be one of the best quarterback-wide receiver combos to ever play the game. I don't know he needs to react that way. He's superhuman on the football field, and when that happens, it almost brings him back to being a mere mortal, if you will. Because it gets in his head and it just messes with all of us a little bit. ... I'm not trying to call AB out. I just think this is causing a distraction that none of us really need.\" \nCoach Mike Tomlin said at his weekly news conference that he didn't see the sequence but heard about it afterward and hopes Brown makes the proper adjustments. \n\"AB is a competitor -- we all know and understand that,\" Tomlin said. \"But we've got to control it. He has to control it. If he does not, it can work against him, it can work against us. Those are the lessons you learn along the way. Sunday was a big game, obviously for a lot of reasons. Emotions are capable of getting away from you. It doesn't need to happen. It shouldn't happen. Hopefully it won't moving forward. Hopefully he's learned a lesson through that. Hopefully others have learned a lesson through that.\" \nWhen asked how Brown finds a balance between passion and outbursts, Tomlin said this is \"not Antonio's first rodeo.\" \n\"I'm not going to waste a lot of time talking to Antonio about not throwing water coolers and so forth,\" Tomlin said. \"Be a professional.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben roethlisberger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brown", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "antonio brown", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "roethlisberger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd haley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pittsburgh steelers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "picks steelers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ravens", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pittsburgh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:30:53.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10bd0a946b7630c1097f660881972c9f61ee629d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdePytePgHeNeeE_kw4xOqccI0sg_M71AfLZuf.mTSijiu0usQhADVRUdVR9Tm4_O3zen1XK1Fd3.z2jJkHdbmdao49i_sNIYwIggGwk1seEBzAapMPXl4E3WzhyN2kozk1w--", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/espn/rss/news", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - TOP", "title": "Jeter vague on Stanton's future with Marlins", "title_full": "Jeter vague on Stanton's future with Marlins", "published": "2017-10-03T20:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1003%2Fr268493_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10bd0a946b7630c1097f660881972c9f61ee629d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdePytePgHeNeeE_kw4xOqccI0sg_M71AfLZuf.mTSijiu0usQhADVRUdVR9Tm4_O3zen1XK1Fd3.z2jJkHdbmdao49i_sNIYwIggGwk1seEBzAapMPXl4E3WzhyN2kozk1w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T20:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jeter vague on Stanton's future with Marlins", "text": "comment \nDerek Jeter was noncommittal when asked about Giancarlo Stanton 's future with the Miami Marlins on Tuesday, saying he doesn't like \"the word 'teardown.\" Yet Jeter acknowledged that he will likely make \"unpopular decisions\" as part of the franchise's new ownership group. \nJeter and new controlling owner Bruce Sherman spoke publicly for the first time Tuesday about their group's $1.2 billion purchase of the Marlins.

Kupp continues to lead rookie wide receivers in receptions and yards. (Chicago Bears RB Tarik Cohen leads all rookies with 24 receptions; Carolina Panthers RB Christian McCaffrey leads all rookies in receiving yards with 206.) Rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster looks to have seized the Steelers' No. 3 WR role. AP Photo/Don Wright \nKupp has some company, though. Pittsburgh's JuJu Smith-Schuster was the No. 62 pick in the draft, and he was the receiver drafted before Kupp. Over the past two weeks, Smith-Schuster has become a legitimate No. 3 receiver in a good Pittsburgh offense. It\u2019s giving him more chances for routes, targets and receptions. \nThen there\u2019s San Francisco\u2019s Trent Taylor , the fifth-round pick from Louisiana Tech who had 10 targets on Sunday. He could push Kupp for top receiver marks. \nA quarter of the way through the season, those three have separated themselves as early successes at the position. \nHere\u2019s a look at rookie wide receivers through four weeks in the NFL; every receiver targeted this year has been included (according to ESPN Stats & Information): \nCorey Davis, Tennessee (YTD stats: 7 rec., 73 yards, 13 targets, 51 routes): Davis did not play Sunday against Houston. \nJohn Ross, Cincinnati (YTD stats: 1 carry, 12 yards; 0 receptions, 0 yards, 0 targets, 2 routes): Ross was again inactive (this time against Cleveland). \nZay Jones, Buffalo (YTD stats: 4 rec., 57 yards, 14 targets, 118 routes): He\u2019s getting opportunities, but Jones hasn\u2019t been able to do much with them. He had one catch for 18 yards against Atlanta but caught only one of his five targets -- an alarming trend for Jones in an offense in which he could thrive. \nCurtis Samuel , Carolina (YTD stats: 4 rec., 12 yards, 8 targets, 40 routes): He was inactive against New England on Sunday. \nJuJu Smith-Schuster , Pittsburgh (YTD stats: 8 rec., 102 yards, 2 TD, 14 targets, 102 routes): Smith-Schuster seems to be moving into the No. 3 receiver role in Pittsburgh -- a potentially medium-volume position. On Sunday, he scored for the second time this season, posting three catches for 47 yards on four targets. After Kupp, he might be the receiver making the largest impact. \nCooper Kupp, Los Angeles Rams (YTD stats: 14 rec., 186 yards, 2 TD, 21 targets, 90 routes): Kupp is one of the rookie wide receivers with the most opportunities -- and he\u2019s had by far the best season. In Week 4, Kupp again led rookies in receptions (tied with Trent Taylor) and yards with five catches for 60 yards plus his second touchdown of the year. He was targeted seven times in an emerging Rams offense. \nTaywan Taylor , Tennessee (YTD stats: 5 rec., 72 yards, 7 targets, 48 routes): Taylor was targeted once Sunday by the Titans. \nKenny Golladay , Detroit (YTD stats: 7 rec., 102 yards, 2 TD, 14 targets, 79 routes): After battling a hamstring injury all week, Golladay was inactive Sunday against Minnesota. He\u2019s tied for second among rookie wide receivers in yards this season. \nMack Hollins , Philadelphia (YTD stats: 3 rec., 32 yards, 3 targets, 26 routes): Hollins played but was not targeted in a win over the Chargers. \nJosh Reynolds , Los Angeles Rams (YTD stats: 1 rec., 28 yards, 1 target, 12 routes): Reynolds played but was not targeted in a win over Dallas. \nAmara Darboh , Seattle (YTD stats: 3 rec., 26 yards, 3 targets, 27 routes): He got a little more work against the Colts, being targeted four times and making two catches for 10 yards. \nChad Williams , Arizona (YTD stats: 2 rec., 23 yards, 3 targets, 17 routes): He was inactive against San Francisco on Sunday. \nTrent Taylor, San Francisco (YTD stats: 11 rec., 93 yards, 1 TD, 19 targets, 93 routes): While Kupp has had the best season, Taylor is emerging as a player in San Francisco. He was targeted a rookie-high 10 times this week against Arizona, catching five passes for 47 yards. \nChris Godwin , Tampa Bay (YTD stats: 3 rec., 44 yards, 5 targets, 25 routes): Godwin was held without a catch or a target in a win over the Giants. \nArDarius Stewart , New York Jets (YTD stats: 3 rec., 34 yards, 5 targets, 35 routes): Stewart was not targeted in an overtime win over the Jaguars. \nIsaiah McKenzie , Denver (YTD stats: 2 targets, 23 routes): He was targeted twice Sunday but did not catch a pass.

One drive later, Rishard Matthews stumbled through his route to effectively break up what would have been a third-down completion and conversion. The third go-around, center Ben Jones got thrown aside by Texans linebacker Whitney Mercilus , who made a big tackle to stop DeMarco Murray on a third-down, short-yardage run. \nThe Tennessee Titans ' first-quarter offense was once again cold. Whether it was the playcalling, the players not being in rhythm or just flat-out failed execution, the Titans' offense took the first quarter off. And Sunday, that was enough to clinch a loss. \n\"We can't start like that. We're not a team that can do that right now,\" left tackle Taylor Lewan said. \"We are a good team. It's just about being good consistently.\" Marcus Mariota and the Titans dug an early hole against the Texans on Sunday. AP Photo/George Bridges \nIt was an underlying problem through three games, but it hadn't hurt Tennessee because its defense thwarted the opponent's attack while the offense gained its footing. Luck ran out Sunday as the Texans scored three touchdowns during the first 15 minutes and six seconds of the game to the Titans' zero. It was already in \"pass the sticks\" territory for what ended up being a 57-14 blowout loss. \n\u201cOffensively, we weren\u2019t clicking fast enough,\" Matthews said. \"Once we got going it was a little too late.\" \nThe biggest issue seemed to be a lack of rhythm, from the quarterback to the receivers to the offensive line. Individual mistakes led to quick drives, and the Texans quickly jumped ahead. Good teams will do that. \nAs the Titans go back to work this week, they need to figure out how to get hot out of the gate. Their defense has serious holes, and Mariota is now hampered with a hamstring injury . An offense consistently digging itself out of first-quarter lulls only makes life more difficult. \nThe Titans' 12 first quarter drives so far this season have ended in eight three-and-outs, an interception, a touchdown and two field goals. That might suffice for a defensive-minded team that can win 17-16 every week. Tennessee is not that team. \nThis Titans' offense is built around the running game. Murray and Derrick Henry are one of the NFL's top running back duos. The two combined for five carries for 11 yards in the first quarter, which didn't allow Tennessee to lean on it throughout the game. \n\"We gotta run the ball. And honestly, this offense lives and dies based on its offensive line,\" Lewan said. \"There's a lot riding on games especially when it comes to us, and we gotta play consistent every game.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "marcus mariota", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "matthews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rishard matthews", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "demarco murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taylor lewan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitney mercilus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "derrick henry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre hal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murray", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "titans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee titans", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tenn.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nashville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:45:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "632c1a62231e6e7b69ac17bec5850c826be81f02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbpk9_zHPTlr4MDCxba8LBb.2BHY8xEICLNWfu_azJ_dDGTUmS.0pSXkczjiBUCcMCUIXzQigj50FkKvrPh7VuXPdnvjMDbpCXr13l.JG1fR4HpgPJioKeL_qCNB227GZb", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=nfcwest", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - NFC West", "title": "Sean McVay's offensive turnaround of the Rams might be unprecedented", "title_full": "Sean McVay's offensive turnaround of the Rams might be unprecedented", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1001%2Fr267623_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "632c1a62231e6e7b69ac17bec5850c826be81f02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbpk9_zHPTlr4MDCxba8LBb.2BHY8xEICLNWfu_azJ_dDGTUmS.0pSXkczjiBUCcMCUIXzQigj50FkKvrPh7VuXPdnvjMDbpCXr13l.JG1fR4HpgPJioKeL_qCNB227GZb", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sean McVay's offensive turnaround of the Rams might be unprecedented", "text": "\u2022 Standings \n4. A significant upgrade at left tackle : Perhaps no team improved at one position more than the Rams did at one of the game's most important spots. They replaced Greg Robinson , one of the game's worst left tackles, with Andrew Whitworth , one of the game's best. They guaranteed $15 million to a 35-year-old offensive lineman, but it was worth it. \nWhitworth has allowed one pressure through his first four games, according to Pro Football Focus. His presence at left tackle, not to mention his willingness to mentor others, has made the entire offensive line better. Jared Goff has taken only four sacks in four games after taking 26 of them in seven games last season. Gurley is averaging 4.2 yards per carry after averaging 3.2 yards per carry last season. John Sullivan has also been a nice addition at center. \n3. Gurley got better : Yes, Gurley was victimized by a bad offensive line and a nonthreatening passing attack that made it easy for defenses to stack the box. But Gurley also missed his fair share of holes. Dating back to training camp, though, Gurley has been hitting holes quickly and decisively. He's running with a lot more confidence , and he has developed into a major threat as a receiver. \nGurley gained only 885 rushing yards last season, the lowest ever by someone with at least 275 carries. He made up for it somewhat by making 43 catches for 327 yards. This season, though, Gurley has hauled in 20 of his 22 targets for 234 yards. He has gained more than 100 yards on the ground in back-to-back games after going 20 straight games without reaching triple-digit rushing yards. And he leads the NFC in scrimmage yards with 596. \n2. Goff got way better : Goff bought in from day one, since the afternoon of Jan. 5, when he studied film with McVay a week before he was hired. When NFL rules kept him from interacting with his new coaches in the winter, Goff ironed out his throwing mechanics at the acclaimed 3DQB. In the spring, he basically lived at the facility, studying the new playbook and familiarizing himself with new teammates. \nSo far this season, Goff has done nothing but make sound decisions and execute precise throws. He leads the NFL with 9.2 yards per attempt and has a 61.5 Total QBR, eighth-highest in the NFL through the first four weeks. Goff has seven touchdowns, two more than he had all of the previous season, and only one interception. His quarterback rating is 112.2, nearly double the 63.6 mark from his rookie season. \n1. McVay implemented a great system : McVay has made the game a lot easier for Goff and has designed creative ways to get Gurley touches, whether it's creating the threat of a jet sweep with Austin or drawing up deceiving wheel routes or setting up screens off play fakes. The biggest key, in the words of McVay, are \"plays that start out the same but are different.\" \nA key staple of that is bunch formations that have receivers lining up tight with the offensive line, with an ability to run an assortment of passing and running plays off that. Because of that, play-action has been very effective as well. Another thing McVay and the new coaches did: Hammer home the fundamentals and demand perfection. \nSaid Austin: \"He works us to death in practice. He works us 'til we get it. ... He demands professionalism. That\u2019s what I like about him.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean mcvay", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andrew whitworth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared goff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcvay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john sullivan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg robinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "said austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "whitworth", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "rams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "austin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:47:06.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2702ac5d36b2a43c2976d64198692d72e03b5fe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbpk9_zHPTlr4MDCxba8LBb.2BHY8xEICLkImjqyWQCFs9t4fSewI4rMZjw1o5.mA.V12CC6Qv02YR0c_U6fVOvkXH_KmbTWIlaEOnZbT_s9OQ5OKoLvRZlYWTNns6UZ94", "site_full": "www.espn.com", "site": "espn.com", "site_section": "http://espn.go.com/blog/feed?blog=nfcwest", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "www.espn.com - NFC West", "title": "Kyle Shanahan sticking with Brian Hoyer but he 'needs to play better'", "title_full": "Kyle Shanahan sticking with Brian Hoyer but he 'needs to play better'", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F1002%2Fr268298_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 82023, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2702ac5d36b2a43c2976d64198692d72e03b5fe7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8Iypkc79NdeG8yJYhJakEbpk9_zHPTlr4MDCxba8LBb.2BHY8xEICLkImjqyWQCFs9t4fSewI4rMZjw1o5.mA.V12CC6Qv02YR0c_U6fVOvkXH_KmbTWIlaEOnZbT_s9OQ5OKoLvRZlYWTNns6UZ94", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kyle Shanahan sticking with Brian Hoyer but he 'needs to play better'", "text": "comment \nSANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Even after failing to lead a touchdown drive for the third time in four games, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brian Hoyer is still the starter, according to coach Kyle Shanahan. \nOne day after Hoyer and his pass-catchers struggled to do basics like throw and catch in a three-point overtime loss to Arizona, Shanahan was asked whether he was going to consider replacing Hoyer with rookie C.J. Beathard . \n\"No, I wouldn't,\" Shanahan said. \"I look at each game where, I know we're 0-4 and it feels extremely bad when you're 0-4, I've been in that situation in the NFL and it doesn't feel good, but you don't want to lose perspective. So you try to look at each game as it is, and I know we're 0-4 right now, but when you lose a total of three games by eight points -- I know we very easily could be 3-1 -- and you don't want to make drastic changes just for one reason, as there's a lot of things that go into losing games. It's never just one guy, and I try to put all that into thought.\" \nShanahan has taken note of some of Hoyer's struggles, but he's also keeping in mind that Hoyer hasn't gotten much help from pass-catchers not named Pierre Garcon and has also had inconsistent protection upfront, particularly on the interior. The first four games have mostly been a struggle for 49ers quarterback Brian Hoyer. Norm Hall/Getty Images \nNone of which is to say that Shanahan feels like Hoyer is playing as well he can right now, just that it would help Hoyer if he had guys around him helping out. \n\"I think he needs to play better, and I think we need to play better around him,\" Shanahan said. \"It's similar to what I said [Sunday] night, when you have the time and you've got guys open, you need to hit them. And I thought he struggled with that at times last night, which I know he can do better, and he does also, but I also know when he did make some key throws, guys weren't great at catching them for him, either. \n\"I think it's a two-way street. I think it takes everyone, coaches included. We all need to do better, and that's what we've got to do.\" \nHoyer's misfires on Sunday resulted in a 24-of-49 for 234 yards with an interception performance that left the Niners able to muster just five field goals in a game that was there for the taking. \nThe loss to Arizona had to be a bit disheartening for Hoyer after he took a big step forward in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Rams . But through his first four games as the 49ers quarterback, that effort against the Rams has been the outlier, which probably shouldn't be a surprise given Hoyer's journeyman status. \n\u201cObviously, I probably missed a few throws,\" Hoyer said. \"I have to get that figured out and then just keep going.\" \nHoyer is completing 58 percent of his passes for 858 yards with two touchdowns and four interceptions for a passer rating of 67.9 and a QBR of 23.7 this season. Among 32 starters, he ranks 30th in completion percentage, passer rating and yards per attempt and is 31st in total QBR. \nAfter a strong preseason and training camp, it's fair to wonder if Hoyer's confidence has been shaken by the lack of that translating into real games.
