It is expected that the upcoming scooter from TVS is likely to be the Jupiter 125 and might be powered by a new 125 cc single-cylinder fuel-injected engine. TVS, however, has not yet confirmed anything about the scooter. The new engine is expected to produce more power at around 8.5 hp than the current 110 cc unit's output of 8 hp. The automatic CVT transmission is expected to remain the same as in the present model.\nAlso read on MSN: Royal Enfield 750cc motorcycle may debut in November\nSimilar to the 110 cc version, the Jupiter 125 in its top-version could come with features such as alloy wheels and front disc brakes along with some other minor changes. The new TVS Jupiter 125 is also likely to get a telescopic suspension at the front and gas charged monoshock at the rear, similar to the ongoing model. However, the company might calibrate the suspension setup for better handling and performance.\nAlso read on MSN: Kawasaki India launches Z900 limited edition\nThe 110 cc TVS Jupiter is priced between Rs 50,051 and Rs 54,651, ex-showroom, Delhi and prices of the new Jupiter 125 are expected to start from Rs 58,000. When launched, it will compete with the likes of the Honda Activa 125, Suzuki Access 125, Mahindra Gusto 125 and other 125 cc scooters in the segment.\nRecently, TVS also introduced a new Classic Edition of the Jupiter in the country that features retro styling. The scooter features a front windscreen, chrome finished round rear view mirrors, chrome finished pillion grab rail with backrest and dual tone seat with stitching details. It is powered by the same 110 cc engine as the standard model and the TVS Jupiter Classic Edition is priced at Rs 55,551, ex-showroom, Delhi.\nImage Source: Team-BHP.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.financialexpress.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "kawasaki india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal enfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jupiter", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T13:55:52.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2c370113637a89382d254a5f4c7b2c2e5b85be29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7l4qdL568d1QSjr24m1MS9K6wwBVnckDt64RU9U4Qhzti9M9PikIkcg96lJXR0dODJx_L9GLDmRrseF5sts81od2bMCEIlL_nQJ38FyuiOpNjePJwpDWZm58Q7hFYbKj7eExlzWV0w6buc3EidSQn08BPUfS3B6SE1o0ulFEWo6CHfTjryDocT8Q--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/lifestyle", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "MSN Lifestyle India | Latest updates from the world of Fashion, Beauty, Astro, Luxury, Relationships and Family, Health, Food, Travel, Shopping and more.", "title": "Tired of ghosting and other terrible dating trends?

Try 'breezing' and make your love life easy India Today 3 days ago Dipannita Saha Truth be told, all these so-called dating trends had started making us lose faith in love and humanity altogether. Whether is stashing , breadcrumbing , or hyping --one dating trend is worse than the other. But, it's time to praise the dating Gods (if there are any), because there's a hot new dating trend on the block which is not at all negative! Behold 'breezing' that will make your love life as peaceful as a quaint breeze.\n\u00a9 India Today Group Praise the dating Gods people, there's a new dating trend 'breezing' on the block. Photo Courtesy: Youtube/TSeries What is this 'breezing' you ask? According to Esquire , it is a term used for when you say goodbye to the conventional \"dating rules\" and are straight-up honest, right from the beginning. Yes, that's right. You can come right out in the open about your expectations and feelings and say goodbye to mixed signals and mind games forever!\nHow did this term come in to be? Well, this method has been tried and tested by Jenna Dewan Tatum, and husband Channing Tatum says that Dewan admitting her feelings was, \"the sexiest thing she'd ever done for me.\"\nIf you're still curious, here are four ways to ace the breezing game, and make your love life thandi hawa ka jhoka .\nStop Following Those Three-Day Stupid Texting Rules\nYou want to stop getting into complicated mathematical equations to find out if you should be messaging the guy? Then just message him. Enough of those three-day or four-day texting rules.\nIf You Were The Last One To Message, It Doesn't Matter\nImagine you were having a conversation with him last night and you ended up sending him the last message. Usually rules say that you let him initiate a conversation the next day. But, not anymore. So what you texted last? It's okay to be the one to initiate the conversation again, no second thoughts given.\nIf You Like Him, Just Tell Him\nLeading someone on when you don't feel the same as they do is the worst thing you can do to someone. You like him? You tell him, girl. And if you don't, tell him that you are still figuring things out. Basically, breezing allows both of you the space to be honest, without hurting or leading the other on.\nFigure Out If It's A Fling Or Something Serious\nSo you like him, but is it just a fling or something more than that? You see, it's very important to define a relationship. When you define something, you also clear out all the doubts that you may have in your mind regarding that person. Just figure out what it is--is it a fling? A relationship? Or just casual sex?\n(Provided by Buzz60)\n Bragging About Your Vacation Stays on Social Media Can Get You Free Gifts!

Popsugar 3 days ago Laura L Hernandez \u00a9 StockSnap/ Elizabeth Tsung You don't go around announcing it, but people can tell your marriage . . . sucks. You alternate between hiding how bad it is by making everything look \"Facebook perfect\" and revealing to friends just how frustrated you are. Sometimes you think that maybe it's just how marriage is. Sometimes you wonder if maybe your expectations are too high. Either way, it's clear from the outside that you are settling for a miserable marriage, thanks to these 10 signs.\nThe two of you act differently around others.\n\u00a9 StockSnap/ William Stitt The two of you act differently around others. You cover up the unhappiness and try to make it look like \"business as usual,\" but both of you are thinking that things are just not good at all!\nYour partner is giving you crumbs of love . . . or vice versa. \u00a9 StockSnap/ Evan McDougall Your partner is giving you crumbs of love . . . or vice versa. These crumbs of love aren't enough, and you or your partner constantly feels as if something is missing . . . as if either one of you has to beg for affection and love.\nYou are making up and breaking up like it's in the job description. \u00a9 StockSnap/Christiana Rivers You are making up and breaking up like it's in the job description. The two of you threaten divorce and then make up more times than either of you can count. It's more dramatic than a soap opera!\nMost of your time is spent wondering if all marriages are like this. \u00a9 StockSnap/bardia hashemirad Most of your time is spent wondering if all marriages are like this. If you're really wondering if your marriage is normal . . . well, perhaps it's not! If you spend a lot of time comparing your marriage to others, not only is that a bad habit to get into and destructive, but it may also be because you're so unhappy and don't understand why.\nYou live parallel lives, frequently venturing off alone. \u00a9 StockSnap/ Alexandr Baranets You live parallel lives, frequently venturing off alone. If the two of you aren't spending any time together and your existences run parallel, your marriage is most likely miserable.\nOne sign of a miserable marriage? Always waiting for your partner. \u00a9 StockSnap/William Stitt One sign of a miserable marriage? Always waiting for your partner. Whether it's literally waiting for your spouse to show up or metaphorically waiting on your partner hand and foot, you're not in a happy marriage.\nThe bedroom is quiet. \u00a9 StockSnap/ Tirachard Kumtanom The bedroom is quiet. You and your spouse rarely have sex. So rarely, in fact, that you are starting to feel very lonely. And unwanted.\nYou make so many wishes: wishing it were better . . . wishing he or she were different. \u00a9 StockSnap/ Alexandr Baranets You make so many wishes: wishing it were better . . . wishing he or she were different. You have a million regrets about your marriage. Instead of thinking about real-life strategies to make it better at this point, you just wish it were different, but you know it's not. You know deep inside that you are unhappily married.\nYou're happier when he or she is not around. \u00a9 StockSnap/Francesco Gallarotti You're happier when he or she is not around. You live for alone time. You envision the future without your spouse but never say this to him or her. You feel single, even though you certainly aren't.\nYour daily mood? Sad. Depressed. Distracted. \u00a9 StockSnap/ Aidan Meyer Your daily mood? Sad. Depressed. Distracted. Your friends and family hate seeing you this way. They notice how unhappy you are. People hate seeing you settle. Even you start to acknowledge your depressive state about your marriage, but you feel trapped and hopeless.\n(Provided by Wochit)\n Therapists Share Habits That Always End a Marriage If you're wondering where your marriage is heading, it could be for turmoil.

Actually, the opposite is true.\n\"Are you and daddy getting divorced?\"\nI was four years old, sitting on the bathroom floor and chatting with my mom while she soaked in the tub, when I blurted out this question.\n\"No, of course not!\" she immediately responded. \"Why would you think that?\" I don't remember what I said next, but somehow we moved on to a new topic.\nLater, I heard her whispering on the phone about what I'd said. She must have been thinking, \"How did my little girl, the one with the stay-at-home mom and Catholic upbringing, know about divorce?\"\nR ELATED GALLERY: The 12 Things You Should Tell Your Spouse Every Day for a Happier Marriage (Provided by Reader's Digest) The 12 Things You Should Tell Your Spouse Every Day for a Happier Marriage\nIt's not like my parents were screaming and slamming doors all the time. Their unhappiness wasn't supposed to be obvious, especially not to a little girl. But somehow, even at that young age, I could sense that my parents were deeply unhappy in their marriage.\nTurns out they did get divorced \u2014 four years later, right around my eighth birthday. The quietly hostile relationship that my parents had when they were married bloomed into an outwardly hostile one during the split, and it stayed that way for years after the divorce papers were signed. By the time my sister and I were pre-teens, our dad had remarried and pretty much vanished from our lives.\nThe whole thing \u2014 the divorce, our father deciding to go his own separate way \u2014 was incredibly sad and unfortunate, but it taught me an important lesson: It's almost impossible to have a happy childhood if you have miserable parents.\nAt some point, I decided that if I were ever to get married and have kids, I would do everything I could to have a happy marriage that lasted for the long haul. And if that wasn't possible, then at least I would do my best to forge a positive relationship with my ex-husband for the sake of my kids.\nYears later, I met an amazing man. I got married and we celebrated our tenth wedding anniversary this past June. We're very happy, and because I want to stay happily married and give our three-year-old son the kind of joyful home I didn't have while I was growing up, I put my marriage first.\nThat's right. My husband comes before anyone else in my life, including my beloved child. And I'll tell you why your husband is more important than your child.\nBefore anyone calls me a selfish, terrible mother, please let me explain what I mean by that; I think you'll see that it's not as harsh as it sounds. And, in fact, the priorities that we've set benefit everyone involved.\nPutting my marriage first means I'm protecting the relationship that's central to Mason's happy childhood; I'm making sure that Chris and I coexist happily despite the changes that we experienced in our relationship after our baby was born, particularly in those first few months (from the way that we needed to divert our attention and, at times, affections to this new little person in our lives to the mind-boggling lack of sleep that lasted for months and made us argue about silly little things like who forgot to buy more coffee when the last bag ran out).\nPutting my marriage first does not mean neglecting my son; Chris and I are extremely involved parents . We both say constantly that Mason is the love of our lives. He's the greatest thing we've ever done; we can't imagine our lives without him. We love him infinity plus.\nSo for Mason's sake (and for ours), here's how we make our marriage our top priority and why your husband is more important than your child, always.\n1. We plan child-free couple vacations.\nThis isn't something my husband and I do every year; in fact, we've only done it once so far, but we plan on taking more trips alone in the future. Our first vacation a deux took place when Mason was six months old.\nToo soon? No way. Chris and I needed to go somewhere and reconnect after my extremely difficult pregnancy (which included 30 weeks of morning sickness and extreme anxiety), so my mom graciously volunteered to come to New York to stay with him for five days. She insisted that we needed that time alone, even though I dreaded leaving the baby.\nAnd you know what? She was right. Going on that trip was the best thing we could have done for our marriage . We had s**, we got some much-needed rest and we had wonderful dinners together. By the time we returned to New York, we were a stronger, happier couple \u2014 and ready to take on whatever Mason dished out. Bring on those sleepless nights, baby. We can handle it!\n2. We present a united front.\nThis means we always have each other's back, no matter what. When Chris needed to take a job that would keep him in another city five days a week, I supported him. When I told Chris in September that I needed to leave my nightmare job and do something else, he supported me, no further explanation needed.\nWith Mason, it's all about being on the same page at all times; we never try to become the favorite parent by caving into what Mason wants versus what we believe is right. For example, I feel strongly that Mason needs to go to bed at 8 PM unless it's a special occasion. Chris, on the other hand, would be fine with letting him stay up later... but he knows this issue is important to me, so he respects my wishes.\nWe're being consistent with our messaging to Mason so that he doesn't get confused and so that he feels secure with a consistent routine. But more importantly, we're showing him that we're united in the decisions that we make, as well as demonstrating unequivocal support and respect for each other.\n3. We keep the baby out of the bed.\nChris and I made a conscious decision from the very beginning not to co-sleep (although Mason's bassinet was in our bedroom for months) because we wanted a space where we could have s ** or cuddle without worrying about a baby sleeping between us. Now that Mason is a toddler, he will crawl into bed with us in the early morning hours, and we're not going to kick him out; we're more than happy (and grateful!) for that cuddle time.\nBut when it's time to go to sleep every night, it's just the two of us, no exceptions. And since that's always the way we've operated, we've never had an issue with Mason about it. He understands that this space is mommy's and daddy's special place, just like his room is his.\n4. I respect my husband's needs (and he does the same).\nNeither of us is a morning person , so we take turns getting up with Mason at the crack of dawn every day. Sometimes Mason insists that mommy (or daddy) needs to be up, too, and we're very clear that he gets the undivided attention of one parent every morning because mommy or daddy is tired and she/he needs some extra rest.\nOr sometimes mommy needs to go to the gym alone, or daddy needs a night out with friends. We protect the other partner's needs out of love and respect. Those time-outs make us better parents \u2014 and better partners, too.\n5. I recognize my husband's greatness (and he returns the favor ).\nI am Chris' biggest fan (his publicist, even) and he's mine. We praise each other to other people, as well as to our son. Every morning when I come out into the living room, dressed for work, Chris points to me and says to Mason, \"Isn't mommy beautiful?\" When Chris cooks us one of his amazing dinners, I point to the food and say to Mason, \"Isn't daddy the best cook?\"\nWe compliment each other in front of Mason, both to build his respect and love for the other parent, as well as to show our love and appreciation for each other. It's our way of keeping the other partner from feeling unimportant, unnoticed, or on the back burner.\nHeather Morgan Shott is a Midwesterner-turned-New Yorker.

Hundreds of students, considered the brightest in the country, will vie for top jobs amidst the IT sector losing sheen over reported mass layoffs as skills turn obsolete due to automation and the Trump administration insisting on more employment for US nationals.\n\"Our placement officer did say there was a reduction in IT placements and an increase in manufacturing placements. They expect the trend to continue this year as well,\" said a final-year electrical engineering student.\nThe top-bracket salaries that these companies are offering indicate that they will hire on Day 1 , said two students appearing for placements. Usually, the biggest names in the field land on campuses early on in the season to lap up the creamiest of layers.\nWhile they will hire software engineers, product developers and product engineers with coding knowledge, big management firms like AT Kearney, Bain & Company and Boston Consulting Group are expected to hire consultants and data scientists on Day 1. These roles are open to students of other branches of engineering as well. Private lenders Axis Bank and HSBC have also registered with IIT-D .\nThe placement process is set to gain momentum after October 22 when students return from the mid-term break. Software giants Microsoft and Google, and India's biggest e-commerce company Flipkart are also likely to join the list of recruiters by then, students said.\n\"I expect the number of recruiting companies to go up to 100-120 by October end,\" the mechanical engineering student said.\nHowever, the electrical engineering student said the mood on the campus is a lot better than what it was last year. \"Lots of firms are coming and tests are happening. It should be better than last year, when it was bad. We feel positive.\"\nWith reports saying many lost their jobs because of not upgrading their skills, students are rushing to learn some of these subjects, he said. \"Machine learning is pretty hot right now. VLSI chip design is another area that students are keen on. Students also take up finance and marketing courses at the MBA department to prepare for consultancy jobs.'' IBM is hiring for a machine learning role, he added. Not many startups have registered so far, with California-based cloud services firm Rubrik being the only attractive one on the list, students said.\nMany startups, including Zomato, Portea Medical and Hopscotch , were blacklisted from the institute's placements last year because they later withdrew the offers made to students. However, the ban has been lifted.\nThis year startups will reportedly be bunched together on one day called 'Startup Day', which will be slotted way below on the fourth or fifth day of placements. Students may also be told to conduct their own checks before accepting an offer from a startup.\nThe ban being revoked has not made a huge difference to students, according to a final-year textile engineering student.\n\"However, the good thing about startups is that many of them will consider even students from non-IT backgrounds if they know coding. That's not something a Microsoft or a Google would do. Sometimes, startups even hire for non-core positions like business development,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://indiatoday.intoday.in/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hopscotch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vidya s samsung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rubrik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ibm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wipro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "axis bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vlsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flipkart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oracle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian institute of technology-delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "at kearney, bain & company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston consulting group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portea medical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:06:53.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d654793d1efed9d3d5bd5465e7789770a9fba3ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z2UbGAzeJlMGBnA2XMUp1Z7PyuC3upP2by4LFBweDwjUfzynL_6D1igQLRtBK0gA961mDy3KMv0NnUhrU5Yt7k1Uiljt29I7yBur4QhEsCcRXnCUGv9i4M_0Scl.K5lBGg-", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Latest India and World news, photos and videos | MSN India", "title": "These top Indian stocks seen extending rally after 400% surge this year", "title_full": "These top Indian stocks seen extending rally after 400% surge this year", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.049, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d654793d1efed9d3d5bd5465e7789770a9fba3ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z2UbGAzeJlMGBnA2XMUp1Z7PyuC3upP2by4LFBweDwjUfzynL_6D1igQLRtBK0gA961mDy3KMv0NnUhrU5Yt7k1Uiljt29I7yBur4QhEsCcRXnCUGv9i4M_0Scl.K5lBGg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Swansy Afonso", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "These top Indian stocks seen extending rally after 400% surge this year", "text": "These top Indian stocks seen extending rally after 400% surge this year Livemint 2 hours ago Swansy Afonso Mumbai: For these two Indian companies, the best may well be yet to come.\nGraphite India Ltd and HEG Ltd are leading manufacturers of graphite electrodes, an essential component of electric arc furnaces that turn scrap into steel.

to respond to Sunday's horrific Las Vegas shooting with love and positivity.\nThe \"I'm the One\" artist and Ed Sheeran were the first guests at the newly relaunched TRL premiere on Monday, where they responded to the domestic terror attack at the Mandalay Bay Resort, where a gunman opened fire at a country music festival, killing at least 59 people and wounding over 500 more.\n\"My prayers go out to everybody in Vegas. The whole world, we gotta pray more. Love is the key, love is the answer, we have to come together and help each other more, this is tragic,\" Khaled implored. \"When I woke up this morning, I was like, 'What is going on?'\"\n\"I'm sending all my love to all the families out there,\" he added. \"Hopefully they can rise up and overcome this.\"\n\"It's all about love and unity and there's not much else we can do, really,\" Sheeran chimed in, echoing Khaled's statement.\n\"I'm a father, so I'm praying,\" Khaled added, referencing his adorable 11-month-old son, Asahd, who joined him for the premiere.\nBut will Asahd be a TRL regular? \"He got his nap times, so he's the boss, the king! A young mogul,\" the proud papa said. \"When he's ready to go he's always invited. Everywhere I go, my son is with me. That's my life.\"\nMeanwhile, ET also talked to TRL c o-host Tamara Dhia about how they planned to handle the horrific events.\n\" TRL is not just a place where we talk about music, but it's also a place where we talk about real-life events,\" Dhia explained to ET. \"We're all affected by this tragedy, and we're hoping that we can maybe be a place of comfort for the children.

And it was welcomed \u2014 a moment to breathe. A moment to appreciate life and enjoy a little TV. A moment to remember that we're fortunate to have such a luxury.\nSo, let\u2019s take a couple hours and let go.\nThe world is, well, it\u2019s dark, y\u2019all. But in the name of Tom Bergeron \u2014 the show must go on. And it's \"Guilty Pleasure Night.\" So let\u2019s focus on being kind. Let\u2019s focus on sparkles. Let\u2019s focus on dancing in sequins. And you know? Let\u2019s not worry about who\u2019s going home either, because this week, it\u2019s no one. And if you didn\u2019t really soak up that kindness message, take a page from Tom, and let\u2019s get to reviewing the night. \u00a9 Lou Rocco, AP Season 25 of 'Dancing with the Stars' premieres Monday.\nBest of the rest Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas: 27/30\nGuilty pleasure: pajamas all day\nCALL UPON THE NAME OF STACY KEIBLER IF YOU\u2019RE NOT WORTHY! Lindsey and Mark are doing a jive to Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go ! Can you imagine? It\u2019s an iconic routine from Keibler in Season 2, but even still, Lindsey and Mark did not do so bad. The judges call it iconic, and it was great, but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 it\u2019s no Stacy Keibler. It\u2019s enough to solidify 9s across the board though.\nJordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold: 25/30\nGuilty pleasure: comic books\nLOL, these guilty pleasures are incredible. But at the core of the absurdity is incredible arts lover and Charleston experts, Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold who, dare I say, just did a routine that should be Dancing with the Stars CANON. It\u2019s like, professional comic book art. The choreography, the music, and the set are all perfect (even if it didn\u2019t meet Len\u2019s standard of Charleston), and it\u2019s more than deserving of the season\u2019s first 10.\nVanessa Lachey and Alan Bernstein: 23/30\nGuilty pleasure: girls night out\nSo, Vanessa is like a low key Chrissy Teigen, you know? But when she\u2019s on the dance floor, she looks like a pro. She gets a couple dings for a wobble or two, but she still manages to shine with a 23, and that\u2019s not bad, y\u2019all. Vanessa Lachey is the kind of stuff final threes are made of.\nBest of the rest Nikki Bella and Artem Chigvintsev: 21/30\nGuilty Pleasure: 50 Shades of Grey\nOkay, weird elevator dance sequence! I see you! Some stars just connect from night one, and Nikki did not do that for us. But, you know what? She\u2019s making some serious ground up, and her Viennese Waltz to Love on the Brain is the kind of performance that could legitimately take her to the end.\nDrew Scott and Emma Slater: 23/30\nVictoria Arlen and Val Chmerkovskiy: 22/30\nFrankie Muniz and Witney Carson: 21/30\nNick Lachey and Peta Murgatroyd: 21/30\nDerek Fisher and Sharna Burgess: 21/30\nTerrell Owens and Cheryl Burke: 21/30\nSasha Pieterse and Gleb Savchenko: 19/30\nUSA TODAY Sparkle Points Podium Sasha Pieterse: 5/5\nGimmicks. Are. Wonderful. So when Sasha and Gleb rolled up as full-bedazzled chefs, you can\u2019t help but cheer. The jazz routine didn\u2019t get five starts, but the gimmick was perfect.\nNick Lachey: 4.5/5\nWe see you, overwrought '80s rom com chic. A lot of pastels and rhinestones. A lot of workout gear. A call back to Love Actually . It\u2019s all the stuff of wardrobe champions.\nJordan Fisher: 4/5\nWhen you dye your hair to match your ensemble, there\u2019s something to be said about that. And when that ensemble is like... a lycra-looking light blue jumpsuit.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Bell \u00a9 Trae Patton/NBC Jennifer Hudson might be new to The Voice\u2019 s stateside scene, but she\u2019s already developing her own sort of feud here with a co-coach. Surprisingly enough, it\u2019s Blake Shelton she seems to have to square off with the most because it turns out they have similar taste.\nMeanwhile, Adam Levine and Miley Cyrus\u2019 interests are also starting to run in a similar vein \u2014 she might be leaning heavy on the country crooner side of things lately, but she still has a deep interest in rock, too, so she\u2019s able to scoop up talent from a multitude of genres, much to Adam\u2019s chagrin.\nLet\u2019s take a look at who comes out for round three of The Voice \u2018s blind auditions.\nAdam Cunningham (38 \u2013 Nashville, Tennessee)\n\u201cMidnight Rider\u201d by The Allman Brothers Band\nImagine you\u2019re playing some kind of Sims game where you have to make the perfect contestant for Team Blake. That\u2019s Adam Cunningham. From his familiar locale \u2014 the man actually records songwriter demos in Blake Shelton\u2019s old studio \u2014 to the hip country clothes to his steely vocals (which have a strong Charlie Daniels persuasion), it\u2019s a match made in Nashville.\nJennifer Hudson tries to throw her hat (but not shoe) into the ring on account of the soul she heard beneath the brass and Southern sass, but Blake\u2019s got this one in the bag.\nTeam : Blake\nHannah Mrozak (18 \u2013 Richfield, Wisconsin)\n\u201cStarving\u201d by Hailee Steinfeld\nWith a pop starlet and an R&B diva on the coaching panel, it might seem a little strange for a fledgling female artist of those genres to bypass both in favor of Team Adam, but this time, he puts the \u201cAdam\u201d in adamant.\nHannah is still pretty new to the singing world and was inspired to pursue this passion by her late brother, who insisted music was her true future. Despite a shaky start, she manages to escape her nerves and deliver a pretty fearless effort at this note-scattered number, which would be very difficult for a less competent crooner. There are still some kinks to be worked out \u2014 or, as Adam might call them, \u201cpocket issues\u201d \u2014 but her vocal fluidity is undeniable and has a place here in this competition.\nTeam : Adam\nShilo Gold (26 \u2013 Denver, Colorado)\n\u201cStay With Me (Baby)\u201d by Lorraine Ellison\nMiley Cyrus seems to always get at least one sure fit for her team \u2014 the last season she coached, it was Darby Walker. This time, it looks like Shilo Gold will do the honors. Because while she\u2019s hardly a perfect singer \u2014 the beginning notes drag too far to the floor of her range, her high notes are off pitch, and even her full voice is a little inconsistent \u2014 there\u2019s a familiar rasp to her voice that Miley thinks she can work with.\nShilo came into the night thinking she\u2019d opt for Team Jennifer if she had the chance because she respects J. Hud\u2019s ability to capture a room before even opening her mouth, but Miley\u2019s promise to help her choose the right songs for her unique vocals wins the day this time.\nTeam : Miley\nSamantha Rios (16 \u2013 Arlington, Virginia)\n\u201cSomething\u2019s Gotta Hold on Me\u201d by Etta James\nThis season isn\u2019t shaping up to be the one for the younger talents, like last year was. Samantha Rios here has some gumption that can\u2019t be taught, but unfortunately there\u2019s just not enough technicality in her tones to earn a chair turn. As Jennifer Hudson points out, it could be that the song just requires some range outside of her skill set \u2014 particularly when it comes to the super low notes that made Etta James so untouchable \u2014 but she\u2019s definitely got some skill and performance savvy that she can hone and then come back and try out again.\nHey, she was brave enough to sing for the president of the United States, so a repeat audition on The Voice should be a cakewalk for this young lady.\nTeam : N/A\nNoah Mac (17 \u2013 Dublin, California)\n\u201cWay Down We Go\u201d by Kaleo\nEvery now and again, a singer comes along whose dedication to the performance is louder than his actual voice, and that seems to be the case with Noah Mac, who started singing at 8 years old during the memorial service for his own sister.\nNoah claims to be inspired by soul and gospel music, and it shows in his Hozier-esque vocals. What really impresses Blake, though, is how well Noah is able to lift out of those low, growly notes and into his head space while still maintaining the \u201croundness\u201d of his sound. While Jennifer Hudson is very complimentary about the effusiveness of his delivery, Blake wins the day by pointing out that Noah is emotionally equipped for the pressures of this competition already and can go far with the right leadership.\nTeam : Blake\nDavon Fleming (30 \u2013 Baltimore, Maryland)\n\u201cMe & Mrs. Jones\u201d by Billy Paul\nYou know Jennifer Hudson is interested in a singer when she not only throws a shoe but proceeds to do a duet with him. In this case, it\u2019s for Davon Fleming, who\u2019s got Stevie Wonder-level range and spirit as he belts out this number in his own, happy-go-lucky way.\nDavon is a worship leader who\u2019s clearly infected by persistent positivity, and all four coaches can\u2019t help but turn around for him, whether they\u2019ve got a legitimate shot at winning him over or not. Blake\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve won five times\u201d bit is a no-go, and Miley\u2019s name-dropping of Dolly Parton backfires when Jennifer Hudson takes that note to share the stage with Davon and sing \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d at which point it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re a perfect match. They even dress alike.\nTeam : Jennifer\nKathrina Feigh (24 \u2013 Philippines)\n\u201cBig White Room\u201d by Jessie J\nMove over, musical theater. Kathrina here put all her eggs in the music-theater basket throughout her education, but she\u2019s ready to step out into a solo spotlight. And The Voice might be a good place for her to do just that, because with the size of her voice and the range that comes naturally to her, the rest can definitely be coached.\nHer delivery sounds a lot like Ingrid Michaelson, but she\u2019s also got some ambitiousness that seems to stretch her beyond her comfort zone. With Jennifer \u201cIf you can think the note, you can sing it\u201d Hudson herself as her coach, she\u2019s in good hands.\nTeam : Jennifer\nAddison Agen (16 \u2013 Fort Wayne, Indiana)\n\u201cJolene\u201d by Ray LaMontagne\nSome people just breathe music, and that\u2019s definitely the case for Addison Agen. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of worldly experience just yet \u2014 auditioning for The Voice marked her first trip on an airplane, even \u2014 but her dad owns a record store and her mom is a music therapist for senior citizens, so that folk singer quality comes naturally to her.\nOn the other hand, when Addison does try to stretch her octave, it sounds a touch forced. It\u2019s her default voice that really lands, and that\u2019s probably what gets the attention of Adam and Miley. In the end, she and Miley have a little more in common, as both have experience being underestimated for their youth, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see if Miley has what it takes to groom Addison for the next level.\nTeam : Miley\nAdam Pearce (31- New Orleans, Louisiana)\n\u201cHot Blooded\u201d by Foreigner\nIt\u2019s a good thing Adam Levine has a great memory because when Adam Pearce comes back after being denied a spot in season 12, he\u2019s looking at his name twin for the fateful turn. And turn Adam does. Adam No. 2 was critiqued and sent away for being a little too chaotic and unwieldy with his rock enthusiasm the first time, so he\u2019s since consulted some vocal coaches to get the 411 on how to contain his screams.\nThis time, though he\u2019s still rocking out with tubular enthusiasm to a tune that\u2019s squarely in his wheelhouse, Adam No. 2 doesn\u2019t lose control of his pitch the way he did last time, and he earns Adam\u2019s bid \u2014 and Miley\u2019s \u2014 for that reason. Miley doesn\u2019t even put up much of a fight to recruit him; the Adams are clearly meant for each other in more ways than just a shared moniker.\nTeam : Adam\nMyles Frost (17 \u2013 Washington, D.C.)\n\u201cMy Cherie Amour\u201d by Stevie Wonder\nAs much as talent matters on this show, a lot also rides on a contestant\u2019s ability to choke back their nerves and provide a convincing showcase for the coaches \u2014 after all, all the coaches get to go off of is what they hear, and there are no second chances. But something tells me that if the coaches had the opportunity to see how much this young man oozes artistry, playing a litany of instruments and dancing with abandon, they might\u2019ve been convinced.\nAlas, it\u2019s his shaky rendition of an already exacting number that ultimately informs their decision to pass on Myles Frost, although the coaches do heavily encourage him to come back with a little more preparation and confidence.\nTeam : N/A\nMoriah Farmica (16 \u2013 Albany, New York)\n\u201cCrazy on You\u201d by Heart\nMost teenagers who come on this show probably don\u2019t have the credentials or cool factor of this girl. Moriah Formica has been singing on a pseudo-professional level for a while now, opening for and then collaborating with Michael Sweet before she was even old enough for junior prom. And what\u2019s even more impressive is that she absolutely shreds this song.\nShe\u2019s got a composure that\u2019s both stoic and radical, and, more importantly, she doesn\u2019t waver in strength during her spot-on rendition of this outright power ballad. As Adam puts it during his sincere plea for her to join his team, she could easily sub in for Ann Wilson if Ann ever needed a sick day \u2014 it\u2019s that on point. Ultimately, though, Moriah is wooed to Team Miley by her promises of big-sisterly advice and picking songs that will, like this one, let her blare her voice like she wants to. And you know what? That might just work. If this performance is any indication, Moriah\u2019s got it all already and just needs an adequate jam platform. As Jennifer Hudson phrases it, she has \u201cown[ed] her moment\u201d here tonight.\nTeam : Miley\nThe rest:\nTeam Jennifer also added Alexandra Joyce, who did a delicate but pretty (from the sounds of the montage sample, at least) rendition of Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cWildest Dreams.\u201d She also snagged Eric Lyn by default, since she was the only one to turn for his take on \u201cOoh Child\u201d by The Five Stairsteps, citing his attention to every note. Meanwhile, Anna Catherine DeHart found herself on Team Blake after delivering a \u201ccutting\u201d performance of Maren Morris\u2019 \u201cI Could Use a Love Song.\u201d\nTEAM STANDINGS :\nTeam Adam

"text": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday CNBC 1 hr ago Alexandra Gibbs \u00a9 Provided by CNBC U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open Tuesday, with the positive trading streak for the fourth quarter set to continue, after Wall Street finished on a strong note in the previous session.\nOn the first trading day of 2017's fourth quarter , U.S. equities finished Monday's session on a strong note, not only closing at record highs but with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 152.51 points by the close. While this positive trading sentiment is set to continue, domestic and political news, however, are set to keep investors on edge.\n One of the key stories set to dominate talk Tuesday is that of Sunday's deadly shooting in Las Vegas. At least 59 people were killed and more than 500 were injured after a gunman opened fire on thousands of concertgoers at a country music festival. The incident has been categorized as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\nElsewhere, eyes will be on U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday as he is set to travel to Puerto Rico, in light of the recent havoc inflicted on the Caribbean island by Hurricane Maria.\nThe natural disaster wiped out the power grid, while 88 percent of the cellphone sites in Puerto Rico still have no service and less than half of the nation's residents have access to running water, according to Reuters.\nIn commodities , oil prices showed signs of being under pressure during early market trade, as global supply glut concerns continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

If they're going to have success moving forward, Hill will need to see more touches.\nOutside linebacker is becoming a position of dire need\nIt's so frustrating when injuries ruin depth at key positions. In Kansas City it seems like the outside linebackers are consistently thinned out, whether by Justin Houston's nagging knees or Tamba Hali's aging body. Now that Ford is on the injury report, Kansas City is down to Zombo and Terrance Smith to man the edge opposite Houston.\nKansas City is infinitely easier to attack when the game plan can be \"run away from Houston.\" One of these younger Chiefs linebackers will need to step up and find a role to keep Zombo, a constant liability, off the field.\nRelated Slideshow: Best of the 2017 NFL Season

In Kansas City it seems like the outside linebackers are consistently thinned out, whether by Justin Houston's nagging knees or Tamba Hali's aging body. Now that Ford is on the injury report, Kansas City is down to Zombo and Terrance Smith to man the edge opposite Houston.\nKansas City is infinitely easier to attack when the game plan can be \"run away from Houston.\" One of these younger Chiefs linebackers will need to step up and find a role to keep Zombo, a constant liability, off the field.\nRelated Slideshow: Best of the 2017 NFL Season

slightly higher open Tuesday, with the positive trading streak for the fourth quarter set to continue, after Wall Street finished on a strong note in the previous session.\nOn the first trading day of 2017's fourth quarter , U.S. equities finished Monday's session on a strong note, not only closing at record highs but with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 152.51 points by the close. While this positive trading sentiment is set to continue, domestic and political news, however, are set to keep investors on edge.\nPopular Searches Toyota Motor Corp TM\n\u25b2 119.31 +0.14 +0.12% Equifax Inc EFX\n\u25b2 107.81 +1.82 +1.72% One of the key stories set to dominate talk Tuesday is that of Sunday's deadly shooting in Las Vegas. At least 59 people were killed and more than 500 were injured after a gunman opened fire on thousands of concertgoers at a country music festival. The incident has been categorized as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\nElsewhere, eyes will be on U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday as he is set to travel to Puerto Rico, in light of the recent havoc inflicted on the Caribbean island by Hurricane Maria.\nThe natural disaster wiped out the power grid, while 88 percent of the cellphone sites in Puerto Rico still have no service and less than half of the nation's residents have access to running water, according to Reuters.\nIn commodities , oil prices showed signs of being under pressure during early market trade, as global supply glut concerns continued to weigh on investor sentiment. At 5.55 a.m. ET, U.S. crude fell slightly, trading around $50.46 per barrel, while Brent hovered around $55.91.\nIn earnings, Lennar (LEN) , and Paychex (PAYX) are set to report their latest financial figures.\nIn stocks news, investors are to keep an eye on the latest moves in defense and gun company stocks, following the massacre in Las Vegas, and Procter& Gamble is set to hold a webcast to answer shareholder questions.\nOverseas, European stocks were trading relatively flat in market trade, while markets in Asia closed on a mixed note after the Reserve Bank of Australia chose to keep its rates unchanged Tuesday.\nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.cnbc.com/pre-markets/?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104748472", "http://www.cnbc.com/", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/02/shooter-las-vegas-strip-police.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104748472", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/02/us-stocks-fourth-quarter-trump.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104748472", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/european-markets-spanish-stocks-in-focus-on-catalonia-concerns.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104748472", "https://www.facebook.com/cnbcinternational", "https://twitter.com/cnbci", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/02/asia-markets-reserve-bank-of-australia-decision-us-gains-and-dollar-in-focus.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104748472", "https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/02/oil-prices-in-focus-amid-oversupply-concerns.html?__source=msn|money|inline|story|&par=msn&doc=104748472"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandra gibbs", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dow", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paychex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equifax inc efx", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc international on twitter and facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lennar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toyota motor corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "procter& gamble", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of australia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "wall street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:27:30.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "476e5b8baa02efc55224b9820317ebdfcec60085", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KYU0JGwr1tCW4eMFU34tJz9ESXH9y1wq4qjwxPw9nHZS558KxjluSuG5xvSyMoIbU8_4XgVkiJAOTLARJf4Hdtnm6DywcaNte", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/tv/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News, recaps, video, local listings and more \u2013 MSN TV", "title": "'DWTS' opens with moment of silence, no eliminations", "title_full": "'DWTS' opens with moment of silence, no eliminations", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.244, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "476e5b8baa02efc55224b9820317ebdfcec60085", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KYU0JGwr1tCW4eMFU34tJz9ESXH9y1wq4qjwxPw9nHZS558KxjluSuG5xvSyMoIbU8_4XgVkiJAOTLARJf4Hdtnm6DywcaNte", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Justin Kirkland", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "'DWTS' opens with moment of silence, no eliminations", "text": "'DWTS' opens with moment of silence, no eliminations USA TODAY 3 days ago Justin Kirkland Click to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Fans out in force for NYC Comic Con CBS2's Vanessa Murdock got up close with the costumed characters at New York Comic Con.

And it was welcomed \u2014 a moment to breathe. A moment to appreciate life and enjoy a little TV. A moment to remember that we're fortunate to have such a luxury.\nSo, let\u2019s take a couple hours and let go.\nThe world is, well, it\u2019s dark, y\u2019all. But in the name of Tom Bergeron \u2014 the show must go on. And it's \"Guilty Pleasure Night.\" So let\u2019s focus on being kind. Let\u2019s focus on sparkles. Let\u2019s focus on dancing in sequins. And you know? Let\u2019s not worry about who\u2019s going home either, because this week, it\u2019s no one. And if you didn\u2019t really soak up that kindness message, take a page from Tom, and let\u2019s get to reviewing the night. \u00a9 Lou Rocco, AP Season 25 of 'Dancing with the Stars' premieres Monday.\nBest of the rest Lindsey Stirling and Mark Ballas: 27/30\nGuilty pleasure: pajamas all day\nCALL UPON THE NAME OF STACY KEIBLER IF YOU\u2019RE NOT WORTHY! Lindsey and Mark are doing a jive to Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go ! Can you imagine? It\u2019s an iconic routine from Keibler in Season 2, but even still, Lindsey and Mark did not do so bad. The judges call it iconic, and it was great, but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 it\u2019s no Stacy Keibler. It\u2019s enough to solidify 9s across the board though.\nJordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold: 25/30\nGuilty pleasure: comic books\nLOL, these guilty pleasures are incredible. But at the core of the absurdity is incredible arts lover and Charleston experts, Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold who, dare I say, just did a routine that should be Dancing with the Stars CANON. It\u2019s like, professional comic book art. The choreography, the music, and the set are all perfect (even if it didn\u2019t meet Len\u2019s standard of Charleston), and it\u2019s more than deserving of the season\u2019s first 10.\nVanessa Lachey and Alan Bernstein: 23/30\nGuilty pleasure: girls night out\nSo, Vanessa is like a low key Chrissy Teigen, you know? But when she\u2019s on the dance floor, she looks like a pro. She gets a couple dings for a wobble or two, but she still manages to shine with a 23, and that\u2019s not bad, y\u2019all. Vanessa Lachey is the kind of stuff final threes are made of.\nBest of the rest Nikki Bella and Artem Chigvintsev: 21/30\nGuilty Pleasure: 50 Shades of Grey\nOkay, weird elevator dance sequence! I see you! Some stars just connect from night one, and Nikki did not do that for us. But, you know what? She\u2019s making some serious ground up, and her Viennese Waltz to Love on the Brain is the kind of performance that could legitimately take her to the end.\nDrew Scott and Emma Slater: 23/30\nVictoria Arlen and Val Chmerkovskiy: 22/30\nFrankie Muniz and Witney Carson: 21/30\nNick Lachey and Peta Murgatroyd: 21/30\nDerek Fisher and Sharna Burgess: 21/30\nTerrell Owens and Cheryl Burke: 21/30\nSasha Pieterse and Gleb Savchenko: 19/30\nUSA TODAY Sparkle Points Podium Sasha Pieterse: 5/5\nGimmicks. Are. Wonderful. So when Sasha and Gleb rolled up as full-bedazzled chefs, you can\u2019t help but cheer. The jazz routine didn\u2019t get five starts, but the gimmick was perfect.\nNick Lachey: 4.5/5\nWe see you, overwrought '80s rom com chic. A lot of pastels and rhinestones. A lot of workout gear. A call back to Love Actually . It\u2019s all the stuff of wardrobe champions.\nJordan Fisher: 4/5\nWhen you dye your hair to match your ensemble, there\u2019s something to be said about that.

Bell \u00a9 Trae Patton/NBC Jennifer Hudson might be new to The Voice\u2019 s stateside scene, but she\u2019s already developing her own sort of feud here with a co-coach. Surprisingly enough, it\u2019s Blake Shelton she seems to have to square off with the most because it turns out they have similar taste.\nMeanwhile, Adam Levine and Miley Cyrus\u2019 interests are also starting to run in a similar vein \u2014 she might be leaning heavy on the country crooner side of things lately, but she still has a deep interest in rock, too, so she\u2019s able to scoop up talent from a multitude of genres, much to Adam\u2019s chagrin.\nLet\u2019s take a look at who comes out for round three of The Voice \u2018s blind auditions.\nAdam Cunningham (38 \u2013 Nashville, Tennessee)\n\u201cMidnight Rider\u201d by The Allman Brothers Band\nImagine you\u2019re playing some kind of Sims game where you have to make the perfect contestant for Team Blake. That\u2019s Adam Cunningham. From his familiar locale \u2014 the man actually records songwriter demos in Blake Shelton\u2019s old studio \u2014 to the hip country clothes to his steely vocals (which have a strong Charlie Daniels persuasion), it\u2019s a match made in Nashville.\nJennifer Hudson tries to throw her hat (but not shoe) into the ring on account of the soul she heard beneath the brass and Southern sass, but Blake\u2019s got this one in the bag.\nTeam : Blake\nHannah Mrozak (18 \u2013 Richfield, Wisconsin)\n\u201cStarving\u201d by Hailee Steinfeld\nWith a pop starlet and an R&B diva on the coaching panel, it might seem a little strange for a fledgling female artist of those genres to bypass both in favor of Team Adam, but this time, he puts the \u201cAdam\u201d in adamant.\nHannah is still pretty new to the singing world and was inspired to pursue this passion by her late brother, who insisted music was her true future. Despite a shaky start, she manages to escape her nerves and deliver a pretty fearless effort at this note-scattered number, which would be very difficult for a less competent crooner. There are still some kinks to be worked out \u2014 or, as Adam might call them, \u201cpocket issues\u201d \u2014 but her vocal fluidity is undeniable and has a place here in this competition.\nTeam : Adam\nShilo Gold (26 \u2013 Denver, Colorado)\n\u201cStay With Me (Baby)\u201d by Lorraine Ellison\nMiley Cyrus seems to always get at least one sure fit for her team \u2014 the last season she coached, it was Darby Walker. This time, it looks like Shilo Gold will do the honors. Because while she\u2019s hardly a perfect singer \u2014 the beginning notes drag too far to the floor of her range, her high notes are off pitch, and even her full voice is a little inconsistent \u2014 there\u2019s a familiar rasp to her voice that Miley thinks she can work with.\nShilo came into the night thinking she\u2019d opt for Team Jennifer if she had the chance because she respects J. Hud\u2019s ability to capture a room before even opening her mouth, but Miley\u2019s promise to help her choose the right songs for her unique vocals wins the day this time.\nTeam : Miley\nSamantha Rios (16 \u2013 Arlington, Virginia)\n\u201cSomething\u2019s Gotta Hold on Me\u201d by Etta James\nThis season isn\u2019t shaping up to be the one for the younger talents, like last year was. Samantha Rios here has some gumption that can\u2019t be taught, but unfortunately there\u2019s just not enough technicality in her tones to earn a chair turn. As Jennifer Hudson points out, it could be that the song just requires some range outside of her skill set \u2014 particularly when it comes to the super low notes that made Etta James so untouchable \u2014 but she\u2019s definitely got some skill and performance savvy that she can hone and then come back and try out again.\nHey, she was brave enough to sing for the president of the United States, so a repeat audition on The Voice should be a cakewalk for this young lady.\nTeam : N/A\nNoah Mac (17 \u2013 Dublin, California)\n\u201cWay Down We Go\u201d by Kaleo\nEvery now and again, a singer comes along whose dedication to the performance is louder than his actual voice, and that seems to be the case with Noah Mac, who started singing at 8 years old during the memorial service for his own sister.\nNoah claims to be inspired by soul and gospel music, and it shows in his Hozier-esque vocals. What really impresses Blake, though, is how well Noah is able to lift out of those low, growly notes and into his head space while still maintaining the \u201croundness\u201d of his sound. While Jennifer Hudson is very complimentary about the effusiveness of his delivery, Blake wins the day by pointing out that Noah is emotionally equipped for the pressures of this competition already and can go far with the right leadership.\nTeam : Blake\nDavon Fleming (30 \u2013 Baltimore, Maryland)\n\u201cMe & Mrs. Jones\u201d by Billy Paul\nYou know Jennifer Hudson is interested in a singer when she not only throws a shoe but proceeds to do a duet with him. In this case, it\u2019s for Davon Fleming, who\u2019s got Stevie Wonder-level range and spirit as he belts out this number in his own, happy-go-lucky way.\nDavon is a worship leader who\u2019s clearly infected by persistent positivity, and all four coaches can\u2019t help but turn around for him, whether they\u2019ve got a legitimate shot at winning him over or not. Blake\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ve won five times\u201d bit is a no-go, and Miley\u2019s name-dropping of Dolly Parton backfires when Jennifer Hudson takes that note to share the stage with Davon and sing \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d at which point it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re a perfect match. They even dress alike.\nTeam : Jennifer\nKathrina Feigh (24 \u2013 Philippines)\n\u201cBig White Room\u201d by Jessie J\nMove over, musical theater. Kathrina here put all her eggs in the music-theater basket throughout her education, but she\u2019s ready to step out into a solo spotlight. And The Voice might be a good place for her to do just that, because with the size of her voice and the range that comes naturally to her, the rest can definitely be coached.\nHer delivery sounds a lot like Ingrid Michaelson, but she\u2019s also got some ambitiousness that seems to stretch her beyond her comfort zone. With Jennifer \u201cIf you can think the note, you can sing it\u201d Hudson herself as her coach, she\u2019s in good hands.\nTeam : Jennifer\nAddison Agen (16 \u2013 Fort Wayne, Indiana)\n\u201cJolene\u201d by Ray LaMontagne\nSome people just breathe music, and that\u2019s definitely the case for Addison Agen. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of worldly experience just yet \u2014 auditioning for The Voice marked her first trip on an airplane, even \u2014 but her dad owns a record store and her mom is a music therapist for senior citizens, so that folk singer quality comes naturally to her.\nOn the other hand, when Addison does try to stretch her octave, it sounds a touch forced. It\u2019s her default voice that really lands, and that\u2019s probably what gets the attention of Adam and Miley. In the end, she and Miley have a little more in common, as both have experience being underestimated for their youth, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see if Miley has what it takes to groom Addison for the next level.\nTeam : Miley\nAdam Pearce (31- New Orleans, Louisiana)\n\u201cHot Blooded\u201d by Foreigner\nIt\u2019s a good thing Adam Levine has a great memory because when Adam Pearce comes back after being denied a spot in season 12, he\u2019s looking at his name twin for the fateful turn. And turn Adam does. Adam No. 2 was critiqued and sent away for being a little too chaotic and unwieldy with his rock enthusiasm the first time, so he\u2019s since consulted some vocal coaches to get the 411 on how to contain his screams.\nThis time, though he\u2019s still rocking out with tubular enthusiasm to a tune that\u2019s squarely in his wheelhouse, Adam No. 2 doesn\u2019t lose control of his pitch the way he did last time, and he earns Adam\u2019s bid \u2014 and Miley\u2019s \u2014 for that reason. Miley doesn\u2019t even put up much of a fight to recruit him; the Adams are clearly meant for each other in more ways than just a shared moniker.\nTeam : Adam\nMyles Frost (17 \u2013 Washington, D.C.)\n\u201cMy Cherie Amour\u201d by Stevie Wonder\nAs much as talent matters on this show, a lot also rides on a contestant\u2019s ability to choke back their nerves and provide a convincing showcase for the coaches \u2014 after all, all the coaches get to go off of is what they hear, and there are no second chances. But something tells me that if the coaches had the opportunity to see how much this young man oozes artistry, playing a litany of instruments and dancing with abandon, they might\u2019ve been convinced.\nAlas, it\u2019s his shaky rendition of an already exacting number that ultimately informs their decision to pass on Myles Frost, although the coaches do heavily encourage him to come back with a little more preparation and confidence.\nTeam : N/A\nMoriah Farmica (16 \u2013 Albany, New York)\n\u201cCrazy on You\u201d by Heart\nMost teenagers who come on this show probably don\u2019t have the credentials or cool factor of this girl. Moriah Formica has been singing on a pseudo-professional level for a while now, opening for and then collaborating with Michael Sweet before she was even old enough for junior prom. And what\u2019s even more impressive is that she absolutely shreds this song.\nShe\u2019s got a composure that\u2019s both stoic and radical, and, more importantly, she doesn\u2019t waver in strength during her spot-on rendition of this outright power ballad. As Adam puts it during his sincere plea for her to join his team, she could easily sub in for Ann Wilson if Ann ever needed a sick day \u2014 it\u2019s that on point. Ultimately, though, Moriah is wooed to Team Miley by her promises of big-sisterly advice and picking songs that will, like this one, let her blare her voice like she wants to. And you know what? That might just work. If this performance is any indication, Moriah\u2019s got it all already and just needs an adequate jam platform. As Jennifer Hudson phrases it, she has \u201cown[ed] her moment\u201d here tonight.\nTeam : Miley\nThe rest:\nTeam Jennifer also added Alexandra Joyce, who did a delicate but pretty (from the sounds of the montage sample, at least) rendition of Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cWildest Dreams.\u201d She also snagged Eric Lyn by default, since she was the only one to turn for his take on \u201cOoh Child\u201d by The Five Stairsteps, citing his attention to every note. Meanwhile, Anna Catherine DeHart found herself on Team Blake after delivering a \u201ccutting\u201d performance of Maren Morris\u2019 \u201cI Could Use a Love Song.\u201d\nTEAM STANDINGS :\nTeam Adam

prospect shares horrific first-hand account of Las Vegas shooting Sporting News 11 hrs ago Joe Rodgers \u00a9 (Getty Images) Las Vegas first responders Brewers minor league pitcher Bubba Derby and eight of his family members were among the thousands of people attending the Jason Aldean concert in Las Vegas on Sunday night.\nDerby, 23, was about 100 yards from the stage when a gunman opened fire from a nearby hotel, leaving 59 dead and more than 500 injured. Derby told MLB.com he thought he heard fireworks but had little time to react as the crowd raced for the little surrounding cover.\n\"At that point, we didn't know where the shots were coming from,\" Derby said. \"It sounded like it was on top of us. We had a sinking feeling that maybe he's shooting an automatic weapon from the top of the Mandalay Bay. It's kind of what everyone was thinking.\n\"Everybody got down, and we tried to get as low to the ground as possible... I turned around to find my aunt, and I'll never forget her face. We made eye contact, and it was that look like 'Are we about to die?' You could hear the bullets hitting, ricocheting, and it's kind of one of those moments where you don't know what to do, but you try to get out of there.\"\nDerby, who was staying at the Mandalay Bay hotel four floors below where the shooter opened fire, says all eight of his family members were unharmed. Derby remains in Las Vegas as his truck and sister's car were in the same valet lot as the shooter's vehicle currently under investigation.\n\"It's weird to be walking around Vegas,\" Derby said. \"There are people that were involved or even just were around the area at the time, and you can tell because they have a certain look on their face. Everyone's walking around like they saw a ghost.\n\"For me personally, processing this information is going to take a while. It's kind of one of those things where you always say that you never imagine yourself being in that position where you're running for your life and you're trying to make sure you have your loved ones by you. Because when there's thousands of people sprinting out at the same time all trying to survive, it gets dangerous. And I'm not talking about the shooting, I'm talking about stampeding and people trampling over each other. That's where it gets scary and deadly as well.\"\nAmid the tragedy, Derby found consolation in the heroism displayed by strangers in midst of chaos.\nMORE : Raiders donate $50,000 to Las Vegas shooting victims\n\"There was a corner that they designated for the wounded,\" Derby said. \"My brother-in-law is a firefighter and used to be an EMT, and you see these people, and they ran over and immediately started helping without hesitating. They're grabbing gloves, they're grabbing gauze, bottles of water, they're helping these victims who are facing injuries that they never thought they'd face in their lives, and they're scared. They don't know where their family is. Especially running out of the venue, you see these victims carrying wounded people. It was incredible to see all these people helping each other.\n\"It was amazing and warming to see these people stay in harm's way to help other people who seemed helpless. They sat there crumpled with fear, and these people went out of their way, into the eye of the danger, to help. That was incredible. At a time like this, it was refreshing to see in such a negative, negative day.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://m.mlb.com/news/article/257232136/bubba-derby-in-audience-during-vegas-shooting/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/raiders-donate-50000-las-vegas-shooting-victims-gofundme-relief/1l9tz47gu6mbl1kqmwrqs46yg1"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bubba derby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodgers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jason aldean", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sporting news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brewers", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandalay bay", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:29:07.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a8767008f70b235f4fa9f48db37672af51f952c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KolEBK4pi1MzzGpiB2LvsrIpW2CLjXCB5NnIPAiBu7oQcaUJI.ggmRQ1R_vBnRXxxBXsZfpaXjLwd_O2LsArWRyXnKxmWeafAQ_z2s_3kB6M68ISI8l43Fg--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Hillary Clinton talks gun silencer bill after massacre", "title_full": "Hillary Clinton talks gun silencer bill after massacre", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 188, "comments": 0, "shares": 188}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a8767008f70b235f4fa9f48db37672af51f952c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KolEBK4pi1MzzGpiB2LvsrIpW2CLjXCB5NnIPAiBu7oQcaUJI.ggmRQ1R_vBnRXxxBXsZfpaXjLwd_O2LsArWRyXnKxmWeafAQ_z2s_3kB6M68ISI8l43Fg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ashley Killough, Jim Sciutto and Miranda Green, CNN", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Hillary Clinton talks gun silencer bill after massacre", "text": "Hillary Clinton talks gun silencer bill after massacre CNN 5 hrs ago By Ashley Killough, Jim Sciutto and Miranda Green, CNN \u00a9 Provided by CNN Former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, amid the fallout of the massacre in Las Vegas, turned the political spotlight on a gun bill that's currently making its way through the House.\n\"The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get,\" she tweeted Monday morning .\nShe wrote later , \"Our grief isn't enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.\"\nThe \"Hearing Protection Act,\" which would make it easier to purchase silencers, is part of a larger bipartisan measure that would ease restrictions on transporting guns across state lines and narrows the restricted category of armor-piercing ammunition. Supporters point out that silencers don't make guns silent, but it decreases their decibel level and muffles the noise.\nThe House Committee on Natural Resources passed the larger package, known as the SHARE Act, last month. It aims to \"expand opportunities for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting\" and \"increases safety and hearing protection for sportsmen and women,\" according to a statement from the committee at the time of passage. The bill would now go to a floor vote, and would need to pass the Senate, but no such vote has been scheduled in the House.\nWhen authorities stormed the room of the Las Vegas gunman on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, authorities found a cache of weapons, including 10 rifles , Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters over night. Authorities have not said whether any silencers had been found or were used among the shooters' weapons cache.\nA congressional hearing on the bill had been scheduled in June, but was canceled in the wake of the shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice that seriously wounded House Republican Whip Steve Scalise and several others.\nThe House Committee on Natural Resources eventually held a hearing September 12 and passed the bill a day later. Multiple GOP leadership aides told CNN there is no House floor vote scheduled yet on the measure.\nArizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, who is on natural resources committee, told CNN on Monday that the only thing between the bill and its passage is \"timing.\"\n\"The current system for background checks for silencers is very important,\" Gallego said. \"The only thing that's stopping Republicans now is timing.\"\nClinton repeatedly brought up the need for tougher gun control laws during the 2016 president campaign. The previous deadliest mass shooting in modern US history -- the shooting at Orlando's Pulse nightclub which killed 49 people -- occurred in June 2016, during last year's presidential election. With authorities saying 58 people were killed in Vegas, the most recent shooting now becomes the country's deadliest mass shooting in modern history.\n\"The Hearing Protection Act\" was introduced by Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-South Carolina, who has spoken publicly about suffering hearing loss in his left ear after growing up hunting without earmuffs or suppressors.\nCurrently, federal laws are more restrictive for silencers than firearms. Buyers must undergo a nine-month approval process that involves getting fingerprinted and submitting a photo, along with paying a $200 tax. The bill calls to eliminate those steps and make purchasing a silencer as easy as purchasing a firearm.\nOne key supporter of silencers is Donald Trump, Jr., the President's eldest son and an avid hunter. He appeared in a video for SilencerCo last year.\nAs seen with other recent mass shootings, some Democrats were quick to ramp up pressure Monday to enact more gun control.\n\"To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut tweeted. \"None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.\"\n\"We need to stop the carnage. More talk and prayers will not save lives. Only action and real changes in our laws can,\" Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, tweeted.\nOthers were more specific about weaponry.\n\"When you have weapons of war in wide circulation, you get war-like casualty counts. Not what the Founders had in mind,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, tweeted. \"House bill for easier access to silencers = more carnage in these kinds of shootings. Terrible idea.\"\n\"Congress should take up and vote on legislation to ban military-style weapons,\" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, tweeted.\nA recent Pew study showed that 52% of Americans feel that gun laws in the country should be more strict than they are currently, while 18% feel they should be less strict and 30% feel they are about right.\nCNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

crackdown on poll Associated Press 15 mins ago Catalonia Referendum (Slideshow by Photo Services)\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 Several thousand protesters gathered Tuesday outside the Barcelona headquarters of Spain's National Police to protest alleged brutality by police during a disputed referendum on Catalonia's secession that left hundreds of people injured.\nThe crowd gathered in the Catalan capital, shouting slogans calling Spanish police an \"occupying force\" and urging them to leave the northeastern region.\nThe protest came as several small labor unions and grassroots pro-independence groups urged workers throughout Catalonia to go on partial or full-day strikes and as the region's leaders ponder a possible declaration of independence, two days after the referendum that turned violent and that Madrid deemed illegal and invalid.\n\"People are angry, very angry,\" said Josep Llavina, a 53 year old self-employed worker who had traveled to Barcelona from a nearby town to participate in the protest outside the police building.\n\"They brought violence with them. They have beaten people who were holding their hands up. How can we not be outraged?\"\nDemonstrators arrived by foot, walking along empty boulevards and streets closed off by municipal police as tourists watched from distance.\nProtesters blocked several roads in the city and bus and taxi services were affected.\nThe strike was not backed by Spain's two main unions, the UGT and CCOO groups, and there were no reports of disruptions affecting big industry or Barcelona's airport.\n\"I disagree with the strike. In fact, at work nobody told me anything about a strike. So I decided to come,\" said Jose Bolivar, 54 a town hall employee.\nOffice worker Antonia Cuello, 37, was in two minds about the industrial action.\n\"On one side it is a hassle to try to get to work in the midst of a strike,\" she said. \"We are suffering this because a few decided to behave in an improper way. On the other hand, I understand the circumstances surrounding the strike.\"\nPort workers also held a demonstration outside the regional headquarters of Spain's ruling Popular Party, while firefighters planned a rally outside the Interior Ministry's regional office in Barcelona. Protests were also to be staged outside polling stations where police acted with force to try to prevent Sunday's poll being held.\nMore than 890 civilians were treated for injuries, most of them not serious, following clashes during Sunday's referendum, according to Catalan regional health authorities. Police using batons, and some firing rubber bullets, cleared protesters hoping to vote in the referendum. Spain's Interior Ministry says 431 National Police and Civil Guard agents were injured too.\nThe police action prompted criticism worldwide although the European Union and most governments backed Spain's stance in what is its most serious political crisis in decades.\nNigel Farage, one of the leaders in Britain's vote to leave the EU, condemned the bloc's failure to clearly condemn the police violence.\n\"It is quite extraordinary to realize that this Union is prepared to turn a blind eye,\" Farage told EU lawmakers.\nCyprus said Spain's national sovereignty and territorial integrity needed to be respected, arguing that the referendum on Catalonia's independence was carried out \"in violation\" of the Spanish constitution.\nTurkey's foreign ministry spokesman Huseyin Muftuoglu also said respect for Spain's territorial integrity was the main \"principle,\" adding that it was important that both sides abide by Spain's laws and avoid violence.\n___\nGiles contribute from Madrid.\nAssociated Press journalist Hernan Munoz contributed from Barcelona, Spain", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "giles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josep llavina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel farage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose bolivar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hernan munoz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonia cuello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huseyin muftuoglu", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "popular party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ugt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ccoo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:30:25.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac225ed8f7a5b6b96fb8924f40403a5ce7499840", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KZNrMuy7mZmFZeUDzDSd_bcCfqauV08yU9pO7mokyynzCTBgD4S0DJqIFgyO06iM4Oh8Ha1EaFyMUODnxxgnjT6BGOuZ5RiyBKuzmn8MW68UFPyg469Xgvv8OiDaIKEK5fPWHDn5BhQwGznVGnB_w7pcF1FwPNkve", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday", "title_full": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 13, "comments": 0, "shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac225ed8f7a5b6b96fb8924f40403a5ce7499840", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KZNrMuy7mZmFZeUDzDSd_bcCfqauV08yU9pO7mokyynzCTBgD4S0DJqIFgyO06iM4Oh8Ha1EaFyMUODnxxgnjT6BGOuZ5RiyBKuzmn8MW68UFPyg469Xgvv8OiDaIKEK5fPWHDn5BhQwGznVGnB_w7pcF1FwPNkve", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandra Gibbs", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday", "text": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday CNBC 1 hr ago Alexandra Gibbs \u00a9 Provided by CNBC U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open Tuesday, with the positive trading streak for the fourth quarter set to continue, after Wall Street finished on a strong note in the previous session.\nOn the first trading day of 2017's fourth quarter , U.S. equities finished Monday's session on a strong note, not only closing at record highs but with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 152.51 points by the close.

Such a ruling could fundamentally shift American politics -- particularly for Democrats, whose urban and minority voters tend to live in clusters that make it easier to drawn them into the same districts.\nThe stakes are high: Right now, Democrats are the majority party in just 31 of the nation's 98 partisan state legislative chambers.\nIf the Supreme Court sets guidelines to prohibit partisanship from being used to draw district lines, it would put \"10 to 12 more chambers in immediate play\" in six or seven states, said Jessica Post, the executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\nWinning control of those state-level chambers means Democrats would also play a role in drawing congressional maps there.\n\"We still have a shot on the current map, but if we have fair maps, we could see real progress,\" Post said.\nThe Wisconsin case, Gill v. Whitford, is the first of several legal battles working through the courts right now that Democrats hope will curb partisan and racial gerrymandering. Ongoing battles in North Carolina, Texas and Virginia are focused on race.\nOn Tuesday, the Eric Holder-led National Democratic Redistricting Committee, launched in the wake of 2016's election, is expected to file a lawsuit on behalf of residents of Georgia over legislative maps that lawmakers there redrew in 2015 to shore up the Atlanta suburbs for Republican incumbents.\n\"As Democrats and grassroots activists refocus their efforts on state and local elections, one thing is abundantly clear: if we want to fix our broken political system, we need to start by fixing the way we draw electoral maps. That fight starts now,\" Holder said.\nThe court battles are at the forefront of Democrats' bid to win back the nearly 1,000 state legislative seats the party lost during Barack Obama's presidency -- a blow that Obama himself is now attempting to help reverse by raising money for the redistricting group.\nThe heightened Democratic focus on state legislatures will be tested this fall in Virginia, where the party will try to chip away at the GOP's nearly 2-to-1 state assembly majority, and Nevada, where Republicans are pushing to recall several sitting Democrats in a bid to change party control of the state Senate.\nThe Nevada effort is particularly concerning to national Democrats who fret that the GOP could use similar tactics in other states.\nIn addition to its regular monthly $10,000 contributions to each state party, the DNC sent a six-figure sum and the Holder-led group sent $50,000 to the new group Our Votes, Our Voice, which is leading a campaign urging voters to decline to sign the recall petitions.\nDonors are also paying closer attention to the state-level battles. Post said the DLCC's online fundraising is up 450% compared to this point in 2015, while a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association said the group is receiving contributions this year from major donors who previously have ignored or only contributed small amounts to state races.\nBuoying Democrats as they attempt to refocus the party's donors and activists on down-ballot races is that -- while whiffing in congressional special elections -- Democrats have flipped eight state legislative seats this year.\n\"Republicans have worked for years to rig the system with partisan gerrymandering and restrictive voting laws designed to keep African Americans, Latinos, and young people away on Election Day,\" said Tom Perez, the DNC chairman.\n\"Democrats believe that voters should get to choose their representatives, not the other way around,\" Perez said in an emailed statement. \"We believe that America is stronger when more people, not fewer, participate on Election Day. And as Republicans try to silence people's voices and limit one of our most fundamental rights, Democrats will continue fighting for the equal voice every voter deserves.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "eric bradner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica post", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic legislative campaign committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dnc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dlcc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic governors association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric holder-led national democratic redistricting committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:30:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9819f7dc497c65bfe9091835780faa7b94179cc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6K1F.r855bscn2ea32JLpz.VIUu4Gqj3ExUAfukA.SVli4bHYq41AJtoiBSOLJimWG.mMnokE5lnvcpYbhPZSInQsCTmALQFz.gf1t3PxHgng-", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Giffords, Scalise highlight party differences on guns", "title_full": "Giffords, Scalise highlight party differences on guns", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 35, "comments": 0, "shares": 35}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9819f7dc497c65bfe9091835780faa7b94179cc1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6K1F.r855bscn2ea32JLpz.VIUu4Gqj3ExUAfukA.SVli4bHYq41AJtoiBSOLJimWG.mMnokE5lnvcpYbhPZSInQsCTmALQFz.gf1t3PxHgng-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mike Lillis", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Giffords, Scalise highlight party differences on guns", "text": "Giffords, Scalise highlight party differences on guns The Hill 1 hr ago Mike Lillis \u00a9 Provided by The Hill Giffords, Scalise highlight party differences on guns Democrat Gabrielle Giffords (Ariz.) and Republican Steve Scalise (La.) share a tragic, common bond: Both were nearly killed in separate mass shootings six years apart.\nBut the two former House colleagues had very different reactions to Sunday night's massacre on the Las Vegas Strip, where a lone gunman killed at least 59 people and injured more than 520 others.\nGiffords and her astronaut husband Mark Kelly stormed Capitol Hill on Monday, urging political leaders to enact tougher gun control laws. Scalise, just four days after his emotional return to the Capitol, called on Americans to donate blood and be kind to one another.\nThe Louisiana Republican echoed President Trump in calling the shootings \"an act of pure evil.\" But Scalise, the third-ranking Republican in leadership, made no mention of stricter gun laws, nor did any of his GOP colleagues in Congress.\n\"In this tragic moment, I encourage people across America to stand together in solidarity, and to support the Las Vegas community and all of those affected, especially by giving blood and encouraging others to do the same,\" Scalise said. \"In the face of unspeakable evil, our whole nation must respond with countless acts of kindness, warmth and generosity.\"\nA spokesman for Scalise had no comment when asked if the majority whip's views have changed on gun control measures after he was shot.\nThe starkly different responses from Scalise and Giffords offer a snapshot of the broader gun debate on Capitol Hill - and help to explain why reform legislation has languished for years even in the face of tens of thousands of annual shooting deaths across the country.\nEven though both political parties have seen gun violence cut down members of their own conferences, their reactions to Las Vegas show Democrats and Republicans are no closer to finding common ground on the issue of gun control. Indeed, some lawmakers quickly predicted, to little surprise from observers, that even the nation's deadliest mass shooting won't sway the deeply entrenched partisan sentiments that have governed the gun debate for decades.\n\"The left will ask for too much and the right will view anything as capitulation,\" said one House GOP lawmaker who backs stronger background checks for gun buyers.\nKelly said Monday that the offering of only \"thoughts and prayers\" is tantamount to complicity, framing gun violence as a preventable public-health scourge and lambasting reform opponents as moral cowards.\n\"Action to save lives is the only acceptable moral course for our country,\" said Kelly, who along with his wife has devoted his life to reining in gun violence. \"Without action, we are asking one person to be the next person to die because of our weakness to address this evil. And then another. And then another. And then another.\"\nAt the top of the Democrats' legislative wish list is a proposal requiring private gun sellers to screen potential buyers through an FBI database designed to weed out felons, domestic abusers, undocumented immigrants, those with severe mental illness and other categories of prohibited buyers. Under current federal law, only licensed gun dealers are required to conduct those screenings.\nCongress last considered that concept in 2013, just months after 20 first-graders and six teachers were shot to death at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), the proposal was defeated on the Senate floor after winning 55 supporters - five shy of the number needed to defeat a GOP filibuster.\nIn addition to Toomey, Republican Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois also backed the bill. Kirk lost his seat in 2016.\nDemocrats have also pushed to ban military-style assault rifles and high-capacity magazines while empowering the federal government to research gun violence as a public health issue.\nBut Republicans, who control the House and Senate, have shown no appetite for tougher gun laws. In fact, in recent weeks, Republicans have been pushing to loosen such laws.\nA bill making it easier for people to buy gun suppressors, often described as silencers, was delayed in mid-June after a gunman shot at Republican lawmakers practicing baseball in Alexandria, Va. Scalise, a Capitol Police officer, a Hill staffer and a lobbyist were all struck by the gunman.\nThat bill, the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, authored by Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), eventually passed out of the Natural Resources Committee last month, paving the way for a vote on the House floor.\nBut Friday, a day after Scalise received a hero's welcome in the Capitol, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) released this week's vote schedule that excluded the SHARE Act.\nIn addition to the suppressor legislation, House Republicans also hope to vote this fall on a bill that would allow gun owners with concealed-carry permits to carry their firearms in other states.\nFor most Hill Republicans, bucking the National Rifle Association (NRA) is unfathomable. The powerful gun lobby spent more than $52 million backing candidates in the 2016 cycle, $30 million on Trump alone. And sponsoring gun control measures could result in the NRA recruiting primary challengers against incumbent Republicans.\nStill, a handful of Republicans in favor of reform appeared open Monday to congressional action, though they say they want more information about the Las Vegas shooting and the conditions of those wounded before they play their hand.\n\"This information is critical in determining the next steps needed to try and prevent future tragedies,\" Toomey said in a statement. \"My staff and I will continue to monitor all of these developments.\"\nOn Thursday, the day Scalise made his first trip to the Capitol since he was shot 15 weeks earlier, Giffords tweeted out praise for the majority whip: \"@SteveScalise has a strength only survivors know. Welcome back to the people's House. Your courage & resilience sends a powerful message.\"\n\"Thank you, Gabby,\" Scalise tweeted back. \"I am so grateful for the support you and Mark have shown my family and me.\"\nBut the tweets never touched on gun reform. And Giffords, though she struggles to speak since the attack, delivered a clear, six-word message to Congress on Monday.\n\"The nation is counting on you,\" Giffords said as she turned and pointed toward the Capitol.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.thehill.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "giffords", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "scalise", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mike lillis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mark kirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabrielle giffords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill giffords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mccain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat toomey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan collins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff duncan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe manchin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sportsmen's heritage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natural resources committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy hook elementary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national rifle association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giffords", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ariz.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "va", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexandria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:30:40.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b9f3dbdba787e99aa95a648b268bbf8c0e256454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KZNrMuy7mZmEf69YczOKiZIZYqpOEpaVVLcqREdF4MuMrVAo5o4wWEkd1VzQooZqTH89wu0PMEYg-", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "ATM fees are out of control", "title_full": "ATM fees are out of control", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b9f3dbdba787e99aa95a648b268bbf8c0e256454", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KZNrMuy7mZmEf69YczOKiZIZYqpOEpaVVLcqREdF4MuMrVAo5o4wWEkd1VzQooZqTH89wu0PMEYg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Suzanne Woolley", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "ATM fees are out of control", "text": "ATM fees are out of control Bloomberg 1 hr ago Suzanne Woolley \u00a9 Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images LOS ANGELES, CA - SEPTEMBER 29: A customer uses a Bank of America ATM on September 29, 2011 in Los Angeles, California. Bank of America annouced its plans to start charging a $5 monthly fee for customers using their debit card for purchases starting early in 2012. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images) Drawing cash from an ATM is beginning to feel like a ritual from a bygone era. Like buying a record on vinyl, it\u2019s a once-universal experience for which dedicated fans are now paying a premium.\nThis year marks the 11th consecutive annual increase in bank ATM fees for customers using out-of-network machines, according to a new Bankrate.com report. Over the past decade, such fees have risen 55 percent. The average cost of such a transaction is now over $4.50.\nATM fees aren\u2019t rising due to overwhelming demand. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. \u201cIt keeps getting easier to avoid the fees, and people are transitioning away from cash,\u201d said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com\u2019s chief financial analyst. \u201cWith fewer people making out-of-network ATM withdrawals, the cost of maintaining that network is being spread over fewer transactions.\u201d\nThe report looked at the 10 biggest banks in the top 25 major metro areas to find out where average ATM fee surcharges are the steepest and where they are \u2026 slightly less steep. Pittsburgh experienced the highest average fees, with customers paying $5.19 when Bankrate.com combined the fees charged by the ATM operator with fees from the consumer\u2019s own financial institution. The lowest average fees were found in Dallas, at $4.07.\nCustomers with higher account balances or multiple relationships with their bank\u2014as in a checking account, a mortgage and a personal loan, for example\u2014may avoid out-of-network ATM charges from their bank or be reimbursed for some of them.\nThe average overdraft fee reached a new high of $33.38, up from $33.04 in 2016. Philadelphia consumers pay the highest average overdraft fee, at $35.30. In San Francisco, average overdraft fees are the lowest of the top 25 metro areas, at $31.44. Banks hiking that fee last year outnumbered those trimming it, by seven to one.\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau zeroed in on overdraft fees in a recent report (PDF). Consumers who pay a lot in overdraft fees \u201ctend to be more credit-constrained,\u201d to have lower credit scores and be less likely to have a general purpose credit card, it found.

Americans buy 15 million to 16 million firearms per year, Dionisio estimates. According to research from IBISWorld, gun and ammunition stores brought in $8.6 billion in revenue in 2016.\nA sales bump is by no means guaranteed. But investors appeared to be betting on one Monday, sending shares of gun maker Sturm Ruger up 6%. American Outdoor Brands, the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson, gained nearly 7%.\nGun stocks also spiked after both the Pulse and San Bernardino shootings , due in part to President Obama's promises to tighten gun laws. Fears of more strict regulations tend to drive shoppers to buy more guns while they still can, but those stricter law never materialized.\nRetailers stocked up on firearms during the 2016 presidential campaign, anticipating a stampede of gun buyers after Hillary Clinton won the race and moved to restrict gun sales.\nInstead, Trump won, and gun sales slumped , since it seems unlikely that his administration will strengthen gun control laws. As a result, gun stocks have mostly been lower since the election.\nVigils in Honor of Las Vegas Shooting Victims Shares did spike, however, when news broke that the president is considering easing export laws -- a move that would make it easier to sell American guns abroad.\n-- CNNMoney's Paul La Monica and Aaron Smith contributed to this story.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/13/investing/gun-stocks-smith-wesson-sturm-ruger-orlando-shooting-pulse/index.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/news/companies/gun-exports-trump/index.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/11/news/companies/vista-outdoor-guns-ammo/index.html?iid=EL", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/07/investing/gun-stocks-smith-wesson-sturm-ruger/index.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/02/investing/las-vegas-shooting-gun-stocks-sturm-ruger-american-outdoor-brands/index.html", "http://www.cnn.com/", "http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/06/news/obama-gun-control-sales/index.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danielle", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dionisio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul la monica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rommel dionisio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aegis capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american outdoor brands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sturm ruger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith & wesson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san bernardino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:30:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1bf08db48b1364c12179a3a2fcc607f6f8bdbc37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z3MkjZD2XflV.92Zs60dpaKbIF9RqoLOUAicNreqi99Z_6Lc2FEjsGG4xGMKzK60C0Ewff1.ws1GDC_ghOYnyoTx8a.0ZXGdUDETh9jRSXD0Q--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Latest India and World news, photos and videos | MSN India", "title": "Jio Recharge Plans: What You Get In Rs 149, Rs 309, Rs 349, Rs 399", "title_full": "Jio Recharge Plans: What You Get In Rs 149, Rs 309, Rs 349, Rs 399", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.219, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1bf08db48b1364c12179a3a2fcc607f6f8bdbc37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z3MkjZD2XflV.92Zs60dpaKbIF9RqoLOUAicNreqi99Z_6Lc2FEjsGG4xGMKzK60C0Ewff1.ws1GDC_ghOYnyoTx8a.0ZXGdUDETh9jRSXD0Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NDTV Profit Team", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Jio Recharge Plans: What You Get In Rs 149, Rs 309, Rs 349, Rs 399", "text": "Jio Recharge Plans: What You Get In Rs 149, Rs 309, Rs 349, Rs 399 NDTV 3 hours ago NDTV Profit Team\nReliance Jio, the telecom arm of conglomerate Reliance Industries, offers several recharge options to its prepaid customers.

India have played 23 matches this year and have lost just five ODIs with one game yielding no result. The series victory over Australia was India's sixth consecutive and fourth this year.\nIndia have also been a dominant side in Test cricket with seven consecutive series victory. Sourav Ganguly once again said Virat Kohli's greatness as captain will be tested when India start their overseas tours.\n\"Virat Kohli has got qualities of being one of India's great captains, there's no doubt about it. I think next 15 months will be important for him when India go to South Africa, England, Australia and the World Cup. I think he is in the right direction. He is preparing his team, he's picking players and giving opportunities. They will beat New Zealand and Sri Lanka, there's no doubt about it. India will be challenged when they go to South Africa but I feel this side has got the ability to do well there as well,\" Sourav Ganguly told India Today.\n\u00a9 REUTERS/Punit Paranjpe Saurav Ganguly 'HOPE PANDYA CONTINUES TO DO GOOD WORK'\nHardik Pandya was named man of the series in the ODI series contest against Australia for his exploits with both bat and ball. Ganguly also had a word of praise for the 23-year-old all-rounder.\n\"Hardik Pandya has the qualities to help this Indian team but don't compare him with Kapil Dev at the moment. Kapil Dev was an absolute champion. We will talk about it 10-15 years down the line once Pandya keeps playing that long. Let's enjoy his cricket, he is a good cricketer, he is a positive cricketer. He's a fighter and he has got heart when he plays cricket. That's what you look in a young cricketer. I wish him all the best hopefully he continues to do good work for Virat Kohli,\" he said.\nAfter the the ODI series, India and Australia now shift their focus to the Twenty20 internationals starting October 7 in Ranchi.\nIndia dominated the visiting Australian side in the ODIs with resounding 4-1 victory in the five-match series.\nIndia were ruthless in the 50-overs format and are expected to continue in the same vein in the upcoming three-match T20 series.\n\"India completely dominated Sri Lanka and Australia. They have looked a far-far superior side in the batting and bowling departments. That has been the case for Indian cricket in the last one and a half years. Except that blip in the Champions Trophy final, they have been a remarkable side. New Zealand and Sri Lanka will come next and I think India will be relentless again. They are far superior side than those two teams,\" Ganguly said.\n'NEHRA'S RETURN A GOOD SIGN FOR INDIAN CRICKET'\nIndia have named a strong 15-member squad with Shikhar Dhawan and Ashish Nehra making comebacks into the squad. Meanwhile, Ajinkya Rahane, who was in top form during the ODIs, was dropped for the series.\nNehra, who last played for India during the T20 series against England in January, was recalled after he was sidelined for the West Indies and Sri Lanka tours.\n\"It's a good news for Indian cricket that they have picked ability and not age. He is an exceptional T20 bowler. We saw him in last T20 World Cup. He is a left armer and he creates a different angle.

But Karn (5 for 78) and Nadeem (4 for 41) ensured things unravelled quickly for the visitors. Henry Nicholls, overnight on 55, continued to resist before he was sixth out for 94, falling to a combination of the two spinners \u2013 caught by Nadeem off Karn\u2019s bowling. The rest of the batting line-up crumbled.\nNew Zealand had gone into lunch on the fourth and final day on a reasonably healthy 167 for 3, but with two wickets in the first two overs after the break, the resistance fell apart. None of the batsmen from No. 6 downwards got into double figures, with the spin duo too tough to handle once again. While Karn ended with 16 wickets in the two-Test series with eight in each match, Nadeem had 14 sticks, with eight in the first and six in the second. Together, they accounted for 30 of the 39 wickets New Zealand lost to bowlers, with one run-out.\nAt the start of the day, Nicholls and Jeet Raval extended the total to 124 before Nadeem trapped Raval lbw for 47, bringing a 105-run second-wicket stand to an end. Will Young stuck around for a bit before he was caught off Karn just before lunch. New Zealand would have expected Colin Munro, who top-scored with 65 in the first innings, to provide stability but he was the first one to fall post lunch, lbw to Karn. Munro had played an attacking game in the first innings and possibly wanted to carry on with the method that brought him success, but he could make only 13 this time, off 11 balls.\nThe end came swiftly after that, with Shardul Thakur\u2019s wicket off Tom Bruce, the No. 6 batsman who was caught behind by Parthiv Patel, the only wicket that didn\u2019t go the way of the spinners. Karn completed a five-wicket haul by trapping last man Lockie Ferguson in front to signal the end of the match, 13.3 overs into the second session.\nThe tour will move on to the one-day leg now, with India A having announced separate squads for the first three matches and the last two matches. All the one-dayers will take place in Visakhapatnam, with the first one scheduled for Friday.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.wisdenindia.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "karn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nadeem", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "shahbaz nadeem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin munro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shardul thakur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry nicholls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom bruce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lockie ferguson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeet raval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "munro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parthiv patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karn sharma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wisden india", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisden new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "visakhapatnam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dr gokaraju liala gangaaraju aca cricket ground", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vijayawada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:39:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ca885abbf761fc7833bf70dc7641bb176a48c21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkwVaGhVHmvwsWt01geYMHOkk1efC5LvC8Xrna5zY2eKhZVO_QHe8CmBbsEKbnCKfKrKnXuwWcdDOAtQ1OGrZ.7JhnAoQGpyJq38nN7pu0eF0DKDyU3VPtzKzS5wwas05fV_a8oQHcND0-", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Russia threatens retaliation over U.S. 'break-in' at San Francisco consulate", "title_full": "Russia threatens retaliation over U.S. 'break-in' at San Francisco consulate", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ca885abbf761fc7833bf70dc7641bb176a48c21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkwVaGhVHmvwsWt01geYMHOkk1efC5LvC8Xrna5zY2eKhZVO_QHe8CmBbsEKbnCKfKrKnXuwWcdDOAtQ1OGrZ.7JhnAoQGpyJq38nN7pu0eF0DKDyU3VPtzKzS5wwas05fV_a8oQHcND0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Futures higher as focus shifts to earnings", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Russia threatens retaliation over U.S. 'break-in' at San Francisco consulate", "text": "Russia threatens retaliation over U.S. 'break-in' at San Francisco consulate Reuters 13 hrs ago \u00a9 Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images SAN FRANCISCO, USA - NOVEMBER 3: A sign is seen at the entrance of the Russian consulate building in San Francisco, United States on October 3, 2017. MOSCOW- The Russian Foreign Ministry said U.S. officials had broken into residences at Russia's consulate in San Francisco, and threatened retaliation over what it called an illegal act.\nRussian staff had left the consulate last month, after Washington ordered Moscow to vacate some of its diplomatic properties, part of a series of tit-for-tat actions during a thorny phase in bilateral relations.\nSince then, U.S. officials had occupied administrative parts of the compound but on Monday they entered residential areas that the departing staff had locked, the ministry said in a statement late on Monday.\n\"Despite our warnings, the U.S. authorities did not listen to reason and did not give up their illegal intentions,\" it said. \"We reserve the right to respond. The principle of reciprocity has always been and remains the cornerstone of diplomacy.\"\nFootage aired repeatedly on Russian state television showed what the broadcaster said were U.S. officials breaking locks that had sealed off parts of the compound and entering the buildings.\nThe \"intruders\" had taken over the whole premises including the consul general's residence, the ministry said.\n\"Therefore, we understand that Americans, breaking into our diplomatic buildings, have de facto agreed that their missions in Russia may be treated likewise.\"\n\"ELECTORAL INTERFERENCE\"\nIn San Francisco, a Department of State Diplomatic Security guard answered the door at the Russian consulate, a six-story brick building surrounded by a modest security fence and manicured hedges in the Pacific Heights neighborhood. The guard declined to comment and left the building in a black SUV.\nA sign on the front door said that the consulate was closed and gave a new mailing address. The State Department guard left the consulate front door open, behind a closed gate, and sounds of activity could be heard inside, but no one responded to repeated calls by a reporter.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin last month accused Washington of \"boorish\" treatment of Russia\u2019s diplomatic premises on U.S. soil, ordering the foreign ministry to take legal action over alleged violations of Russia\u2019s property rights.\nThe dispute began late last year when former U.S. president Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats on accusations of Russian meddling in the election that took Donald Trump to the White House.\nTrump took office in January, saying he wanted to improve ties with Russia, while Putin also spoke favorably of Trump.\nBut the allegations of interference in the vote, which Moscow has denied, have persisted as an investigation by U.S. authorities has widened.\nIn July, Moscow ordered the United States to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in Russia by around 60 percent, to 455.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry solovyov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john stonestreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:48:23.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "850fe37f19a4f2a527bfaafe35135149cbae497e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9Lk2BJVbaUaUIV86kzK3I848dPq1SxAy1g4oktMFLKUVf2kURLLATHRUPiYfmHT8nPUohoVl.BBJaJ4hsrjFgWg7hBU0JNtL0.DPFZrb_DHUsjhVZku0su2_A--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Gun sales could increase after Las Vegas killing spree", "title_full": "Gun sales could increase after Las Vegas killing spree", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 28, "comments": 0, "shares": 28}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "850fe37f19a4f2a527bfaafe35135149cbae497e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9Lk2BJVbaUaUIV86kzK3I848dPq1SxAy1g4oktMFLKUVf2kURLLATHRUPiYfmHT8nPUohoVl.BBJaJ4hsrjFgWg7hBU0JNtL0.DPFZrb_DHUsjhVZku0su2_A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gun sales could increase after Las Vegas killing spree", "text": "Gun sales could increase after Las Vegas killing spree CNN 48 mins ago Danielle Wiener-Bronner \u00a9 Getty Gun sales slumped after Donald Trump was elected president, but that could change after Sunday's massacre in Las Vegas, the deadliest in modern U.S. history.\nIt wouldn't be the first time that gun sales have jumped in the wake of a mass shooting.\nHandgun sales spiked by 62% in December 2015, following the San Bernardino shootings that killed 14 and the November 2015 terror attacks in Paris, according to Rommel Dionisio, managing director at Aegis Capital and an expert on the gun industry.\nAnd sales were up for several months after the June 2016 attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that claimed 49 lives, climbing about 20% in June, July and August 2016.\nLas Vegas shooting The killing spree in Las Vegas left 59 dead and more than 500 injured, and it could prompt Americans to start buying more guns.\n\"This event in Las Vegas could result in increased demand near-term for firearms as people are concerned about personal safety,\" Dionisio said.\nRelated: Gun stocks up after Las Vegas shooting\nGuns are already big business. Americans buy 15 million to 16 million firearms per year, Dionisio estimates. According to research from IBISWorld, gun and ammunition stores brought in $8.6 billion in revenue in 2016.\nA sales bump is by no means guaranteed. But investors appeared to be betting on one Monday, sending shares of gun maker Sturm Ruger up 6%. American Outdoor Brands, the company formerly known as Smith & Wesson, gained nearly 7%.\nGun stocks also spiked after both the Pulse and San Bernardino shootings , due in part to President Obama's promises to tighten gun laws. Fears of more strict regulations tend to drive shoppers to buy more guns while they still can, but those stricter law never materialized.\nRetailers stocked up on firearms during the 2016 presidential campaign, anticipating a stampede of gun buyers after Hillary Clinton won the race and moved to restrict gun sales.\nInstead, Trump won, and gun sales slumped , since it seems unlikely that his administration will strengthen gun control laws. As a result, gun stocks have mostly been lower since the election.\nVigils in Honor of Las Vegas Shooting Victims Shares did spike, however, when news broke that the president is considering easing export laws -- a move that would make it easier to sell American guns abroad.\n-- CNNMoney's Paul La Monica and Aaron Smith contributed to this story.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://money.cnn.com/2016/06/13/investing/gun-stocks-smith-wesson-sturm-ruger-orlando-shooting-pulse/index.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/news/companies/gun-exports-trump/index.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/05/11/news/companies/vista-outdoor-guns-ammo/index.html?iid=EL", "http://money.cnn.com/2015/12/07/investing/gun-stocks-smith-wesson-sturm-ruger/index.html", "http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/02/investing/las-vegas-shooting-gun-stocks-sturm-ruger-american-outdoor-brands/index.html", "http://www.cnn.com/", "http://money.cnn.com/2016/01/06/news/obama-gun-control-sales/index.html"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "danielle", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dionisio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul la monica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aaron smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rommel dionisio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aegis capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american outdoor brands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sturm ruger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith & wesson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san bernardino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:48:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dac6c01e5ef9387c0633c1a52b5575dcf957602b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkhgOvzh1i0Qa.TCWDn8TfMWEw2z9Kodrh4Hyen7dWLzA0DlLkAhaHgGG85xRaMrEJ2cnqjfW0X5rKfOqDmJ32jmCRGs9bk4I.23hReNB6b2wlUQIAieDNl4_4O8EJLXXIvxqZd50rfvr8wNhT9q87IlUodwHYlQYP", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday", "title_full": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dac6c01e5ef9387c0633c1a52b5575dcf957602b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkhgOvzh1i0Qa.TCWDn8TfMWEw2z9Kodrh4Hyen7dWLzA0DlLkAhaHgGG85xRaMrEJ2cnqjfW0X5rKfOqDmJ32jmCRGs9bk4I.23hReNB6b2wlUQIAieDNl4_4O8EJLXXIvxqZd50rfvr8wNhT9q87IlUodwHYlQYP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alexandra Gibbs", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday", "text": "Stock futures point to higher open on Wall Street, after Dow closes 152 points up on Monday CNBC 2 hrs ago Alexandra Gibbs \u00a9 Provided by CNBC U.S. stock index futures pointed to a slightly higher open Tuesday, with the positive trading streak for the fourth quarter set to continue, after Wall Street finished on a strong note in the previous session.\nOn the first trading day of 2017's fourth quarter , U.S. equities finished Monday's session on a strong note, not only closing at record highs but with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 152.51 points by the close. While this positive trading sentiment is set to continue, domestic and political news, however, are set to keep investors on edge.\nOne of the key stories set to dominate talk Tuesday is that of Sunday's deadly shooting in Las Vegas. At least 59 people were killed and more than 500 were injured after a gunman opened fire on thousands of concertgoers at a country music festival. The incident has been categorized as the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\nElsewhere, eyes will be on U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday as he is set to travel to Puerto Rico, in light of the recent havoc inflicted on the Caribbean island by Hurricane Maria.\nThe natural disaster wiped out the power grid, while 88 percent of the cellphone sites in Puerto Rico still have no service and less than half of the nation's residents have access to running water, according to Reuters.\nIn commodities , oil prices showed signs of being under pressure during early market trade, as global supply glut concerns continued to weigh on investor sentiment.

Editor\u2019s note: The opinions in this article are the author\u2019s, as published by our content partner, and do not necessarily represent the views of MSN or Microsoft.\nU.S. households\u2019 equity exposure \u2014 perhaps the broadest-based sentiment measure available \u2014 has risen to near-record levels.\nPopular Searches Toyota Motor Corp TM\n\u25b2 119.31 +0.14 +0.12% Moody's Corporation MCO\n\u25b2 140.21 +1.00 +0.72% Equifax Inc EFX\n\u25b2 107.81 +1.82 +1.72% Microsoft Corp MSFT\n\u25b2 74.61 +0.12 +0.16% That\u2019s not a good contrarian sign, of course, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the bulls from trying to put lipstick on this pig. They insist that investors still hold lots of cash that is available to propel the stock market highe r.\nJust last week, for example, a widely-shared article in the blogosphere blared: \u201cAn investing legend who has nailed the market at every turn just got even more bullish on stocks.\u201d His reasoning? \u201cAmple cash remains on the sidelines.\u201d A number of the investment newsletters have been trumpeting the same theme; the editor of one recently wrote to clients: \u201cThere is still a huge population of underinvested individuals.\u201d\nI\u2019m not buying this argument, and you shouldn\u2019t either. Whenever household equity exposure levels have risen to levels as high as they are now, the stock market\u2019s subsequent 10-year return has been well-below average.\nCurrently, according to Ned Davis Research, stocks represent 40% of total household financial assets, much higher than the 28.2% average allocation since 1951. There\u2019s been only one other occasion since 1951 in which stock allocation was higher than it is today \u2014 at the top of the late 1990s internet bubble, when it rose to 47.5%.\nEvery other major stock market top of the last seven decades, in contrast, occurred when households\u2019 equity allocation was lower than today\u2019s level. At the 2007 stock market top, for example, the allocation peaked at 37.1%.\nSkeptics will point out that, earlier this year when the first quarter data became available, I advanced a similar argument: I reported that household equity allocation stood at a dangerously high 39.2%. And, yet, far from stopping the bull market, it has continued to power higher. So why worry that this allocation is at even loftier levels today, at 40%?\nIt\u2019s important to remember that households\u2019 equity allocation is not being proposed as a short-term market timing indicator. On the contrary, its true value is as a long-term forecaster, since it has an unparalleled correlation with the stock market\u2019s subsequent 10-year return. Philosophical Economics , the investment blog to which Ned Davis credits with discovering this correlation, referred to household equity allocation as the \u201cSingle Greatest Predictor of Future Stock Market Returns.\u201d\nSo you shouldn\u2019t dismiss the high household-equity allocation just because the stock market has been so strong over the past six months . Assuming the future is like the past, the market\u2019s returns between now and 2027 are likely to be mediocre at best \u2014 regardless of the direction stocks head in the next several months .\nThe bottom line? Hayes Martin is president of Market Extremes , an investment consulting firm that focuses on major market turning points. In an interview, he referred to the near-record levels of household equity allocation as creating the preconditions for an eventual bear market. \u201cWe\u2019re in the late innings of the ballgame,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps the 7th or 8th inning.\u201d\nFurthermore, lofty household equity allocation levels tell us that the bear market, when it eventually comes, could be particularly severe. \u201cWhen we do top out, we could have a very big drop,\u201d Hayes said.\nWhat is \u2018sideline cash,\u2019 anyway?\nAnother reason to question the bulls\u2019 argument about sideline cash is that it\u2019s not clear what it really refers to. For pointing this out, I am indebted to Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management.\nSeveral years ago in the Financial Analysts Journal , Quote: : \u201cThere are no sidelines. Those saying this seem to envision a seller of stocks moving her money to cash and awaiting a chance to return. But they always ignore that this seller sold to somebody, who presumably moved a precisely equal amount of cash off the sidelines.\u201d\nAsness implores us to view the markets as an equilibrium. While \u201cthere can be a sideline for any subset of investors, \u2026 someone else has to be doing the opposite. Add us all up and there are no sidelines.\u201d\nFor more information, including descriptions of the Hulbert Sentiment Indices, go to The Hulbert Financial Digest or email mark@hulbertratings.com.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.marketwatch.com/story/october-could-determine-whether-stocks-have-a-great-or-middling-move-over-the-coming-year-2017-09-29", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-rising-optimism-should-make-stock-market-investors-nervous-2017-10-02", "http://hulbertratings.com/", "http://www.marketextremes.com/", "http://www.marketwatch.com/", "http://www.philosophicaleconomics.com/", "http://www.cfapubs.org/doi/pdf/10.2469/faj.v70.n1.2", "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-test-support-and-subsequently-rally-2017-10-02"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mark hulbert", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ned davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cliff asness", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayes martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asness", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ned davis research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aqr capital management", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hulbert financial digest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dow jones & company, inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "financial analysts journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philosophical economics", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:48:46.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53fe65068a822a95839aa72886d0984c8e028be3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6K8m24p4B3hMNOkwggvJAtnin1elFwyoJH632NfQ2HpIxGY0TNNGEof5yI7RpxpqkCtQHEI5GKFwYvdyejKl2WxkNSzaE4XBFG", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "MSN.com - Hotmail, Outlook, Skype, Bing, Latest News, Photos &amp; Videos", "title": "Why you lose your hair when you get older", "title_full": "Why you lose your hair when you get older", "published": "2017-10-03T04:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.178, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 19, "comments": 0, "shares": 19}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53fe65068a822a95839aa72886d0984c8e028be3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6K8m24p4B3hMNOkwggvJAtnin1elFwyoJH632NfQ2HpIxGY0TNNGEof5yI7RpxpqkCtQHEI5GKFwYvdyejKl2WxkNSzaE4XBFG", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "msn.com", "published": "2017-10-03T04:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why you lose your hair when you get older", "text": "Why you lose your hair when you get older", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:49:22.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "820e110fcc65a9d0062dee1c395d39837289c851", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFaaAc02DnEdrKCmiVzx_9mwQyw.5POOeAWwMKAkR2RhmTe41v0iNIEFXf_PBU7oivi49wpZQ13I0Plk5JhS37_ANT531Jn4F2w--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://movies.uk.msn.com/RSS-Movies-Features.aspx", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Movies | Latest news, movie releases and reviews | MSN UK", "title": "Paddington 2 - Trailer", "title_full": "Paddington 2 - Trailer", "published": "2017-10-03T13:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "820e110fcc65a9d0062dee1c395d39837289c851", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFaaAc02DnEdrKCmiVzx_9mwQyw.5POOeAWwMKAkR2RhmTe41v0iNIEFXf_PBU7oivi49wpZQ13I0Plk5JhS37_ANT531Jn4F2w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T13:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Paddington 2 - Trailer", "text": "SHARE Paddington, now happily settled with the Brown family and a popular member of the local community, picks up a series of odd jobs to buy the perfect present for his Aunt Lucy's 100th birthday, only for the gift to be stolen.

Companies have given their pre-placement talks and five to six of them conducted tests to shortlist candidates, said finalyear students.\n\"Our CV verification process is going on,\" said a final-year mechanical engineering student who did not want to be named.

They expect the trend to continue this year as well,\" said a final-year electrical engineering student. The top-bracket salaries that these companies are offering indicate that they will hire on Day 1, said two students appearing for placements.\nUsually, the biggest names in the field land on campuses early on in the season to lap up the creamiest of layers. While they will hire software engineers, product developers and product engineers with coding knowledge, big management firms like AT Kearney, Bain & Company and Boston Consulting Group are expected to hire consultants and data scientists on Day 1. These roles are open to students of other branches of engineering as well.\nALSO WATCH: Indian markets may remain stable after this credit policy: Experts\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO (Video provided by Times of India)\nPrivate lenders Axis Bank and HSBC have also registered with IIT-D. The placement process is set to gain momentum after October 22 when students return from the mid-term break. Software giants Microsoft and Google, and India's biggest ecommerce company Flipkart are also likely to join the list of recruiters by then, students said.\n\"I expect the number of recruiting companies to go up to 100-120 by October end,\" the mechanical engineering student said.

It should be better than last year, when it was bad.

VLSI chip design is another area that students are keen on. Students also take up finance and marketing courses at the MBA department to prepare for consultancy jobs.'' IBM is hiring for a machine learning role, he added.\nNot many startups have registered so far, with Californiabased cloud services firm Rubrik being the only attractive one on the list, students said. Many startups, including Zomato, Portea Medical and Hospscotch, were blacklisted from the institute's placements last year because they later withdrew the offers made to students.\nHowever, the ban has been lifted. This year startups will reportedly be bunched together on one day called 'Startup Day', which will be slotted way below on the fourth or fifth day of placements.

Especially if you're looking forward to a long and healthy retirement, waiting to claim Social Security at 70 can help you maximize your overall retirement income from the program.\nYet the most common age to claim Social Security is 62. That's the earliest possible age you can claim retirement benefits, and by claiming at that age, you're locking in the lowest monthly benefits you could receive. That raises a key question of why more people don't wait until age 70 to claim Social Security. Despite the obvious benefit of a higher monthly income from waiting, there are good reasons people claim earlier rather than deferring.\nNo. 1: They really need the money\nAround 62% of retirees get at least half their income from Social Security. With the average retiree benefit at $1,369 per month ($16,428 per year ), that indicates that most retirees would have a total income at or below that level if they didn't claim their benefits. If the ability is there to more than double an otherwise meager income just by signing up, it makes sense to take the money.\nNo. 2: They don't expect to live long enough to make waiting worthwhile\nNot all retirees expect to live a long and healthy life in retirement. Despite the higher monthly check, for a retiree to collect more over your lifetime from waiting until age 70, that retiree will need to survive to somewhere around age 80 to 83 . If health concerns, family history, or lifestyle choices make it unlikely for a retiree to survive long enough to get the benefit of that bigger payment, it simply makes no sense to wait.\nNo. 3: They want money while they're still young enough to enjoy it\nEven for retirees who expect to live a long time, the unfortunate reality is that most of us tend to slow down the older we get. Many retirees would rather have the income boost from a Social Security check sooner, while they're still young and vibrant enough to enjoy the money. If you're largely homebound near the end of your retirement, the increased monthly income probably won't mean as much to you as the memories you could have made by getting your hands on the money earlier.\nNo. 4: They expect benefits through their spouse's work history\nYour Social Security benefit depends on your own earnings history, but if you're married, you may be able to instead claim a benefit up to a level that's half your spouse's. Many couples have one spouse who accrued significantly higher Social Security benefits than the other, which makes it a potentially attractive benefit. Still, unlike a retiree's own benefits, spousal benefits stop increasing at a person's full retirement age instead of at age 70. As a result, it's not worthwhile to wait until 70 for those spousal benefits.\nNo. 5: They're really smart investors\nOnce you retire, you should shift some of your money to bonds to cover your near-term costs of living. How much you'll need to shift depends on how much of your spending you need to cover from your portfolio, as opposed to covering from other income sources such as Social Security.\nThe more costs you need your portfolio to cover, the higher the bond allocation you'll need. By taking Social Security earlier than age 70, you can keep more money in stocks longer, potentially benefiting from the faster compounding that stocks can deliver.\nIt's your retirement, your choice\n\u00a9 Getty Images Senior couple drinking white wine or champaign Unless you have good reason to believe you'll have a shorter or longer life expectancy than the typical American, you'll probably receive about the same throughout your life no matter when you start collecting. As a result, feel free to weigh the trade-offs between collecting earlier and waiting until age 70, and make a decision that looks like it best fits your particular needs.\nSPONSORED: The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

It's been wiped out,\" Trump said last week. \"Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\"\nThe trip will be Trump's fourth to a region battered by storms during an unusually violent hurricane season that has also seen parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the U.S. Virgin Islands inundated by floodwaters and whipped by winds.\n\u00a9 AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Roberto Clemente's team, the Pittsburgh Pirates collects donations outside PNC Park in Pittsburgh for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico, Monday, Oct. 2, 2017. Trump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend briefings and meet with Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, as well as the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. They'll also meet with Navy and Marine Corps personnel on the flight Deck of the USS Kearsarge.\nEven before the storm hit on Sept. 20, Puerto Rico was in dire condition thanks to a decade-long economic recession that had left its infrastructure, including the island's power lines, in a sorry state. Maria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island's entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads.\nNearly two weeks later, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access basic necessities, including food, fresh water and cash.\nTrump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat the perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm's destruction in its immediate aftermath.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday the trip would focus on local recovery efforts, \"which we're fully committed to.\"\n\"The top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,\" she said.\nWhile early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved.\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there are now more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island, and forty-five percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 60 percent of retail gas stations now up and running.\nFor many, however, that isn't enough. On Monday, the nonprofit Oxfam announced that it would be taking the rare step of intervening in an American disaster, citing its outrage over what it called a \"slow and inadequate response.\"\n___\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

We were just trying to keep people from dying.\"\nAs Sunday night led to Monday morning, the attack became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history with 59 killed and 527 wounded.\nUniversity Medical Center of Southern Nevada was one of many hospitals that were overflowing.\n\"Every bed was full,\" Coates said. \"We had people in the hallways, people outside and more people coming in.\"\nHe said the huge, horrifying wounds on his operating table that told him it wasn't just the massive numbers that made this shooting different.\n\"It was very clear that the first patient I took back and operated on that this was a high-powered weapon,\" Coates said. \"This wasn't a normal street weapon. This was something that did a lot of damage when it entered the body cavity,\" Coates said.\nHe had seen similar wounds before but \"of course never this many patients,\" he said.\nThe gunman, 64-year-old retired accountant Stephen Paddock, killed himself as authorities stormed his hotel room.\nHe had 23 guns \u2014 some with scopes \u2014 in the room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, where he had been staying since Thursday. He knocked out two windows to create sniper's perches he used to rain torrents of bullets on the crowd of 22,000 some 500 yards away, authorities said.\nTwo guns were modified to make them fully automatic, according to two U.S. officials briefed by law enforcement who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still unfolding.\nAt Paddock's home, authorities found 19 more guns, explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Also, several pounds of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be turned into explosives, were in his car, authorities said.\nAuthorities believe Paddock acted alone. While he appeared to have no criminal history, his father was a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list in the 1960s.\n\"I can't even make something up,\" his brother in Florida, Eric Paddock, said when asked what might have motivated his brother. \"There's just nothing.\"\nLas Vegas shooting Slideshow by photo services\nAuthorities also had nothing to say about Paddock's motive.\n\"I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,\" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said.\nAt the concert, headliner Jason Aldean had just started his set shortly after 10 p.m. to close out the three-day Route 91 Harvest Festival when bullets started hitting people.\nIn the crowd there was gunfire, but no gunman. Some figured out where it was coming from through the cracks and muzzle flashes.\n\"It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life,\" said Kodiak Yazzie, 36. \"You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash, flash, flash, flash.\"\nPaddock appeared to fire unhindered for more than 10 minutes, according to radio traffic, as police frantically tried to locate him.\n\"We can't worry about the victims,\" an officer said on radio at 10:15 p.m. \"We need to stop the shooter before we have more victims. Anybody have eyes on him ... stop the shooter.\"\nThe crowd, funneled tightly into a wide-open space, had little cover and no easy way to escape. Victims fell to the ground, while others fled in panic. Some hid behind concession stands or crawled under parked cars.\nFaces were etched with shock and confusion, and people wept and wailed. Some of the injured were hit by shrapnel. Others were trampled or were injured jumping fences.\n\"It was chaos \u2014 people just running for their lives. People trying to get down. Trying to get to their loved ones that had gotten hit,\" said Shaun Topper. \"It was just, you know. It was chaos.\"\nMarie Langer, 16, of Las Vegas, got to the concert early so she could get to the very front of the venue, closest to the stage.\nThat meant she and her friends were among the last to get out, and could hear shots ringing and people screaming the entire time she was trying to flee. She finally had to climb a fence with points on the top of metal bars designed to prevent people from getting over it.\n\"We had no other option,\" she said.\n\u00a9 The Associated Press Mandalay Bay resort and casino towers over the festival area. Tales of heroism and compassion emerged quickly: One man grasped the hand of a dying stranger as the man died, unable to pull himself away despite the danger. Another borrowed a flannel shirt from a man he didn't know to create a tourniquet for a girl he didn't know.\nCouples held hands as they ran. The healthy carried the bleeding off the grounds. Strangers drove victims to hospitals in their own cars.\nBodies covered in white sheets were still being removed from the festival grounds more than 12 hours after the massacre, and the scene was covered with the abandoned bags and belongings of those who fled.\nCoates, the trauma surgeon, said it was not for lack of preparation that lives were lost, though with smaller numbers they might have saved more.\n\"I will tell you that everybody that should have lived, lived,\" Coates said. \"The ones that we lost, I think if they had been the only patients coming through the door that we would have been able to save them.\"\nAuthorities put out a call for blood donations and set up a hotline to report missing people and speed the identification of the dead and wounded. They also opened a \"family reunification center\" for people to find loved ones.\nWorld leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull sent condolence messages to President Donald Trump.\nBefore Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in June 2016, when a gunman who professed support for Muslim extremist groups opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people. Historically, the United States has had a number of mass shootings surpassing Sunday's attack. For example, more than 100 black people were gunned down during a mass shooting in Colfax, Louisiana, in 1873.\nSally Ho, Regina Garcia Cano and Brian Skoloff in Las Vegas; Brian Melley and Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles; Sadie Gurman and Tami Abdollah in Washington; and Kristin M.

shooting", "text": "As Las Vegas grieves, investigators struggle to uncover motive behind shooting The Washington Post 38 mins ago Lynh Bui, Mark Berman, Matt Zapotosky Las Vegas shooting Slideshow by photo services\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Investigators struggled Tuesday with a chilling but baffling array of clues in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history \u2014 including a hotel room arsenal fit for a commando team \u2014 yet were still left trying to grasp the chain of events that caused a 64-year-old retiree to turn a concert ground into a killing field.\n\u201cI can\u2019t get into the mind of a psychopath,\u201d said Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, on Monday.\nAt the same time, the probes stretched from a ranch-style home near the Arizona border to the 32nd-floor hotel suite used by Stephen Paddock as a place to scan the crowds at a country music festival and then open fire \u2014 leaving at least 59 people dead and hundreds more injured in the rain of bullets or trampled in the panicked rush for cover late Sunday. He then killed himself as police closed.\nAnd once again, a stunned nation was left to grapple with enduring issues over gun control and gun violence. The White House and many Republicans insisted it was a time to mourn rather than launch into political battles. But some Democrats renewed calls for gun safety legislation, and late-night comedy hosts turned somber.\nJimmy Kimmel was in tears at the start of his monologue Monday night as he spoke of the \u201cterrible, inexplicable, shocking and painful tragedy\u201d in his hometown Las Vegas.\nThe massacre was possibly in the planning stages for days.\nLas Vegas shooting victims Slideshow by photo services\nPolice said Paddock arrived on Thursday at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino overlooking the Vegas Strip. He aroused no suspicion from hotel staff as he surrounded himself with stunning firepower in two rooms: 23 guns, some with scopes. One of the weapons he apparently used in the attack was an AK-47 type rifle, with a stand used to steady it for firing, people familiar with the case said.\nAuthorities said a sweep of law enforcement databases showed Paddock had no known run-ins with police. He was the son of a bank robber who was once on the FBI wanted list. But investigators have turned up no clear links to any underworld gangs or international terrorist groups \u2014 despite a claim by the Islamic State that Paddock carried out the carnage in its name.\nAmong the questions they have: How a former accountant with a penchant for high-stakes gambling obtained a weapon that sounded to those on the ground like it could fire as an automatic, and how he was able to bring it and many other weapons into a Vegas hotel suite undetected.\nInvestigators believe at least one of the guns functioned as if it were fully automatic, and they are now trying to determine if he modified it or other weapons to be capable of spitting out a high volume of fire just by holding down the trigger, people familiar with the case said.\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT New details emerge about victims in Las Vegas The names and stories of some of the victims of Sunday's Las Vegas shooting are coming to light following the massacre.

Guns & Guitars, a store in Mesquite, Nev., said in a statement that Paddock purchased some of his weapons there, but employees followed all procedures required by law, and Paddock \u201cnever gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time.\u201d Lombardo said Paddock also seemed to have purchased guns in Arizona.\nInvestigators also found at least 19 additional firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition and the chemical tannerite, an explosive, at Paddock\u2019s home in Mesquite, Nev. They also found ammonium nitrate, a chemical that can be used in bomb-making, in Paddock\u2019s vehicle, Lombardo said.\nMore than 22,000 people had been at the Route 91 Harvest festival, a three-day country music concert with grounds across the street from the Mandalay Bay resort, when the shooting began about 10 p.m. Sunday, according to police. As country star Jason Aldean played what was expected to be one of the last sets of the night, Paddock opened fire \u2014 his bullets flying from a window on the casino\u2019s golden facade, which Paddock had smashed with some type of hammer.\n\u201cPeople were getting shot at while we were running, and people were on the ground bleeding, crying and screaming. We just had to keep going,\u201d said Dinora Merino, 28, a dealer at the Ellis Island casino who was at the concert with a friend. \u201cThere are tents out there and there\u2019s no place to hide. It\u2019s just an open field.\u201d\nThe death toll in Las Vegas was massive, surpassing the 49 people slain by a gunman in Orlando in June 2016. That shooter, who later said he was inspired by the Islamic State, opened fire inside a crowded nightclub. And Lombardo said the number of dead from Sunday\u2019s concert shooting could rise, as an additional 527 were thought to have been injured.\nThe dead included a behavioral therapist who was soon to be married, a nursing assistant from Southern California, a commercial fisherman and an off-duty Las Vegas city police officer. Two other officers who were on duty were injured, police said; one was in stable condition after surgery, and the other sustained minor injuries. Another off-duty officer with the Bakersfield Police Department in Southern California also sustained non-life threatening injuries, according to a statement from the department.\nSyed Saquib, a surgeon on duty Sunday night at University Medical Center, said the hospital treated 104 patients, most of whom had gunshot wounds.\n\u201cThose that could be saved, were saved,\u201d Saquib said. \u201cThere were a few that came in with devastating, non-survivable injuries.\u201d\nPolice and hotel security ultimately scoured several floors of the hotel looking for the shooter and came upon Paddock\u2019s suite, Lombardo said. At some point, Paddock fired through the door and hit a security guard in the leg, he said, adding that the guard is expected to survive. SWAT officers ultimately stormed the room and some fired shots, though Paddock is believed to have killed himself, Lombardo said. He was not counted in the death toll that authorities reported.\nPresident Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. He praised the \u201cmiraculous\u201d speed with which local law enforcement responded to the shooting \u2014 asserting that their actions saved lives \u2014 though he noted that hundreds were still mourning the loss of loved ones. Answers for them, he said, would \u201cnot come easy.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an act of pure evil,\u201d Trump said during remarks from the White House.\nSteve Sisolak, Clark County Commission Chair from Las Vegas, praised the police for their quick response and commended the outpouring of support from the community; more than 25,000 people have donated to a fundraising effort for victims and people have been waiting eight hours in line to donate blood, he said.\n\u201cLas Vegas will never be quite the same as a result of this,\u201d Sisolak said. But, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nEric Paddock, Stephen Paddock\u2019s brother, said he was stunned to learn that his brother could be responsible for such violence.\nStephen Paddock had no history of mental illness nor did he have problems with drugs or alcohol, Eric Paddock said, noting that his brother was a high-stakes gambler, sometimes wagering hundreds of dollars on a single hand of video poker.\nWhen he spoke to the FBI, Eric Paddock said he showed agents three years of text messages from his brother, including one that mentioned winning $250,000 at a casino. A federal law enforcement official said investigators had reviewed reports suggesting Paddock engaged in high-dollar gambling, and they are trying to determine whether he faced financial strains.\nEric Paddock said his brother was \u201cwealthy,\u201d in part because he had no children to support. Stephen Paddock had worked in the past as an accountant, and he had real estate investments in the Orlando area, Eric Paddock said.\nPolice said they believe Paddock was a \u201clone wolf\u201d attacker, though they were still interested in speaking more with a woman named Marilou Danley who lived with him in Mesquite, Nev., a little more than an hour outside of Las Vegas on the Arizona border. Danley, Paddock\u2019s 62-year-old girlfriend, was found outside the country \u2014 as of Monday afternoon, in Tokyo \u2014 and was not involved in the shooting.\n\u201cWe still consider her a person of interest,\u201d Lombardo said Monday. He said investigators also are exploring a report that Paddock attended a different music festival in September.\nNot long after the shooting, the Islamic State claimed responsibility, though law enforcement authorities were quick to reject that assertion. \u201cWe have determined, to this point, no connection with an international terrorist group,\u201d Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Las Vegas, said at a news briefing.\nThe FBI had a previous dealing with the Paddock family, though it did not initially seem to involve Stephen. Eric Paddock said his father was Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, a convicted bank robber and con-man described in a wanted poster as \u201cpsychopathic\u2019\u2019 with suicidal tendencies. But Eric Paddock said that his father, who escaped from prison in 1969 and was at one point on the FBI\u2019s list of most-sought-after and dangerous criminals, was not around during their childhood. Benjamin Paddock was apprehended in 1978, according to news reports.\nRelatives said Stephen Paddock, a licensed pilot who owned two airplanes, was a quiet man who often went to Las Vegas to gamble and view concerts. In a statement, Lockheed Martin, the defense giant, said that Paddock worked for them for three years in the 1980s.\nA former neighbor of Stephen Paddock\u2019s recalled that his home in a 55-and-over community in Florida looked more akin to a college freshman\u2019s dorm, with nothing on the walls and only a few pieces of furniture.\n\u201cOne of the first times we met him, he told me he lived there, in Vegas,\u201d Don Judy, his next-door neighbor in the community until two years ago, recalled. \u201cHe explained that he was a gambler, and a prospector. He said he was buying this house to check it out for his mother \u2026 and that if she liked it, he planned to buy another next door with a floor plan like ours.\u201d\nSoon, Judy said, Paddock put up a for-sale sign and was gone, saying that he was moving back to Las Vegas.\nZapotosky and Berman reported from Washington.

begin in April Hindustan Times 15 hours ago The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to start printing redesigned Rs 100 currency notes around April next year, sources in the central bank have said.\nPrinting for the new notes, one of the most common denominations in the country, will begin after presses finish printing the new Rs 200 bank note by the end of the financial year in March.\nThe existing Rs 100 currency notes will continue to be in the system and will be withdrawn gradually without any disruption, the central bank official said, asking to remain unnamed.\nThe size and dimensions of the new notes will not be altered, ensuring automatic-teller machines (ATMs) can be compatible from the beginning. Currently, Rs 100 is dispensed through ATMs across the country. Of the four cassettes, or boxes, in an ATM, only one is used for Rs 100 notes.\nCountries often redesign bank notes to eliminate chances of hoarding in order to catch tax dodgers. India banned the old Rs 500- and Rs 1,000-denomination bank notes in November last year in an ambitious attempt to flush out undeclared wealth. The two bank notes together accounted for 86% of the currency in circulation at the time.\nIn December, RBI officials had said that all currency notes will be redesigned.\nSince then, the government has changed the Rs 500 and Rs 50 notes, and introduced new denominations of Rs 200 and Rs 2,000.\nSources added the exercise of pumping the Rs 200 notes into the system is likely to take around another six months. Their printing will depend on the demand and feedback received from the select bank branches that have started dispensing the new denomination.\nThe government introduced the Rs 200 notes to help people change high-value currency notes. According to a State Bank of India report, 43.6% of the total cash circulation is in Rs 500 notes while Rs 100 is just over 20%.\n\u00a9 Provided by Hindustan Times Bank officials said that while the currency replacement exercise is over and there is no shortage of cash, people are not keen on withdrawing the Rs 2,000 bank notes.\n.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.hindustantimes.com/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reserv", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hindustan times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hindustan times bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:45:38.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a2951a67db240748ccc2b7fd71615bb5cb7270f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z0zrFRuQ9K6nvVW1NLwg1BBIve0zdzO40hiVS3Zw79xxujJZ_0clsheJDUSmMjXq5460PEnnNNjQckR5y9bIb8ZZo7JD2W9RA4w0Q68fhedyw--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Latest India and World news, photos and videos | MSN India", "title": "Reliance Jio Festive Offer: JioFi Can Still Be Bought For Rs 999", "title_full": "Reliance Jio Festive Offer: JioFi Can Still Be Bought For Rs 999", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a2951a67db240748ccc2b7fd71615bb5cb7270f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z0zrFRuQ9K6nvVW1NLwg1BBIve0zdzO40hiVS3Zw79xxujJZ_0clsheJDUSmMjXq5460PEnnNNjQckR5y9bIb8ZZo7JD2W9RA4w0Q68fhedyw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NDTV Profit Team", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Reliance Jio Festive Offer: JioFi Can Still Be Bought For Rs 999", "text": "Reliance Jio Festive Offer: JioFi Can Still Be Bought For Rs 999 NDTV 14 hours ago NDTV Profit Team Reliance Jio has extended its festive season offer for the sale of its 4G wi-fi device JioFi.

Earlier on Sunday, Reliance Communications called off the talks with Aircel citing regulatory delays and legal uncertainties.\nRCom on Monday issued a statement and said: \"Merger of mobile business of RCom and Aircel lapses with mutual consent.

Reliance Communications also blamed high level of competition as one of the reasons for termination of the merger talks.\n\"Unprecedented competitive intensity in the Indian telecom sector together with fresh policy directives, adversely impacting bank financing for this sector, have also seriously affected industry dynamics. As a result of the various factors aforesaid, the merger agreement has lapsed,\" RCom said.\nOn Monday, Anil Ambani-led RCom further expanded its board by adding four new members. The company has also presented an alternative plan for debt reduction by selling company's real estate, tower and fibre business.\nAnil Ambani's telecom business has been shrinking in big size for last couple of years - RCom made a standalone loss of Rs 1796 crore in the last financial year, compared to its peak profit of Rs 4803 crore in March 2009 and its net sales fell by 35 per cent to Rs 8823 crore in this period.\nEarlier in May, it was reported that RCom defaulted on its loan servicing obligations with more than 10 local banks and some of whom categorised the exposure as \"special mention account\" in their asset books.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://indiatoday.intoday.in/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "anil ambani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anil", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "aircel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reliance communications", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:45:45.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0b33c18935b670b08ed2a4b5dc429e13d74b8c75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z2a7mbLwGUiY8Yd5nZNDoSPKfKmWVJ2vwH6TsdNwf_fGsSMkLuBUztmwlmIy_8JvRpnZ1AAK6YLT_hicmnlteNbVPhBF.NyB7fzdGikQ8U_Sg--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Latest India and World news, photos and videos | MSN India", "title": "Six reasons why the RBI should keep status quo on repo rate", "title_full": "Six reasons why the RBI should keep status quo on repo rate", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0b33c18935b670b08ed2a4b5dc429e13d74b8c75", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z2a7mbLwGUiY8Yd5nZNDoSPKfKmWVJ2vwH6TsdNwf_fGsSMkLuBUztmwlmIy_8JvRpnZ1AAK6YLT_hicmnlteNbVPhBF.NyB7fzdGikQ8U_Sg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Saaho: Another actress roped in for Prabhas's film", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Six reasons why the RBI should keep status quo on repo rate", "text": "Six reasons why the RBI should keep status quo on repo rate India Today 16 hours ago \u00a9 Provided by India Today Six reasons why the RBI should keep status quo on repo rate The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will unveil its fourth bi-monthly monetary policy statement on Wednesday. In the last policy in August, it cut the repo rate, the rate at which banks borrows from RBI, by 25 basis points to 6 per cent. Six reasons why RBI should keep a status quo in the current policy.\ni) The Retail Inflation is up\nThe consumer price index (CPI), which the RBI tracks for adjusting its repo rate, has been hardening after touching a low of 1.54 per cent in June this year. CPI moved up to 2.4 per cent in July and 3.36 per cent in August this year. Clearly, the short term trend indicates some hardening in line with the RBI's projection of 3.5-4.5 per cent in the second half (October to March ) of 2017-18. The entire year target for CPI is 4 per cent with plus and minus 2 per cent in 2017-18. There are two more reviews left in December and February to adjust the rates.\nii) Higher current account deficit\nThe current account deficit (CAD), which has been on the decline from 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2012-13 to a low of 0.7 per cent in 2016-17, is suddenly reversing. In the first quarter (April-June) of 2017-18, the CAD has widened to a high of 2.4 per cent of GDP, which is alarming. This is on the back of higher imports of gold and crude in value terms. Given the huge trade deficit and the sudden outflow of portfolio investments from equity markets, there is every possibility of higher CAD in 2017-18. This will have a direct impact on the rupee value against the US dollar. The market saw how the rupee depreciated when the CAD was over 4 per cent between 2011/12 to 2012/13. And if the currency depreciates, there is a threat of imported inflation via currency in the coming months.\niii) Likely stimulus to widen fiscal deficit\nThe fiscal deficit has been steadily declining over the last 5 years from a high of close to 6 per cent in 2012-13 to 3.2 per cent targeted in 2017-18. The present BJP led NDA government has also adhered to the road map of keeping a low fiscal deficit. The target for next year -- 2018/19 -- is 3 per cent. The sudden talk of fiscal stimulus to push the country's GDP, which has crashed to 5.1 per cent in the first quarter (April-June) of 2017-18, has the potential to impact the fiscal deficit numbers if the matching revenues through tax and non tax is not generated. The RBI would certainly wait and watch for the government moves in this direction before further easing the interest rates now.\niv) US Fed rate to move up further\nThe US Fed rate , which kept is short term rates near zero level for almost seven years, started hiking the rates from 2016 onwards. In a short period of 18 months, the Fed rates have gone up from near zero to 1.25-1.50 per cent. There is likelihood of another rate hike of 25 basis points before December this year. The gradual hiking of rate by US Fed is narrowing the interest rates differential for investors. The RBI will have to take into account the US Fed rates , which would surely move up in the coming months.\nv) Banks balance sheet issue still to be resolved\nThe banks clean up exercise has taken a heavy toll of banks especially the public sector banks, which control over 70 per cent of deposits and advances of the industry. The additional provisioning requirement for stressed assets especially telecom etc, rising NPAs and also bankruptcy proceedings (where banks have to take major haircuts) has been impacting the profitability of banks. Half a dozen PSU banks are already under RBI monitored preventive corrective action (PCA) framework because of low capital and profitability issues. Most of the PSU banks won't be in a position to transmit any rate cuts at this moment because they will tend to protect their margins.\nvi) Over-leveraged corporate and low capacity utilization\nThe corporate sector itself is over-leveraged with many sectors sitting on over-capacity. The capacity utilization has to move up for further expansion or demand for credit. Similarly, there are many corporate houses that are on a de-leveraging mode, and don't require credit for new projects. These two issues have to settle before corporate would start borrowing from banks. As per available statistics, the credit growth of banks have fallen to single digit in the last four years. In the first quarter, the credit growth was negative at 2 .22 per cent. So assuming the RBI cuts rates and banks also transmit the same instantly, there is actually no demand from India Inc.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://indiatoday.intoday.in/"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "india inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "psu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reserve bank of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us fed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:45:58.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a60431152e273c950fef4dd2c01cee40699dc737", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z0bydaFXVN811DELNad9V028UMwU7CBPsl5qem35JQolH3.Yyuh7dF4YTMxqicNl85.LfxL2PjSA8eDckwTlf.mvZurUXh7gOQ-", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Latest India and World news, photos and videos | MSN India", "title": "Vijay Mallya Arrested In UK For Money Laundering: Reports", "title_full": "Vijay Mallya Arrested In UK For Money Laundering: Reports", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 164, "comments": 0, "shares": 164}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a60431152e273c950fef4dd2c01cee40699dc737", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lrse9i9oH.Z0bydaFXVN811DELNad9V028UMwU7CBPsl5qem35JQolH3.Yyuh7dF4YTMxqicNl85.LfxL2PjSA8eDckwTlf.mvZurUXh7gOQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Haryana Police arrest Honeypreet", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vijay Mallya Arrested In UK For Money Laundering: Reports", "text": "Vijay Mallya Arrested In UK For Money Laundering: Reports NDTV 1 hour ago LONDON: Liquor baron Vijay Mallya was arrested in London for the second time this year, in a case of money laundering. Mr Mallya is out on bail after his arrest in April following India's extradition request.\nThe 61-year-old tycoon, who has been staying in the UK for over a year now, is accused of defaulting on loans worth thousands of crores in India. He slipped out of the country on March 2 last year, in the middle of attempts by a group of banks to recover more than Rs. 9,000 crore loaned to him for his now collapsed Kingfisher Airlines.\nIndia made an extradition request in February to Britain to send back Vijay Mallaya to face trial. Indian agencies followed up their request with a 2,000-page dossier as evidence against Mr Mallya.\nLast month, the fugitive submitted his response to India's request in a large box which had four reports. The extradition case will be taken up in December.\nVijay Mallya is in Britain on an \"indefinite leave to remain\" visa or on permanent residence after India cancelled his passport.\nThe businessman faces at least half a dozen arrest warrants back in India.\nALSO ON MSN: Vijay Mallya plays victim card again, says allegations against him are baseless\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO (Video provided by Times of India)\nKnown for his lavish lifestyle, Vijay Mallya has repeatedly defied summons by courts and investigators in India but has been a regular at public events in Britain, especially for the Formula One team that he owns.\nOn Twitter, he has dismissed the charges against him and targeted the media and politicians.\nCases against him are being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate, which handles financial crimes.\nVijay Mallya was earlier this year sacked from the board of United Breweries, the firm which was at the core of his business empire.

The Los Angeles private equity firm was in talks to cough up $1 billion to fund a transaction with the Nordstrom family but could not secure any bank financing, according to the New York Post. The company could not be reached for immediate comment.\nThe newspaper estimated the deal could have a value of up to $10 billion. Nordstrom had $2.7 billion in debt as of the end of July, with cash and equivalents totaling $919 million. The Seattle retailer has a $7.34 billion market capitalization after Monday's decline.\nNordstrom ended fiscal 2016, which closed on Jan. 28, with $805 million in Ebit and $354 million in net earnings on $14.5 billion in sales, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. The company carries a Baa1 investment grade rating from Moody's Investors Service Inc. For comparison, riskier Sears Holdings Corp. carries a Caa2 rating, deep into junk.\n\"No other private equity firm is going to be more successful in canvassing the market for debt financing than Leonard Green, so the only other way for another private equity player to come into this situation is if they're willing to put in more equity into the transaction, thereby decreasing the amount of debt needed to execute,\" Tawil said. \"And to me, that's unlikely.\"\nThe Post had said the deal could involve $6.5 billion in debt, with the Nordstrom family kicking in some $2.5 billion in equity. The family held 31.2% of the retailer as of June 7, according to SEC filings.\nBeyond its own livelihood, the upscale department store's financial troubles foreshadow harder times to come for retailers across the board in terms of finding and restructuring capital, experts said Monday. And for retailers such as Hudson's Bay Co. that are also looking into privatization options , Nordstrom's defeat raises the specter of an abrupt dead end.\n\"It's a terrible catch-22,\" said Ricardo Rubi, a marketing specialist and partner at consulting firm Simon-Kucher & Partners. \"Retailers like Nordstrom need long-term investments in order to grow, but if they don't grow, they can't get the backing of lenders.\"\n\u00a9 Provided by Thestreet.com A Nordstrom store. He added, \"All the banks are super scared about mall traffic and all the retail closures.\"\nFor Nordstrom, being stuck as a public company could mean that its existing investments in innovation -- including a slate of strategic hires -- could go to waste.\nPublic companies answer to shareholders, who focus on one thing quarter after quarter: comparable-store sales. But the problem, according to Rubi, is that the long-term developments needed to really salvage a retailer will not demonstrate returns in a single quarter. That's why going private was such a viable option for Nordstrom.\nFor similar department stores such as Macy's Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. , both of which fare considerably worse than Nordstrom in terms of comp sales, Wall Street's fear of retail signals their own troubles in the near future.\n\"There are other retailers with borrowing facilities due in the next couple of years. Even the retailers that have survived the recent apocalypse will have difficulty refinancing,\" Tawil said. \"And that means restructuring, if not bankruptcies and liquidations.\"\nMacy's, for instance, had $6.3 billion in total debt as of July 29. More than $1 billion of its bonds and notes are set to mature within five years.\nNordstrom's latest predicament also means trouble for activist investors, according to Tawil.\n\"Another takeaway is that for activist investors in retail situations, this casts a shadow over their efforts if their strategy is monetizing the real estate or refinancing the company,\" he said.\nMore of What's Trending on TheStreet : Apple iOS 11 Draining Your iPhone Battery?

Wisden India 1 day ago Wisden India staff England dethroned Australia in the International Cricket Council women\u2019s team rankings following the annual update on Tuesday (October 3). England, the Women\u2019s World Cup 2017 champions, were level with Australia on 128 points but ahead on decimal points, as per the new rankings.\nThe annual update meant results from 2013-14 were no longer relevant, with the 2014-15 and 2015-16 season results weighed at 50%, and the 2016-17 results at 100%.\nEngland went from 125 points to 128.47, while Australia were on 128.43. This marked the first time Australia have slipped from the top spot since the combined rankings for women\u2019s cricket was introduced in October 2015.\nAs the women\u2019s team rankings take into account performances in all three formats, the small gap of 0.04 points between the two sides should lend a lot of interest to England\u2019s upcoming Ashes tour of Australia, where the top two sides will play one Test, three One-Day Internationals and three Twenty20 Internationals from October 22 to November 21.\nWomen\u2019s rankings\n1. England \u2013 128 points\n2. Australia \u2013 128 points\n3. New Zealand \u2013 118 points\n4. India \u2013 116 points\n5. Windies \u2013 101 points\n6. South Africa \u2013 93 points\n7. Pakistan \u2013 72 points\n8. Sri Lanka \u2013 67 points\n9. Bangladesh \u2013 37 points\n10. Ireland \u2013 30 points\nThe rest of the teams\u2019 rankings stayed the same, though India made significant gains and were at 116 points, just two behind the third-ranked New Zealand, who were on 118.\nHeather Knight, the England captain, said gaining the top spot was a sign of her side\u2019s recent improvement. \u201cIt's flattering to be named as the No. 1 side in the world because it's a sign of how much progress we've made,\u201d she said. \u201cIt won't take anything away from the challenges ahead of us, though. We're a developing side and our journey isn't finished yet.\n\u00a9 Provided by Wisden \u201cWe have plenty more hard work to do, starting with the Ashes in Australia this winter but it has been a great 12 months for us. We'll never forget the feeling of winning the ICC Women's World Cup on home soil and we want to keep pushing forward as a side so we can experience more moments like that.\u201d\nMithali Raj, under whose leadership India reached the final of the World Cup in July losing narrowly to England, saw her side gain three points and was pleased with how things had gone. \u201cGaining these valuable points is no mean achievement and has come after some fine performances over the past year, including at the World Cup,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm sure this will inspire our team in matches ahead. We are now close to New Zealand in the rankings and will aim to be number three.\u201d\nWindies remained at No. 5 but lost four points to be at 101, with South Africa in sixth place, followed by

Butker\u2019s kick put the Chiefs up 23-20, and Kansas City added a touchdown as time expired when linebacker Justin Houston returned a fumbled lateral.\nButker also made 26- and 32-yard attempts earlier in the second half.\nHe missed the first attempt of his career when he pulled a 46-yarder wide left just before halftime. With hindsight, Butker can see that miss as a blessing.\nMore: Late scoring flurry allows Chiefs to stay unbeaten by beating Redskins 29-20\nMore: Chiefs' Alex Smith keeps answering questions one win at a time\nMore: 40 things we learned in Week 4 of the 2017 NFL season\nIt happened in the same end zone as his game-winning kick, from nearly an identical distance, and under similar wind conditions.\n\u201cI knew the ball was going to move, so that allowed me to aim right-middle for the second kick. I think everything happens for a reason,\u201d Butker said. \u201cI missed that kick, but I came back and I was more experienced going that way, more experienced with the wind, and I was able to handle it.\u201d\nButker, who said he kicked two short game-winning field goals in 2014 for Georgia Tech, was in his apartment in Charlotte, where he was a member of the Carolina Panthers\u2019 practice squad, on Monday when his agent called and told him he was heading to Kansas City. He was able to practice three times with his new teammates, even if he didn\u2019t get to know many of them outside of punter Dustin Colquitt, whom Butker knew from an offseason kicking academy, and long snapper James Winchester.\nAfter Butker\u2019s miss in the second quarter, it was Colquitt, a 13-year veteran, who gave the rookie a pep talk that boosted Butker\u2019s spirits, so much so that in critical situations late in the fourth quarter, Reid had no qualms in trusting Butker to make his kicks.\n\u201cI was confident because he was confident,\u201d Reid said.\nRelated Slideshow: Best

CBS Sports 1:15 Gurley on pace for historic season USA Today Sports Video 0:43 Appeals Court Set to Hear Elliott's Case Sports Illustrated 0:38 UP NEXT KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 Travis Kelce simply knew placekicker Harrison Butker, the newest member of the Kansas City Chiefs, by his jersey number.\n\u201cSeven,\u201d Kelce, the Chiefs standout tight end, said. \u201cI had to go introduce myself to him before the game.\u201d\nHIGHLIGHTS: Chiefs move to 4-0\nHead coach Andy Reid knew Butker by nickname.\n\u201cButtkicker dot com,\u201d Reid said, a nod to Butker\u2019s twitter handle, @Buttkicker87. \u201cWelcome to Kansas City.\u201d\nThe Chiefs will all surely remember Butker now.\nThe rookie kicker, signed to the Chiefs roster six days ago after an injury to Cairo Santos, nailed a 43-yard field goal with 4 seconds remaining to help Kansas City beat the Washington Redskins 29-20 Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium. Butker\u2019s kick put the Chiefs up 23-20, and Kansas City added a touchdown as time expired when linebacker Justin Houston returned a fumbled lateral.\nButker also made 26- and 32-yard attempts earlier in the second half.\nHe missed the first attempt of his career when he pulled a 46-yarder wide left just before halftime. With hindsight, Butker can see that miss as a blessing.\nMore: Late scoring flurry allows Chiefs to stay unbeaten by beating Redskins 29-20\nMore: Chiefs' Alex Smith keeps answering questions one win at a time\nMore: 40 things we learned in Week 4 of the 2017 NFL season\nIt happened in the same end zone as his game-winning kick, from nearly an identical distance, and under similar wind conditions.\n\u201cI knew the ball was going to move, so that allowed me to aim right-middle for the second kick. I think everything happens for a reason,\u201d Butker said. \u201cI missed that kick, but I came back and I was more experienced going that way, more experienced with the wind, and I was able to handle it.\u201d\nButker, who said he kicked two short game-winning field goals in 2014 for Georgia Tech, was in his apartment in Charlotte, where he was a member of the Carolina Panthers\u2019 practice squad, on Monday when his agent called and told him he was heading to Kansas City. He was able to practice three times with his new teammates, even if he didn\u2019t get to know many of them outside of punter Dustin Colquitt, whom Butker knew from an offseason kicking academy, and long snapper James Winchester.\nAfter Butker\u2019s miss in the second quarter, it was Colquitt, a 13-year veteran, who gave the rookie a pep talk that boosted Butker\u2019s spirits, so much so that in critical situations late in the fourth quarter, Reid had no qualms in trusting Butker to make his kicks.\n\u201cI was confident because he was confident,\u201d Reid said.\nRelated Slideshow: Best

They insist that investors still hold lots of cash that is available to propel the stock market highe r.\nJust last week, for example, a widely-shared article in the blogosphere blared: \u201cAn investing legend who has nailed the market at every turn just got even more bullish on stocks.\u201d His reasoning? \u201cAmple cash remains on the sidelines.\u201d A number of the investment newsletters have been trumpeting the same theme; the editor of one recently wrote to clients: \u201cThere is still a huge population of underinvested individuals.\u201d\nI\u2019m not buying this argument, and you shouldn\u2019t either. Whenever household equity exposure levels have risen to levels as high as they are now, the stock market\u2019s subsequent 10-year return has been well-below average.\nCurrently, according to Ned Davis Research, stocks represent 40% of total household financial assets, much higher than the 28.2% average allocation since 1951. There\u2019s been only one other occasion since 1951 in which stock allocation was higher than it is today \u2014 at the top of the late 1990s internet bubble, when it rose to 47.5%.\nEvery other major stock market top of the last seven decades, in contrast, occurred when households\u2019 equity allocation was lower than today\u2019s level. At the 2007 stock market top, for example, the allocation peaked at 37.1%.\nSkeptics will point out that, earlier this year when the first quarter data became available, I advanced a similar argument: I reported that household equity allocation stood at a dangerously high 39.2%. And, yet, far from stopping the bull market, it has continued to power higher. So why worry that this allocation is at even loftier levels today, at 40%?\nIt\u2019s important to remember that households\u2019 equity allocation is not being proposed as a short-term market timing indicator. On the contrary, its true value is as a long-term forecaster, since it has an unparalleled correlation with the stock market\u2019s subsequent 10-year return. Philosophical Economics , the investment blog to which Ned Davis credits with discovering this correlation, referred to household equity allocation as the \u201cSingle Greatest Predictor of Future Stock Market Returns.\u201d\nSo you shouldn\u2019t dismiss the high household-equity allocation just because the stock market has been so strong over the past six months . Assuming the future is like the past, the market\u2019s returns between now and 2027 are likely to be mediocre at best \u2014 regardless of the direction stocks head in the next several months .\nThe bottom line? Hayes Martin is president of Market Extremes , an investment consulting firm that focuses on major market turning points. In an interview, he referred to the near-record levels of household equity allocation as creating the preconditions for an eventual bear market. \u201cWe\u2019re in the late innings of the ballgame,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps the 7th or 8th inning.\u201d\nFurthermore, lofty household equity allocation levels tell us that the bear market, when it eventually comes, could be particularly severe. \u201cWhen we do top out, we could have a very big drop,\u201d Hayes said.\nWhat is \u2018sideline cash,\u2019 anyway?\nAnother reason to question the bulls\u2019 argument about sideline cash is that it\u2019s not clear what it really refers to. For pointing this out, I am indebted to Cliff Asness of AQR Capital Management.\nSeveral years ago in the Financial Analysts Journal , Quote: : \u201cThere are no sidelines. Those saying this seem to envision a seller of stocks moving her money to cash and awaiting a chance to return.

Three such thefts occurred from 2014 to 2016.\nProsecutors say the guns fell quickly into the hands of gangs and drug dealers. They've linked those weapons to Chicago's gun violence.\nShelton is the first of eight defendants up for sentencing. Prosecutors are seeking an 11\u00bd-year prison term.

MOSCOW- The Russian Foreign Ministry said U.S. officials had broken into residences at Russia's consulate in San Francisco, and threatened retaliation over what it called an illegal act.\nRussian staff had left the consulate last month, after Washington ordered Moscow to vacate some of its diplomatic properties, part of a series of tit-for-tat actions during a thorny phase in bilateral relations.\nSince then, U.S. officials had occupied administrative parts of the compound but on Monday they entered residential areas that the departing staff had locked, the ministry said in a statement late on Monday.\n\"Despite our warnings, the U.S. authorities did not listen to reason and did not give up their illegal intentions,\" it said. \"We reserve the right to respond. The principle of reciprocity has always been and remains the cornerstone of diplomacy.\"\nFootage aired repeatedly on Russian state television showed what the broadcaster said were U.S. officials breaking locks that had sealed off parts of the compound and entering the buildings.\nThe \"intruders\" had taken over the whole premises including the consul general's residence, the ministry said.\n\"Therefore, we understand that Americans, breaking into our diplomatic buildings, have de facto agreed that their missions in Russia may be treated likewise.\"\n\"ELECTORAL INTERFERENCE\"\nIn San Francisco, a Department of State Diplomatic Security guard answered the door at the Russian consulate, a six-story brick building surrounded by a modest security fence and manicured hedges in the Pacific Heights neighborhood. The guard declined to comment and left the building in a black SUV.\nA sign on the front door said that the consulate was closed and gave a new mailing address. The State Department guard left the consulate front door open, behind a closed gate, and sounds of activity could be heard inside, but no one responded to repeated calls by a reporter.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin last month accused Washington of \"boorish\" treatment of Russia\u2019s diplomatic premises on U.S. soil, ordering the foreign ministry to take legal action over alleged violations of Russia\u2019s property rights.\nThe dispute began late last year when former U.S. president Barack Obama expelled 35 Russian diplomats on accusations of Russian meddling in the election that took Donald Trump to the White House.\nTrump took office in January, saying he wanted to improve ties with Russia, while Putin also spoke favorably of Trump.\nBut the allegations of interference in the vote, which Moscow has denied, have persisted as an investigation by U.S. authorities has widened.\nIn July, Moscow ordered the United States to cut the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in Russia by around 60 percent, to 455.\nGo to MSN Home", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry solovyov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john stonestreet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:55:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53f4a8eaa89bbfbc7e230478121812b7073add17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KZNrMuy7mZmHLzB_t8ytXtLkjQGiUiRor3Vlz3MME_nsCZlUZSoeNYVFY7Udj0Fkl6jHqjOSPHxEpjlpAr9_cFZxlJWyrlpXv1yGcc1nCD0U-", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Winners and losers from Week 4 of 'Monday Night Football'", "title_full": "Winners and losers from Week 4 of 'Monday Night Football'", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.047, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53f4a8eaa89bbfbc7e230478121812b7073add17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KZNrMuy7mZmHLzB_t8ytXtLkjQGiUiRor3Vlz3MME_nsCZlUZSoeNYVFY7Udj0Fkl6jHqjOSPHxEpjlpAr9_cFZxlJWyrlpXv1yGcc1nCD0U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jesse Reed", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Winners and losers from Week 4 of 'Monday Night Football'", "text": "Winners and losers from Week 4 of 'Monday Night Football' Sportsnaut 8 hrs ago Jesse Reed Replay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO The Washington Redskins and Kansas City Chiefs put on an entertaining show on Monday Night Football in Week 4. The outcome came down to the wire. The Chiefs pulled out a win with four seconds to spare thanks to a 43-yard field goal by kicker Harrison Butker, who was playing in his first regular season NFL game.\n@Chiefs FOR THE WIN! #ChiefsKingdom #WASvsKC pic.twitter.com/WBQTT7oVY7\n\u2014 NFL (@NFL) October 3, 2017 The Chiefs would add another six points after Justin Houston returned a fumble for a touchdown on the game\u2019s final play.\nBOX SCORE: CHIEFS 29, REDSKINS 20\nFor the most part, it was a pretty clean game by both teams, who did not turn the ball over once until that final act of desperation from Washington blew up in its face. Still, there were some clear winners and losers, which we\u2019ll get to without any further delay.\nWinner: Alex Smith continues to shine\nAlex Smith leads the only undefeated team in the NFL heading into the second quarter of the 2017 season. His strong play has a lot to do with this, and it had a lot to do with the Chiefs winning against a very tough Redskins squad Monday night.\nSmith burned Washington\u2019s defense with his arm and his legs. He passed for 293 yards with a touchdown, added a rushing score and 56 big yards on the ground. In particular, Smith\u2019s ability to evade pressure on passing plays, turning them into huge gains by running away from it, was one aspect of Kansas City\u2019s offense Washington had no answer for.\nHIGHLIGHTS: Chiefs move to 4-0\nAfter Kirk Cousins got the Redskins in position for a tie with less than a minute remaining, it was Smith\u2019s turn to shine. He led the Chiefs down the field on a six-play, 50-yard drive to set up the game-winning field goal.\nAt least for now, rookie Patrick Mahomes II is nothing but a talented youngster on the sideline. Smith\u2019s mastery of Andy Reid\u2019s offense and his almost flawless execution of it has ensured he gets to play at least the 2017 season without any chatter about the young passer potentially unseating him .\nLoser: Preston Smith and a lack of discipline\nPreston Smith committed two neutral zone infractions and an offsides penalty that hurt his team badly. The first two helped the Chiefs on their first two touchdown-scoring drives of the game. He committed his first in the first quarter on a third-and-8 that gifted the Chiefs with five yards en route to their first score of the game. This was the lesser of his two evils.\nKansas City had driven down into the red zone early in the third quarter and were stuffed near the goal line. On third-and-goal, Alex Smith tried to hit Kareem Hunt out in the flat for the go-ahead score but safety D.J. Swearinger broke the play up, forcing fourth down. Only Smith had lined up well into the neutral zone, giving the home team new life and four more downs.\nOne play later, Alex Smith scored on a read-option to give the Chiefs their first lead of the game. Then on the next drive Smith jumped offsides on a third down to give the Chiefs yet another gift backed up in their own territory.\nWinner: Travis Kelce was unstoppable\nWashington had no answer for the talented tight end. For much of the middle two quarters, Kansas City\u2019s offense was the Travis Kelce show. He was covered by linebackers, safeties and cornerbacks as Andy Reid moved him all over the field. In the end Kelce finished with seven catches for 111 yards and one touchdown.\nOn top of that, before Josh Norman left with a rib injury , the cornerback lit into Kelce, knocking him down hard. It looked vicious. But the tight end popped back up like it was nothing and applauded . That was before the Chiefs had scored a point, and it set a tone that would resonate the rest of the game.\nLoser: Marcus Peters had a bad game in victory\nMarcus Peters is one of the NFL\u2019s best young cornerbacks. That\u2019s not up for debate. Heading into Monday night\u2019s game, he had 15 career interceptions in 35 career games, and according to Nathan Jahnke of Pro Football Focus he hadn\u2019t given up two touchdowns in a game since his first NFL game.\nThat all changed against the Redskins. After getting toasted by Pryor on the game\u2019s opening drive , Peters was burned a second time in the red zone when he gave up his second touchdown of the game, this time to Ryan Grant. In a mostly clean game by both teams, Peters\u2019 poor play was not only surprising but significant in terms of the way things played out.\nThankfully for the Chiefs, it did not cost them the game.\nWinner: Vernon Davis turns back the clock\nWith a 69-yard reception that set up the Redskins in the red zone in the third quarter, Vernon Davis recorded his longest reception since 2009. Taking on a larger role for the second week in a row due to Jordan Reed\u2019s injury, Davis came up huge for Washington right when the team needed a big boost. The Chiefs had just taken their first lead of the game the drive before Davis\u2019 long catch and run, but it was very short-lived due to the speedy veteran.\nLoser: Jay Gruden, why doth thou neglect Chris Thompson so?\nLast weekend when Washington took Oakland to task, running back Chris Thompson was the engine that drove Jay Gruden\u2019s offense. He totaled 188 yards, rushing for 38 yards on eight carries and catching six passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. The weekend before that during Washington\u2019s big win over the Los Angeles Rams, Thompson rushed for 77 yards on three carries and two touchdowns, adding another 29 yards on three catches.\nSo, this is a guy who had a pivotal role in each of the team\u2019s two wins this year. A guy who totaled 294 yards and three touchdowns in those two wins.\nDuring the team\u2019s first loss, Thompson only touched the ball seven times. On Monday night, it was back to that very number once again. And this time around, Thompson was targeted just twice in the passing game and came down with one catch for four yards.\nGruden essentially kept his greatest offensive weapon in the sheath for the entire second half. In a game that literally came down to the final seconds, we thought we\u2019d highlight this glaring lapse of reason.\nRelated slideshow: Best of the NFL season (Provided by photo services)\n2017-18

Butker\u2019s kick put the Chiefs up 23-20, and Kansas City added a touchdown as time expired when linebacker Justin Houston returned a fumbled lateral.\nButker also made 26- and 32-yard attempts earlier in the second half.\nHe missed the first attempt of his career when he pulled a 46-yarder wide left just before halftime. With hindsight, Butker can see that miss as a blessing.\nMore: Late scoring flurry allows Chiefs to stay unbeaten by beating Redskins 29-20\nMore: Chiefs' Alex Smith keeps answering questions one win at a time\nMore: 40 things we learned in Week 4 of the 2017 NFL season\nIt happened in the same end zone as his game-winning kick, from nearly an identical distance, and under similar wind conditions.\n\u201cI knew the ball was going to move, so that allowed me to aim right-middle for the second kick. I think everything happens for a reason,\u201d Butker said. \u201cI missed that kick, but I came back and I was more experienced going that way, more experienced with the wind, and I was able to handle it.\u201d\nButker, who said he kicked two short game-winning field goals in 2014 for Georgia Tech, was in his apartment in Charlotte, where he was a member of the Carolina Panthers\u2019 practice squad, on Monday when his agent called and told him he was heading to Kansas City. He was able to practice three times with his new teammates, even if he didn\u2019t get to know many of them outside of punter Dustin Colquitt, whom Butker knew from an offseason kicking academy, and long snapper James Winchester.\nAfter Butker\u2019s miss in the second quarter, it was Colquitt, a 13-year veteran, who gave the rookie a pep talk that boosted Butker\u2019s spirits, so much so that in critical situations late in the fourth quarter, Reid had no qualms in trusting Butker to make his kicks.\n\u201cI was confident because he was confident,\u201d Reid said.\nRelated Slideshow: Best

It's been wiped out,\" Trump said last week. \"Nobody has ever seen anything like it.\"\nThe trip will be Trump's fourth to a region battered by storms during an unusually violent hurricane season that has also seen parts of Texas, Florida, Louisiana and the U.S. Virgin Islands inundated by floodwaters and whipped by winds.\n\u00a9 AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar Baseball Hall of Fame outfielder Roberto Clemente's team, the Pittsburgh Pirates collects donations outside PNC Park in Pittsburgh for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico, Monday, Oct. 2, 2017. Trump and first lady Melania Trump are scheduled to attend briefings and meet with Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, as well as the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. They'll also meet with Navy and Marine Corps personnel on the flight Deck of the USS Kearsarge.\nEven before the storm hit on Sept. 20, Puerto Rico was in dire condition thanks to a decade-long economic recession that had left its infrastructure, including the island's power lines, in a sorry state. Maria was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in nearly a century and unleashed floods and mudslides that knocked out the island's entire electrical grid and telecommunications, along with many roads.\nNearly two weeks later, 95 percent of electricity customers remain without power, including some hospitals. And much of the countryside is still struggling to access basic necessities, including food, fresh water and cash.\nTrump and other administration officials have worked in recent days to reassure Americans that recovery efforts are going well and combat the perception that the president failed to fully grasp the magnitude of the storm's destruction in its immediate aftermath.\nWhite House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday the trip would focus on local recovery efforts, \"which we're fully committed to.\"\n\"The top priority for the federal government is certainly to protect the lives and the safety of those in affected areas and provide life-sustaining services as we work together to rebuild their lives,\" she said.\nWhile early response efforts were hampered by logistical challenges, officials say that conditions, especially in the capital, have improved.\nAccording to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there are now more than 10,000 federal officials on the ground on the island, and forty-five percent of customers now have access to drinking water. Businesses are also beginning to re-open, with 60 percent of retail gas stations now up and running.\nFor many, however, that isn't enough. On Monday, the nonprofit Oxfam announced that it would be taking the rare step of intervening in an American disaster, citing its outrage over what it called a \"slow and inadequate response.\"\n___\nFollow Colvin on Twitter at https://twitter.com/colvinj", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Especially if you're looking forward to a long and healthy retirement, waiting to claim Social Security at 70 can help you maximize your overall retirement income from the program.\nYet the most common age to claim Social Security is 62. That's the earliest possible age you can claim retirement benefits, and by claiming at that age, you're locking in the lowest monthly benefits you could receive. That raises a key question of why more people don't wait until age 70 to claim Social Security. Despite the obvious benefit of a higher monthly income from waiting, there are good reasons people claim earlier rather than deferring.\nNo. 1: They really need the money\nAround 62% of retirees get at least half their income from Social Security. With the average retiree benefit at $1,369 per month ($16,428 per year ), that indicates that most retirees would have a total income at or below that level if they didn't claim their benefits. If the ability is there to more than double an otherwise meager income just by signing up, it makes sense to take the money.\nNo. 2: They don't expect to live long enough to make waiting worthwhile\nNot all retirees expect to live a long and healthy life in retirement. Despite the higher monthly check, for a retiree to collect more over your lifetime from waiting until age 70, that retiree will need to survive to somewhere around age 80 to 83 . If health concerns, family history, or lifestyle choices make it unlikely for a retiree to survive long enough to get the benefit of that bigger payment, it simply makes no sense to wait.\nNo. 3: They want money while they're still young enough to enjoy it\nEven for retirees who expect to live a long time, the unfortunate reality is that most of us tend to slow down the older we get. Many retirees would rather have the income boost from a Social Security check sooner, while they're still young and vibrant enough to enjoy the money. If you're largely homebound near the end of your retirement, the increased monthly income probably won't mean as much to you as the memories you could have made by getting your hands on the money earlier.\nNo. 4: They expect benefits through their spouse's work history\nYour Social Security benefit depends on your own earnings history, but if you're married, you may be able to instead claim a benefit up to a level that's half your spouse's. Many couples have one spouse who accrued significantly higher Social Security benefits than the other, which makes it a potentially attractive benefit. Still, unlike a retiree's own benefits, spousal benefits stop increasing at a person's full retirement age instead of at age 70. As a result, it's not worthwhile to wait until 70 for those spousal benefits.\nNo. 5: They're really smart investors\nOnce you retire, you should shift some of your money to bonds to cover your near-term costs of living. How much you'll need to shift depends on how much of your spending you need to cover from your portfolio, as opposed to covering from other income sources such as Social Security.\nThe more costs you need your portfolio to cover, the higher the bond allocation you'll need. By taking Social Security earlier than age 70, you can keep more money in stocks longer, potentially benefiting from the faster compounding that stocks can deliver.\nIt's your retirement, your choice\n\u00a9 Getty Images Senior couple drinking white wine or champaign Unless you have good reason to believe you'll have a shorter or longer life expectancy than the typical American, you'll probably receive about the same throughout your life no matter when you start collecting. As a result, feel free to weigh the trade-offs between collecting earlier and waiting until age 70, and make a decision that looks like it best fits your particular needs.\nSPONSORED: The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook\nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year!

We were just trying to keep people from dying.\"\nAs Sunday night led to Monday morning, the attack became the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history with 59 killed and 527 wounded.\nUniversity Medical Center of Southern Nevada was one of many hospitals that were overflowing.\n\"Every bed was full,\" Coates said. \"We had people in the hallways, people outside and more people coming in.\"\nHe said the huge, horrifying wounds on his operating table that told him it wasn't just the massive numbers that made this shooting different.\n\"It was very clear that the first patient I took back and operated on that this was a high-powered weapon,\" Coates said. \"This wasn't a normal street weapon. This was something that did a lot of damage when it entered the body cavity,\" Coates said.\nHe had seen similar wounds before but \"of course never this many patients,\" he said.\nThe gunman, 64-year-old retired accountant Stephen Paddock, killed himself as authorities stormed his hotel room.\nHe had 23 guns \u2014 some with scopes \u2014 in the room at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino, where he had been staying since Thursday. He knocked out two windows to create sniper's perches he used to rain torrents of bullets on the crowd of 22,000 some 500 yards away, authorities said.\nTwo guns were modified to make them fully automatic, according to two U.S. officials briefed by law enforcement who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still unfolding.\nAt Paddock's home, authorities found 19 more guns, explosives and thousands of rounds of ammunition. Also, several pounds of ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can be turned into explosives, were in his car, authorities said.\nAuthorities believe Paddock acted alone. While he appeared to have no criminal history, his father was a bank robber who was on the FBI's most-wanted list in the 1960s.\n\"I can't even make something up,\" his brother in Florida, Eric Paddock, said when asked what might have motivated his brother. \"There's just nothing.\"\nLas Vegas shooting Slideshow by photo services\nAuthorities also had nothing to say about Paddock's motive.\n\"I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,\" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said.\nAt the concert, headliner Jason Aldean had just started his set shortly after 10 p.m. to close out the three-day Route 91 Harvest Festival when bullets started hitting people.\nIn the crowd there was gunfire, but no gunman. Some figured out where it was coming from through the cracks and muzzle flashes.\n\"It was the craziest stuff I've ever seen in my entire life,\" said Kodiak Yazzie, 36. \"You could hear that the noise was coming from west of us, from Mandalay Bay. You could see a flash, flash, flash, flash.\"\nPaddock appeared to fire unhindered for more than 10 minutes, according to radio traffic, as police frantically tried to locate him.\n\"We can't worry about the victims,\" an officer said on radio at 10:15 p.m. \"We need to stop the shooter before we have more victims. Anybody have eyes on him ... stop the shooter.\"\nThe crowd, funneled tightly into a wide-open space, had little cover and no easy way to escape. Victims fell to the ground, while others fled in panic. Some hid behind concession stands or crawled under parked cars.\nFaces were etched with shock and confusion, and people wept and wailed. Some of the injured were hit by shrapnel. Others were trampled or were injured jumping fences.\n\"It was chaos \u2014 people just running for their lives. People trying to get down. Trying to get to their loved ones that had gotten hit,\" said Shaun Topper. \"It was just, you know. It was chaos.\"\nMarie Langer, 16, of Las Vegas, got to the concert early so she could get to the very front of the venue, closest to the stage.\nThat meant she and her friends were among the last to get out, and could hear shots ringing and people screaming the entire time she was trying to flee. She finally had to climb a fence with points on the top of metal bars designed to prevent people from getting over it.\n\"We had no other option,\" she said.\n\u00a9 The Associated Press Mandalay Bay resort and casino towers over the festival area. Tales of heroism and compassion emerged quickly: One man grasped the hand of a dying stranger as the man died, unable to pull himself away despite the danger. Another borrowed a flannel shirt from a man he didn't know to create a tourniquet for a girl he didn't know.\nCouples held hands as they ran. The healthy carried the bleeding off the grounds. Strangers drove victims to hospitals in their own cars.\nBodies covered in white sheets were still being removed from the festival grounds more than 12 hours after the massacre, and the scene was covered with the abandoned bags and belongings of those who fled.\nCoates, the trauma surgeon, said it was not for lack of preparation that lives were lost, though with smaller numbers they might have saved more.\n\"I will tell you that everybody that should have lived, lived,\" Coates said. \"The ones that we lost, I think if they had been the only patients coming through the door that we would have been able to save them.\"\nAuthorities put out a call for blood donations and set up a hotline to report missing people and speed the identification of the dead and wounded. They also opened a \"family reunification center\" for people to find loved ones.\nWorld leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull sent condolence messages to President Donald Trump.\nBefore Sunday, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history took place in June 2016, when a gunman who professed support for Muslim extremist groups opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 people. Historically, the United States has had a number of mass shootings surpassing Sunday's attack. For example, more than 100 black people were gunned down during a mass shooting in Colfax, Louisiana, in 1873.\nSally Ho, Regina Garcia Cano and Brian Skoloff in Las Vegas; Brian Melley and Andrew Dalton in Los Angeles; Sadie Gurman and Tami Abdollah in Washington; and Kristin M.

shooting", "text": "As Las Vegas grieves, investigators struggle to uncover motive behind shooting The Washington Post 55 mins ago Lynh Bui, Mark Berman, Matt Zapotosky Las Vegas shooting Slideshow by photo services\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Investigators struggled Tuesday with a chilling but baffling array of clues in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history \u2014 including a hotel room arsenal fit for a commando team \u2014 yet were still left trying to grasp the chain of events that caused a 64-year-old retiree to turn a concert ground into a killing field.\n\u201cI can\u2019t get into the mind of a psychopath,\u201d said Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, on Monday.\nAt the same time, the probes stretched from a ranch-style home near the Arizona border to the 32nd-floor hotel suite used by Stephen Paddock as a place to scan the crowds at a country music festival and then open fire \u2014 leaving at least 59 people dead and hundreds more injured in the rain of bullets or trampled in the panicked rush for cover late Sunday. He then killed himself as police closed.\nAnd once again, a stunned nation was left to grapple with enduring issues over gun control and gun violence. The White House and many Republicans insisted it was a time to mourn rather than launch into political battles. But some Democrats renewed calls for gun safety legislation, and late-night comedy hosts turned somber.\nJimmy Kimmel was in tears at the start of his monologue Monday night as he spoke of the \u201cterrible, inexplicable, shocking and painful tragedy\u201d in his hometown Las Vegas.\nThe massacre was possibly in the planning stages for days.\nLas Vegas shooting victims Slideshow by photo services\nPolice said Paddock arrived on Thursday at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino overlooking the Vegas Strip. He aroused no suspicion from hotel staff as he surrounded himself with stunning firepower in two rooms: 23 guns, some with scopes. One of the weapons he apparently used in the attack was an AK-47 type rifle, with a stand used to steady it for firing, people familiar with the case said.\nAuthorities said a sweep of law enforcement databases showed Paddock had no known run-ins with police. He was the son of a bank robber who was once on the FBI wanted list. But investigators have turned up no clear links to any underworld gangs or international terrorist groups \u2014 despite a claim by the Islamic State that Paddock carried out the carnage in its name.\nAmong the questions they have: How a former accountant with a penchant for high-stakes gambling obtained a weapon that sounded to those on the ground like it could fire as an automatic, and how he was able to bring it and many other weapons into a Vegas hotel suite undetected.\nInvestigators believe at least one of the guns functioned as if it were fully automatic, and they are now trying to determine if he modified it or other weapons to be capable of spitting out a high volume of fire just by holding down the trigger, people familiar with the case said.\nClick to expand Replay Video UP NEXT New details emerge about victims in Las Vegas The names and stories of some of the victims of Sunday's Las Vegas shooting are coming to light following the massacre.

CBS New York Las Vegas shooting: Investigators search for a motive Authorities are now digging into the recent past of 64-year-old Stephen Paddock as they attempt to understand what drove him to kill 59 people and injure more than 500 in the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history.

Guns & Guitars, a store in Mesquite, Nev., said in a statement that Paddock purchased some of his weapons there, but employees followed all procedures required by law, and Paddock \u201cnever gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time.\u201d Lombardo said Paddock also seemed to have purchased guns in Arizona.\nInvestigators also found at least 19 additional firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition and the chemical tannerite, an explosive, at Paddock\u2019s home in Mesquite, Nev. They also found ammonium nitrate, a chemical that can be used in bomb-making, in Paddock\u2019s vehicle, Lombardo said.\nMore than 22,000 people had been at the Route 91 Harvest festival, a three-day country music concert with grounds across the street from the Mandalay Bay resort, when the shooting began about 10 p.m. Sunday, according to police. As country star Jason Aldean played what was expected to be one of the last sets of the night, Paddock opened fire \u2014 his bullets flying from a window on the casino\u2019s golden facade, which Paddock had smashed with some type of hammer.\n\u201cPeople were getting shot at while we were running, and people were on the ground bleeding, crying and screaming. We just had to keep going,\u201d said Dinora Merino, 28, a dealer at the Ellis Island casino who was at the concert with a friend. \u201cThere are tents out there and there\u2019s no place to hide. It\u2019s just an open field.\u201d\nThe death toll in Las Vegas was massive, surpassing the 49 people slain by a gunman in Orlando in June 2016. That shooter, who later said he was inspired by the Islamic State, opened fire inside a crowded nightclub. And Lombardo said the number of dead from Sunday\u2019s concert shooting could rise, as an additional 527 were thought to have been injured.\nThe dead included a behavioral therapist who was soon to be married, a nursing assistant from Southern California, a commercial fisherman and an off-duty Las Vegas city police officer. Two other officers who were on duty were injured, police said; one was in stable condition after surgery, and the other sustained minor injuries. Another off-duty officer with the Bakersfield Police Department in Southern California also sustained non-life threatening injuries, according to a statement from the department.\nSyed Saquib, a surgeon on duty Sunday night at University Medical Center, said the hospital treated 104 patients, most of whom had gunshot wounds.\n\u201cThose that could be saved, were saved,\u201d Saquib said. \u201cThere were a few that came in with devastating, non-survivable injuries.\u201d\nPolice and hotel security ultimately scoured several floors of the hotel looking for the shooter and came upon Paddock\u2019s suite, Lombardo said. At some point, Paddock fired through the door and hit a security guard in the leg, he said, adding that the guard is expected to survive. SWAT officers ultimately stormed the room and some fired shots, though Paddock is believed to have killed himself, Lombardo said. He was not counted in the death toll that authorities reported.\nPresident Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday. He praised the \u201cmiraculous\u201d speed with which local law enforcement responded to the shooting \u2014 asserting that their actions saved lives \u2014 though he noted that hundreds were still mourning the loss of loved ones. Answers for them, he said, would \u201cnot come easy.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an act of pure evil,\u201d Trump said during remarks from the White House.\nSteve Sisolak, Clark County Commission Chair from Las Vegas, praised the police for their quick response and commended the outpouring of support from the community; more than 25,000 people have donated to a fundraising effort for victims and people have been waiting eight hours in line to donate blood, he said.\n\u201cLas Vegas will never be quite the same as a result of this,\u201d Sisolak said. But, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nEric Paddock, Stephen Paddock\u2019s brother, said he was stunned to learn that his brother could be responsible for such violence.\nStephen Paddock had no history of mental illness nor did he have problems with drugs or alcohol, Eric Paddock said, noting that his brother was a high-stakes gambler, sometimes wagering hundreds of dollars on a single hand of video poker.\nWhen he spoke to the FBI, Eric Paddock said he showed agents three years of text messages from his brother, including one that mentioned winning $250,000 at a casino. A federal law enforcement official said investigators had reviewed reports suggesting Paddock engaged in high-dollar gambling, and they are trying to determine whether he faced financial strains.\nEric Paddock said his brother was \u201cwealthy,\u201d in part because he had no children to support. Stephen Paddock had worked in the past as an accountant, and he had real estate investments in the Orlando area, Eric Paddock said.\nPolice said they believe Paddock was a \u201clone wolf\u201d attacker, though they were still interested in speaking more with a woman named Marilou Danley who lived with him in Mesquite, Nev., a little more than an hour outside of Las Vegas on the Arizona border. Danley, Paddock\u2019s 62-year-old girlfriend, was found outside the country \u2014 as of Monday afternoon, in Tokyo \u2014 and was not involved in the shooting.\n\u201cWe still consider her a person of interest,\u201d Lombardo said Monday. He said investigators also are exploring a report that Paddock attended a different music festival in September.\nNot long after the shooting, the Islamic State claimed responsibility, though law enforcement authorities were quick to reject that assertion. \u201cWe have determined, to this point, no connection with an international terrorist group,\u201d Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Las Vegas, said at a news briefing.\nThe FBI had a previous dealing with the Paddock family, though it did not initially seem to involve Stephen. Eric Paddock said his father was Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, a convicted bank robber and con-man described in a wanted poster as \u201cpsychopathic\u2019\u2019 with suicidal tendencies. But Eric Paddock said that his father, who escaped from prison in 1969 and was at one point on the FBI\u2019s list of most-sought-after and dangerous criminals, was not around during their childhood. Benjamin Paddock was apprehended in 1978, according to news reports.\nRelatives said Stephen Paddock, a licensed pilot who owned two airplanes, was a quiet man who often went to Las Vegas to gamble and view concerts. In a statement, Lockheed Martin, the defense giant, said that Paddock worked for them for three years in the 1980s.\nA former neighbor of Stephen Paddock\u2019s recalled that his home in a 55-and-over community in Florida looked more akin to a college freshman\u2019s dorm, with nothing on the walls and only a few pieces of furniture.\n\u201cOne of the first times we met him, he told me he lived there, in Vegas,\u201d Don Judy, his next-door neighbor in the community until two years ago, recalled. \u201cHe explained that he was a gambler, and a prospector. He said he was buying this house to check it out for his mother \u2026 and that if she liked it, he planned to buy another next door with a floor plan like ours.\u201d\nSoon, Judy said, Paddock put up a for-sale sign and was gone, saying that he was moving back to Las Vegas.\nZapotosky and Berman reported from Washington.

The White House said Monday afternoon it was \u201cpremature\u201d to talk about gun control.\n\u201cThere will be certainly time for that policy discussion to take place, but that\u2019s not the place that we\u2019re in at this moment,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday. \u201cBut certainly, I think that there\u2019s a time for that to happen.\u201d\n\u00a9 AP Photo/Brynn Anderson Former White House strategist Steve Bannon speaks at a rally for U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore, Monday, Sept. 25, 2017, in Fairhope, Ala.\nThis article was written by Nicole Lafond from Talking Points Memo and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

deaths from Sunday night's mass shooting at a Las Vegas country music concert was 23-year-old Jordan McIldoon. His final minutes were spent in the arms of a total stranger who never left his side, reports CBS News' Adriana Diaz.\n\"It's what you see on TV and it's never going to be you. It's never going to happen to you. And it was happening,\" said Heather Gooze. She was working as a bartender at the concert and escaped the gunfire. But McIldoon who, according to his Facebook page, lived in Canada and worked in construction, did not. He was among the seriously wounded Gooze held.\n\"His fingers were kind of wrapped on my hand. His hand kind of squeezed a little bit, and then just, like, went loose,\" Gooze said. Gooze was able to call McIldoon's girlfriend, who was sheltering in place nearby.\n\"She said, 'Be honest with me, like, what's going on?' And I said 'He didn't make it.' She said to me, 'You know, he's the love of my life, like, are you sure?' I said, 'Yes.'\"\nThere were dozens of stories like McIldoon's Sunday night. People with little in common except for being caught in the crosshairs of a killer. Sonny Melton of Tennessee reportedly was running with his wife to safety when he was shot and killed. Charleston Hartfield was a 34-year-old Las Vegas police officer off-duty at the time of the shooting. Angela Gomez was a cheerleader from California.\nLas Vegas shooting victims Slideshow by photo services\nRachel Parker worked for the police department in Manhattan Beach, California. Teacher Sandy Casey was remembered by her partner as a woman who, \"lived life to the fullest and made me the happiest man in the world.\"\n\"I'm connected to him now my whole life,\" Gooze said of McIldoon. She stayed with his body for more than four hours. \"I would hope somebody would do it for me. I would hope that they wouldn't let me be alone,\" Gooze said.\nGooze says she's not a hero \u2014 those are the people who ran in to save lives. While she may not have saved a life, she did save a family from the agony of waiting hours to find out their loved one's fate.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.cbsnews.com/news/las-vegas-shooting-victims-identified-additional-names-latest/?ftag=MSF0951a18", "https://www.cbsnews.com/feature/las-vegas-shooting/?ftag=MSF0951a18", "http://www.cbsnews.com/?ftag=MSF0951a18"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jordan mcildoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcildoon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charleston hartfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angela gomez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather gooze", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sonny melton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel parker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adriana diaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy casey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gooze", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cbs news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bs interactive inc.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan beach", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:55:51.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d0972827be715730d6670aa03268a08f06a2f29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KfQnG75Vo._tkaP6vW43pNbUMHu0hfg8vzkLmFRSWLyBjosscGvuuPeDFIEfNze8e51f4QBuPsIxZ867NtCH54hAZeapNigriAG.v7V5xDB8heX0SiUO98g--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Nobel prize cites finding of ripples in fabric of universe", "title_full": "Nobel prize cites finding of ripples in fabric of universe", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 364, "comments": 0, "shares": 364}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d0972827be715730d6670aa03268a08f06a2f29", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFWQaF2jSMz6KfQnG75Vo._tkaP6vW43pNbUMHu0hfg8vzkLmFRSWLyBjosscGvuuPeDFIEfNze8e51f4QBuPsIxZ867NtCH54hAZeapNigriAG.v7V5xDB8heX0SiUO98g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "msn.com", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nobel prize cites finding of ripples in fabric of universe", "text": "Nobel prize cites finding of ripples in fabric of universe Associated Press 25 mins ago Click to expand Replay Video UP NEXT New details emerge about victims in Las Vegas The names and stories of some of the victims of Sunday's Las Vegas shooting are coming to light following the massacre.

When the discovery was announced several months later, it was a sensation not only among scientists but the general public.\nThe scientists were honored for a combination of highly advanced theory and ingenious equipment design.\n\"It's a win for the human race as a whole. These gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe,\" said Thorne, speaking by phone with The Associated Press from California shortly after the announcement.\nAriel Goobar of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the winners' work meant \"we can study processes which were completely impossible, out of reach to us in the past.\" \"The best comparison is when Galileo discovered the telescope, which allowed us to see that Jupiter had moons and all of a sudden we discovered that the universe was much vaster than we used to think about,\" Goobar said.\nWith the technology that the three developed \"We may even see entirely new objects that we haven't even imagined yet,\" said Patrick Sutton, an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales.\n\u00a9 Molly Riley/AFP/Getty Images Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, who won the Nobel Physics Prize 2017 for gravitational waves. Weiss, in a phone call with the announcement news conference at the Swedish academy, said \"I view this more as a thing that recognizes the work of a thousand people.\" Gravitational waves are extremely faint ripples in the fabric of space and time, generated by some of the most violent events in the universe.\nThe waves detected by the laureates came from the collision of two black holes some 1.3 billion light-years away. A light-year is about 5.88 trillion miles.\nThe waves were predicted by Einstein a century ago as part of his theory of general relativity. General relativity says that gravity is caused by heavy objects bending space-time, which itself is the four-dimensional way that astronomers see the universe.\nThe prize is \"a win for Einstein, and a very big one,\" Barish told the AP.\nThe German-born Weiss was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount and Thorne and Barish will split the other half.\nWeiss in the 1970s designed a laser-based device that would detect gravitational waves. He, Thorne and Barish \"ensured that four decades of effort led to gravitational waves finally being observed,\" the Nobel announcement said.\nThe laser device, called an interferometer, must be both exquisitely precise and extremely stable. \"The beam must hit the mirrors precisely. They should hardly shake at all, not even when leaves fall from nearby trees,\" according to a prize background paper.\nThe announcement said Einstein was convinced that gravitational waves could never be measured. The laureates used laser devices \"to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus.\"\nIn a moment of poetry aimed at making the distant and infinitesimal phenomenon understandable to non-experts, the academy announcement said gravitational waves \"are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other.\"\nFor the past 25 years, the physics prize has been shared among multiple winners.\nLast year's prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids.\n___\nBob Lentz in Philadelphia, Michelle Moore in Phoenix, Arizona and science writer Malcolm Ritter

ago MOHD RASFAN \u00a9 Provided by AFP Royal Malaysian Police escort Vietnamese defendant Doan Thi Huong (2nd L) after her trial at the Shah Alam High Court in Shah Alam, outside Kuala Lumpur on October 2, 2017, for her alleged role in the assassination of Kim Jong-Nam The half-brother of North Korea's leader suffered extensive organ damage after being attacked with a nerve agent, a pathologist said Tuesday, as more chilling details emerged at the trial of his alleged killers.\nVital organs, including his lungs and brain, swelled due to a build-up of fluid, testified Mohamad Shah Mahmood, who carried out the post-mortem on Kim Jong-Nam.\nTwo women are on trial accused of attacking Kim Jong-Un's estranged relative with the deadly nerve agent VX at Kuala Lumpur airport on February 13, in an assassination that shocked the world.\nHe died an agonising death about 20 minutes after the VX, a chemical so deadly it is listed as a weapon of mass destruction, was rubbed on his face.\nIndonesian Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, who were arrested a few days after the killing, have pleaded not guilty to the murder.\nThe defendants, who face death by hanging if convicted, say they were duped into believing they were taking part in a prank for a reality TV show. Their lawyers blame North Korean agents.\nSouth Korea has accused the North of ordering the hit but Pyongyang denies the allegations.\nThe charge sheet blames Kim's death on the women along with four other people still at large, who are not named. Four North Korean suspects fled Malaysia on the day of the murder.\n\u00a9 Provided by AFP A police convoy carrying the two defendants leaves court after the first day of their trial on Monday On the second day of proceedings Tuesday, Mohamad Shah described to the Sham Alam High Court, outside Kuala Lumpur, how he carried out the post-mortem.\n\"The overall findings showed congestion of the organs and swelling of the lungs,\" he said, using the medical term which refers to an excessive accumulation of body fluid.\nParts of the brain, the liver and spleen were among organs affected, he added.\nHe said the weight of Kim's right lung had increased to 690 grams (24 ounces), above the average for an adult lung.\nFrom the examination, he concluded that Kim had \"died due to VX poisoning\".\nA post-mortem report submitted as evidence to the trial showed that VX was found not just on Kim's face and eyes but also in his blood and urine, and on his clothes and luggage.\nEarlier, a chemical pathologist who examined a sample of Kim's blood testified it showed very low levels of an enzyme vital for his nervous system to function, a condition which could have been caused by exposure to poison.\nThe pathologist, Nur Ashikin Othman, said Kim had a level of 344 units per litre, far below the usual level for men. But tests on the two suspects showed their levels were normal.\nThe murder sparked a furious diplomatic row between North Korea and Malaysia, which had been one of Pyongyang's few allies amid global outrage over its atomic weapons programme.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim jong-nam", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mohamad shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nur ashikin othman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doan thi huong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamad shah mahmood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siti aisyah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah alam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "afp", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "sham alam high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "royal malaysian police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah alam high court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:56:05.032+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01071223468f4321d273844536241c9983cf2d7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkhgOvzh1i0QagxC20DqPaV0.Lzd.kcbNWNkCWDmErGmcmcTwLIVEPWA5d2dmm_OAKvgQyRKb34ISJurt7VdILFAIFTL1HVtvElSw58WHqUwzA58Nk30JehA--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5", "title_full": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "01071223468f4321d273844536241c9983cf2d7d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkhgOvzh1i0QagxC20DqPaV0.Lzd.kcbNWNkCWDmErGmcmcTwLIVEPWA5d2dmm_OAKvgQyRKb34ISJurt7VdILFAIFTL1HVtvElSw58WHqUwzA58Nk30JehA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Grey Papke", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5", "text": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5 Larry Brown Sports 10 hrs ago Grey Papke Click to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Las Vegas survivor: Why do I get to live?

As such, the polls have done a bit of settling, and there have not been a huge amount of changes to the rankings since this time last week.\nStill, there are a few gripes throughout the top 25 and beyond. Here\u2019s a list of eight items from both the AP and Coaches Poll that the voters should have taken a second look at.\nCoaches should have Georgia in the top five\nGeorgia got a two-spot bump this week, moving to No. 5 in the AP Poll and No. 6 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll. The AP got this one right \u2014 Georgia\u2019s 41-0 drubbing away from home at Tennessee was enough to catapult the Bulldogs past Washington and into the top five. The Bulldogs have won at Notre Dame, too, and while the Volunteers are having a hugely disappointing season, it\u2019s not exactly a foregone conclusion for anyone to walk in there and win 41-0. The coaches still have the Bulldogs at No. 6, a spot behind Washington in the rankings. Those two should be flipped around.\nWisconsin\u2019s perplexing jump in the Coaches\u2019 Poll\nWisconsin is No. 9 in the AP and No. 8 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll, sitting one spot ahead of Ohio State in both. But the coaches gave Wisconsin a two-spot bump, vaulting them ahead of the Buckeyes.\nThe Badgers beat Northwestern on Saturday, but they were on upset alert for much of the game. They have not looked as good as Penn State, whom they deservedly sit behind despite both having unbeaten records. The same goes for how they compare with Michigan. Ohio State? The Buckeyes have a loss, at home against Oklahoma, but their victories have been accomplished in more impressive fashion than Wisconsin\u2019s so far. Yes, the Badgers have the better record, but the Buckeyes have looked like the superior team recently.\nVirginia Tech should be below Louisville\u2026\nThe Hokies predictably fell after losing in rather meek fashion to Clemson at home. They dropped four spots in the AP poll to No. 16 and seven spots to No. 19 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll. The writers still kept VT above a Louisville team (ranked No. 17) that lost by more to the Tigers, but did so on the road. Perhaps that was the deciding factor, but the Cardinals, buoyed by Lamar Jackson, look to be hitting their stride once more. Louisville and Virginia Tech are very close in stature, but the Cardinals should get a slight edge based on talent.\n\u2026but the coaches punished the Hokies too much\nOn the other hand, Virginia Tech shouldn\u2019t be hit too hard for losing to Clemson, who are, at minimum, one of the three best teams in the nation. The coaches hit them hard, dropping them from No. 12 to No. 19 for the loss. The Hokies may have been a bit overrated to begin with, and it\u2019s good that they\u2019re still in the top 20. Inching them up a couple of spots to the No. 17 spot or so would be a fairer reflection on where Virginia Tech is at this point, though we like that they have Louisville ahead of them.\nSan Diego State might be slightly overrated by the writers\nThe Aztecs defeated Northern Illinois by only six points at home, escaping both an upset and some unwarranted poking . Even though San Diego State sits at 5-0, their latest victory wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s most impressive win. That did not stop the writers from keeping them at No. 19 in this week\u2019s poll \u2014 slightly higher than the No. 21 spot the coaches pegged them at. That mark is more fair; the Aztecs are a top 25 team, but not a top 20 one, at least not until they get a better win, or a more convincing set of victories.\nHow is Florida State the first team out of the Coaches\u2019 Poll?\nThe Seminoles haven\u2019t shown anything to merit a top 25 vote at this point. They finally grabbed their first win of the season \u2014 a 26-19 victory at Wake Forest. Wake is a team that preseason prognosticators would have had FSU beating easily at the start of the season, with or without Deondre Francois. Despite this, Florida State fell just six points shy of returning to the top 25 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll, which is absurd. They\u2019re also the second team out in the AP Poll. This team should be nowhere near the rankings until they show a lot more.\nFlorida still isn\u2019t a top-20 team\nThe Gators (21/20) got past Vanderbilt at home on Saturday with another unimpressive win in a season filling with them. They weren\u2019t rewarded or punished, which is fair, but the problem remains that they were overrated to begin with, particularly by the coaches, who have them at No. 20. Florida is not a top 20 team. They have done nothing to demonstrate that they are a top 20 team. Their best win is over a Tennessee team that looks increasingly terrible. They deserve their ranking \u2014 barely \u2014 but they remain too high.\nSouth Florida gets a bit too much credit from the coaches\nUSF put up 61 on East Carolina on Saturday to move to 5-0, lifting them to No. 16 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll. That puts them above the likes of Louisville, Utah, and Virginia Tech. South Florida\u2019s problem is the same one that plagues many Group of Five powers \u2014 no great wins, and no real opportunities to get them. If the Bulls continue to run the table, they\u2019ll get rewarded in turn, but for now, other teams have more impressive resumes. They have earned their place in the top 20, but the coaches have them a bit too high.\nRelated slideshow: 2017 college football season (Provided by photo services)\n2017 college football season",

shooting rampage", "text": "Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock was a high-stakes gambler who 'kept to himself' before massacre The Washington Post 54 mins ago Tim Craig, Mark Berman, Matt Zapotosky Las Vegas shooting victims Slideshow by photo services\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 Investigators struggled Tuesday with a chilling but baffling array of clues in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history as they sought to determine the chain of events that caused a 64-year-old to gun down concertgoers from his hotel suite overlooking the Las Vegas Strip.\nSubscribe to the Post Most newsletter: Today\u2019s most popular stories on The Washington Post\n\u201cI can\u2019t get into the mind of a psychopath,\u201d said Joseph Lombardo, the sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, on Monday.\nAt the same time, the probes stretched from a ranch-style home near the Arizona border to the 32nd-floor hotel suite used by Stephen Paddock as a place to scan the crowds at a country music festival and then open fire \u2014 leaving at least 59 people dead and hundreds more injured in the rain of bullets or trampled in the panicked rush for cover late Sunday. He then killed himself as SWAT officers closed in.\nOnce again, a stunned nation was left to grapple with a city riven by tragedy and a resurgent debate over gun control and gun violence. The White House and many Republicans said it was a time to mourn rather than launch into political battles, while some Democrats renewed calls for gun safety legislation.\nLombardo warned that the number of dead in Las Vegas could rise, as an additional 527 were thought to have been injured. Hospitals across the region continued to treat patients from the scene, many of them seriously injured. Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center said that as of Tuesday morning, it had 68 patients from the rampage, 33 of them in critical condition.\nWhile the nation learned more about the lives cut brutally short as well as the heroic actions of people on the ground, few answers were available as to what, if anything, may have motivated the rampage.\nAuthorities described a level of preparation that suggested the massacre was planned in advance. Police said Paddock arrived on Thursday, three days before the shooting, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip. He took more than 10 suitcases into his suite, officials said.\nPaddock aroused no suspicion from hotel staff even as he brought in 23 guns, some of them with scopes. One of the weapons he apparently used in the attack was an AK-47 type rifle, with a stand used to steady it for firing, people familiar with the case said.\nOfficials recovered another 19 guns as well as thousands of rounds of ammunition and the chemical tannerite, an explosive, at Paddock\u2019s home in Mesquite, Nev. They also found ammonium nitrate, a chemical that can be used in bombmaking, in Paddock\u2019s vehicle, Lombardo said.\nPaddock apparently used remote video cameras linked to a tablet in order to keep an eye out for police storming his hotel room, according to two people close to the investigation, who asked not to be identified discussing the ongoing probe.\nThe idea was apparently to be able to have a security perimeter behind him while he fired down on the crowd \u2013 another indication of the planning and forethought Paddock put into the attack. Such a setup would have made it easier for Paddock to know when he was close to being captured.\nLas Vegas shooting Slideshow by photo services\nWhen police breached his hotel room door and stormed inside, they found him already dead, with blood spread out behind him, mixed in with the empty shell casings on the carpet. He had apparently pointed a silver, black-handled revolver into his mouth and pulled the trigger.\nBefore that, police and hotel security had scoured several floors of the hotel looking for the shooter and came upon Paddock\u2019s suite, Lombardo said. At some point, Paddock fired through the door and hit a security guard in the leg, he said, adding that the guard is expected to survive.\nPaddock had purchased weapons legally over a period of years, from local stores near his homes and from major retailers, like Cabela\u2019s, according to law enforcement officials.\nGuns & Guitars, a store in Mesquite, Nev., said in a statement that Paddock purchased some of his weapons there, but employees followed all procedures required by law, and Paddock \u201cnever gave any indication or reason to believe he was unstable or unfit at any time.\u201d Lombardo said Paddock also seemed to have purchased guns in Arizona.\nInvestigators believe at least one of Paddock\u2019s guns functioned as if it were fully automatic, and they are now trying to determine if he modified it or other weapons to be capable of spitting out a high volume of fire just by holding down the trigger, people familiar with the case said.\nAuthorities said a sweep of law enforcement databases showed that before the rampage, Paddock had no known run-ins with police. He was the son of a bank robber who was once on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list, but investigators turned up no clear links to any criminal enterprises or international terrorist groups \u2014 despite repeated claims by the Islamic State that Paddock carried out the carnage in its name.\nPolice said they believe Paddock was a \u201clone wolf\u201d attacker, though they were still interested in speaking more with a woman named Marilou Danley who lived with him in Mesquite, Nev., a little more than an hour outside of Las Vegas on the Arizona border.\nDanley, Paddock\u2019s 62-year-old girlfriend, was found outside the country \u2014 as of Monday afternoon, in Tokyo \u2014 and was not involved in the shooting.\n\u201cWe still consider her a person of interest,\u201d Lombardo said Monday. He said investigators also are exploring a report that Paddock attended a different music festival in September.\nPeople close to the investigation said that in the weeks before the attack, Paddock transferred a large amount of money \u2013 something close to $100,000 \u2013 to someone in the Philippines, possibly his girlfriend.\nThe rampage Sunday targeted the Route 91 Harvest festival, a three-day country music concert with grounds across the street from the Mandalay Bay Resort. When the gunfire began Sunday at about 10:08 p.m., some 22,000 people were there, according to police. Country star Jason Aldean was playing what was expected to be one of the last sets of the night as Paddock opened fire, his bullets flying from a window on the casino\u2019s golden facade, which Paddock had smashed with some type of hammer.\n\u201cPeople were getting shot at while we were running, and people were on the ground bleeding, crying and screaming. We just had to keep going,\u201d said Dinora Merino, 28, a dealer at the Ellis Island casino who was at the concert with a friend. \u201cThere are tents out there and there\u2019s no place to hide. It\u2019s just an open field.\u201d\nThe dead included a behavioral therapist who was soon to be married, a nursing assistant from Southern California, a commercial fisherman and an off-duty Las Vegas city police officer. Two other officers who were on duty were injured, police said; one was in stable condition after surgery, and the other sustained minor injuries. Another off-duty officer with the Bakersfield Police Department in Southern California also sustained non-life-threatening injuries, according to a statement from the department.\nSyed Saquib, a surgeon on duty Sunday night at University Medical Center, said the hospital treated 104 patients, most of whom had gunshot wounds.\n\u201cThose that could be saved, were saved,\u201d Saquib said. \u201cThere were a few that came in with devastating, non-survivable injuries.\u201d\nJohn Soqui drove seven hours from Arizona to see his 29-year-old niece, who had been shot in the head. Jovanna Martinez-Calzadillas, from suburban Phoenix, had been attending the concert with her husband, a military police officer, Soqui said. Her husband, who was not injured, carried Martinez-Calzadillas away from the concert after she had been shot, relatives said.\n\u201cThere is just so much hate in this world, and she is my little niece, and I just want to get the guy who shot her,\u201d said Soqui, 51.\nSoqui then remembered that Paddock had apparently taken his own life before police stormed into his hotel room. \u201cI want to die, kill myself, just so I can get him,\u201d Soqui added. \u201cSo many people have been affected by this, and it\u2019s just killing me that there are people like that out there.\u201d\nPresident Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff and said he would visit Las Vegas on Wednesday.\nLeaving the White House to visit hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday morning, Trump repeated his praise for police in Las Vegas and their response, saying of law enforcement that \u201cwhat happened in Las Vegas is in many ways a miracle.\u201d He also said that \u201cwe\u2019ll be talking about gun laws as time goes by.\u201d\n\u00a9 Photo by Salwan Georges/The Washington Post Police officers are seen along the Las Vegas Strip on Monday.\nEric Paddock, Stephen Paddock\u2019s brother, said he was stunned to learn that his brother could be responsible for such violence. Stephen Paddock had no history of mental illness nor did he have problems with drugs or alcohol, Eric Paddock said, noting that his brother was a high-stakes gambler, sometimes wagering hundreds of dollars on a single hand of video poker.\nWhen he spoke to the FBI, Eric Paddock said he showed agents three years of text messages from his brother, including one that mentioned winning $250,000 at a casino.\nA federal law enforcement official said investigators had reviewed reports suggesting Paddock engaged in high-dollar gambling, and they are trying to determine whether he faced financial strains.\nEric Paddock said his brother was \u201cwealthy,\u201d in part because he had no children to support. Stephen Paddock had worked in the past as an accountant, and he had real estate investments in the Orlando area, Eric Paddock said.\nLockheed Martin, the defense giant, said that Paddock had worked for the company for three years in the 1980s. Not long after the shooting in Las Vegas, the Islamic State claimed responsibility, though law enforcement authorities were quick to reject that assertion.\n\u201cWe have determined, to this point, no connection with an international terrorist group,\u201d Aaron Rouse, the special agent in charge of the FBI in Las Vegas, said at a news briefing.\nBerman, Barrett and Zapotosky reported from Washington.

The White House said Monday afternoon it was \u201cpremature\u201d to talk about gun control.\n\u201cThere will be certainly time for that policy discussion to take place, but that\u2019s not the place that we\u2019re in at this moment,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday. \u201cBut certainly, I think that there\u2019s a time for that to happen.\u201d\n\u00a9 AP Photo/Brynn Anderson Former White House strategist Steve Bannon speaks at a rally for U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore, Monday, Sept. 25, 2017, in Fairhope, Ala.\nThis article was written by Nicole Lafond from Talking Points Memo and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.

Three such thefts occurred from 2014 to 2016.\nProsecutors say the guns fell quickly into the hands of gangs and drug dealers. They've linked those weapons to Chicago's gun violence.\nShelton is the first of eight defendants up for sentencing. Prosecutors are seeking an 11\u00bd-year prison term. They say the 43-year-old Shelton received less time for six previous train-theft convictions and those sentences didn't deter him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andrew shelton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shelton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "u.s. attorney's office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south side", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norfolk southern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. attorney's office", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:02:42.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2531425cf8001674f82360ff356915886a378e47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9Lk2BJVbaUaUIU986nHmAkXH8qUPuQqy0dVzjz3l9_AvoywjknYMhGIY_MMXQWdM6xIboUpJbFFdMcDXum18Bv5vrsxT472ks19G6pUeIf_V54-", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/news", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "News", "title": "Trump: Las Vegas shooter a 'sick,' 'demented' man", "title_full": "Trump: Las Vegas shooter a 'sick,' 'demented' man", "published": "2017-10-03T20:28:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 290, "comments": 0, "shares": 290}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2531425cf8001674f82360ff356915886a378e47", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9Lk2BJVbaUaUIU986nHmAkXH8qUPuQqy0dVzjz3l9_AvoywjknYMhGIY_MMXQWdM6xIboUpJbFFdMcDXum18Bv5vrsxT472ks19G6pUeIf_V54-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "msn.com", "published": "2017-10-03T20:28:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump: Las Vegas shooter a 'sick,' 'demented' man", "text": "President Trump spoke about relief efforts in Puerto Rico and the Las Vegas massacre.

Butker\u2019s kick put the Chiefs up 23-20, and Kansas City added a touchdown as time expired when linebacker Justin Houston returned a fumbled lateral.\nButker also made 26- and 32-yard attempts earlier in the second half.\nHe missed the first attempt of his career when he pulled a 46-yarder wide left just before halftime. With hindsight, Butker can see that miss as a blessing.\nMore: Late scoring flurry allows Chiefs to stay unbeaten by beating Redskins 29-20\nMore: Chiefs' Alex Smith keeps answering questions one win at a time\nMore: 40 things we learned in Week 4 of the 2017 NFL season\nIt happened in the same end zone as his game-winning kick, from nearly an identical distance, and under similar wind conditions.\n\u201cI knew the ball was going to move, so that allowed me to aim right-middle for the second kick. I think everything happens for a reason,\u201d Butker said. \u201cI missed that kick, but I came back and I was more experienced going that way, more experienced with the wind, and I was able to handle it.\u201d\nButker, who said he kicked two short game-winning field goals in 2014 for Georgia Tech, was in his apartment in Charlotte, where he was a member of the Carolina Panthers\u2019 practice squad, on Monday when his agent called and told him he was heading to Kansas City. He was able to practice three times with his new teammates, even if he didn\u2019t get to know many of them outside of punter Dustin Colquitt, whom Butker knew from an offseason kicking academy, and long snapper James Winchester.\nAfter Butker\u2019s miss in the second quarter, it was Colquitt, a 13-year veteran, who gave the rookie a pep talk that boosted Butker\u2019s spirits, so much so that in critical situations late in the fourth quarter, Reid had no qualms in trusting Butker to make his kicks.\n\u201cI was confident because he was confident,\u201d Reid said.\nRelated Slideshow: Best

When the discovery was announced several months later, it was a sensation not only among scientists but the general public.\nThe scientists were honored for a combination of highly advanced theory and ingenious equipment design.\n\"It's a win for the human race as a whole. These gravitational waves will be powerful ways for the human race to explore the universe,\" said Thorne, speaking by phone with The Associated Press from California shortly after the announcement.\nAriel Goobar of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said the winners' work meant \"we can study processes which were completely impossible, out of reach to us in the past.\" \"The best comparison is when Galileo discovered the telescope, which allowed us to see that Jupiter had moons and all of a sudden we discovered that the universe was much vaster than we used to think about,\" Goobar said.\nWith the technology that the three developed \"We may even see entirely new objects that we haven't even imagined yet,\" said Patrick Sutton, an astronomer at Cardiff University in Wales.\n\u00a9 Molly Riley/AFP/Getty Images Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne, who won the Nobel Physics Prize 2017 for gravitational waves. Weiss, in a phone call with the announcement news conference at the Swedish academy, said \"I view this more as a thing that recognizes the work of a thousand people.\" Gravitational waves are extremely faint ripples in the fabric of space and time, generated by some of the most violent events in the universe.\nThe waves detected by the laureates came from the collision of two black holes some 1.3 billion light-years away. A light-year is about 5.88 trillion miles.\nThe waves were predicted by Einstein a century ago as part of his theory of general relativity. General relativity says that gravity is caused by heavy objects bending space-time, which itself is the four-dimensional way that astronomers see the universe.\nThe prize is \"a win for Einstein, and a very big one,\" Barish told the AP.\nThe German-born Weiss was awarded half of the 9-million-kronor ($1.1 million) prize amount and Thorne and Barish will split the other half.\nWeiss in the 1970s designed a laser-based device that would detect gravitational waves. He, Thorne and Barish \"ensured that four decades of effort led to gravitational waves finally being observed,\" the Nobel announcement said.\nThe laser device, called an interferometer, must be both exquisitely precise and extremely stable. \"The beam must hit the mirrors precisely. They should hardly shake at all, not even when leaves fall from nearby trees,\" according to a prize background paper.\nThe announcement said Einstein was convinced that gravitational waves could never be measured. The laureates used laser devices \"to measure a change thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus.\"\nIn a moment of poetry aimed at making the distant and infinitesimal phenomenon understandable to non-experts, the academy announcement said gravitational waves \"are always created when a mass accelerates, like when an ice-skater pirouettes or a pair of black holes rotate around each other.\"\nFor the past 25 years, the physics prize has been shared among multiple winners.\nLast year's prize went to three British-born researchers who applied the mathematical discipline of topology to help understand the workings of exotic matter such as superconductors and superfluids.\n___\nBob Lentz in Philadelphia, Michelle Moore in Phoenix, Arizona and science writer Malcolm Ritter

deaths from Sunday night's mass shooting at a Las Vegas country music concert was 23-year-old Jordan McIldoon. His final minutes were spent in the arms of a total stranger who never left his side, reports CBS News' Adriana Diaz.\n\"It's what you see on TV and it's never going to be you. It's never going to happen to you. And it was happening,\" said Heather Gooze. She was working as a bartender at the concert and escaped the gunfire. But McIldoon who, according to his Facebook page, lived in Canada and worked in construction, did not. He was among the seriously wounded Gooze held.\n\"His fingers were kind of wrapped on my hand. His hand kind of squeezed a little bit, and then just, like, went loose,\" Gooze said. Gooze was able to call McIldoon's girlfriend, who was sheltering in place nearby.\n\"She said, 'Be honest with me, like, what's going on?' And I said 'He didn't make it.'

Their lawyers blame North Korean agents.\nSouth Korea has accused the North of ordering the hit but Pyongyang denies the allegations.\nThe charge sheet blames Kim's death on the women along with four other people still at large, who are not named. Four North Korean suspects fled Malaysia on the day of the murder.\n\u00a9 Provided by AFP A police convoy carrying the two defendants leaves court after the first day of their trial on Monday On the second day of proceedings Tuesday, Mohamad Shah described to the Sham Alam High Court, outside Kuala Lumpur, how he carried out the post-mortem.\n\"The overall findings showed congestion of the organs and swelling of the lungs,\" he said, using the medical term which refers to an excessive accumulation of body fluid.\nParts of the brain, the liver and spleen were among organs affected, he added.\nHe said the weight of Kim's right lung had increased to 690 grams (24 ounces), above the average for an adult lung.\nFrom the examination, he concluded that Kim had \"died due to VX poisoning\".\nA post-mortem report submitted as evidence to the trial showed that VX was found not just on Kim's face and eyes but also in his blood and urine, and on his clothes and luggage.\nEarlier, a chemical pathologist who examined a sample of Kim's blood testified it showed very low levels of an enzyme vital for his nervous system to function, a condition which could have been caused by exposure to poison.\nThe pathologist, Nur Ashikin Othman, said Kim had a level of 344 units per litre, far below the usual level for men. But tests on the two suspects showed their levels were normal.\nThe murder sparked a furious diplomatic row between North Korea and Malaysia, which had been one of Pyongyang's few allies amid global outrage over its atomic weapons programme.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim jong-nam", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "mohamad shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nur ashikin othman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doan thi huong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohamad shah mahmood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siti aisyah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah alam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sham alam high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah alam high court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:03:09.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f654a4ea8c92440168753f48354299b4881ca68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkdSt.4aSkeTa1pOsHc2jq3_wwKC1Uei6_8.WyQis7Z8UvHWgfpLnBOCf6x._uriJ7PLw66PBU2x7GQjLgL_l0mBQV4SC4KA6HJJF5ucGI1AAtVjeA2cqBIQ--", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "Sports News, Scores, Schedules, Standings, Stats, Photos, Videos - MSN Sports", "title": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5", "title_full": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f654a4ea8c92440168753f48354299b4881ca68", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ_cKByJGZr3LvXo2oRv9LkdSt.4aSkeTa1pOsHc2jq3_wwKC1Uei6_8.WyQis7Z8UvHWgfpLnBOCf6x._uriJ7PLw66PBU2x7GQjLgL_l0mBQV4SC4KA6HJJF5ucGI1AAtVjeA2cqBIQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Grey Papke", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5", "text": "Eight things the college football polls got wrong in Week 5 Larry Brown Sports 10 hrs ago Grey Papke Click to expand Replay Video UP NEXT Highlights: Chiefs drop Redskins to remain unbeaten Check out game highlights from the Week 4 matchup between the Washington Redskins vs. the Kansas City Chiefs.

As such, the polls have done a bit of settling, and there have not been a huge amount of changes to the rankings since this time last week.\nStill, there are a few gripes throughout the top 25 and beyond. Here\u2019s a list of eight items from both the AP and Coaches Poll that the voters should have taken a second look at.\nCoaches should have Georgia in the top five\nGeorgia got a two-spot bump this week, moving to No. 5 in the AP Poll and No. 6 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll. The AP got this one right \u2014 Georgia\u2019s 41-0 drubbing away from home at Tennessee was enough to catapult the Bulldogs past Washington and into the top five. The Bulldogs have won at Notre Dame, too, and while the Volunteers are having a hugely disappointing season, it\u2019s not exactly a foregone conclusion for anyone to walk in there and win 41-0. The coaches still have the Bulldogs at No. 6, a spot behind Washington in the rankings. Those two should be flipped around.\nWisconsin\u2019s perplexing jump in the Coaches\u2019 Poll\nWisconsin is No. 9 in the AP and No. 8 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll, sitting one spot ahead of Ohio State in both. But the coaches gave Wisconsin a two-spot bump, vaulting them ahead of the Buckeyes.\nThe Badgers beat Northwestern on Saturday, but they were on upset alert for much of the game. They have not looked as good as Penn State, whom they deservedly sit behind despite both having unbeaten records. The same goes for how they compare with Michigan. Ohio State? The Buckeyes have a loss, at home against Oklahoma, but their victories have been accomplished in more impressive fashion than Wisconsin\u2019s so far. Yes, the Badgers have the better record, but the Buckeyes have looked like the superior team recently.\nVirginia Tech should be below Louisville\u2026\nThe Hokies predictably fell after losing in rather meek fashion to Clemson at home. They dropped four spots in the AP poll to No. 16 and seven spots to No. 19 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll. The writers still kept VT above a Louisville team (ranked No. 17) that lost by more to the Tigers, but did so on the road. Perhaps that was the deciding factor, but the Cardinals, buoyed by Lamar Jackson, look to be hitting their stride once more. Louisville and Virginia Tech are very close in stature, but the Cardinals should get a slight edge based on talent.\n\u2026but the coaches punished the Hokies too much\nOn the other hand, Virginia Tech shouldn\u2019t be hit too hard for losing to Clemson, who are, at minimum, one of the three best teams in the nation. The coaches hit them hard, dropping them from No. 12 to No. 19 for the loss. The Hokies may have been a bit overrated to begin with, and it\u2019s good that they\u2019re still in the top 20. Inching them up a couple of spots to the No. 17 spot or so would be a fairer reflection on where Virginia Tech is at this point, though we like that they have Louisville ahead of them.\nSan Diego State might be slightly overrated by the writers\nThe Aztecs defeated Northern Illinois by only six points at home, escaping both an upset and some unwarranted poking . Even though San Diego State sits at 5-0, their latest victory wasn\u2019t the world\u2019s most impressive win. That did not stop the writers from keeping them at No. 19 in this week\u2019s poll \u2014 slightly higher than the No. 21 spot the coaches pegged them at. That mark is more fair; the Aztecs are a top 25 team, but not a top 20 one, at least not until they get a better win, or a more convincing set of victories.\nHow is Florida State the first team out of the Coaches\u2019 Poll?\nThe Seminoles haven\u2019t shown anything to merit a top 25 vote at this point. They finally grabbed their first win of the season \u2014 a 26-19 victory at Wake Forest. Wake is a team that preseason prognosticators would have had FSU beating easily at the start of the season, with or without Deondre Francois. Despite this, Florida State fell just six points shy of returning to the top 25 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll, which is absurd. They\u2019re also the second team out in the AP Poll. This team should be nowhere near the rankings until they show a lot more.\nFlorida still isn\u2019t a top-20 team\nThe Gators (21/20) got past Vanderbilt at home on Saturday with another unimpressive win in a season filling with them. They weren\u2019t rewarded or punished, which is fair, but the problem remains that they were overrated to begin with, particularly by the coaches, who have them at No. 20. Florida is not a top 20 team. They have done nothing to demonstrate that they are a top 20 team. Their best win is over a Tennessee team that looks increasingly terrible. They deserve their ranking \u2014 barely \u2014 but they remain too high.\nSouth Florida gets a bit too much credit from the coaches\nUSF put up 61 on East Carolina on Saturday to move to 5-0, lifting them to No. 16 in the Coaches\u2019 Poll. That puts them above the likes of Louisville, Utah, and Virginia Tech. South Florida\u2019s problem is the same one that plagues many Group of Five powers \u2014 no great wins, and no real opportunities to get them. If the Bulls continue to run the table, they\u2019ll get rewarded in turn, but for now, other teams have more impressive resumes. They have earned their place in the top 20, but the coaches have them a bit too high.\nRelated slideshow: 2017 college football season (Provided by photo services)\n2017 college football season",

After the extension, the benefit of Rs 2.6 lakh subsidy will be available till March 2019. On 31 December last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that the credit linked subsidy scheme (CLSS) under PMAY (Urban) will be applicable to middle income groups till the end of December this year.\nHow To Avail PM Awas Yojana Scheme In 10 Points\n1) Experts have welcomed the extension. Amandeep Singh Dhaliwal, vice president at Levidia Infra Group, said, the extension will give more time to middle income groups to avail interest subsidy under the scheme. \"The idea of 'Housing For All' for which the scheme was introduced in a big nation like India cannot be fulfilled in an year's time,\" he said.\n2) The PM Awas Yojana subsidy scheme is against the home loan of the beneficiary. This means that the subsidy amount will be credited in the loan account of the beneficiary. The subsidy amount is credited upfront and it will reduce the principal outstanding amount of the loan.\n3) The home loan borrower can then opt for lower EMIs or repay loan faster with original EMI.\n4) The foremost condition of PM Awas Yojana (CLSS) is that the family should not own a pucca house either in his name or in the name of the family member in any part of India.\n5) Under the subsidy scheme, middle-income group beneficiaries with annual income of above Rs.6 lakh and up to Rs.12 lakh get an interest subsidy of 4 per cent on a 20-year loan component of Rs 9 lakh.\n6) Those with annual income exceeding Rs 12 lakh and up to Rs 18 lakh would get interest subsidy of 3 per cent on loan amount of up to Rs 12 lakh. Additional loans beyond the specified limit, if any, will be at non-subsidised rate.\n7) The income calculated is of the total Household and not of the individual. The Maximum benefit of interest ranges between Rs. 2.30 lakh to Rs. 2.67 lakh as per the income bracket and loan amount of the beneficiary. For lower income group beneficiaries with total income up to Rs 6 lakh, benefit ranges up to Rs 2.67 lakh for a home loan of Rs 6 lakhs for a tenure of 20 Years.\n\u00a9 Provided by NDTV Profit table \u00a9 Provided by NDTV Profit lig 8) Home loans sanctioned or applications are under consideration since January 1, 2017, are eligible for interest subsidy under the Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for middle income groups under the PM Awas Yojana.\n9) Beneficiaries eligible for interest subsidy under the CLSS scheme have to apply to their lenders for availing the subsidy benefit.\n10) Interest subsidy will be provided on loans for construction/acquisition of house with carpet area of up to 90 sq metres for those with income of up to Rs. 12 lakh per year and of up to 110 square metres for those earning between Rs. 12 lakh and Rs. 18 lakh per year.\n\u00a9 Provided by NDTV Profit graph", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://profit.ndtv.com/news/property/article-pradhan-mantri-awas-yojana-centre-aims-to-construct-12-lakh-houses-in-fy18-1696798", "http://www.ndtvprofit.com/", "http://profit.ndtv.com/news/your-money/article-reduce-home-loan-emis-under-pradhan-mantri-awas-yojana-how-it-works-1674758"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "awas yojana", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amandeep singh dhaliwal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "narendra modi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradhan mantri", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ndtv", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ndtv profit team t", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "emi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "credit linked subsidy scheme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "levidia infra group", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:24:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "18994e4b684c75fd383026720c3ad8a9e0b39ea0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lLKftZHhpRW22gpi5tzPnq8jSA2dy86ROdGYVP8u2Yl5GOSwm.I1.jVdgHICHgmNHE3uR4Bqf_0oPgjBKHU7rsunFj9VD_msKfVgYwyNLmJiPIa4lNKrLJgy5.laKIbq7", "site_full": "www.msn.com", "site": "msn.com", "site_section": "http://www.msn.com/en-in/money", "site_categories": ["tech", "email"], "section_title": "MSN Money India | Latest Financial News, Market Updates and Guides", "title": "Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 leaked in images one day before launch", "title_full": "Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 leaked in images one day before launch", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "18994e4b684c75fd383026720c3ad8a9e0b39ea0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.WnoVDhJqAFT8KJmIE4k7lLKftZHhpRW22gpi5tzPnq8jSA2dy86ROdGYVP8u2Yl5GOSwm.I1.jVdgHICHgmNHE3uR4Bqf_0oPgjBKHU7rsunFj9VD_msKfVgYwyNLmJiPIa4lNKrLJgy5.laKIbq7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Saaho: Another actress roped in for Prabhas's film", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 leaked in images one day before launch", "text": "Google Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 leaked in images one day before launch India Today 19 hours ago Google Pixel launch is almost here but the company failed to keep the curtains on.

RCom shares were trading at 17.90 rupees, down 6.77 percent, after dropping to a low of 17.70 rupees.

Reliance Communications also blamed high level of competition as one of the reasons for termination of the merger talks.\n\"Unprecedented competitive intensity in the Indian telecom sector together with fresh policy directives, adversely impacting bank financing for this sector, have also seriously affected industry dynamics. As a result of the various factors aforesaid, the merger agreement has lapsed,\" RCom said.\nOn Monday, Anil Ambani-led RCom further expanded its board by adding four new members.

Las Vegas Mass Shooting the \"Price of Freedom\" The Hollywood Reporter 15 hrs ago Meena Jang \u00a9 Teresa Kroeger/Getty Bill O'Reilly Bill O'Reilly weighed in on the Sunday night attack in Las Vegas, calling the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history \" the price of freedom \" in a message posted to his official site Monday.\nIn the note, O'Reilly said that gun control regulations \"will not stop psychopaths from harming people.\"\nHe added, \"Public safety demands logical gun laws but the issue is so polarizing and emotional that little will be accomplished as there is no common ground.\"\nThe No Spin News host called the mass murder the \"downside to American freedom,\" citing the Second Amendment and Americans' right to bear arms. \"Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are,\" he wrote.\nRead the full post below.\nOnce again, the big downside of American freedom is on gruesome display. A psychotic gunman in Las Vegas has committed the worst mass murder in U. S. history.\n64-year-old Stephen Paddock, who lived in Nevada, began firing from a hotel window about 10pm Pacific time last night. His targets were folks attending a music festival below him. When it was all over, more than 50 human beings lay dead, 400 plus wounded. Paddock apparently killed himself as police closed in on him.\nThe murderer had a number of deadly weapons in his room and you can count on the gun control debate to ramp up.\nBut having covered scores of gun-related crimes over the years, I can tell you that government restrictions will not stop psychopaths from harming people.\nThey will find a way.\nPublic safety demands logical gun laws but the issue is so polarizing and emotional that little will be accomplished as there is no common ground.\nThe NRA and its supporters want easy access to weapons, while the left wants them banned.\nThis is the price of freedom.

He made his Test debut against Australia and played a significant role in India's series-clinching victory in Dharamsala. The left-arm chinaman bowler has also made an immediate impact in ODIs, snaring 18 wickets in 11 matches.\nPhotos: Indian cricketers and their 'unique' world records\nHardik, Virat, Dhoni and other Indian cricketers who hold 'unique' world records Kuldeep recently became only the third Indian bowler to take an ODI hat-trick during the second match against Australia at the Eden Gardens.\nChahal, meanwhile, has been on a roll too. The 27-year-old leg-spinner has 14 wickets from seven matches and is an ideal foil for Kuldeep as India look to blood in two wrist-spinners to sharpen their bowling arsenal. So far, the duo along with Axar Patel, have delivered the results.\nDespite wide success and instant fame, Kuldeep and Chahal continue to be two young boys from small towns.

Even i am shy (of girls). I have not interacted with a lot of girls because I was always focussed on training,\" he said.\nBut Rohit, one of the most senior members in the side, refused to believe the two spinners were shy. Maybe, they are real pranksters inside the dressing-room. It does look like the two can be a real laugh riot when they choose to be.\nHowever, that is where the similarities end for both wrist-spinners. While Chahal likes to go out to dine, loves listening to loud music and attend parties, Kuldeep prefers staying in his room to catch up on soccer.\nThe two also revealed who their favourite actresses were.
