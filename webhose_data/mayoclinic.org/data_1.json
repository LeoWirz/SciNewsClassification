Request an appointment. \nSprains and strains are common injuries that share similar signs and symptoms, but involve different parts of your body. \nA sprain is a stretching or tearing of ligaments \u2014 the tough bands of fibrous tissue that connect two bones together in your joints. The most common location for a sprain is in your ankle. \nA strain is a stretching or tearing of muscle or tendon. A tendon is a fibrous cord of tissue that connects muscles to bones. Strains often occur in the lower back and in the hamstring muscle in the back of your thigh. \nInitial treatment for both sprains and strains includes rest, ice, compression and elevation. Mild sprains and strains can be successfully treated at home. Severe sprains and strains sometimes require surgery to repair torn ligaments, muscles or tendons. Transcript \nMost ankle sprains involve injuries to the three ligaments on the outside of your ankle. Ligaments are tough bands of tissue that stabilize joints and help prevent excessive movement. An ankle sprain occurs when you roll, twist or turn your ankle in an awkward way. This can stretch or tear the ligaments that help hold your ankle bones together.

But the \u201choly grail\u201d of contemporary dementia research is determining the risk factors that make people more likely to develop the disease, neurologist Ronald Petersen, who directs the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center and Study of Aging at the Mayo Clinic, tells Newsweek. Risk factor research is just as important as treatment development, Petersen says, since the two work together: first detection and then prevention. Once viable pre-dementia medications are found, doctors can use them in the intervention stage, similar to how cholesterol drugs lower heart disease risk.

as well as in the brain. Though it can be made synthetically, most people get creatine through seafood and red meat. The body's liver, pancreas and kidneys also make creatine. \nYour body converts creatine to phosphocreatine and stores it in your muscles, where it's used for energy. As a result, people take creatine orally to improve athletic performance and increase muscle mass. \nPeople also use oral creatine to treat certain brain disorders, congestive heart failure and other conditions. Topical creatine might be used to treat aging skin. Evidence \nResearch on creatine use for specific activities and conditions shows: Exercise. A wide body of research on the impact of oral creatine use on exercise has produced mixed results. Oral creatine use might benefit athletes who require short bursts of energy, such as sprinters and weight lifters. Rare creatine-metabolizing syndromes. In children with the certain creatine deficiency syndromes, oral creatine supplements might improve some symptoms. Heart failure. There isn't enough evidence to recommend use of oral creatine as a heart failure treatment. Skin aging. Preliminary research suggests that a cream containing creatine and other ingredients applied to the face every day for six weeks might reduce skin sag and wrinkles in men. Another study suggests that a cream containing creatine and folic acid improves sun damage and reduces wrinkles. \nPeople who have low levels of creatine \u2014 such as vegetarians \u2014 appear to benefit most from creatine supplements. Our take Generally safe \nCreatine might benefit athletes who need short bursts of speed or muscle, such as sprinters and weight lifters. \nWhile taking creatine might not help all athletes, evidence suggests it generally won't hurt if taken as directed. However, people who have kidney disorders or people at risk of developing kidney disease should talk to a doctor before taking creatine due to concerns that the supplement might cause kidney damage.

With a few exceptions, we\u2019re not treating people with what actually works best.\u201d Part of the reason is that exposure work is hard.

Mayo Clinic research shows that licensing requirements in many states include questions about past mental health treatments or diagnoses, with the implication that they may limit a doctor's right to practice medicine. The findings appear in Mayo Clinic Proceedings . \u201cClearly, in some states, the questions physicians are required to answer to obtain or renew their license are keeping them from seeking the help they need to recover from burnout and other emotional or mental health issues,\u201d says Liselotte Dyrbye, M.D. , a Mayo Clinic physician and first author of the article.

Others remember the disastrous winter of 2014, when CDC officials misjudged which strain would take hold that year, meaning the vaccine did not provide adequate protection. Others are simply not fussed - 'it's just the flu'. But one of the most often-voiced fears is of catching the flu from the flu shot. While it is understandable that people make that erroneous connection, Dr Pritish Tosh, MD, of the Mayo Clinic explains why the fear is unfounded.

Additional coverage: American Nursing Informatics Association \nHealthcare Analytics News , How Mayo Clinic Plans to Use Data to Fight Pointless Lab Tests by Ryan Black \u2014 Data and smooth operating are the chief weapons in the Mayo Clinic\u2019s war against the wrongful ordering of laboratory tests. CareSelect Lab, the medical practice and research group\u2019s collaboration with National Decision Support Company (NDSC), aims to use analytics and interoperable capabilities to reduce the number of unnecessary lab tests. Announced in late September, the system will integrate with hospital electronic health records (EHR) systems and weigh data against more than 1,500 Mayo Clinic-curated care models to enhance physicians\u2019 ability to order the right tests for their patients. \u201cThere are 3 components,\u201d Curtis Hanson, MD and chief medical officer of Mayo Medical Laboratories, told Healthcare Analytics News\u2122 during the Transform conference. \u201cMaking sure that you\u2019re ordering the right test, [having] the analytics at the back end to make sure you\u2019re getting more complete information for the patient, and understanding populations of patients, so you know better what to do.\u201d \nAmerican Journal of Managed Care , Preventing Infection in Patients With Neutropenia: Q&A With Dr Ruben A. Mesa \u2014 Individuals who develop neutropenia are at higher risk of infection, and they should understand the symptoms to look for that might mean they need to seek urgent medical care, explained Ruben A. Mesa, MD, of the Mayo Clinic, speaking with The American Journal of Managed Care \u00ae ( AJMC \u00ae). Those individuals with neutropenia can also take preventive steps to reduce their risk of developing an infection that might result in hospitalization. \nOncLive , Mesa on Guideline Updates in Polycythemia Vera and Essential Thrombocythemia \u2014 Ruben Mesa, chair of the Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology at Mayo Clinic, discusses the guideline updates in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. Diseases like polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are unique, says Mesa, as they are malignancies, but a lot of patients have very long survival. However, some can progress. Mesa states that the primary goal of the guidelines is the avoidance of thrombosis and bleeding in a risk-based fashion. \nCancer Network , Risk Factors in Myelofibrosis Linked With Poor Outcome After Splenectomy by Dave Levitan \u2014 Survival of patients with myelofibrosis (MF) who undergo splenectomy is adversely affected by older age, the need for transfusion, and leukocyte and circulating blast cell counts, according to a new analysis. The findings, and a score developed to assess risk, may help identify the best candidates for splenectomy. \u201cIndications for splenectomy in MF include drug-refractory symptomatic splenomegaly, frequent transfusion need, refractory thrombocytopenia, and complications from portal hypertension,\u201d wrote study authors led by Ayalew Tefferi, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \nThe Telegraph , The 39 best exercises for burning calories by Richard Jones \u2014 \u2026 All this data and proof has us scratching our heads as to the best way to optimise our precious workout time. Do I need to do strength training or will a kick-around in the park suffice? I love a round of Sunday golf but would a jog on the treadmill be a better use of my time? Fortunately, researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota have ranked 39 common exercises based on information obtained from the US National Institutes of Health. The research calculated the number of calories burned during an hour of each exercise, with surprising results. \nWXOW La Crosse , Flu season begins early by Emily Young \u2014 Flu Season has arrived, and it's come a bit early. Across Wisconsin, 22 hospitalizations and 10 cases of the flu have been recorded. Doctors recommend getting the flu vaccine shot as a preventative measure, because flu medications tend to have more side effects than benefits. The flu can have a particular impact on those most vulnerable. \"The most susceptible are children, very young children,\" Dr. Chris Martinez, Family Medicine Physician for Mayo Clinic said. \"So children as young as six months old typically are able to get the vaccine and then typically the elderly, so patients older than the age of 65 are more susceptible to it.\" \nWKBT La Crosse , Education - Garden opportunities expand by Lisa Klein \u2014 Four local organizations brought their expertise to the table to help provide a new learning environment for students in the Hamilton school building...\u201cWe all bring something unique to the table,\u201d said Cinthia Shireman, sustainability coordinator for Mayo Clinic Health System. Mayo Clinic Health System, Shelter Development, and the School District combined their strengths with GROW La Crosse to hopefully create a new learning space. \nKansas City Star , How do docs misusing drugs fit into the opioid crisis? One example sheds light. by Andy Marso \u2014 Keith Berge, an anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic, said it\u2019s something his health system has confronted head on. Mayo recognized a pattern of anesthesia workers ending up in treatment for addiction to fentanyl, a highly concentrated opioid, more than a decade ago. Then in 2008, the health system was rocked by scandal when a catheterization lab nurse was caught stealing patients\u2019 fentanyl and replacing it with saline. Mayo started an internal Drug Diversion Intervention and Response Team to help spot doctors abusing drugs early and get them help. \nTimes Record , Here\u2019s why whole grains are the healthier choice \u2014 Want to be a healthier eater? Focus on whole grains. These unrefined grains are linked to a lower risk for heart disease, certain cancers and other health problems. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends at least half of all the grains you eat be whole grains. \u201cThe healthiest bread option is something that is made with whole grains,\u201d said Angie Murad, a dietitian with the Mayo Clinic Healthy Living Program. \u201cIt needs to say whole grain.\u201d \nIf you would like to be added to the weekly distribution list, send a note to Emily Blahnik

Focus on small steps to make your life more active. Take the stairs more often or park farther from your destination and walk the rest of the way. Check with your doctor before you begin any exercise program. \nWith your doctor's approval, start slowly and work your way up. The American Cancer Society recommends adult cancer survivors exercise for at least 150 minutes a week, including strength training at least two days a week. As you recover and adjust, you might find that more exercise makes you feel even better. \nSometimes you won't feel like exercising, and that's OK. Don't feel guilty if lingering treatment side effects, such as fatigue, keep you sidelined. When you feel up to it, take a walk around the block. Do what you can, and remember that rest also is important to your recovery. \nExercise has many benefits, and some early studies suggested that it may also reduce the risk of a cancer recurrence and reduce the risk of dying of cancer. Many cancer survivors are concerned about cancer recurrence and want to do all they can to avoid it. \nWhile the evidence that exercise can reduce the risk of dying of cancer is preliminary, the evidence for the benefits of exercise to your heart, lungs and other body systems is substantial. For this reason, cancer survivors are encouraged to exercise. Eat a balanced diet \nVary your diet to include lots of fruits and vegetables, as well as whole grains. When it comes to selecting your entrees, the American Cancer Society recommends that cancer survivors: Eat at least 2.5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day Choose healthy fats, including omega-3 fatty acids, such as those found in fish and walnuts Select proteins that are low in saturated fat, such as fish, lean meats, eggs, nuts, seeds and legumes Opt for healthy sources of carbohydrates, such as whole grains, legumes, and fruits and vegetables \nThis combination of foods will ensure that you're eating plenty of the vitamins and nutrients you need to help make your body strong. \nIt's not known if a certain diet or certain nutrients can keep cancer from recurring. Studies examining low-fat diets or diets that contain specific fruits and vegetables have had mixed results. In general, it's a good idea to eat a varied diet that emphasizes fruits and vegetables. \nWhile it may be tempting to supplement your diet with a host of vitamin and mineral supplements, resist that urge. Some cancer survivors think that if a small amount of vitamins is good, a large amount must be even better. But that isn't the case. In fact, large amounts of certain nutrients can hurt you. \nIf you're concerned about getting all the vitamins you need, ask your doctor if taking a daily multivitamin is right for you. Maintain a healthy weight \nYou may have gained or lost weight during treatment. Try to get your weight to a healthy level. Talk to your doctor about what a healthy weight is for you and the best way to go about achieving that goal weight. \nFor cancer survivors who need to gain weight, this will likely involve coming up with ways to make food more appealing and easier to eat. Talk to a dietitian who can help you devise ways to gain weight safely. \nYou and your doctor can work together to control nausea, pain or other side effects of cancer treatment that may be preventing you from getting the nutrition you need. \nFor cancer survivors who need to lose weight, take steps to lose weight slowly \u2014 no more than 2 pounds (about 1 kilogram) a week. Control the number of calories you eat and balance this with exercise. If you need to lose a lot of weight, it can seem daunting. Take it slowly and stick to it. Rest well \nSleep problems are more common in people with cancer, even survivors. This can be due to physical changes, side effects of treatment, stress or other reasons. \nBut getting enough sleep is an important part of your recovery. Sleeping gives your mind and body time to rejuvenate and refresh to help you function at your best while you're awake. Getting good sleep can boost cognitive skills, improve hormone function and lower blood pressure. It can also just make you feel better in general. \nTo optimize your chances at getting good sleep, practice healthy sleep hygiene: Avoid caffeine for at least 8 hours before bedtime Stick to a regular sleep schedule Avoid computer or television screens for 1 to 2 hours before bedtime Exercise no later than 2 to 3 hours before going to bed Keep your bedroom quiet and dim \nIf you feel excessively sleepy during the day, talk with your doctor. You may have a sleep disorder or a problem caused by side effects of your cancer or its treatment.

Now, a new study shows, those concerns break down along geographic lines \u2014 and in those states whose licensure applications ask the most sweeping questions about mental illness, physicians are most likely to be reluctant to seek treatment. The problem lies in how they ask, said Mayo Clinic professor and internist Dr. Liselotte Dyrbye, who led the study. \u201cIn some states, the question is really broad, as in, \u2018Have you ever been treated for a mental health condition?'\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not a fair question.\u201d \nReach: STAT covers the frontiers of health and medicine including science labs, hospitals, biotechnology board rooms, and political back rooms.

Mayo Clinic research shows that licensing requirements in many states include questions about past mental health treatments or diagnoses, with the implication that they may limit a doctor's right to practice medicine. The findings appear in Mayo Clinic Proceedings . \u201cClearly, in some states, the questions physicians are required to answer to obtain or renew their license are keeping them from seeking the help they need to recover from burnout and other emotional or mental health issues,\u201d says Liselotte Dyrbye, M.D. , a Mayo Clinic physician and first author of the article.

Participants, beginning the study as young adults, reported their physical activity and had physical exams at least three times (and up to eight times) during the 25-year study period. Physical activity scores were calculated based on how much each participant exercised and with what intensity. Some participants fell into a group that did not meet the recommended 150 minutes/week; another group met the 150 minutes/week; and a third group exercised excessively: 450 minutes/week, or three times the recommended amount.

Throughout the study, the research team tracked volunteers\u2019 progress via improvements in their leg strength, lean muscle mass, oxygen capacity, and insulin sensitivity. They also biopsied tissue samples and analyzed cells from the volunteers\u2019 thighs. All three exercise groups showed improvements in their lean muscle and aerobic capacity by the end of the 12-week session, the researchers reported.

When you start testing healthy people, she said, it\u2019s not unusual to get some incidental findings \u2014 things that look a little off but don\u2019t signify anything worrisome. Michael Joyner, a physician and human physiology researcher at the Mayo Clinic, agreed. Because my creatinine level was a bit high, Joyner said, it was almost inevitable that my eGFR would also be off, because it is calculated based on creatinine levels. \u201cThat\u2019s the easy explanation, but if you showed that data to the average clinician, you could get a big kidney workup out of it,\u201d Joyner said. Had my doctor been less well-versed on the dangers of testing the so-called \u201cworried well,\u201d I could have been sent down a spiral of escalating testing that ultimately cost me money, time and anxiety without making me any healthier. \nInternational Business Times , Stressed by high blood pressure?

Kumar said she regularly sees children with diseases that used to be considered adult-only, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and fatty liver disease. \"Because rates of obesity are so high, despite all the advances we're seeing, our children may live less healthy and shorter lives than their parents,\" Kumar said. \"We're going to have a much higher number of adults with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease down the line.\" \nMedscape , Menopause Triggers Metabolic Brain Changes Linked to Alzheimer's by Megan Brooks \u2014 Reached for comment, Walter Rocca, MD, a neurologist and epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said the study \"is a next step in the work conducted over the years by Dr Diaz Brinton and her team. Dr Diaz Brinton has proposed that some metabolic changes related to menopause and to the decrease in sex hormone production by the ovaries may be an early step in the chain of events leading to the pathological brain changes underlying cognitive decline and dementia. \"It remains unknown whether the bioenergetic dysfunction precedes the deposition of amyloid or follows the deposition of amyloid in the most common form of late-onset dementia (late-onset Alzheimer's disease). A lot of the work supporting the hypothesis has been done in animal models or cell cultures. This paper is bridging previous laboratory work with clinical work,\" said Dr Rocca. \nAccuWeather , Now is the time to protect yourself from the flu by Bianca Barr Tunno \u2014 Experts won\u2019t make specific predictions about the upcoming influenza season because the severity of the season varies from year to year, but they do suggest flu shots and simple, preventative measures to keep illness at bay. \u201cGenerally, people with influenza are very ill. To put it in simple terms, they look like they\u2019ve been hit by a bus,\u201d said Dr. Mark Beahm, a family medicine doctor with the Mayo Clinic Health System. \u201cThey\u2019re very achy and tired. They complain of headaches, sore throat, body aches, joint aches, and they often times have high fevers and a cough.\u201d In most cases, Beahm said he doesn\u2019t treat flu patients with antiviral medications because many times, it\u2019s too late. Patients have had their symptoms for several days and at that point, he said using an antiviral medication would be ineffective.

The $7.1 million facility will soon add 44 beds for long-term addiction treatment and 30 beds for short-term treatment, effectively filling a missing niche in Southeast Minnesota. However, those gains will be offset by Mayo Clinic's recent decision to \"pause admissions\" at its women's residential unit at Fountain Centers, which opened in 1974 in Albert Lea. Mayo spokeswoman Ginger Plumbo said \"critical staffing shortages\" forced Mayo's hand at what was once a 50-plus bed facility that could serve up to 12 females. Mayo plans to create a \"behavioral health center of excellence\" in Albert Lea by combining its residential program at Fountain Centers with its inpatient psychiatric services unit, which is moving from Austin to Albert Lea in 2018 as part of Mayo's optimization plan.

There are many factors that predict what source of fuel will be used. Proteins, fats and carbohydrates are all possible sources of fuel for exercise and muscle contraction. During moderate-intensity exercise, roughly half of the energy is derived from glycogen, while the other half comes from glucose in the blood and fatty acids. Carbohydrates (glucose/glycogen) serve as the primary source of fuel as duration and intensity increase. If exercise continues for a significant period of time, fatty acids will serve as the fuel source when glycogen stores are nearly depleted. \u2026 \u2014Anne Harguth is a registered dietitian with Mayo Clinic Health \nWXOW La Crosse , Physician explains Aaron Rodgers' injury by Emily Young \u2014 Green Bay Packer fans are all taking a keen interest in human anatomy this week.

Sometimes detected at birth, microcephaly usually is the result of the brain developing abnormally in the womb or not growing as it should after birth. \nMicrocephaly can be caused by a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Children with microcephaly often have developmental issues. Generally there's no treatment for microcephaly, but early intervention with supportive therapies, such as speech and occupational therapies, may help enhance your child's development and improve quality of life.

But behind this mask of extreme confidence lies a fragile self-esteem that's vulnerable to the slightest criticism. \nA narcissistic personality disorder causes problems in many areas of life, such as relationships, work, school or financial affairs. People with narcissistic personality disorder may be generally unhappy and disappointed when they're not given the special favors or admiration they believe they deserve. They may find their relationships unfulfilling, and others may not enjoy being around them. \nTreatment for narcissistic personality disorder centers around talk therapy (psychotherapy). Symptoms \nSigns and symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and the severity of symptoms vary. People with the disorder can: Have an exaggerated sense of self-importance Have a sense of entitlement and require constant, excessive admiration Expect to be recognized as superior even without achievements that warrant it Exaggerate achievements and talents Be preoccupied with fantasies about success, power, brilliance, beauty or the perfect mate Believe they are superior and can only associate with equally special people Monopolize conversations and belittle or look down on people they perceive as inferior Expect special favors and unquestioning compliance with their expectations Take advantage of others to get what they want Have an inability or unwillingness to recognize the needs and feelings of others Be envious of others and believe others envy them Behave in an arrogant or haughty manner, coming across as conceited, boastful and pretentious Insist on having the best of everything \u2014 for instance, the best car or office \nAt the same time, people with narcissistic personality disorder have trouble handling anything they perceive as criticism, and they can: Become impatient or angry when they don't receive special treatment Have significant interpersonal problems and easily feel slighted React with rage or contempt and try to belittle the other person to make themselves appear superior Have difficulty regulating emotions and behavior Experience major problems dealing with stress and adapting to change Feel depressed and moody because they fall short of perfection Have secret feelings of insecurity, shame, vulnerability and humiliation When to see a doctor \nPeople with narcissistic personality disorder may not want to think that anything could be wrong, so they may be unlikely to seek treatment. If they do seek treatment, it's more likely to be for symptoms of depression, drug or alcohol use, or another mental health problem. But perceived insults to self-esteem may make it difficult to accept and follow through with treatment. \nIf you recognize aspects of your personality that are common to narcissistic personality disorder or you're feeling overwhelmed by sadness, consider reaching out to a trusted doctor or mental health provider. Getting the right treatment can help make your life more rewarding and enjoyable. Request an Appointment at Mayo Clinic Causes \nIt's not known what causes narcissistic personality disorder. As with personality development and with other mental health disorders, the cause of narcissistic personality disorder is likely complex. Narcissistic personality disorder may be linked to: Environment \u2015 mismatches in parent-child relationships with either excessive adoration or excessive criticism that is poorly attuned to the child's experience Genetics \u2015 inherited characteristics Neurobiology \u2014 the connection between the brain and behavior and thinking Risk factors \nNarcissistic personality disorder affects more males than females, and it often begins in the teens or early adulthood. Keep in mind that, although some children may show traits of narcissism, this may simply be typical of their age and doesn't mean they'll go on to develop narcissistic personality disorder. \nAlthough the cause of narcissistic personality disorder isn't known, some researchers think that in biologically vulnerable children, parenting styles that are overprotective or neglectful may have an impact. Genetics and neurobiology also may play a role in development of narcissistic personality disorder. Complications \nComplications of narcissistic personality disorder, and other conditions that can occur along with it, can include: Relationship difficulties Problems at work or school Depression and anxiety ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-26T16:52:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d0d35db20e29fa8fcfa64942dfc8f0b5acdb4b60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuSs0KQ1wkzHjoylw_F68D0G_MwDWkImiDzbPhpEqGZ4T4g5.yu7ffUEtvWwoPimn_CA99cW2vnuhnC3J11gOv7G_YFXmngA_vSN7xgX5HGEQ--", "site_full": "medprofvideos.mayoclinic.org", "site": "mayoclinic.org", "site_section": "http://medpagetoday.com//rss/Cardiology.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "MedPage Today Cardiology", "title": "The Scoop on the New Syncope Guidelines", "title_full": "The Scoop on the New Syncope Guidelines", "published": "2017-10-29T18:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://clf1.medpagetoday.com/media/images/68xxx/68850.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 840, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d0d35db20e29fa8fcfa64942dfc8f0b5acdb4b60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApuSs0KQ1wkzHjoylw_F68D0G_MwDWkImiDzbPhpEqGZ4T4g5.yu7ffUEtvWwoPimn_CA99cW2vnuhnC3J11gOv7G_YFXmngA_vSN7xgX5HGEQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-29T18:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "The Scoop on the New Syncope Guidelines", "text": "The Scoop on the New Syncope Guidelines Mayo Clinic expert provides insight MedpageToday by BroadcastMed October 29, 2017 \nWin-Kuang Shen, MD, cardiology chair at the Mayo Clinic's Phoenix/Scottsdale campus, discusses the recently released 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS) Guideline for the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Syncope . \nThis video first appeared on BroadcastMed .
