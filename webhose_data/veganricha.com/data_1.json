Most people search for vegan butter chicken for some reason and not vegan soycurls in no butter butter sauce or other variations ;). So here goes.\nThis recipe adapted from my popular Butter Tofu recipe. To make a skillet version, use the butter tofu recipe with soy curls. Just simmer the soy curls in the sauce with a up of water for 15 minutes. I use a combination of soy curls and chickpeas in this version and don\u2019t use any oil. You can add some oil or vegan butter with the cashew cream to make it even more like restaurant flavor profile. Don\u2019t have soy curls ? use all chickpeas, beans or veggies. \nIts a super simple recipe. Blend up the tomato, garlic, ginger, chile. Add to the IP along with spices, soy curls and chickpeas, close and cook. Add some cashew cream and simmer for a few minutes to thicken, garnish and done!

Tag me on Instagram #veganricha ! \nSweet Potato Pie Bars with Cinnamony Crust Prep Time 50 mins \nVegan Sweet Potato Pie Bars. Spiced Sweet Potato Pie layered over cinnamony snickerdoodle crust. Make this into a pie for decadent holiday dessert. Gluten-free option. Makes 1 9 by 5 inch loaf pan Course: Dessert Snickerdoodle Crust: 1/2 cup almond flour 1/2 cup flour , I use unbleached white. Use oat flour or gluten-free blend to make gluten-free 1/4 tsp salt 3.5 tbsp coconut sugar or use any fine grain sugar of choice 2.5 to 3 tbsp oil , organic safflower or other neutral Sweet potato layer: 1 1/4 cup sweet potato puree , or use pure pumpkin puree 1/4 cup maple syrup 5 tsp starch , cornstarch or arrowroot starch 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice , or use 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, a pinch of cloves 1/2 tsp vanilla extract US Customary - Metric Instructions \nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a loaf pan with parchment such that the parchment strip is hanging over the edge (see pics). Make the Crust: Add all the ingredients except oil in a bowl and mix well. Add 2 tbsp of oil and mix in with a spoon or your hand. Add more oil a tsp at a time to mix in until the crust starts to stick to make fat crumbs. \nTransfer mixture to the loaf pan (a stoneware or glass pan works better to keep the crust more shortbread like and reduce overbrowning). Press it down to form a well packed and even crust. Bake for 8 to 10 mins. \nMix everything under the sweet potato layer until well combined. Pour over the baked crust. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes until the top is well set. \nLet it cool for 15 minutes, then gently remove from the pan. Chill for atleast an hour before slicing. Longer chilling time (a few hours) makes for a better set top and much more spiced and buttery flavor profile. Serve as is or with a dollop of vegan vanilla ice cream or whipped coconut cream and a dusting of pumpkin pie spice. Recipe Notes \nUse pumpkin puree for pumpkin pie bars. \n\nTip: Measure out a scant 1/4 cup oil in a 1/4 cup measure to use to make the crust and use the remaining in the sweet potato layer. Use the same 1/4 cup measure for maple syrup, less sticky mess \n\nTo make Sweet Potato Pie: Double the recipe with double the crust and the filling. Use 3 tbsp starch in the filling and add 10 to 15 minutes to the bake time. \n\nNutrition is for 1 of 8 bars.

You do have to try these roasted winter squash slices with berbere or use garam masala or baharat from my book (I am salivating already thinking of baharat on some roasted veggies).
