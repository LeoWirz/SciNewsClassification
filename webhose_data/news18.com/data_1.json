While he is \"not done yet\", Hogg remains realistic about his chances of making another comeback for Australia.He is currently commentating in the limited-overs series between India and Australia and if it was not for a surgery on his left knee, he may well have been preparing back home to make another First-Class comeback for Western Australia. \"I am not worried about my age mate. I am still trying to play First-Class cricket for Western Australia. I don't think I will ever announce my retirement   because it is a privilege to play for your country and if I am doing well enough I would never say no,\" Hogg told PTI. The boom in T20 cricket has pushed a host of cricketers to stretch their careers. Hogg is a prime example of that alongside India's \"ageless\" Ashish Nehra, who, at 38, has earned a recall to the Indian team for the three T20s against Australia beginning October 7. Hogg was 44 when he last played for Australia in 2014 and still thinks he is good enough to bowl at the highest level. He also remains a regular at the Big Bash League and even played the IPL as recently as last year. \"If I get the opportunity to play again (for Australia), I would take it. Because once you are long time retired (it is difficult to comeback). If it stops now, it stops now, I know I won't get to play again. \"I am fortunate that at my age I am still wanted. Whether it happens or not, it is another matter but yeah I am not done yet,\" he says. Hogg says the constant curiosity over his age doesn't bother him and he is focused on getting back to full fitness, having undergone a knee surgery three months ago. \"While I am doing that (recovering), I am using the time to do commentary. I feel at a very fortunate place to be honest and thoroughly enjoying it. The recovery is taking longer than expected but I should be back on the ground soon.\" Is it tough to maintain fitness as one grows older? \"Not at all,\" says Hogg. \"If you look after yourself, it is not an issue. But as sportsmen, a lot of us have wear and tear. Sometimes it happens early in your career, sometimes it happens late. I am very lucky that it is late in my career. \"In fact I would not call it (injury layoff) a difficult period. I have been extremely lucky to play the game. I am grateful for that. You rather think about the things you have.\" While commentating, he has also found time to help fellow Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who calls the Australian his mentor with both having spent a lot of time together at the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. Yadav has been making rapid strides in international cricket ever since making his Test debut against Australia in March, and Hogg is not at all surprised. \"Everyone's career graph is different. We all go through different phases and he has got a great foundation. Now he has just to make sure he keeps his head on his shoulders, don't think too far ahead and keep working on his game. \"He has just got to make sure he is reliable when the captain calls him to bowl. The best cricketers in the world are consistent and reliable, they do the job,\" feels Hogg adding Yadav's accuracy remains one of his biggest strengths.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad hogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yadav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ashish nehra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chinaman kuldeep yadav", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ipl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolkata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:19:09.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7eb502bb3f63593556e01249f6846006dcd3764c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1Eb_n_GxTlrcgVEjlrwdryIW6.My1nokcpytAITNuDxHOTuBuW_0.zXsTVFZGPbESUkkDuUQf7r9FidnW99Ho_QwwleLUr6iPwOB0Rqxuq_6Rs.lLPqhSVM", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/cricketnext.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Cricketnext News- News18.com", "title": "England Set to Lose Ashes, With or Without Stokes, Says Blewett", "title_full": "England Set to Lose Ashes, With or Without Stokes, Says Blewett", "published": "2017-10-03T17:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/ashes-urn-afp.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7eb502bb3f63593556e01249f6846006dcd3764c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1Eb_n_GxTlrcgVEjlrwdryIW6.My1nokcpytAITNuDxHOTuBuW_0.zXsTVFZGPbESUkkDuUQf7r9FidnW99Ho_QwwleLUr6iPwOB0Rqxuq_6Rs.lLPqhSVM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "England Set to Lose Ashes, With or Without Stokes, Says Blewett", "text": "England Set to Lose Ashes, With or Without Stokes, Says Blewett Reuters   2:48 PM IST \nThe Ashes urn (AFP Photo) Adelaide: An Ashes series shorn of Ben Stokes would be a great shame for cricket but England are heading for defeat with or without the troubled all-rounder, former Australia batsman Greg Blewett has said.Test vice-captain Stokes and opener Alex Hales have been suspended   indefinitely, pending an investigation into an altercation outside a nightclub in Bristol last week. Stokes was initially named in the 16-man squad for the Ashes tour starting in November but the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) rowed back on the decision a day later Blewett, who struck a century on his test debut during the 1994-95 Ashes series, cast doubt on Stokes's chances of playing a full part in the series. \"I'm sure they will (sanction him). They are having their internal investigation. That will play out,\" Blewett, a 46-test righthanded batsman, told Reuters in an interview in Adelaide on Tuesday. \"It would be a shame if he's not out here. I think everyone wants to play against the strongest possible team. \"It would be a shame if he doesn't come out because he's a bit of a drawcard, he's a world class all-rounder and will leave a massive hole in their team. \"But even if he was (to come), I think Australia are going to be too good at home anyway. With or without Ben Stokes I don't see a different result but I think England would love to have him in their side.\" The Sun newspaper published footage of what it said was a brawl between the player and two other people, one clutching a bottle. The authenticity of the images could not be verified by Reuters. Media reports said Stokes, who suffered a minor fracture of a finger on his right hand, apologised to the ECB for his arrest on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and described his state of mind as 'fragile and devastated'. Blewett, who was Australia's fielding coach until stepping down in August, has taken on assistant roles with Sheffield Shield side South Australia and the Adelaide Strikers in the 'Big Bash' domestic Twenty20 competition. Also coach of South Australia's men's under-19 side, Blewett said he would take a dim view of any player out drinking in the early hours of the morning and days before a match. \"I wouldn't be over the moon, put it that way, because I did see the footage and it's not great,\" Blewett said, referring to the video posted by The Sun. \"I'm sure he's got his side to the story which we haven't necessarily heard yet. \"Yeah, you would be disappointed, I think they were only a couple of days away from the next one-day international so I think any coach would be disappointed with that sort of behaviour.\" The Stokes incident has revived the debate as to whether curfews should be enforced during series, but Blewett said he was against such measures. \"Generally, you'd say players these days are a hell of a lot more professional than what we used to be,\" said the 45-year-old. \"These things don't pop up all that often these days, but when they do, obviously you need to address it.\" The potential absence of Stokes would heap further pressure on England's bowlers and a batting order featuring players like opener James Vince and Dawid Malan who are yet to establish themselves. Blewett said Australia and the team's formidable pace attack led by Mitchell Starc would provide the toughest of initiations. \"Two or three of those guys in the squad haven't had a great start to their careers,\" he said. \"It's not going to get any easier when they come out here. \"And it's looking like Australia are going to be full strength with their bowling attack so (they) are going to be up against it.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "blewett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben stokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitchell starc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg blewett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex hales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dawid malan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james vince", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "says blewett reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales cricket board", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheffield shield", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelaide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:19:10.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8d8019d4afc0b9e3a3f964013eb772b6f7dbc8e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1EpYcYrT01CBv0To2MyXtB36E7uQC1ZP0Pu__LE18TEevIHTqt7TGG5P64PwpcB1d7dJMCDitbf1Fyg48yxMxYLtaXyU3Y8ajb4FCwoA2J2dw--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/cricketnext.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Cricketnext News- News18.com", "title": "India A Trounce New Zealand A by Innings & 26 Runs to Win 2-0", "title_full": "India A Trounce New Zealand A by Innings & 26 Runs to Win 2-0", "published": "2017-10-03T19:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/12/shahbaz-nadeem_3112pti_875.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d8019d4afc0b9e3a3f964013eb772b6f7dbc8e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1EpYcYrT01CBv0To2MyXtB36E7uQC1ZP0Pu__LE18TEevIHTqt7TGG5P64PwpcB1d7dJMCDitbf1Fyg48yxMxYLtaXyU3Y8ajb4FCwoA2J2dw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "India A Trounce New Zealand A by Innings & 26 Runs to Win 2-0", "text": "India A Trounce New Zealand A by Innings & 26 Runs to Win 2-0 PTI | Updated: October 3, 2017, 4:59 PM IST \nFile image of India A cricketer Shahbaz Nadeem.

After scoring 211 in their first innings, the visitors managed only 210 in their second essay, courtesy another batting collapse despite starting the final day at 104 for 1.India A had scored 447 in their only innings. Leg-spinner Karn (5/78 in 20.3 overs) and left-arm spinner Nadeem (4/41 in 26 overs) ran through the opposition line-up as they added only 106 runs losing nine wickets in theprocess. Pacer Shardul Thakur took the other wicket. After a match haul of eight wickets in the first game, Railways' Karn once again got another eight wickets (8/129) in the second match. Henry Nicholls (94) played a lone hand, which incidentally wasn't enough as none of the other batsmen were able to support him. Save the second wicket stand of 105 runs between Raval and Nicholls, there wasn't a single partnership of more than 30 runs. New Zealand A have been completely outclassed in the series having lost the first 'Test' by an innings and 31 runs. The batsmen simply didn't have any clue how to negotiate Karn-Nadeem duo. While Karn ended the series with 16 wickets, Nadeem wasn't far behind with 14 in his kitty.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 4:43 PM IST England U-17 arrived in Kolkata in Tuesday Kolkata: Ahead of their opening FIFA U-17 World Cup game against Chile on October 8, the England team arrived at the City of Joy on Tuesday. The Three Lions who were in Mumbai before this though have arrived without wonder kid Jadon Sancho, who is expected to join the squad only for the group stages of the tournament. \"Jadon Sancho will be joining the squad in Kolkata,\" a team official said. He is expected to join the side before their group opener against Chile on October 8. The star forward was named in England's 21-member squad but did not travel with the team as his club Borussia Dortmund did not grant permission. But after the English FA's intervention, the Bundesliga giants have now allowed the 17-year-old to feature for Steve Cooper's side only for the group stages. The FIFA Under-17 World Cup will be missing Brazil's young star Vinicius Junior who was not allowed by his club Flamengo to play in the tournament and Sancho's limited participation is further bad news for the marquee event. The Steve Cooper coached side were based in Mumbai for pre-conditioning after landing in India on September 28 and warmed up to the October 6-28 tournament with a 3-2 defeat of New Zealand on October 1. \"We are happy to be here. There's no activity today,\" a team official said after landing here at 2.20pm. Chile were the first to land here on October 1, followed by Iraq the next day while the fourth team of Group F, Mexico, will join tomorrow, when the Salt Lake Stadium is thrown open four days ahead of the first match here. England are in Group F and will play all their three group leagues matches against Chile on October 8, Mexico on October 11 and Iraq on October 14 at the Salt Lake Stadium. England's previous two U-17 World Cup campaigns have hosted by two of their group opponents, Chile and Mexico. The Young Lions travelled to Chile for the 2015 edition of the competition, when Cooper was on the coaching staff as Neil Dewsnip's assistant. A squad featuring the likes of Everton's Tom Davies and Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold went out after the group stage.

(Twitter/Iran football) Margao: A 21-member Iran national team arrived here on Tuesday to play in the FIFA U-17 World Cup, beginning on October 6. Iran, who are placed along with Germany, Guinea and Costa Rica in Group 'C', will play their first match against Guinea on October 7. After failing to qualify for its first eight tournaments, Iran competed at their first FIFA U-17 World Cup at Trinidad and Tobago 2001, were they suffered three defeats and finished bottom of their group. Eight years later, the Asian side participated in Nigeria 2009, where they advanced from their pool, but lost in the round of 16 to Uruguay, 1-2 after extra time. At UAE 2013, Iran again reached the knockout stages, but again came unstruck, losing 1-4 to Nigeria, the eventual winners of the competition. Iran topped Group A at the 2016 AFC U-16 Championship, due to a better goal difference than second-placed UAE. They then made certain of their place at the U-17 World Cup by comfortably disposing of Vietnam (5-0) in the quarter-finals, before beating Korea DPR in the semi-finals via a penalty shoot-out, following a 1-1 draw. In the final versus Iraq, which failed to produce a goal after 120 minutes of football, the Iranians were involved in another shoot out but this time they ended up on the wrong end of the scoreline (3-4).

(Photo: Chaman Lal Palania) Chandigarh: Honeypreet Insan, the 'adopted daughter' of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, on Tuesday came out of hiding after being on the run for over a month and was arrested by the Haryana Police. The 36-year-old, whose real name is Priyanka Taneja, had gone missing soon after large-scale violence broke out in Panchkula following the conviction of Ram Rahim in a rape case a little more than a month ago. Although the police had been unable to track her down, she appeared in interviews on two TV channels on Tuesday morning. Hours later, she was taken into custody by the police. Confirming the arrest, Haryana DGP BS Sandhu said she was picked up from the Zirakpur-Patiala highway near Chandigarh. Panchkula police commissioner AS Chawla said she is being taken to Panchkula and will be produced before a magistrate on Wednesday. Honeypreet was top of the list of 43 people who were wanted by Haryana police in connection with the Panchkula violence that left 41 people dead. She has been accused of inciting the mob of Dera supporters to riot after Ram Rahim was pronounced guilty as well as trying to help the Dera chief escape after he was sent to jail. \u201cHer role in the violence will be probed... who provided her shelter or support during her run from police will also be produced. She will be produced before a court (in Panchkula) tomorrow and we will seek her police remand,\u201d Chawla said. Chawla also said that another woman who was accompanying her was also taken into custody. He said Punjab Police has been informed about the arrest. On Tuesday morning, Honeypreet had told a TV channel that she was depressed and devastated by the baseless allegations levelled against \u201cPapa\u201d and her. She was last seen accompanying Ram Rahim in a chopper when he was flown to Rohtak jail on August 25, but dismissed reports that she had fled to Nepal. She said that she never left the country and was just waiting for the right legal advice. \u201cI was shocked when a look-out notice was issued against me. I never fled anywhere,\u201d she said. She justified her vanishing act by saying that she was in shock after her father\u2019s arrest. \u201cTry and understand my condition. I was completely shaken to hear of sedition charges when I haven't even killed an ant. I was devastated,\u201d she said in the TV interview, adding that she had complete faith in the judiciary and would approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court. On her former husband Vishwas Gupta\u2019s allegations that she shared a sexual relationship with Ram Rahim, Honeypreet questioned why people are tarnishing a father-daughter relationship. \u201cWhy are they flinging such malicious charges.

(Image: Reuters) New Delhi: The Central government on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that Rohingya refugees - who are mostly Muslims - cannot claim asylum on the ground of parity with Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists who were given this reprieve after they fled Pakistan and Bangladesh due to religious persecution. Submitting an affidavit in the Court, the government maintained there were many factors that require to be considered before allowing a set of illegal immigrants to enter and stay in India, and no other group can allege discrimination in these matters. \"Considering the very nature of such a decision which are to be taken on a case-to-case basis, there cannot be any comparison or claim of discrimination based upon some earlier decision taken with respect to one set of illegal immigrants vis-\u00e0-vis another set of illegal immigrants,\" stated the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its affidavit. The MHA was responding to a contention raised by some of the Rohingya petitioners in SC that the Indian government, by a notification in September 2015, had allowed illegal immigrants from Pakistan and Bangladesh to stay in India without valid travel documents after they fled their countries due to fear of religious persecution. This notification clearly mentioned \"Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Jains, Parsis and Buddhists\" who were compelled to seek shelter in India. The petitioners called it discriminatory that the government was not extending the same relief to Rohingyas who also had to flee Myanmar due to persecution. But the government has shot down this argument, stating that these administrative decisions are taken on a case-to-case basis and that there cannot be any claims based on parity. \"Any administrative decision taken by the executive with respect to illegal immigrants in question in each case depends upon the variety of reasons, empirical data, facts, potential danger to internal security, the number of illegal immigrants involved, disturbances in the social fabric of the country or any particular part thereof, possibility of law and order problem arising in the country or any part thereof, demographic changes and its extent etc,\" maintained the affidavit. The MHA added that the administrative decision to relax rules for Hindus and other minority groups fleeing Pakistan and Bangladesh cannot be compared with the decision with respect to Rohingyas who are about 40,000 in number, \"having other options, and most disturbingly the continuing of a systematic influx of illegal immigrants in an organised manner into India through agents and touts\".

Updated: October 3, 2017, 4:50 PM IST Image for representation only. Bhind: Death of a middle-aged head constable in Madhya Pradesh has caused ripples in the police ranks. The policeman, before his death, accused a senior officer of abusing him when he refused to clean a drain on Gandhi Jayanti on Monday. State Home Minister Bhupendra Singh on Tuesday ordered a DIG-level probe into the incident. The concerned station in-charge, Surendra Gaur, has been named in a complaint. Meanwhile, Ramkumar Shukla\u2019s (55) family has alleged murder. A new twist was added to the tale on Tuesday, when an audio clip went viral, in which the deceased is heard complaining to Superintendent of Police (Bhind) Anil Singh Kushwah, against his senior. The constable accused the station in-charge of persistent torture and the staff of accepting bribes. Shukla repeatedly said that no one would listen to him as he was a low-rung employee and that he \u201cwould be a dead man soon\u201d. Ramkumar Shukla was posted at the Raun police station in Bhind, and on October 2, the head constable had a feud with Gaur. Later in the day, Shukla consumed poison and died at the hospital during treatment. However, minutes before his death, a dying Shukla told mediapersons that the Gaur was constantly targeting him and asked him time and again to do menial cleaning jobs and dig pits despite knowing the fact that he had a liver ailment. \u201cOn October 2, he again asked me to pick up the spade. As I denied, he abused me and beat me up,\u201d a semi-conscious Shukla told reporters. Sources have claimed that the incident took place when the police station staff was preparing for a cleanliness drive on Gandhi Jayanti. \u201cA probe has been ordered by the Chambal DIG and further action will be taken once the report is received. For the time being, the accused has been line attached,\u201d Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said on Tuesday.

Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced that his government plans stringent action against spurious liquor trade and an Act would be passed during the upcoming session of the state Assembly. The CM claimed that no new liquor shop or liquor manufacturing unit would be allowed to open in the state. While there would be no new liquor vend in 5km periphery of the river Narmada. Liquor ban didn\u2019t find a mention in Chouhan\u2019s speech, though he claimed that liquor vends would be gradually reduced in the state. In April this year, Chouhan had announced a decision to close down liquor vends in phased manner, an announcement the state government retracted later. Amid speculations of an absolute liquor ban in MP from October 2, government spokesesperson Narottam Mishra had clarified last week that MP government had no plans to ban liquor in the near future. Sources claimed that after studying liquor ban initiatives in Gujarat and Bihar, MP government refrained from such a populist measure owing to revenue constraints. Liquor along with petroleum products offer major chunk of revenue to the debt-ridden MP government.

(TV grab) New Delhi: A Jaish-e-Mohammad squad named after Afzal Guru was behind the BSF camp attack near Srinagar airport in Humhama on Tuesday. Jammu and Kashmir Police IG, Muneer Khan said that prima facie it looked like a fidayeen attack conducted by the Jaish. The confirmation came after Jaish called a local news agency and claimed the responsibility. However, police sources said that the fidayeen squad has taken a lot of precautions to hide their Pakistani links. \"The three terrorists did not carry any I Card, food or medicine packets on them this time. Usually, these articles give us clear evidence about their origin. But the features of the terrorists tell us that they are Pakistanis and not Kashmiris,\" a police officer said. Police also believe that the Humhama attackers are from the same group that killed 8 security personnel in Pulwama on August 26. \"This group infiltrated from the Sakhdar side in Jammu region. We suspect 6-7 more terrorists from the group could still be in the valley,\" IG Muneer Khan said in a press conference at the BSF battalion headquarters. \u201cIn the August incident, a Jaish-e-Mohammad group infiltrated the borders from the Jammu area. It is being suspected that the Pulwama attackers and Humhama attackers are all part of the same group,\u201d Khan said on Tuesday afternoon. Security forces suspect that a group of 9-10 terrorists infiltrated the International Border in the Jammu area. The group then moved towards the Kashmir Valley and carried out the attack in Pulwama. Police suspect some from the group could still be active in the Valley. Militants launched a suicide attack on the BSF camp on Tuesday, killing an Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI) of the BSF and leaving four security personnel injured. Three militants were also killed in the gunbattle that raged near the airport, forcing brief suspension of air traffic and closure of schools in the vicinity. According to sources, one Noor Mohammed, a resident of Tral in south Kashmir, is the local link to the recent attacks in Pulwama and Humhama. \u201cPolice suspect that Noor, who was released from jail recently, has joined the Jaish ranks full time. He went missing from his residence after being released. He is the common link between the two consecutive attacks,\u201d an officer told CNN-News18. Three terrorists entered the BSF 182 Battalion Headquarters at 4.05 am on Tuesday. The terrorists entered from a side gate which lead to a civilian colony called Gogoland. The first terrorist was killed at the gate by guards, while two others managed to enter the administration building and the senior officers\u2019 mess. Four BSF men were injured at the gate and ASI B Yadav succumbed later. Officers said that at the SO mess, five BSF officers were present at the time of the attack and they were evacuated. One person was also evacuated from the admin building. The second terrorist was killed inside the mess and the third inside the admin building in the afternoon. Home Minister Rajnath Singh congratulated the forces on the successful operation. He told CNN-News18, \u201cI have spoken to DG CRPF and DG BSF. It's a good operation that they have conducted.\" The closeness of the BSF camp to the airport led to panic but officers said, prima facie it looks like the attack was targeted at the BSF camp. \"The idea was not to attack the airport but to attack the forces.

The prominent Malayalam actor is accused of hiring a gang to abduct and sexually assault the actress to settle a personal score. \nNeethu Reghukumar | CNN-News18 Updated: October 3, 2017, 5:01 PM IST Thiruvanathapuram: Malayalam actor Dileep was given bail by the Kerala High Court on Tuesday in the case of abduction and sexual assault of a fellow actress. The bail was granted by Justice Sunil Thomas after imposing stringent conditions, including surrendering of his passport, a deposit of Rs 1 lakh and two solvent sureties for the like amount. Another condition was that he should not tamper with evidence and appear before investigating officers as and when required. Granting bail, Justice Thomas said investigation against Dileep was in the final stages and his further custody was not necessary. The development comes as a sigh of relief for the actor, who was denied bail five times before \u2014 twice by the Angamaly magistrate court and thrice by the Kerala High Court. The HC had last week denied his bail for the fifth time saying that Dileep might influence the case if he is let out on bail. The actor is accused of hiring a gang to abduct and sexually assault the actress to settle a personal score. Six persons, including Dileep and main accused 'Pulsar' Suni, were arrested in connection with the incident in which an actress, who has worked in Tamil and Telugu films, was abducted and allegedly molested inside her car for two hours on February 17. Dileep\u2019s friend and director Nadirshah, who has also filed an anticipatory bail plea in the HC, was also questioned by the police on Sunday. The court, while considering the plea, directed the police to produce the details of questioning in a sealed cover.

And even when they get a small break between series, they are busy with shooting commitments and off field activities. And news has come in that India skipper Virat Kohli will be shooting a special chat show with Bollywood star Aamir Khan for Diwali. The Indian cricketers are currently on a mini break after the ODI series against Australia ended on Sunday. The 3-match T20I series starts on Saturday.According to reports in a news agency, the shoot will take place on Tuesday as Aamir takes a break from promoting his upcoming movie Secret Superstar. \u201cThis would be the first time that Aamir Khan and Virat Kohli will share a platform together,\u201d the spokesperson of the film said. \nTeam India has been on a roll in recent times with the team claiming the No.1 spot in the lastest ODI rankings after thrashing Australia 4-1 in the ODI series. Kohli continued his dominance at the top of ODI rankings for batsmen as Team India is now the No.1 team in ODIs. Joining Kohli in the top-half of the batting rankings is India opener Rohit Sharma. Rohit has moved up four places to reach fifth position in the latest ICC ODI Player Rankings after finishing as the leading scorer in the home series against Australia which India won 4-1 on Sunday. \nRohit Sharma struck a majestic century while Axar Patel starred with the ball as India crushed Australia by seven wickets to take the five-match series 4-1 at the Vidarbha Cricket Stadium in Nagpur on Sunday. \nWith this victory, the \u2018Men in Blue\u2019 leapfrogged South Africa to regain the top spot in the latest ICC ODI rankings. \nChasing a modest target of 243, team India got off to a steady start with Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma at the crease. Rahane started going for runs right from the word go, but his partner Rohit took 15 balls to open his account in the match. \nBut once both batsmen were set, they took the attack to the visitors in sublime style. Rohit was the first to complete his half-century and at one point he was only dealing in boundaries. Rahane soon followed suit and he notched up his fourth successive fifty of the series. \nThe 124-run partnership was finally ended by Nathan Coulter-Nile as the pacer trapped Rahane LBW for 61. Virat Kohli joined Rohit in the middle and the duo kept the scoreboard ticking comfortably. \nRohit Sharma then upped the ante and went onto to score his 14th ODI ton in stunning style. During the course of this innings, Rohit became the fastest Indian to score 2000 runs at home and he also became only the ninth Indian to cross the 6,000-run barrier in the 50-over format of the game. \nRohit continued to be Australia\u2019s nemesis as this was 6th ODI ton against them (also includes one double century). Rohit and Kohli put on 99 runs for the second wicket to propel India closer to the target \nAdam Zampa finally removed Rohit (124) and Kohli (39) in one over but it was bit too late by then as Kedar Jadhav and Manish Pandey saw India home with 43 balls to spare. \nFirst Published: October 3, 2017, 10:37 AM IST SHARE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "virat kohli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aamir khan virat kohli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aamir khan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kedar jadhav", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "axar patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ajinkya rahane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam zampa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kohli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohit sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aamir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathan coulter-nile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manish pandey", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "aamir khan  india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diwali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nagpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vidarbha cricket stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:12:17.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9c42d4e4e63914926a57e0aa708e7563e2d65e2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDNsdRSNhTO24ToM8djb4TiXSIA5qi4khNvx8aQRnoBg9VinISqKuM05GSOsAvM28Ta.ZSW4cb1ya2Unk9c.2WBp_Ouz72ZqTHi46Qty8OXylQ--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/football.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Football News- News18.com", "title": "Argentina In Danger, War Torn Syria Eyes 2018 FIFA World Cup Berth", "title_full": "Argentina In Danger, War Torn Syria Eyes 2018 FIFA World Cup Berth", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/06/argentina_football.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9c42d4e4e63914926a57e0aa708e7563e2d65e2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDNsdRSNhTO24ToM8djb4TiXSIA5qi4khNvx8aQRnoBg9VinISqKuM05GSOsAvM28Ta.ZSW4cb1ya2Unk9c.2WBp_Ouz72ZqTHi46Qty8OXylQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Argentina In Danger, War Torn Syria Eyes 2018 FIFA World Cup Berth", "text": "3-min read Argentina In Danger, War Torn Syria Eyes 2018 FIFA World Cup Berth As qualifying for the 2018 World Cup reaches its climax, Lionel Messi's Argentina find themselves in trouble, Syria face a play-off to keep their remarkable dream alive and European champions Portugal have work to do. Updated: October 3, 2017, 5:08 PM IST File image of members of Argentina's football team celebrating during a game. (Getty Images) As qualifying for the 2018 World Cup reaches its climax, Lionel Messi's Argentina find themselves in trouble, Syria face a play-off to keep their remarkable dream alive and European champions Portugal have work to do. Argentina in danger Brazil secured their place in next year's finals back in March, but three automatic berths remain up for grabs in South America ahead of the final two rounds of qualifying matches. Two-time World Cup champions Argentina haven't missed the tournament since 1970, but five-time Ballon d'Or winner Messi and his compatriots, runners-up in Brazil three years ago, are currently languishing in fifth place. While that would not spell the end of the road for Argentina, instead sending them into a two-legged play-off against New Zealand, even that is far from assured with Copa America holders Chile lurking just a point behind in sixth. Germany cruising, France on thin ice Europe will provide 14 of the 32 competing teams in Russia, the hosts included. But so far only Belgium have punched their ticket to the finals going into the last two sets of fixtures. World champions Germany, who need just a draw in Northern Ireland on Thursday, lead a handful of other sides who can wrap up qualification this week. England are five points clear in Group F, while Serbia are in control of their section and 2010 champions Spain have the edge over Italy in their two-horse race. The nine group winners progress automatically, while all but one of the runners-up advance to the play-off round to determine the final four qualifiers. Portugal, while sure of at least making the play-offs, face a critical final match at home to Switzerland as Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates look to overturn a three-point deficit in Group B. France hold a tentative one-point cushion over Sweden in Group A and will be all too aware of the dangers posed by a trip to Bulgaria, the country responsible for their absence at the 1994 World Cup. Nigeria and Tunisia within sight Five places are on offer in Africa, but none as yet have been claimed. Nigeria are closing in on a sixth World Cup appearance, with reigning continental champions Cameroon and Algeria out of the running in a challenging section, but Zambia could still deny the Super Eagles. Tunisia are well positioned to end a 12-year World Cup exile, leading nearest rivals the Democratic Republic of Congo by three points, while Egypt are in control of their destiny. But other groups remain wide open with just the first-place finishers qualifying for Russia. Ivory Coast top Group C on seven points, but both Morocco (six) and Gabon (five) still harbour genuine hopes. It is a similar situation in Group D after FIFA's decision to annul South Africa's 2-1 win over Senegal from November 2016 -- a match manipulated by a Ghanaian referee. Burkina Faso and Cape Verde head the pool on six points, but Senegal trail by just a point with their match against Bafana Bafana to be replayed in November. War-torn Syria head into play-offs Iran, Japan, South Korea and Saudi Arabia will represent Asia in Russia next year, but Syria and Australia will attempt to join them via the play-offs. Syria prolonged their fairytale World Cup campaign with a dramatic stoppage-time equaliser in their final group match to set up a double-header against Australia on October 5 and 10. The Socceroos are bidding for a fourth straight finals appearance while Syria, who have never reached the World Cup before, have kept their dream alive despite the brutal civil war that has forced them to play all their home games abroad. They will take on Australia in Malaysia in the first leg before travelling to Sydney for the return. The winner of the tie will meet the fourth-placed team from CONCACAF with a spot in Russia at stake. Mexico and who else? Mexico will compete at their seventh straight World Cup next summer, with Costa Rica also on the verge of direct qualification. But a third automatic berth is still in play, while the fourth-placed side can also qualify through the inter-continental play-offs. Panama, in third, lead the United States and Honduras by a single point with two rounds of games still to play.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bafana bafana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ballon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cristiano ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lionel messi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "messi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "socceroos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "super eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivory coast top group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "concacaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameroon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "costa rica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cape verde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "serbia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bulgaria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copa america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tunisia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zambia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "switzerland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burkina faso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senegal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic republic of congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:14:29.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ed90ab5c0891acaabbd8fbce81fec18443d32a35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qDShcb17bNRpkfVGbnxbqwDNMPstfIyqfbIOw3BdLN_ht_f.DGSOj6R7R_XBdACez59W9Z6kFHBCm8i.keAbur3QpFbt4jwguGxHIO9qRKM3cSzv6GdxXhQ--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/tech.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Tech News- News18.com", "title": "BlackBerry Expands India Channel Ecosystem With Six New Partners", "title_full": "BlackBerry Expands India Channel Ecosystem With Six New Partners", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/12/blackberry.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ed90ab5c0891acaabbd8fbce81fec18443d32a35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qDShcb17bNRpkfVGbnxbqwDNMPstfIyqfbIOw3BdLN_ht_f.DGSOj6R7R_XBdACez59W9Z6kFHBCm8i.keAbur3QpFbt4jwguGxHIO9qRKM3cSzv6GdxXhQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BlackBerry Expands India Channel Ecosystem With Six New Partners", "text": "1-min read BlackBerry Expands India Channel Ecosystem With Six New Partners \"BlackBerry is committed to helping enterprises in India, one of the world's largest mobile-first nations, to secure against the ever-increasing data leaks and security threats,\" said Richard McLeod, Vice President of Global Channels at BlackBerry, in a statement. Updated: October 3, 2017, 3:49 PM IST BlackBerry Expands India Channel Ecosystem With Six New Partners (photo for representation, image: REUTERS) Canada-based tech giant BlackBerry announced on Tuesday it has added six new partners in India to design, implement and support its solutions in the country. The company has added ACPL Systems Pvt Ltd, Galaxy Office Automation Pvt Ltd, Jainam Technologies Pvt Ltd, Meta Infotech Pvt Ltd, Nucleus Software Exports Ltd and XSAT India Services Pvt Ltd. \"BlackBerry is committed to helping enterprises in India, one of the world's largest mobile-first nations, to secure against the ever-increasing data leaks and security threats,\" said Richard McLeod, Vice President of Global Channels at BlackBerry, in a statement. \"By joining BlackBerry's Enterprise Partner Programme, these companies will now have access to secure software solutions that will address today's complex and sophisticated business environments,\" McLeod added. BlackBerry has made a comeback as a software solutions company focused on security under the leadership of CEO John Chen. The company reported a revenue of $249 million in the second quarter of 2017. The surge was led by record software revenue, which came in at $996 million -- a year-over-year (YoY) increase of 26 percent, TechCrunch reported late on Thursday. BlackBerry suffered a major fall as it struggled to adapt to the smartphone revolution. In 2009, the company controlled the smartphone market with 41.6 percent share. BlackBerry has now redefined itself as a software company and it does not make its own phones. The company outsourced manufacturing to China's TCL to manufacture and sell BlackBerry branded phones in December 2016 and also embraced Android platform. Chinese electronics company TCL will launch a full-touchscreen smartphone under the BlackBerry name in October. BlackBerry 'KEYone', introduced earlier this year by Chinese firm TCL, was recently launched in India by the homegrown Optiemus Infracom -- one of the three licensees of 'KEYone' devices across the world. BlackBerry \"Priv\", \"DTEK60\" and recently-launched \"KEYOne\" all run on Android OS. \"KEYOne\" comes with both touch-screen and old-school physical QWERTY keyboard.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 3:33 PM IST Zyxel Launches \u2018Multy X\u2019 WiFi Mesh System (image: Zyxel) Zyxel Communications has launched Multy X, a tri-band AC3000 whole-home WiFi Mesh System designed to provide fast, reliable WiFi coverage throughout the home, the company claims. The Multy X utilizes WiFi mesh network technology and aims to deliver seamless coverage throughout the home and eliminate WiFi dead spots. Multiple Multy X nodes work together to provide a single network that envelops homes of all sizes in reliable WiFi coverage. Devices automatically connect to the nearest Multy X node with the best signal, allowing free roaming throughout the home and optimum network performance without having to switch networks and reestablish connections. Multy X nodes work together as a single network to deliver full bandwidth and speed to the connected devices. Multy X is a tri-band solution that uses the third band for the overhead communications between nodes that robs dual-band solutions of bandwidth and reduces the overall performance of the network. Multy X provides the full bandwidth for connected devices on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands to ensure maximum performance and reliability. MU-MIMO support further improves the user experience by enabling Multy X to connect and communicate with multiple devices simultaneously at the fastest possible speeds. Using the Multy X app, users can set up the network in a matter of minutes, push over-the-air firmware updates, create temporary guest WiFi access, and pause WiFi access for specific users. Voice control through Amazon Alexa service makes it even easier to manage the Multy X home network.

And that's very positive.\" Marchionne said the current team was still comparatively young and finding its way, after a restructuring last year, even if Ferrari had been around for 70 years. And components needed to be better. \"We are addressing the entire chain to impose different standards,\" he said. \"It's one thing breaking an engine on the (test) bench at home but it really looks bad when you have to be pushed off the grid (before the formation lap) from second place, it's enough to make you pull your hair out.\" Dutch 20-year-old Max Verstappen won in Malaysia for Red Bull while Lewis Hamilton finished second for Mercedes to increase his championship lead over Vettel to 34 points with five races remaining.

(Getty Images) New Delhi: Kohei Uchimura's remarkable tenure as world all-around champion ended on Monday as the Japanese pulled out of qualification at the gymnastics world championships in Montreal with an apparent lower left leg injury. Uchimura, who has won the last six world and two Olympic all-around titles, pulled out after three of six events on the opening day of the seven-day competition. The 28-year-old Japanese limped badly after the vault, his second rotation, and barely held the landing following his parallel bars routine where he stumbled backwards. After being tended to by multiple members of the Japanese delegation and limping around in visible pain, Uchimura gripped up for his high bar routine but then walked off the competition floor at Olympic Stadium. His absence makes Ukraine's Oleg Verniaiev, who lost to Uchimura by just 0.099 of a point at last year's Rio Olympics, one of the favourites in Montreal. Verniaiev was a bit shaky as he went out of bounds on the floor exercise and even took a big hop on his high bar routine to finish second in his group behind Cuba's 2015 silver medallist Manrique Larduet. After three subdivisions, Larduet had the all-around lead with 86.699 followed by China's Xiao Ruoten (86.297) and Russia's David Belyavskiy (85.839). Verniaiev (85.431) was fifth overall. Men's qualification concludes on Tuesday while the all-around final is Thursday. Women's all-around qualification begins on Tuesday and there is no clear favourite with many of the top talent, including three-times champion Simone Biles, absent and leaving the stage for their younger successors.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "uchimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kohei uchimura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oleg verniaiev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verniaiev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiao ruoten", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larduet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david belyavskiy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manrique larduet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simone biles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olympic stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:31:58.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e129b6408e93e280bf2552f2e5613a58989e058b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qzc68tZPyPUotDlT6ZE2bPQDcHrLLlYP_R46_DQCkRZhmDZav0DR3wWlO266I7o1a8ZMCWBVT1Ky5PAkjg5UKpu8YqVnvazClZFsRe9yjxghnjs2zZIMlO.zWiSfJwDCslq.4URTAq4Y-", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/lifestyle.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Lifestyle News- News18.com", "title": "Asha Bhosle Unveils Her Wax Figure At Upcoming Madame Tussauds Delhi", "title_full": "Asha Bhosle Unveils Her Wax Figure At Upcoming Madame Tussauds Delhi", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/asha-bhosle-news18.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e129b6408e93e280bf2552f2e5613a58989e058b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qzc68tZPyPUotDlT6ZE2bPQDcHrLLlYP_R46_DQCkRZhmDZav0DR3wWlO266I7o1a8ZMCWBVT1Ky5PAkjg5UKpu8YqVnvazClZFsRe9yjxghnjs2zZIMlO.zWiSfJwDCslq.4URTAq4Y-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Asha Bhosle Unveils Her Wax Figure At Upcoming Madame Tussauds Delhi", "text": "2-min read Legendary Singer Asha Bhosle Unveils Her First Wax Figure At Upcoming Madame Tussauds Delhi Asha Bhosle's life-like Madame Tussauds Delhi wax figure was crafted from over 150 measurements and photographs. \n@Mugdha_Kapoor Updated: October 3, 2017, 5:20 PM IST (Photo: Legendary singer Asha Bhosle unveils her wax figure at Madame Tussauds Delhi's event in the capital/ Perfect Relations) Legendary singer and queen of melody Asha Bhosle, who has enthralled listeners with her evergreen and mesmerising voice in the last six decades, on Tuesday, unveiled her first wax figure at a Madame Tussauds Delhi event held in the capital.

(Photo courtesy: AFP Relaxnews/ GrapeImages/ IStock.com) New US research has found that seniors who fail to identify at least four out of five common odors are more likely to develop dementia. Carried out by the University of Chicago, the long-term study looked at 2,906 adults aged 57 to 85 and asked them to identify various everyday smells. The team tested the participants' sense of smell using \"Sniffin'Sticks,\" a well-validated tool which looks like a felt-tip pen but is infused with distinct scents instead of ink. The five scents included in the study, in order of increasing difficulty, were peppermint, fish, orange, rose and leather. The results showed that 78 percent of participants had a normal sense of smell, with 29.4 percent able to correctly identify four out of five scents and 48.7 percent able to correctly identified all five. Around 14 percent could identify just three out of five scents, and five percent could identify only two scents. Two percent of the participants could name just one, and one percent were not able to identify any at all. Five years after this initial test was carried out, the team found that almost all of the participants who had been unable to name a single scent had been diagnosed with dementia. In addition, nearly 80 percent of those who had identified just one or two scents also had dementia, with the team finding that the greater the loss of the smell, the higher the incidence of dementia. \"These results show that the sense of smell is closely connected with brain function and health,\" said the study's lead author, Jayant M. Pinto, MD, \"Loss of the sense of smell is a strong signal that something has gone wrong and significant damage has been done. This simple smell test could provide a quick and inexpensive way to identify those who are already at high risk.\" The study also follows research published back in 2014, which found that olfactory dysfunction was associated with increased risk of death within five years. In this study loss of smell was also found to be a better predictor of death than a diagnosis of heart failure, cancer or lung disease. Trouble identifying odors has also been found to be an early sign of Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease. Pinto also pointed out that a loss of smell can have a significant negative effect on daily lifestyle and well-being, explaining that, \"Smells influence nutrition and mental health. People who can't smell face everyday problems such as knowing whether food is spoiled, detecting smoke during a fire, or assessing the need for a shower after a workout. Being unable to smell is closely associated with depression as people don't get as much pleasure in life.\" \"Of all human senses,\" Pinto added, \"smell is the most undervalued and underappreciated -- until it's gone.\" The findings can be found published online in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jayant m. pinto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinto", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp relaxnews/ grapeimages/ istock.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american geriatrics society", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:36:59.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "de0c23364f3141d1e5da2603b0b951e6ce2bfc22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1FT4ebJUN.EezaNs7HJOLozEC4Tzh1e2OochcRuPZJ3YebMZ3AksLL4q2AP1mrqGlUyWNFBHvXU8fVLA9EFzp89omjs5rUmIOORJjioYatI7q8MGbj1QQqK", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://nowbreaking.in/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Now Breaking News India", "title": "Mitchell Starc Set for Comeback From Injury With Eye on Ashes", "title_full": "Mitchell Starc Set for Comeback From Injury With Eye on Ashes", "published": "2017-10-03T15:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nowbreaking.in/wp-content/uploads/Mitchell-Starc.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "de0c23364f3141d1e5da2603b0b951e6ce2bfc22", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1FT4ebJUN.EezaNs7HJOLozEC4Tzh1e2OochcRuPZJ3YebMZ3AksLL4q2AP1mrqGlUyWNFBHvXU8fVLA9EFzp89omjs5rUmIOORJjioYatI7q8MGbj1QQqK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-10-03T15:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mitchell Starc Set for Comeback From Injury With Eye on Ashes", "text": "Mitchell Starc Set for Comeback From Injury With Eye on Ashes Reuters | Updated: October 3, 2017, 12:42 PM IST \nMitchell Starc.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 7:23 PM IST (Photo: AP) Stockholm : Who will win the 2017 Nobel Literature Prize, after Bob Dylan last year? The Swedish Academy likes to stun the world with its pick, but, wary of its reputation, it is seen going with a more traditional choice this year. The overall buzz, from literary circles to fortune tellers, is that the 18 Academy members in Stockholm will pick a laureate most people agree is Nobel-worthy. \"The Academy is actually a very discreet society and we shouldn't expect anything sensational\" this year, Clemens Poellinger, literary critic for Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet, told AFP. After Gao Xingjian won in 2000 and Mo Yan in 2012, another Chinese-language author is seen as a strong contender: Yan Lianke. He won the 2014 Franz Kafka Prize -- just like Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek and others often mentioned as potential winners, such as Philip Roth, Amos Oz, Haruki Murakami and Claudio Magris. Names that repeatedly appear in the Nobel speculation and are mentioned this year as well are Kenya's Ngugi wa Thiong'o, Syrian poet Adonis, Israel's Amos Oz and Don DeLillo of the United States. The Swedish Academy will end the suspense and announce its pick on Thursday at 1:00 pm (1100 GMT). Cloak-and-dagger secrecy Last year's choice of US singer-songwriter Bob Dylan -- who didn't comment on his win until weeks later and who snubbed the formal prize ceremony in Stockholm -- created such a stir that the Academy is likely to choose a more orthodox laureate, suggested Bjorn Wiman, cultural editor at Swedish paper of reference Dagens Nyheter. \"What happened last year was really unusual. This year I think it'll be a male novelist or essayist with roots in Europe. I think it's going to be the exact opposite of Bob Dylan,\" Wiman said. He thinks Antonio Lobo Antunes of Portugal and Albania's Ismail Kadare have a good chance. \"Everyone will think 'Ah, of course, they deserve the prize', and there'll be no objection.\" The prestigious distinction could also be bestowed upon Canada's Margaret Atwood, whose novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" was recently made into a well-received television series, or Ngugi wa Thiong'o, a favourite of online betting sites. Or it could go to a complete unknown. Each February, the Academy makes a list of all the nominations it has received by those eligible to do so -- including former laureates and university professors -- before reducing it to five names in May. The members then spend the summer reading those writers, before making their choice in October. The Academy is known for its cloak-and-dagger methods to prevent any leaks, resorting to code names for authors and fake book covers when reading in public. Stockholm's literary circles, therefore, try to dissect the Academy members' latest interests to guess the winner -- sometimes with success but usually not. In line with the last will and testament of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite who used his vast fortune to create the prizes, \"it has to be someone who deals with universal questions, someone who makes us reflect about all of us,\" explained publisher Elisabeth Grate. Only 14 women Another aspect not to be overlooked is gender. Of the 113 laureates honoured since Frenchman Sully Prudhomme won in 1901, only 14 have been women. Wiman is however not convinced that has any bearing on the Academy, recalling its claim that it does not take gender or nationality into consideration. \"I think it will be a man in his 70s or 80s who has written heavy novels,\" predicts Clemens Poellinger. At the Hedengrens bookstore in central Stockholm, owner Nicklas Bjorkholm has already set up a wall with books by possible winners, including Spain's Javier Marias, Americans Joan Didion and Don DeLillo, Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and David Grossmann of Israel. His personal favourite for the prize is Korean poet Ko Un because, he insists, \"the time has come for a non-anglophone and an Asian.\" Each critic may have their favourite, but they're usually off the mark. So why not see what's written on the cards? Zanna, a Tarot card reader consulted by AFP, seems to think it's Yan Lianke's year. \"So many pieces come together. He gets such unbelievably good cards, it feels like a yes,\" she exclaimed.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elfriede jelinek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elisabeth grate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clemens poellinger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javier marias", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ismail kadare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicklas bjorkholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zanna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yan lianke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip roth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claudio magris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david grossmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haruki murakami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjorn wiman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ngugi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franz kafka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adonis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfred nobel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonio lobo antunes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "olga tokarczuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don delillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mo yan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prudhomme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gao xingjian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret atwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amos oz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joan didion", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dagens nyheter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "svenska dagbladet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swedish academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hedengrens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kenya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:24:09.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e267ae6640c424303b04164b070abd2bb8dc7b4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qUjNjIwQ3DEgYI4_smhQKe4jUU6Fy2Mfv01JF2dz0WaEaMD8DvWkjlY31t9GclYgRD1QMKwM2c.K4l81G79nluvDtcGpvFlW0", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/lifestyle.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Lifestyle News- News18.com", "title": "Nobel Literature Prize: Controversy, Fame and Flops", "title_full": "Nobel Literature Prize: Controversy, Fame and Flops", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/gabriel.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e267ae6640c424303b04164b070abd2bb8dc7b4d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qUjNjIwQ3DEgYI4_smhQKe4jUU6Fy2Mfv01JF2dz0WaEaMD8DvWkjlY31t9GclYgRD1QMKwM2c.K4l81G79nluvDtcGpvFlW0", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nobel Literature Prize: Controversy, Fame and Flops", "text": "2-min read Nobel Literature Prize: Controversy, Fame and Flops Other winners raised eyebrows because they were members of the Nobel Academy that chooses the laureates. Updated: October 3, 2017, 7:22 PM IST Image courtesy: REUTERS Paris : Ahead of the announcement Thursday of this year's Nobel Literature Prize laureate, here is a look at some of the controversies down the years since the prestigious title was first awarded in 1901. Controversy The 1964 laureate French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, whose political philosophy was partly based on the criticism of institutions, was the first writer to refuse the prize. He wrote that he \"always declined official honours\". Other winners raised eyebrows because they were members of the Nobel Academy that chooses the laureates. They include the little-known Swedish joint-winners Eyvind Johnson and Harry Martinson, who in 1974 beat out Graham Greene, Saul Bellow and Vladimir Nabokov. There was an uproar in 1989, on the sidelines of the prize, when jurors resigned in fury that the Academy had not publicly backed British author Salman Rushdie, subject of a death sentence by Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. Over the past 20 years two laureates have particularly divided opinion: Dario Fo, the Italian playwright and actor who was described as a \"jester\" by the Academy in 1997; and singer-songwriter Bob Dylan in 2016 who was silent for weeks after he was announced as the winner and then snubbed a ceremony to receive the prize. The famous, the forgotten The Nobel Academy has recognised writers of repute like Americans William Faulkner (1949), Ernest Hemingway (1954) and John Steinbeck (1962) and France's Andre Gide (1947) and Albert Camus (1957). Other big-name winners are Rudyard Kipling (1907), Samuel Beckett (1969) and Gabriel Garcia Marquez (1982). However many prestigious names in literature have not been recognised with a Nobel such as Joseph Conrad, James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Paul Valery, Henry James and Virginia Woolf. While some obvious candidates fell through the cracks, the Academy has been criticised for rewarding obscure writers who are not widely read outside their own countries: Iceland's Halldor Laxness (1955), Erik Axel Karlfeldt (1931), Odysseus Elytis (1979) and Jaroslav Seifert (1984). There have been 14 female laureates, only six between 1901 and 1990. Western domination From 1901 to 1985 only eight laureates were chosen from outside Europe and the United States. India has only one laureate in Rabindranath Tagore in 1913, as does the Arab world with Egypt's Naguib Mahfouz receiving the award in 1988. One reason may be that it was previously difficult for the Nobel juries to judge non-European literature as translations were rare and information less accessible before the Internet. In 1986 Nigeria's Wole Soyinka became the first African to be recognised. The first Chinese author was Gao Xingjian in 2000 and in 2006 Orhan Pamuk became the first Turkish writer on the list. Geopolitics The Nobel institution defends an \"idealist\" policy, according to the will of founder Alfred Nobel. In this vein, the Academy has often backed those in exile, dissidents, opposition leaders and authors who are banned from publishing in their own countries. These include Guatemala's Miguel Angel Asturias in 1967 and Pablo Neruda from Chile in 1971. And during the Cold War, several choices were not made purely literary grounds such as Poland's Czeslaw Milosz (1980) and Jaroslav Seifert of the former Czechoslovakia (1984). Most famously, in 1970, Soviet writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn was forced to decline the prize, fearing that he would not be able to return to his country should he travel to receive it. He finally accepted the award four years later.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dario fo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayatollah khomeini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naguib mahfouz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-paul sartre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "william faulkner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcel proust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham greene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel garcia marquez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir nabokov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel beckett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wole soyinka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eyvind johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jaroslav seifert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john steinbeck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul valery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orhan pamuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry martinson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james joyce", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "odysseus elytis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabindranath tagore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czeslaw milosz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rudyard kipling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salman rushdie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ernest hemingway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alfred nobel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saul bellow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik axel karlfeldt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pablo neruda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander solzhenitsyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joseph conrad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert camus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gao xingjian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre gide", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nobel academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "academy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miguel angel asturias", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "virginia woolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egypt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iceland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guatemala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "poland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "czechoslovakia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:24:09.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85b5a6141867f87a98ec81374f2cc611b0c00de3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qzc68tZPyPUq_TYE9BHAvZFhY_xcSBm_3rb75UYevSZ58bzddaQ3fAy2M3VKaS63ryMXZu9n.3WrUlKKynDwnbQnUZ16WlXg9MU59pWJ4rOY-", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/lifestyle.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Lifestyle News- News18.com", "title": "US Carriers Issue Travel Waivers For Las Vegas", "title_full": "US Carriers Issue Travel Waivers For Las Vegas", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/lasvegas_AFP.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85b5a6141867f87a98ec81374f2cc611b0c00de3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qzc68tZPyPUq_TYE9BHAvZFhY_xcSBm_3rb75UYevSZ58bzddaQ3fAy2M3VKaS63ryMXZu9n.3WrUlKKynDwnbQnUZ16WlXg9MU59pWJ4rOY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Carriers Issue Travel Waivers For Las Vegas", "text": "1-min read US Carriers Issue Travel Waivers For Las Vegas American Airlines is allowing flyers to change their travel dates, though the waiver is a little less flexible. Updated: October 3, 2017, 6:12 PM IST Las Vegas (Photo courtesy: AFP Relaxnews/ Nick Martucci/ shutterstock.com) American carriers have issued waivers for travelers who were booked to fly in and out of Las Vegas following the horrific shooting that killed at least 59 people on Sunday. United Airlines has waived their rebooking fees for flyers who were originally scheduled to fly between October 2 and 6. Rebooking fees will be waived for new flights departing before October 13 as long as travel is rescheduled in the originally ticketed cabin or fare class between the same original cities. Likewise, American Airlines is allowing flyers to change their travel dates, though the waiver is a little less flexible. Affected flights must have been originally scheduled to fly October 2-3, and rebooked for travel up to October 6. The route must remain the same and rebooked tickets for the same cabin. Meanwhile, foreign state departments have updated their travel advice pages advising citizens to avoid the affected area in Las Vegas. The shooting also warrants a second look at safety and security recommendations for travel to the US. \"The possession of firearms and the frequency of violent crime are generally more prevalent in the US than in Canada,\" reads a Canadian government web page for the US. \"Within large metropolitan areas, violent crime more commonly occurs in economically disadvantaged neighbourhoods, particularly from dusk to dawn, and often involves alcohol and/or drug consumption. Incidents of violent crime are mainly perpetrated by gangs or members of organized crime groups. Incidents of mass shooting receive a lot of media attention, yet account for a very small percentage of all homicide deaths in the country.\" While violent crime rarely affects tourists, Canadian travelers are advised to be mindful of their surroundings, particularly at night, the advisory continues. An updated British travel advisory likewise summarizes the shooting events in Las Vegas, and reminds its 3.8 million British nationals who visit the country every year to avoid walking through quieter areas alone at night.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 6:28 PM IST File photo of Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. London : An honour bestowed on Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi by the city of Oxford has been withdrawn as a reaction to her perceived inadequate response to the plight of Rohingya Muslims in the country. The 'Freedom of Oxford' had been granted to the de facto leader of Myanmar in 1997 for her \"long struggle for democracy\" by the Oxford City Council. A cross-party motion was unanimously passed by the council on Monday which said it was \"no longer appropriate\" for her to hold the honour. Oxford City Council leader Bob Price supported the motion to remove her honour and confirmed it was an \"unprecedented step\" for the local authority. The city council will hold a special meeting to confirm that the honour is removed on November 27. Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, has close links to the city of Oxford, having lived in Park Town with her family and earlier attended St Hugh's College from 1964 until 1967. The city council's move comes days after her alma mater, St Hugh's, removed her portrait from the main college entrance. While the exact reasons for the portrait's removal were attributed to a new replacement, there is a wider view that the allegations of ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya Muslims fleeing their homes to Bangladesh is likely to be behind the move. Nearly 500,000 people belonging to Myanmar's Rohingya minority have been displaced after violence allegedly instigated by the country's military, causing a major humanitarian crisis. Suu Kyi has been Myanmar's State Counsellor, a position similar to prime minister, since April, 2016. She spent years under house arrest as a campaigner for democracy while Myanmar was ruled by a military dictatorship. She became a worldwide icon for freedom before leading her National League for Democracy to victory in open elections in November, 2015. The UK government has made repeated calls for her take a more firm stance on the violence being suffered by the Rohingyas.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "st hugh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "suu kyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aung san suu kyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob price", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "suu kyi stripped of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st hugh's college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford city council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "'freedom of oxford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rohingya", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "myanmar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park town", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aung san suu kyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oxford", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:52:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94476354edb1ec3ed1f88afa4a2fc4ffb12da363", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3wxO3nRO._gcm4fnd2W_4nGuzMjVvkhF_mzkNK9zE9JpxbropZvEQZJs8RSvkmkTeabkP7nnj6y.EPV9a0t2Fafq2.lTl3IUXrcFJaNDV.shmc94wf.9DKv", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/world.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top World News- News18.com", "title": "Pakistan's Ousted PM Nawaz Sharif Re-elected Head of Ruling PML-N Party", "title_full": "Pakistan's Ousted PM Nawaz Sharif Re-elected Head of Ruling PML-N Party", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/Nawaz1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94476354edb1ec3ed1f88afa4a2fc4ffb12da363", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3wxO3nRO._gcm4fnd2W_4nGuzMjVvkhF_mzkNK9zE9JpxbropZvEQZJs8RSvkmkTeabkP7nnj6y.EPV9a0t2Fafq2.lTl3IUXrcFJaNDV.shmc94wf.9DKv", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pakistan's Ousted PM Nawaz Sharif Re-elected Head of Ruling PML-N Party", "text": "1-min read Pakistan's Ousted PM Nawaz Sharif Re-elected Head of Ruling PML-N Party Nawas Sharif, 67, had to step down as the chief of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) after he was disqualified as the prime minister by the Supreme Court on July 28 in the Panama Papers scandal. \nPTI Updated: October 3, 2017, 5:07 PM IST Pakistan's former prime minister Nawaz Sharif speaks during a news conference in Islamabad, Pakistan September 26, 2017. (Photo: REUTERS/Faisal Mahmood) Islamabad: Nawaz Sharif was on Tuesday re-elected as the president of Pakistan's ruling PML-N party after Parliament passed a controversial bill, paving the way for the ousted prime minister's return to politics. Sharif, 67, had to step down as the chief of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) after he was disqualified as the prime minister by the Supreme Court on July 28 in the Panama Papers scandal. Under The Representation of Peoples Act 1976, a disqualified person could not hold office of a party. However, the legal hurdle in his way to become party chief was cleared yesterday when the National Assembly passed a controversial Election Bill 2017 that allows politicians disqualified from holding public office to head a political party. President Mamnoon Hussain signed the controversial Election Act 2017 into law hours after it was bulldozed through the parliament amid pandemonium on the opposition benches. PML-N leader Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry submitted Sharif's papers for party president in the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) while no one other candidate from the party contested the election. Minister of State Talal Chaudhry told media that Sharif will remain chief of PML-N. \"He will also become Prime Minister of the country. Sharif cannot be removed from politics through conspiracies, he said. The election of party president is a requirement by Election Commission of Pakistan that already last month issued notice to PML-N for failing to choose permanent successor of Sharif. Sharifs election has temporarily healed the rifts within the party which appeared on the verge of defections after his ouster. But Sharifs fate as party president still hangs in balance as Pakistan Awami Tehreek party has challenged the new law in the Lahore High Court, while Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and other parties have announced to challenge it in the Supreme Court. Opposition parties allege that the new law was \"Sharif-specific\" to allow him to return to politics.

In an article released by Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), Pyongyang responded to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's speech at the UN General Assembly last month, in which he called for \"pressure, not dialogue\" to force North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions. Kim Jong-un's regime accused Abe of \"using the 'theory of crisis on the Korean peninsula'\" for political purposes, and in particular to \"facilitate Japan's militarisation and at the same time strengthen inside unity and save the present rulers driven into a tight corner with corruption and irregularities\", reports Efe news. The article added that Abe had already shown his \"sinister political goal\" with measures such as increasing defence costs and calling snap elections. \"Japan's rackets inciting the tension of the Korean peninsula is a suicidal deed that will bring nuclear clouds to the Japanese archipelago. \"No one knows when the touch-and-go situation will lead to a nuclear war, but if so, the Japanese archipelago will be engulfed in flames in a moment,\" the article said, stressing that if the Japanese people, \"the first victim of nuclear disaster in the world, are offered in sacrifice owing to handful militarist reactionaries' political aim, it will be a tragedy of the century\".

(Photo: Reuters/Abir Sultan/Pool) Jerusalem : Israel's defence minister said on Tuesday President Bashar al-Assad was winning Syria's civil war and urged the United States to weigh in as Damascus's Iranian and Hezbollah allies gain ground. Avigdor Lieberman's comments marked a reversal for Israel, where top officials had from the outset of fighting in 2011 until mid-2015 regularly predicted Assad would lose control of his country and be toppled. \"I see a long international queue lining up to woo Assad, include Western nations, including moderate Sunnis. Suddenly everyone wants to get close to Assad,\" Lieberman told Israel's Walla news site in an interview. In late 2015, Russia helped Assad turn the tide with a military intervention that put Moscow's forces in the field alongside Israel's most potent foes - Iran and the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah - opposite Syrian rebels. The United States has focused its Syria operations on fighting rebel jihadis like Islamic State - dismaying Israel, which has tried to persuade both Washington and Moscow that Iran's expanding clout is the greater threat.

While largely keeping out of the Syrian civil war, Israel has tried to sway the world powers involved in the conflict and cautioned it could strike militarily to prevent Iran and Hezbollah entrenching further on its northern front. \"We hope the United States will be more active in the Syrian arena and the Middle East in general,\" Lieberman said. \"We are faced with Russians, Iranians, and also the Turks and Hezbollah, and this is no simple matter to deal with, on a daily basis.\" Lieberman did not elaborate on what actions he sought from the Donald Trump administration, which Israel has been lobbying for reassurances that Iranian and Hezbollah forces will not be allowed to deploy near its border or set up bases within Syria. \"The United States has quite a few challenges of its own, but as a trend - the more the United States will be active, the better it will be for the State of Israel,\" Lieberman said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "avigdor lieberma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lieberman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avigdor lieberman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hezbollah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jerusalem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "damascus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "waer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "homs", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:52:39.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "922a51ce8336c88a46cbfff9dac646a44ef46b37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3yiuFkoLRw8sRMSGYMLgklbqt3KvgS7jE1Bt88W8K_.D5pHmebpPpXJplLLOL2kenr.S830tlDLrxVJw8M_qpOcUEstih6sIzQEcF4FDLGgzA--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/world.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top World News- News18.com", "title": "Gravitational Wave Scientists Win 2017 Nobel Physics Prize", "title_full": "Gravitational Wave Scientists Win 2017 Nobel Physics Prize", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/nobel-physics.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "922a51ce8336c88a46cbfff9dac646a44ef46b37", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3yiuFkoLRw8sRMSGYMLgklbqt3KvgS7jE1Bt88W8K_.D5pHmebpPpXJplLLOL2kenr.S830tlDLrxVJw8M_qpOcUEstih6sIzQEcF4FDLGgzA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gravitational Wave Scientists Win 2017 Nobel Physics Prize", "text": "3-min read US Trio Win Nobel Prize in Physics for Finding Einstein's Gravitational Waves The work of Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne crowned half a century of experimental efforts by scientists and engineers.

Parish and Kip S. Thorne are displayed on the screen during the announcement of the winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics 2017, in Stockholm, Sweden, October 3, 2017. (Photo: Reuters) Stockholm: Three US scientists won the 2017 Nobel prize for physics on Tuesday for opening up a new era of astronomy by detecting gravitational waves, ripples in space and time foreseen by Albert Einstein a century ago. The work of Rainer Weiss, Barry Barish and Kip Thorne crowned half a century of experimental efforts by scientists and engineers. Measuring gravitational waves offers a new way to observe the cosmos, helping scientists explore the nature of mysterious objects including black holes and neutron stars. It may also provide insight into the universe's very earliest moments. The first detection of the waves created a scientific sensation when it was announced early last year and the teams involved in the discovery had been widely seen as favourites for Tuesday's prize. \"We now witness the dawn of a new field: gravitational wave astronomy,\" Nils Martensson, acting chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, told reporters. \"This will teach us about the most violent processes in the universe and it will lead to new insights into the nature of extreme gravity.\" Weiss said the award of the 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize was really a recognition of around 1,000 people working on wave detection. Two US-based instruments working in unison, called the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), detected the first waves caused by colliding black holes. A European sister facility, known as VIRGO based in Italy, has also detected waves more recently. Those spotted so far have come from very distant black holes - extraordinarily dense objects whose existence was also predicted by Einstein - that smashed together to form a single, larger black hole. JUST THE START Weiss believes this is just the start. \u201cThere are a huge amount of things ... in the universe that radiate gravitational waves. The black holes are the most obvious but there are many, many others,\" he said in a telephone call with the Nobel committee. Other experts share that excitement and said LIGO and VIRGO offered new ways to explore the fundamental nature of the universe that have so far been impossible, even with the most sophisticated telescopes. Because gravitational waves are radically different from electromagnetic waves such as radio waves, visible light, infrared light and X-rays, they are expected to reveal previously inaccessible features. \u201cThis is just the beginning of a new roller-coaster exploration of the universe,\" said Alberto Vecchio of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Gravitational Wave Astronomy. The signals from gravitational waves are extremely weak when they reach Earth and therefore require exquisitely accurate measurement. \"These represent some of the most precise measurements that are made by physicists,\" Nobel committee member David Haviland told Reuters. Designed to pick up tiny vibrations as they pass through the Earth, the laser detectors spot changes thousands of times smaller than an atomic nucleus. The scientists then convert the wave signal into sound waves and can listen to the \"chirps\" of the black holes merging. Physics is the second of this year's crop of Nobel Prizes and comes after Americans Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine on Monday. The prizes for achievements in science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the will of Swedish business tycoon Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed much of the fortune he generated from his discovery of dynamite. Among the science prizes, physics has often taken centre stage with laureates including superstars such as Einstein, Niels Bohr and Marie Curie, one of only two women to win a Nobel prize in physics.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 4:47 PM IST A YouTube grab of Maryam, the first Qatari woman to become a jockey. (YouTube.com/ France24) Doha : A Qatari woman who created ripples by appearing on television without a headscarf has broken new ground as a jockey in the conservative Gulf country, where men usually hold the reins. Maryam al-Subaiey has defied expectation and tradition -- as well as any fear of controversy -- to pursue her \"dream\" of racing horses, which even a nasty fall this year could not crush. \"I don't have to do things that society expects from me as a woman,\" Subaiey, 31, told AFP. \"I am expected to be a businesswoman and eventually get married and have kids.\" She adds: \"But being a female athlete, this is not something that is considered Qatari. \"It's just not expected. It's very different.\" Racing against tradition Subaiey's dream came true on February 24 at Qatar's pastoral Racing and Equestrian Club, a green oasis on the western fringes of the capital Doha. There, on the undercard of an eight-race meeting, she took to the track for the very first time. Subaiey didn't win -- she finished eleventh out of 14 runners in the \"Thoroughbred Handicap\" on her mount \"Comedy Night\". But more notable than her final position was the fact she competed at all. Women have raced before in Qatar -- indeed there was another non-Qatari female jockey in the same handicap and there are local media reports dating back to 2008 about a 14-year-old amateur riding at the equestrian club. But although records are not conclusive, officials told AFP that Subaiey was the first ever Qatari female jockey to take part in such a ranking event. \"I still can't believe that I am here,\" she said immediately afterwards. \"The importance of my presence here isn't just the fact that I am the first female Qatari jockey -- I am here for all female Qataris and all female Khaleejis,\" she said, referring to women from the Gulf. Backlash Her groundbreaking ride also took many in attendance by surprise. \"To be honest, I didn't think there were female jockeys here,\" said one Western racegoer. Subaiey is well-known among some Qataris. Last year, she appeared on France 24 Arabic television to discuss how Qatari women view their role in society. There was a backlash though as she appeared on screen not wearing a headscarf. One online commenter called her \"a bad example\" for Qatari women. Another more vehement poster wrote: \"Education is no good if it results in disobeying God's orders.\" Subaiey -- speaking at the racetrack without a headscarf -- responded simply: \"I have the freedom to choose what and what not to wear.\" 'Not prestigious' Subaiey's gallop into history began back in August 2014 during what she described as a \"very difficult time in my life\". She had lost her job as a video director for a local television station and wanted a change of direction. Although she had ridden horses as a child she had no experience as a jockey. But she said: \"This is something I wanted to do for a very long time. I love horses and I thought, why not?\" One of those why nots was social convention in Qatar. Being a female jockey was seen by some as \"not prestigious\" in such a traditional society, admitted Subaiey, who wears the same style of racing silks to compete in as her male jockey counterparts. But although her desire to become a jockey may have raised a few eyebrows, Subaiey said she has the support of her family, who had no prior involvement in the horse racing world, and many compatriots -- \"even Qatari men\". \"All I hear is positive comments,\" she added. \"A lot of young girls tell me that I inspire them. That's what I want to do.\" Another \"why not\" would be the number of female sports stars in Qatar. Despite using sport to brand itself globally, including in horse racing where Qatar sponsors major events in France and Britain including the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and the Goodwood Festival, there are few homegrown female sports stars. Qatar took just two female athletes to the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio, even fewer than the four in London in 2012, the first time Qatar had taken female competitors to the Games. Disaster strikes As part of her training to become a jockey, Subaiey has trained with noted British jockey Steve Smith Eccles at his school in the British \"racing capital\", Newmarket. She was training hard for up to six hours a day. However, disaster struck in her second race back home in March. She fell from her horse, sustaining severe injuries, including a double fracture to her pelvis. \"My family was so devastated, but they know I am going to go back to racing. They know I am stubborn and they know I can never say no,\" she said. Subaiey plans to get back in the saddle and continue her training in Newmarket in October. \"If anything, more than ever before, I have something to prove.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "maryam al-subaiey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khaleejis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "subaiey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve smith eccles", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "racing and equestrian club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "youtube", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "doha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newmarket", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:52:39.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "44cb8b23806b4ff0855026a4bb06410943ab75e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3wFN3wQKvuNZzkY0.EUpWpnoQRv3XByo4mnwnrYNg65cjOnVgzMlasKu5HkOub8DAHfrxhgzOEnxYcNbXAndTZS", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/world.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top World News- News18.com", "title": "Xi Jinping Revamps PLA Ahead of His CPC Congress", "title_full": "Xi Jinping Revamps PLA Ahead of His CPC Congress", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/08/Xi-Jinping.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "44cb8b23806b4ff0855026a4bb06410943ab75e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3wFN3wQKvuNZzkY0.EUpWpnoQRv3XByo4mnwnrYNg65cjOnVgzMlasKu5HkOub8DAHfrxhgzOEnxYcNbXAndTZS", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Xi Jinping Revamps PLA Ahead of His CPC Congress", "text": "3-min read Chinese President Xi Jinping Revamps PLA Ahead of His CPC Congress The reshuffle comes prior to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) which will open in Beijing from October 18 and the meeting is widely expected to confer a second five-year term to Xi as General Secretary. Updated: October 3, 2017, 4:38 PM IST File photo of Chinese President Xi Jinping. (REUTERS) Beijing : Chinese President Xi Jinping has reshuffled the top leadership of the powerful PLA, packing it with a new set of generals, vastly strenghtening his power base in the world's largest military ahead of the Congress of the ruling Communist party. The reshuffle comes prior to the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) which will open here from October 18. The meeting is widely expected to confer a second five-year term to Xi as General Secretary. Two top officials, Gen. Fang Fenghui, head of the Joint Staff Department Central Military Commission (CMC), and Gen. Zhang Yang, head of its Political Work Department have been removed in the latest shake up of the 2.3 million strong PLA, increasing Xi's dominance over the military. Xi heads the all-powerful CMC the overall high command of the PLA and he is the only civilian in the 11-member body. The \"ousting\" of Fang and Zhang is further proof that Xi is \"cementing his control over the military\", the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported today. Fang has been replaced by Gen. Li Zuocheng, a decorated veteran of the Sino-Vietnamese war and Admiral Miao Hua, formerly the PLA Navy's political commissar has been appointed as head of the Political Work Department in the place of Gen. Zhang. Xi promoted Li to full general and Miao to the equivalent naval rank in 2015 and both men are seen as being firmly in his camp, the Post report said. He heads the Presidency and the military, which makes him far more powerful compared to his predecessor, Hu Jintao. In his first term, Xi has carried out a massive anti-graft campaign in the party and the military in which thousands of officials from top to bottom were either punished or purged. \"Whatever option will be chosen, the first thing Xi will do is to root out the harmful influence left by the two disgraced CMC vice-chairmen, Guo Boxiong and Xu Caihou,\" the Post quoted an official as saying. Guo and Xu became the most senior military officers probed for buying and selling military ranks and other forms of corruption in the sweeping anti-graft campaign launched by Xi soon after he became party general secretary in November 2012. Since then, at least 13,000 military officers involved in corruption have been punished, the Post quoted a report by the PLA Daily, official organ of the Chinese military as saying. Guo, 75, was sentenced to life imprisonment in July last year and Xu died of cancer at the age of 72 in 2015 while in custody and under investigation for graft. Since he took over Xi's focus remained on revamping the military. In an unprecedented overhaul, he had announced that PLA would shed three lakh troops, taking their number down to two million. He has also cut the size of the army to a million and vastly increased the role of the navy and the air force to assist Chinas global push for influence. He had also scrapped the PLAs four former headquarters General Staff, General Political, General Logistics and General Armaments and established 15 functional departments to divide their powers. The PLAs seven military commands were also reshaped into five theatre commands. Xi will use the party congress to restructure the CMC, the Post quoted officials as saying. He may either trim the size of the 11-member CMC to just the chairman and four vice-chairmen or induct heads of the five theatre commands into the high power body. The current CMC comprises one chairman, two vice-chairmen, and eight regular members: the defence minister, the heads of the four former headquarters, and the commanders of the air force, navy and rocket force. \"Rooting out the harmful influence of Guo and Xu is one of the key reasons Xi needs to reform the CMC,\" Beijing-based military expert Li Jie told the Post. The structure of the commission also needs to fit the ongoing military overhaul, with thousands of senior officers being laid off, he said. Shanghai-based political commentator Chen Daoyin said Xi was intent on reforming the CMC to strengthen his hand against those in the party opposed to his new political thinking. Xi hoped his political ideas would to be in included in the party constitution at the upcoming congress, like those of his predecessors Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, and become part of the partys political guidelines. \"But it seems there are some different voices inside the party against him,\" Chen told Post. \"The removal Fang and Zhang and reform the CMC could remind his opponents that Xi has absolute dominance in the army, which helped put the Communist Party in power,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

(Getty Images) New Delhi: Former Australia opener feels that the recent incident involving Ben stokes has diverted all the attention from cricket, and that could have contrasting effects on the team. Stokes and his England teammate Alex Hales was handed indefinite bans by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The matter is currently under investigation, after which the ECB is will make a decision on the future of the team. The southpaw also drew parallels from the 2013 incident that involved David Warner, and how the then coach Darren Lehmann handled the situation. Rogers told The Mirror, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a factor; I just think it needs to be addressed. You have to get it out in the open, deal with it and move on. Credit to Darren Lehmann, that\u2019s what he did.

It could have the opposite effect as well \u2014 it could cause a bit of friction, but it\u2019ll come down to the characters involved and the leaders, they\u2019re the most important people,\u201d Rogers added. Rogers also hinted that it may not be the best idea to leave stokes out of the team right now, but could lead to more problems if he is allowed to play without getting a closure on the issue. \u201cIt will be interesting to see which characters step up to fill the void.

(Getty Images) New Delhi: Karnataka off-spinner Krishnappa Gowtham, who was barred by the BCCI from playing Duleep Trophy and India A series due to disciplinary reasons, has tendered unconditional apology but the matter is still being referred to the disciplinary committee.Gowtham had played the opening Duleep Trophy game for India Red and got five wickets but left for Bengaluru after the match, claiming that he was down with typhoid.However, he chose to play a T20 match in the Karnataka Premier League (KPL) match without taking permission from the BCCI. Gowtham was show caused by BCCI GM (Game Development) Ratnakar Shetty and was barred from taking further part in the Duleep Trophy and his name was struck off from the India A squad that played two 'Tests' against New Zealand A. While tendering \"unconditional apology\", Gowtham gave a weird explanation as to why he played KPL game on September 12 for the Belgavi Panthers. \"I thought it was typhoid but it turned out to be viral fever,\" Gowtham wrote in his apology letter. Gowtham felt that \"bowling four overs and fielding for 85 minutes\" was permissible being blissfully unaware that he is on selectors' radar having done well in the India A series in South Africa and was supposed to play against New Zealand A. The BCCI disciplinary committee comprising President CK Khanna, senior politician Jyotiraditya Scindia and Niranjan Shah will now take a call on his future. When contacted, Khanna told PTI, \"Yes, I have received his apology letter. In my view, it has been a huge mistake on Gowtham's part to have disrespected a tournament of Duleep Trophy's stature. He has apologised unconditionally. He is a youbng cricketer and we need to look at his career ahead. \u201cWhile I want him to give a written undertaking, I haven't yet discussed with Mr Shah and Mr Scindia in this regard.\" It is learnt that the selection committee is so peeved, that it will be difficult for the 28-year-old Gowtham to get the nod for the national teams in near future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ratnakar shetty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duleep trophy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scindia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gowtham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jyotiraditya scindia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niranjan shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "krishnappa gowtham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ck khanna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khanna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bcci refers matter to disciplinary panel k gowtham tenders apology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bcci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgavi panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kpl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka premier league", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:55:06.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98711135d9322ee5c54c08988716226972adb425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1FmJcPQPaoPeYye17aFSy0lHudJ94CgBoM_zWuPzrkWFAlZ1DrKtkSGQO2Mpx383Mdm2b1XD5Lb3QJZrXsg9sXQpeKG1aGrIdZK544ehgVh83NaeBx9YY2aDDHfTWZCkjaFkLG_779Gow--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/cricketnext.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Cricketnext News- News18.com", "title": "3rd October 2007: Mark Boucher Pips Ian Healy for Keeper With Most Dismissals", "title_full": "3rd October 2007: Mark Boucher Pips Ian Healy for Keeper With Most Dismissals", "published": "2017-10-03T21:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/05/boucher_0505getty_875.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98711135d9322ee5c54c08988716226972adb425", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1FmJcPQPaoPeYye17aFSy0lHudJ94CgBoM_zWuPzrkWFAlZ1DrKtkSGQO2Mpx383Mdm2b1XD5Lb3QJZrXsg9sXQpeKG1aGrIdZK544ehgVh83NaeBx9YY2aDDHfTWZCkjaFkLG_779Gow--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T21:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "3rd October 2007: Mark Boucher Pips Ian Healy for Keeper With Most Dismissals", "text": "3rd October 2007: Mark Boucher Pips Ian Healy for Keeper With Most Dismissals   6:15 PM IST \nA file photo of former South Africa wicketkeeper Mark Boucher.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 6:37 PM IST A poster of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI). New Delhi : CPI(M)'s Youth Wing, Democratic Youth Federation of India (DFYI), has moved the Supreme Court urging judiciary not to deport Rohingya children as it would be a violation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, as children are being \"slaughtered as part of ethnic cleansing in Myanmar\". A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra stated that the apex court will hear the matter on October 13. The petitioner organisation has contended that under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, deportation of the child refugees in Rohingya camps must be safeguarded. \"Children arriving in the camps have already endured long and dangerous journeys. Many of them have lost family members in the ethnic violence and have reached the refugee camps, separated and unaccompanied. If the Rohingya children in the refugee camps are deported to Myanmar, a country where in thousands of such children are slaughtered as part of the ethnic cleansing, it will be the violation of Articles 2,6,7,19,20,22,31 and 37 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989, which India ratified in December, 1992,\" reads the petition. CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat told News18 that the party's official stand has been to stop the deportation of Rohingyas. \"The official stand of the party has been to stop the deportation of helpless Rohingya Muslims on the ground of compassion and humanity. DYFI as a youth organisation has pleaded for the children, but we as an organisation are against the decision to deport them,\" she said. The Petition also alleges violation of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India, highlighting the fact that Tibetans, the Chakmas of Bangladesh, Afghans and Tamils from Sri Lanka have been given refuge in India. There is, therefore, no rationale in discriminating against Rohingya refugees, it contends. DYFI has claimed that the environment in Myanmar is not conducive for children to stay and that the government should find a way to arrange for their care in India. \"Union of India shall find alternate care for the child such as foster care, adoption or Kafalah of Islamic law. Any other action other than this will be a violation of Article 37 of the convention. Article 37 of the Convention ensures that children shall never be subject to torture,\" submitted DYFI through its petition. The petitioner has also submitted a list of dates by which the petitioner has shown that Rohingyas came into being in Myanmar from 4th Century and that the current persecution is atrocious. The government affidavit had claimed that the Rohingyas are nothing but a drain on natural resources, but the petitioner contends that \"a child growing up with healthy educational and cultural opportunities is a hope to humanity. This may be the reason why Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore penned, 'every time a child is born, it brings with it the hope That God is not yet Disappointed with man'.\"", "highlightText": "",

Khan \nPhoto Credit: Getty Images \nKabul: Such is Rashid Khan\u2019s popularity that even a suicide blast at Kabul\u2019s main cricket stadium couldn\u2019t keep his fans away \u2014 and the teenager is now eyeing the sport\u2019s big prizes as his international profile grows.The 19-year-old leg spinner started playing with a tennis ball in the remote and poor province of Nangarhar, but he has now starred in the Indian Premier League and will soon make his debut in Australia\u2019s Big Bash League. \nAt last month\u2019s Shpageeza Cricket League, Afghanistan\u2019s Twenty20 domestic tournament, he became the youngest player to take 100 T20 wickets as he helped the Band-e-Amir Dragons to victory. \nKhan\u2019s success has helped elevate cricket\u2019s profile in Afghanistan, where most players were introduced to the sport in refugee camps in Pakistan after fleeing the 1979-1989 Soviet occupation. \nEven after a suicide bomber blew himself up within metres of the Kabul stadium, killing three people, Khan\u2019s fans continued to flock to watch him play. \nThey waved the Afghan national flag and chanted songs for Khan, some showing their devotion by painting his name on their bodies. \n\u201cI play cricket to bring victories for my country and to make Afghanistan proud on the world stage,\u201d Khan told AFP in an interview in Kabul. \nThis year, Khan became the first Afghan to play in the lucrative IPL, and he will also be the first from his country in the Big Bash League when he turns out for the Adelaide Strikers in December. \nAdelaide Strikers coach Jason Gillespie hailed Rashid\u2019s signing as a \u201cmajor coup\u201d when it was announced last month. \n\u201cRashid has set the world alight in T20 cricket with his energy, enthusiasm, and great control for a young guy,\u201d Gillespie said. \n\u201cHe has some great variations, can bowl stump-to-stump and can be very hard to pick.\u201d \nKhan was born during the Taliban\u2019s 1996-2001 rule, when sport was considered a distraction from religious studies. \nHe learned cricket by studying the techniques of Indian batting great Sachin Tendulkar and Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi on television, and then practising outside in the dirt with his brothers using a tennis ball. \nKhan, one of 12 children, began his professional career in Afghanistan\u2019s domestic league where his deceptive bowling technique soon caught the attention of national selectors. At 17, he made his international debut against Zimbabwe. \nSince then Khan has been on a rollercoaster ride, taking 63 wickets in 29 one-day internationals, including the fourth best figures in one-day history \u2014 seven for 18 against the West Indies in June. \nHe is also the first bowler to take a hat-trick in the T20 Caribbean Premier League, when playing for the Guyana Amazon Warriors. \n\u201cNow I want to play against the world\u2019s best and to challenge the best teams on their home turf,\u201d said Khan. \nKhan\u2019s ascension to cricket poster boy in Afghanistan has coincided with the sport\u2019s stunning revival in the country. \nAfghanistan was catapulted into the elite club of Test nations in June and made its landmark debut at Lord\u2019s the following month. \n\u201cI want to bring Afghanistan the cricket World Cup \u2014 this is the ultimate goal of my life,\u201d said Khan, a comment that may not be as far-fetched as it sounds. \nFormer England captain Adam Hollioake, who coached one of the six teams in Afghanistan\u2019s domestic T20 tournament last month, believes the country \u201ccould be top six in the world\u201d within a decade. \n\u201cI really believe the talent and passion is here in this country,\u201d Hollioake told AFP. \nAfghanistan Cricket Board chief executive Shafiqullah Stanekzai told AFP he was optimistic about the sport\u2019s future in the country. \nCricket is going \u201cfrom strength to strength\u201d and there are plans to build five international-standard stadiums over the next three years, he said. \n\u201cWe need five stadiums with capacity of between 15,000 and 30,000 as it is obvious that cricket is the number one sport and we have so many people coming to the grounds even in our domestic games,\u201d he said. \nAs the Taliban insurgency marks its 16th anniversary, ethnic divisions deepen and civilian casualties rise, cricket could serve a greater purpose than just entertainment, said Khan. \n\u201cI believe the game of cricket\u2026 is a binding force and brings many ethnic groups together and can restore peace and stability to Afghanistan,\u201d he said. \nFirst Published:

Amit Shah's Kerala Yatra May Struggle to Make Much Headway It is this huge divide or gap in perception that the Amit Shah yatra hopes to bridge. That the Kerala Hindu has no real affiliation with the BJP's national interests or 'hidden agenda' (cow, Hindi, Gujarat, Hindu Rashtra, destablising Congress or CPM governments) is a problem the BJP has to confront when trying to position itself as the Third Force. Updated: October 3, 2017, 7:22 PM IST BJP president Amit Shah delivering a speech during his rally in Kerala. Kerala's critics often comment that the state is a tourist destination because of the many \"yatras\" that take place throughout the year. If people are not journeying 'to' the state they are journeying 'within'. Such internal journeys also embody Kerala's inner struggle to come to terms with its many paradoxes and frustrations. If it is not a yatra for environment, it is a yatra to close down a polluting factory. If it is not a yatra for a politician to emphasise his emergence, it is a yatra for a national politician to announce his imminent victory in the polls. Yatras are taken out both by the vanquished and the victorious as if such Yatras are an end in themselves, albeit a journey that never ends. To one of these categories belong the Jan Raksha Yatra (People's Protection March) led by the BJP National President Amit Shah flagged off from the northern point of Kerala today (October 3) and will end in the southern most point of the state on October 17. Shah will be present on the first day and the last and during the intevening period he will be making many speeches and exhortations and clarion calls in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, both going to elections soon. Union HRD minister Prakash Javadekar is leading a phalanx of central ministers who will be in Kerala during the Yatra, which will make it the largest concentration of BJP leaders in Kerala at any time in the recent past. It is a state which the BJP had given up for 'lost' long time back, but Shah is not willing to give it up without some serious effort. \"The CPI(M) is desperate and on a killing spree. It is doing murder politics in its desperation and people, including from the CPI(M), are joining the BJP. We will use democratic means to answer its violence,\" Javadekar told a press confernce on Gandhi Jayanthi, October 2. In answer, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said the people know what the RSS-BJP really does and that Shah's party will be rebuffed. BJP's first major assault on Kerala during the last state elections resulted in just one seat, but it raised its vote share to 15% from about 6% which is a commendable effort. Amit Shah's strategy at that time was to split the Ezhava (affluent OBC caste) vote and align it with a so-called Ezhava party BDJS, formed expressly for this purpose by Vellapally Natesan who controls many Ezhava socio cultural organisations. This Ezhava-woooing strategy backfired badly and apart from the new party BDJS, Natesan's assiduously built reputation as a King-maker also lay in tatters. No wonder he now wants to quit the BJP alliance and the NDA. In fact there was an Ezhava consolidation in favour of the CPM which was always seen as a Ezhava party. The reason was two fold: the liquor policy of the UDF (gradually tapering of liquor sales) was going to hurt the Ezhavas and two, the Ezhavas felt that the Muslims were making inroads into many of their business interests in central and south Kerala. This added to the overall perception that the UDF government was pro-minority (Christian and Muslim ministers dominated) and so the upper castes too in many pockets voted for the CPM. Kerala's Hindus never considered BJP as a viable political alternative and compounding the irony, voted for the Left Front perched at the other end of the political spectrum. To add to the irony or paradox, the Nairs (who have many RSS supporters) too decided that first they will have to take care of the rise of Muslim affluence and then later think of BJP. The situation hasn't changed much now for the Kerala Hindu to suddenly embrace the BJP in big numbers. It is this huge divide or gap in perception that the Amit Shah yatra hopes to bridge. That the Kerala Hindu has no real affiliation with the BJP's national interests or 'hidden agenda' (Cow, Hindi, Gujarat, Hindu Rashtra, destablising Congress or CPM governments) is a problem the BJP has to confront when trying to position itself as the Third Force. What does it have to offer Kerala? A state without beef and alcohol and the gradual propagation of Hindi is unimaginable to the Kerala Hindu who loves his temples and its festivals but has never moved outside the strict confines of Nehruvian socialism and Constitutional strictures. In fact the present Congress is more socialist that the CPM itself whose chief minister is trying to sell off dead state properties like Aluminium factory in Kundara, Kollam, and maybe rightly so. The BJP yatra is trying to project the CPM as a Maoist party which indulges in killings of its political opponents. This is terribly old wine in a old bottle, tired many years over by the Congress since the killing stretches back to two decades. The CPM cadres have also killed its own rebels. The RSS has also not been lacking in strength in retaliatory killings. As if that was not enough the RSS strengthened its love-jihad campaign in Kerala, resulting recently in the confinement of 24-year-old Hindu convert to Islam whose case the Supreme Court is hearing. It is true that various Islamist hardliner groups are running institutions of dubious nature in north Kerala. So the BJP-RSS now have to fight on two fronts: Against Islamist forces and against the CPM, two of the most entrenched powers in the state. It is a two-pronged task that is bound to fail both short term and midterm. Also because polarising the Hindu vote, the tested Amit Shah strategy, has not worked in Kerala. In the land of yatras it is no surprise that another yatra is on the way to get the 24-year-old converted girl Hadiya released from custody. This 'Chalo Kerala' March is moving in the opposite direction to the Jan Raksha Yatra. The two yatras collide not just on the streets but in the Kerala's febrile argumentative space which now is in turmoil with Shah and his Hindutva brigade trying to plant yet another political idea in that fertile soil.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "natesan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hadiya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madhya pradesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "javadekar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vellapally natesan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yatras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gandhi jayanthi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinarayi vijayan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prakash javadekar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ezhavas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hindu rashtra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cpm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "third force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerala hindu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nda", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kerala yatra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kundara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kollam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chalo kerala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amit shah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:15:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a5c1f6ea25695de59305c210b60569a56c3c17b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1E2IOtoEV8onrfqAFbSsn7W4LwQ39wT8t8N8N4_IazIy9ZVLClV_nw7A2XgxenheqkP1LNaW9ZbqGV8hFpSnmZSFq7y4YSE9R4lg2.HYbTH1Q--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/cricketnext.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Cricketnext News- News18.com", "title": "Ashwin, Vijay Return For Tamil Nadu in Ranji Trophy Opener", "title_full": "Ashwin, Vijay Return For Tamil Nadu in Ranji Trophy Opener", "published": "2017-10-03T22:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/12/ashwin_2912_Reuters.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7a5c1f6ea25695de59305c210b60569a56c3c17b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCByaB.DueuT2wCoMuF44Vx1E2IOtoEV8onrfqAFbSsn7W4LwQ39wT8t8N8N4_IazIy9ZVLClV_nw7A2XgxenheqkP1LNaW9ZbqGV8hFpSnmZSFq7y4YSE9R4lg2.HYbTH1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ashwin, Vijay Return For Tamil Nadu in Ranji Trophy Opener", "text": "Ashwin, Vijay Return For Tamil Nadu in Ranji Trophy Opener PTI | Updated: October 3, 2017, 7:33 PM IST \nPhoto Credit: Reuters Chennai: Ignored for India's Twenty20 series against Australia, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has been named in the 15-member Tamil Nadu Ranji squad along with Test opener Murali Vijay for the season opener against Andhra Pradesh, starting Friday.The team, to be led by Abhinav Mukund, would miss the services of the experienced batsman-wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik and all-rounder Vijay Shankar. Karthik has been picked for the T20 series against Australia while Shankar features in the Board President's XI to face New Zealand. The team includes exciting all-rounder Washington Sundar, who has impressed with his recent performances including in the Duleep Trophy final. Baba Indrajith, who scored a double ton on his Duleep Trophy debut, would be Mukund's deputy. The team also features aggressive wicketkeeper-batsman N Jagadeesan and another wicketkeeper in R Rohith, who shone in the recent Tamil Nadu Premier League. In the absence of T Natarajan and Aswin Crist due to fitness issues, the pace attack would be led by K Vignesh, who did well in his debut season with 30-plus wickets as Tamil Nadu made the semifinals. L Vignesh and V Lakshman are the other pacemen named in the squad. With the wicket at the M A Chidambaram Stadium likely to assist the spinners, the selectors have picked three specialists apart from Ashwin and Washington Sundar. \"It is a good team. We have a mix of experience and youth. The availability of Ashwin and Vijay is certain to bolster the squad,\" Chairman of selectors Sridharan Sharath told PTI.

(Image: Reuters) Sao Paulo: Little more than a year has gone by since Tite took over as coach of a Brazil side still reeling from embarrassing exits in the World Cup and Copa America; but in that short time he has transformed the team into title favourites for Russia 2018. No one could have imagined just how influential the former Corinthians coach would be but nine wins in 10 World Cup qualifiers are just reward for a return to the form that won them a record five World Cup titles. \"There is no questioning the enormous quality of Brazil's players, Tite and backroom staff,\" the normally cautious former World Cup winner Tostao wrote before the final two qualifiers against Bolivia and Chile. \"The team is ready.\" Tite retained several players who had misfired under Luiz Felipe Scolari during the 2014 World Cup and his successor Dunga but he transformed their front line with the introduction of attack-minded youngsters Philippe Coutinho and Gabriel Jesus. In midfield he recalled Paulinho and Renato Augusto, his former charges at Corinthians. With Real Madrid's Casemiro an automatic choice to anchor the team and Neymar still the undisputed talisman, the side is settled and there are no major disagreements over the first 11 for the first time in years. Tite's task between now and next June is mostly deciding who will support those leading men. The problem, if there is one, comes with Brazil's almost customary overconfidence. They are the only side to play in every World Cup and even after their 7-1 hammering by Germany in the 2014 semi-finals on home soil, they believe they are special. Just as in 2006, when Brazil sailed through the qualifiers with players like Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Ronaldinho and Adriano, they go to Russia as one of the clear favourites. But Brazil were knocked out at the quarter-final stage by France and over confidence was one of the reasons cited. Tite is a master of playing down expectations and - crucially in a nation that famously has 200 million coaches \u2013 he commands the respect of both players and press. That has given him an authority that few Brazil managers this century have enjoyed and he has used it to warn their outstanding form is no guarantee of success. \"We are at a stage of strengthening, consolidating and growing,\" he said when announcing his squad for this week's games. \"We're not in the comfort zone stage but rather a confidence zone stage.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tite", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tostao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casemiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippe coutinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel jesus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto carlos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adriano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luiz felipe scolari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renato augusto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neymar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tite turns brazil around little", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "real madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corinthians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronaldinho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolivia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chile", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "copa america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:37:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c4ead355f132d8b5b04b306c4cd1a92a932450a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDOqDfpkxx_MyuXAcOkMEUz.eDf_RXKP8z9WVUP0Lh9IEwJ0o3RkTX.koYKVrH6TNixt.dwGv2.D9rd1ANShU85t", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/sports.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Sports News- News18.com", "title": "2018 Commonwealth Games Baton Arrives in Delhi", "title_full": "2018 Commonwealth Games Baton Arrives in Delhi", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/edited-baton.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c4ead355f132d8b5b04b306c4cd1a92a932450a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDOqDfpkxx_MyuXAcOkMEUz.eDf_RXKP8z9WVUP0Lh9IEwJ0o3RkTX.koYKVrH6TNixt.dwGv2.D9rd1ANShU85t", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "2018 Commonwealth Games Baton Arrives in Delhi", "text": "2018 Commonwealth Games Baton Arrives in Delhi The Baton reached India from Pakistan, and will go to Bangladesh next Updated: October 3, 2017, 6:52 PM IST A file photo of Baton for 2018 games.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 7:00 PM IST Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal (Getty Images) Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are two greats who have taken men's tennis to a pedestal it had never reached before. They are the two most successful players in the history of the sport in terms of Grand Slam wins, and their rivalry over the years has been the stuff of legend. But Federer though doesn't think that a movie would be made on their duels any time soon. But that didn't stop him from naming the Hollywood stars that he would want to see play him on the silver screen. Recently the movie \u2018Borg vs. McEnroe\u2019 was released, which focusses on the rivalry between the two legends who ruled the roost on the tennis court in late 70s and early 80s. The Swiss ace was quizzed during the premiere of the movie about whether he thinks a movie could be made on the titanic battles between him and Nadal. Federer answered in the negative but went on to name Academy Award winner Leonardo Di Caprio among the stars he would want to see play himself if a movie is ever made. \u201cI doubt there ever will be a movie about Rafa and me,\u2019 he said. \u2018But if there is, I\u2019d like Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio or a James Bond like guy to play me,\u201d he said. When asked who Federer would like to play as an actor, he narrowed down the list to just one. \u201cI would like to be Leonardo DiCaprio. He recently won an Oscar and makes great films. I think it\u2019s pretty good right now,\u201d said Federer referring to DiCaprio\u2019s first Oscar for The Revenant. Sweden's Bjorn Borg and American John McEnroe played each other in four Grand Slam finals with both winning two apiece. While Borg was known for his cool and calm demeanor on the court, McEnroe was pretty much the angry young man of the tennis scene of that era. His verbal battles with chair umpires are now part of tennis folklore. \u201cThey have incredible stories,\u2019 said Federer, who will battle it out for the World No 1 ranking with Nadal, to Spanish sports daily AS. \u201cIt was more rock and roll, let\u2019s be honest. Today it\u2019s very professional\u2014but still we have a good time. But it\u2019s also very similar to some extent. We can be rivals and yet get along, and I think me and Nadal have shown that, as McEnroe and Borg did.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger federer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james bond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mcenroe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt damon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcenroe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leo dicaprio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonardo dicaprio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dicaprio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjorn borg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonardo di caprio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "getty images", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:37:05.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3d9b4ed5dc32c2bdbeb0f41fcf6219bd494950cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDMfKsoNMGO6P4OoWr7Xt6R2A8cbSSEJaKjGUJVxdWrxzZL212LHbpNYGSbOVztKwR7bT2Pwfkk1xwRl9JGpPecQ", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/sports.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Sports News- News18.com", "title": "PSG Terror Attack Foiled by French Police", "title_full": "PSG Terror Attack Foiled by French Police", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2015/11/psg_1911getty_750-e1507038492599.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3d9b4ed5dc32c2bdbeb0f41fcf6219bd494950cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDMfKsoNMGO6P4OoWr7Xt6R2A8cbSSEJaKjGUJVxdWrxzZL212LHbpNYGSbOVztKwR7bT2Pwfkk1xwRl9JGpPecQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "PSG Terror Attack Foiled by French Police", "text": "1-min read PSG Terror Attack Foiled by French Police In February 2016, the terrorists had attacked Stade de France, when France were playing Germany. In that attack three people were killed. Updated: October 3, 2017, 8:07 PM IST Image Credit: Getty Images. New Delhi: On Saturday, France police uncovered a possible terror attack on the PSG team. The explosives were found near the Parc des Princes stadium, a few hours before PSG took on Bordeaux in a French Ligue 1 encounter. The improvised explosive device is said to have been made up of four gas cylinders soaked in petrol. According to The Daily Mail,\"Five suspects were arrested at the scene, including a known radical with links to Islamist movements.\" All four gas cylinders were lined to a mobile phone that could ignite the cylinders so causing an explosion, the report quoted a French official as saying. France\u2019s Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said that the suspect may have used a friend who looked like him to evade those watching him. \u201cWhen you watch someone, there is always a nebula, a friend ready to help the one who is on the file,\u201d Collomb shared with the France Inter radio station. \"This shows that the level of the threat in France is extremely important,\" he added.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 7:49 PM IST File: Alvaro Morata (Getty Images) Madrid : Spain and Chelsea striker Alvaro Morata's hamstring problem could leave him sidelined for several weeks after tests with the national team revealed he has a grade two tear. Morata had an MRI scan on Sunday after limping off during Chelsea's 1-0 Premier League home defeat by Manchester City on Saturday. According to British media reports on Tuesday, the injury could keep him out for at least six weeks. Spain manager Julian Lopetegui on Monday called up 36-year-old Athletic Bilbao striker Aritz Aduriz to replace Morata, with the Blues forward missing Spain's final World Cup 2018 qualifying matches against Albania and Israel. Spain are also missing injured duo Andres Iniesta of Barcelona and Dani Carvajal of Real Madrid, replaced by Las Palmas' Jonathan Viera and Real Sociedad's Avaro Odriozola, as the Group G leaders bid to earn a place at the finals in Russia. The Spaniards are three points clear of second-placed Italy with just the two rounds of matches remaining. Chelsea signed Morata from Real Madrid in the close season and the striker has flourished at Stamford Bridge, with seven goals in nine appearances for Antonio Conte's champions.

(Source: Germany Twitter) The face mask is a fairly common sight in modern football now as players with facial injuries use it as a form protection to get through a match unscathed. The mask - holds together the angular bones of the visage while they slowly heal. At the upcoming FIFA U-17 World, German left winger John Yeboah will be the one with the mask as he attempts to protect a broken nose which he sustained just before leaving for India. Yeboah is one of two players of Ghanain origin in the German team and plays for the VfL Wolfsburg juniors. The smiling bloke might be restricted in emoting and talking while wearing the mask, but he continued to be a buzzing presence during their first practice on Monday. Yeboah did not bother about the injury or the harm that might come from a second knock and continued to hog possession during the short practice match. The winger went about business as usual, though he\u2019s likely to don the superhero-like mask through the fortnight. \u201cHe broke his nose in one of the previous matches in Germany and therefore needs protection. The mask is carbon fibre so provides optimum protection,\u201d a team training staff said. Other masked men The man who made the protective headgear famous by wearing it for the longest was Peter Cech, he donned it for 9 years after a serious collision fractured his skull. In 2011, he needed to wear a mask under the helmet. Chelsea players have been freakishly prone to facial injuries \u2014 and all of Ramires, Paulo Ferreira, Pedro, Demba Ba, Cesc Fabregas, Fernando Torres, Nemanja Matic, Gary Cahill, Diego Costa and Cesar have worn the mask as the Blues with black eyes became a common feature. Paolo Maldini wore one of the earliest models in 2003, and flying elbows are not uncommon inside the penalty box when defending corners, but it was Alberto Aquilani who cut the most pained of frames with dipping eyes when in fact his leather-like strapping blunted out that distinctive nose. Yeboah, with his winsome curls, might be the first Zorro to hit Indian shores, and should he start in the XI, it\u2019ll be difficult to miss the busybody on the pitch \u2014 never mind the constricting shield with double-banded elastics.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john yeboah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramires", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "demba ba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paolo maldini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter cech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulo ferreira", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fernando torres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nemanja matic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary cahill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diego costa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto aquilani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yeboah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cesc fabregas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cesar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany twitter", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wolfsburg", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:37:05.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f601851d0e8b32abf1cc34befb97af32f231e7b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDMMwDTUmSMzyJJTVfSs0yElVV_HgicNsTvgB4wHWYQGeWqeLaBi9srYBnV0G9iIgNXGwV0tUxs00K4dBdzp8Qe5EU2cN_7cABUF2YVXABEV5g--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/sports.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Sports News- News18.com", "title": "Wales Forward Gareth Bale Ruled Out of World Cup qualifiers", "title_full": "Wales Forward Gareth Bale Ruled Out of World Cup qualifiers", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/06/GarethBale_1406_getty.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f601851d0e8b32abf1cc34befb97af32f231e7b6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDMMwDTUmSMzyJJTVfSs0yElVV_HgicNsTvgB4wHWYQGeWqeLaBi9srYBnV0G9iIgNXGwV0tUxs00K4dBdzp8Qe5EU2cN_7cABUF2YVXABEV5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Wales Forward Gareth Bale Ruled Out of World Cup qualifiers", "text": "1-min read Wales Forward Gareth Bale Ruled Out of World Cup qualifiers Wales forward Gareth Bale has been ruled out of their crucial last two World Cup qualifiers against Georgia and Ireland due to a calf injury, The Football Association of Wales said on Tuesday.

Wales need to top the group to secure an automatic place in Russia but will go through to the playoffs if they finish second.

The first member of the India U-17 football team to take the field on October 6, against USA will be the boy wearing number 8 - Amarjit Singh Kiyam. Updated: October 3, 2017, 6:31 PM IST Amarjit Singh Kiyam (Twitter) New Delhi: In the world\u2019s largest democracy, Indian football quite aptly chose their first FIFA World Cup by democratic methods under the orders of their Portugese coach Luis Norton de Matos. 16 year old Amarjit Singh was to be the unanimous choice amongst the players. The first member of the India U-17 football team to take the field on October 6, against USA will be the boy wearing number 8 - Amarjit Singh Kiyam. Well known as a driving force in his team, Amarjit will be part of the machine room of the team. The Andres Iniesta fan is known to have the stomach for tough battle, on the field and off the field. Amarjit\u2019s coach at the Chandigarh Football Academy (CFA), Sandeep Singh recollects an incident from 2014, where the young boy\u2019s ankle was hurt to the extent he could not put on his shoes, on the morrow was a crucial semi-final. Amarjit was to be the eventual difference in that semi-final scoring the winner to CFA to the summit clash. \u201cHe sat till 4 in the morning and iced his ankle so that he would get fit for the match. He always knew what he meant to the team,\u201d says his coach who saw him develop into the dynamite midfielder from 2011. Born in a small town called Thoubal in Manipur, Amarjit\u2019s initiation to the beautiful game was with his older brother Umakanta Singh Kiyam, his cousin Jeackson Singh and his uncle Diven Singh. While Umakanta was away at the St Stephens Academy in Chandigarh, the two cousins \u2013 now national teammates \u2013 would train with Diven Singh. \u201cMy brother used to play in competitions in the village and by the time he was 8 or 9 people knew him to be a good player. He was younger than most he played with, but he had a lot of stamina,\u201d says a very proud older brother. \u201cMy brother is now taller and bigger than me after having spent all these years at CFA.\u201d Very soon, at the age of 10 when most young boys find their devilish streak in them, Amarjit was given his first flight ticket, and with his parents\u2019 blessings began life at the Chandigarh Football Academy. The coaches at the academy take a very pragmatic approach, make the players understand, that there are no two ways about performing on the ground because otherwise the whole point of travelling so far and staying away from family is defeated. The young captain who loves his tandoori chicken was a dedicated trainee right from the day his stint began. \u201cHe would be one of the last ones of the field after practice, always staying back the extra half hour to practice his shooting or do free-kick drills,\u201d recalls Sandeep. Amarjit was expected to make the cut for the final squad according to his coach, who does not hesitate to add that he was sure his ward would go on and reclaim the captain\u2019s armband before October 6. A very proud Sandeep adds, \u201cIn a pressure situation, the boy is calm and even on the big day, he will be calm. He remains unfazed and his sole focus becomes the task on hand. Amarjit is someone leader who leads by example.\u201d While speaking exclusively to CNN-News18 on the sidelines of a promotional event in the national capital, Amarjit \u2013 the man of the moment \u2013 said, \u201cThis is a very big moment for me and my team. There is a lot of responsibility and we will give it our best shot as a team.\u201d The jovial FC Barcelona fan has travelled quite a fair distance since 2011, bringing his family a lot of joy with his sporting achievements. Amarjit\u2019s mother Ashangbi Devi begins her day well before the crack of dawn without fail every day, his Umakanta, a former India U-16 player himself, recollects how their mother would take a break from work when they would visit home for holidays. \u201cMy mother and father are very happy and proud.

And the 2011 ICC World Cup winner has credited his performance in the Indian Premier League for his return to the national team. \u201cI performed well in the last IPL so I think the selectors must have seen that. I don\u2019t feel I will be out of sorts against Australia,\u201d Nehra said in an interview with with Mid-Day newspaper. The Delhi paceman has struggled with recurring injuries throughout his career, something that deprived him of a chance to play in the final of the 2011 World Cup final as well. His IPL 10 season was also hampered by injuries, in which he took eight wickets in the six matches. Nehra also said that he felt \u201cembarassed\u201d when people called him up to congratulate him on his selection. \u201cAfter all, I am 38 years of age,\u201d he said. \u201cThey inquired whether I would be able to play the Twenty20 series and I said yes. These days, I cannot play all formats, but I think I will be able to deliver in the forthcoming series,\u201d he said. \u201cI am taking it match-by-match, series by series. I think I will be able to bowl my quota of four overs to the best of my ability,\u201d said left-arm paceman. Nehra also lauded the pace duo of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, his teammate at Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Jasprit Bumrah for their splendid show against the Aussies in the one-day internationals. \u201cI am fortunate to have (Jasprit) Bumrah and Bhuvi (Bhuvneshwar Kumar) in the pace department.

New Delhi : Helped by robust performance of coal, natural gas and electricity, the eight core sectors recorded a five-month high growth rate of 4.9 percent in August, official data showed on Tuesday. These eight infrastructure sectors -- coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilisers, steel, cement and electricity -- had witnessed 3.1 percent expansion in August last year. The infrastructure growth was 2.6 percent in the previous month of July. The core sector growth in August is the highest since March, when it grew by 5.2 percent. The production of coal, natural gas and electricity rose by 15.3 percent, 4.2 percent and 10.3 percent, according to the official data released on Tuesday. However crude oil, fertiliser and cement recorded negative growth in the month under review. The production growth of refinery products and steel slowed down to 2.4 percent and 3 percent in August as against 2.5 percent and 16.7 percent respectively in the same month last year. Cumulatively, the eight core sectors in April-August recorded a growth rate of 3 per cent as against 5.4 percent in the same period a year ago. Healthy growth in key sectors would have positive implications on the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) as these segments account for about 41 per cent to the total factory output. Commenting on the data, rating agency ICRA said: \"Given the favourable base effect and the expected rebuilding of inventories prior to the festive season, we expect the IIP (index of industrial production) growth to improve in August relative to the initial estimate of 1.2 percent for July 2017\".", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "index of industrial production", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "icra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:44:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f31d77d79019893fea8d5443e6480dbc7aee25af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qc2UVzdcdsNRQLMZ8kNjUidyXJ9h5dPVDAD8b3gQKjVPSxTVTkpvbVYQcXz3mU1GRYt.Qgvy9OJOFKOqqtyJKlyIF12dmE7v.MqIbb.yxRvF7MvJQNAqJw24XyKUq9JEM", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/business.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Business News- News18.com", "title": "GST Anti-profiteering Body: Govt to Examine Contours on Wednesday", "title_full": "GST Anti-profiteering Body: Govt to Examine Contours on Wednesday", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/08/gst.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f31d77d79019893fea8d5443e6480dbc7aee25af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qc2UVzdcdsNRQLMZ8kNjUidyXJ9h5dPVDAD8b3gQKjVPSxTVTkpvbVYQcXz3mU1GRYt.Qgvy9OJOFKOqqtyJKlyIF12dmE7v.MqIbb.yxRvF7MvJQNAqJw24XyKUq9JEM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "GST Anti-profiteering Body: Govt to Examine Contours on Wednesday", "text": "2-min read GST Anti-profiteering Body: Govt to Examine Contours on Wednesday To keep a tab on businesses that have not passed on to consumers the benefit of lower tax rates under the GST regime, the GST Council had approved setting up of a five-member National Anti-Profiteering Authority. Updated: October 3, 2017, 4:22 PM IST Image for representation. New Delhi : The Union Cabinet is likely to approve setting up of the anti-profiteering authority under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime on Wednesday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-headed Cabinet may also approve creation of the post of chairman and four technical members of the authority on Wednesday, officials said. To keep a tab on businesses that have not passed on to consumers the benefit of lower tax rates under the GST regime, the GST Council had approved setting up of a five-member National Anti-Profiteering Authority. The authority will have a sunset date of two years from the date on which the chairman assumes charge. The chairman and the four members of the authority have to be less than 62 years. The chairman, who would be a secretary level officer, shall be paid a monthly salary of Rs 2.25 lakh plus other allowances and benefits of similar ranking officers. If a retired officer is selected as chairman, he will be paid a monthly salary of Rs 2.25 lakh reduced by the amount of pension. The technical members will be paid a monthly salary of over Rs 2.05 lakh plus allowances and benefits as applicable to an additional secretary rank officer. The officers who are or have been commissioner of state tax or central tax or have held equivalent post under the excise, Customs or VAT laws will be eligible for appointment as technical members in the authority. The additional director general in the Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS) will act as secretary to the anti-profiteering authority. The chairman and members of the authority will have a term of two years or until they attain the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier, and shall be eligible for reappointment. As per the structure of the anti-profiteering mechanism in the GST regime, complaints of local nature will be first sent to the state-level 'screening committee' while those of national level will be marked for the 'Standing Committee'. If the complaints have merit, the respective committees would refer the cases for further investigation to the Directorate General of Safeguards (DGS). The DG Safeguards would generally take about three months to complete the investigation and send the report to the anti-profiteering authority. If the authority finds that a company has not passed on GST benefits, it will either direct the entity to pass on the benefits to consumers or if the beneficiary cannot be identified will ask the company to transfer the amount to the 'consumer welfare fund' within a specified timeline. The authority will have the power to cancel registration of any entity or business if it fails to pass on to consumers the benefit of lower taxes under the GST regime, but it would probably be the last step against any violator. According to the antiprofiteering rules, the authority will suggest return of the undue profit earned from not passing on the reduction in incidence of tax to consumers along with an 18 per cent interest, as also impose penalty. A five-member committee, headed by Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha, comprising Revenue Secretary Hasmukh Adhia, CBEC Chairman Vanaja Sarna and chief secretaries from two states, has been entrusted to finalise the chairman and members of the authority. A four-member Standing Committee, comprising tax officials of the Centre and states, has already been set up to receive complaints of undue profiteering by any entity under the GST regime. The Standing Committee on anti-profiteering will act as a complaint processing machinery and will refer any case it finds fit for investigation to the DGS.

(Photo: Reuters/Shailesh Andrade) Mumbai : SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd made just modest gains in its trading debut on Tuesday after its IPO - country's biggest in seven years - raised $1.3 billion at valuations widely viewed as steep. Although India could notch up a record-setting year for IPOs with almost $6 billion in deals done so far in 2017, concerns about high valuations have started to emerge with the stock market starting to pull back after a string of record highs. Shares in the country's biggest private sector life insurer, majority-owned by State Bank of India, were 3.6 percent higher than their IPO price of 700 rupees on the National Stock Exchange in afternoon trade. At one stage they rose as much as 5.7 percent. Some debuts earlier this year have been much stronger, with Avenue Supermarts, for example, doubling in price on its first day of trade. SBI Life's gains were, however, in line with ICICI Lombard General Insurance's performance last week when it ended its maiden day of trade 3 percent higher. SBI Life's IPO, which raised funds for its two main shareholders, saw its valuation jump to 700 billion rupees from an estimate 460 billion rupees in December when it sold a small stake to investors including KKR & Co and Temasek. Vrinda Aditya, an analyst at Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd, said although the debut had not been particularly strong, she believed SBI Life was an attractive stock to hold long-term given rosy prospects for India's insurance industry. \"Overall for the insurance industry, it is growing much faster compared to its global peers, so lots to look forward to. But pricing and valuation will remain key in deciding the fate of upcoming IPOs,\" she said Insurers are expected to benefit from rising income levels in the world's second-most populous nation, where comparatively few people currently take out insurance.

There are many ways you can maximize the benefits from your credit card by using it smartly. Updated: October 3, 2017, 3:48 PM IST Picture for Representation. (Photo: Reuters) Credit Card is one of most common financial instruments that a large number of people use to perform a wide range of transactions at different places, including shopping malls, spas, grocery stores and online. Credit cards entail exclusive offers and rewards, by which users can save big on their shopping. There are many ways you can maximize the benefits from your credit card by using it smartly. Here\u2019s a list of 5 Ways to Smartly Use Your Credit Card: 1. Maximum Credit Limit Credit limit allowed for one person may differ from another. If you are applying for a new credit card, you should make sure to ask for the maximum credit limit available for you. Higher credit limit for your credit card not only helps you to undertake higher credit transactions, but it also benefits your overall credit score. 2. Redeem the Rewards Credit cards give reward points to users for specific transactions. Few credit card companies give guaranteed benefits and gift vouchers, like free access to lounges, etc. In addition, credit cards allow users to redeem the accumulated points to get rewards in the form of both kind and cash. Understand the rewards attached to your credit card and do not forget to redeem them before they lapse. 3. Pay Bills on Time Credit cards often impose a very high rate of interest on outstanding balances. Hence, if you fail to clear your credit card dues timely, you might have to make a big payment in the near future. In addition, defaulting on credit card bill payments hampers your actual credit score. Thus, to avoid additional outgoing interest and to maintain your credit score, you should make sure to clear dues before due date. 4. Scrutinize Your Credit Card Bill Other than timely payment of the credit card bill, you should make sure to scrutinize the respective itemized bill of your credit card transactions during the last billing cycle.

(Photo: Reuters/Krishnendu Halder/Files) New Delhi : Bowing to public pressure, the government on Tuesday cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre to moderate the relentless rise in fuel prices witnessed for the last three months. \"Govt of India has reduced Basic Excise Duty rate on petrol and diesel [both branded and unbranded] by Rs 2 perlitre w.e.f. 4th October,2017,\" the finance ministry said in a tweet. Prices of petrol and diesel will be reduced by the amount of duty cut with effect from Wednesday. Petrol currently costs Rs 70.88 per litre in Delhi while a litre of diesel is priced at Rs 59.14, the highest ever. On petrol, the government currently levies excise duties totalling Rs 21.48 per litre while that on diesel is Rs 17.33 per litre. The government, which had raised duties three years back to take away gains arising from plummeting global oil prices, has been criticised for not cutting excise duty despite a sustained rise in fuel prices since early July. Petrol price has jumped by Rs 7.8 per litre since July 4, while diesel rates have touched an all-time high after rates went up by Rs 5.7. \"This (excise duty cut) has been done to cushion the impact of rising international prices of crude petroleum oil and petrol and diesel on their retail sale prices,\" it said in another tweet.

(Getty Images) New Delhi: Rio Paralympics silver medallist Deepa Malik remains upset over being ignored for Khel Ratna this year and feels exception should have been made by the awards committee, like it had done in 2016. The Khel Ratna was awarded to two-time Paralympic gold medallist, Devendra Jhajharia, and former India hockey captain Sardar Singh in August. However, as many as four were awarded the country's highest sporting honour in the Olympic year -- shuttler PV Sindhu, gymnast Dipa Karmakar, wrestler Sakshi Malik and shooter Jitu Rai, who flopped in the Rio Olympics but was rewarded for his consistent performances at world events. \"They gave to all four last year. They could have done something similar this time. However, I will continue to apply and they will have to give me sooner than later. Anyway the rule is that my performance over four years will be taken into consideration,\" Malik told PTI on the sidelines of an event organised by the Australian High Commission. With her event not being there in the Commonwealth Games next year, Malik will have to wait till the Para Asian Games in October 2018 for her next major event. \"May at the Asian Games I will break the world record and then they will have to give me Khel Ratna,\" said Malik, who was honoured with Padma Shri earlier this year and Arjuna Award in 2012. \"However, I still don't feel negative. Sports has given me a lot. More than I thought it would,\" said the para athlete, who won her silver medal at Rio in shot put. It has been more than a year but Malik is yet to get some of the cash awards promised to her. \"Madhya Pradesh government has written back to us saying they will honour us during their state awards.

(AP Image) New Delhi: Former star opener Virender Sehwag on Tuesday said that the Australian players were scared of sledging Virat Kohli and the other Indian players during the recently concluded One-Day International (ODI) series due to the possibility of losing out on their lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) contracts.Sehwag said the Aussies, who were thrashed 4-1 in the five-match series, restrained themselves from getting involved in verbal volleys because of the fear that they might not earn mega money in the IPL auctions scheduled for next year. \"They (Australian players) are scared because of the next year's mega IPL auctions. If they had sledged the Indian players in the ODI series, then the Indian franchise owners might think before bidding high for the Australian players. This can also be a reason for them not to get involved in sledging with their Indian counterparts,\" Sehwag told India TV. The rivalry between India and Australia is quite intense and a lot is always at stake when the two teams meet. A series between these teams invariably involves a lot of passion and frayed tempers, a testimony to that being the Test series that India won 2-1 earlier this year. A huge row erupted during the second Test in Bengaluru in March when Australia captain Smith looked towards the dressing room for assistance on a Decision Review System (DRS) call after he was adjudged LBW by umpire Nigel Llong at the Chinnaswami Stadium. Smith later admitted to looking towards their dressing room and described it a \"brain fade\" moment. As the issue threatened to escalate, the ICC intervened and brokered peace without penalising anyone. However, the Australians -- usually fierce and aggressive -- seemed to be lacking confidence during their ODI drubbing. Sehwag said the \"brain fade\" incident might have kept the Australians quiet this time. \"I think the Australian team was playing under pressure because they don't have all the great players now. Their team was dependent on two or three players -- David Warner, Steve Smith and Aaron Finch. \"Out of these three players, Smith couldn't do much.

(AP Photo) England are likely to go to the Ashes without Ben Stokes after a controversial brawl while on a night out and that could be a massive boost for the Australians who will play hosts starting November 23. The strong English bowling line up though could negate that advantage against the Australian batting. On the other side is a strong Australian bowling attack against a weak England top order.\u201cThere\u2019s no hiding from it and we\u2019re certainly going to try and start making amends,\u201d said Australia\u2019s batting coach Graeme Hick on the topic of recent collapses to Cricket Australia. Hick played 65 Tests for England in a 10-year career. \u201cEspecially with the Ashes coming up, we certainly don\u2019t want to be losing wickets in clumps. Our batting collapses are mental. The players are all there, their techniques are set and they\u2019re all very different and all very individual. Every side collapses at times, but at the moment we seem to be doing it quite a bit in both forms of the game. So I think it is a bit of a mental thing.\u201d In the previous year and a half, Australia have collapsed from a position of strength - in Colombo last year, in Perth, in Dharamshala against India in the four-match Test series and most recently, in Dhaka to lose the opening Test to Bangladesh. In each case, Australia were in a dominant position and went on to be beaten. \u201cAt times when it happens, especially after a long partnership, people sometimes get a little bit relaxed thinking everything is OK and you\u2019re maybe not preparing mentally for that,\u201d Hick says. \u201cAnd the next thing you know you\u2019re strapping your pads on, two or three wickets are down, and you\u2019re out there. Maybe there\u2019s a little bit of that. It happens in all cricket but it\u2019s certainly something we\u2019ve identified. You need to identify that (it\u2019s) an important time in the game and maybe just hold yourself back a little bit. Our natural game is quite an aggressive game and at times maybe we need to step back a bit, let a few balls through to the keeper, have a look, take a few deep breaths and suck the atmosphere in rather than chasing things.\u201d Like Steve Smith or Darren Lehmann, who have asked for the batsmen to step up following a disappointing 1-4 ODI series loss against India, Hick was at a loss of words in explaining where the team is going wrong. \u201cYou can talk as much as you want about it, but they need to perform on the field,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know that, they\u2019re professionals and they were gutted at the end of the ODI series. It\u2019s disappointing for all. Them more than anyone else.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "graeme hick cricketnext", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graeme hick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben stokes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren lehmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colombo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dharamshala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:11:15.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7310494ffcceea4d1577dafca7ab0ea119d42b72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qeovsflNKoMiAmfmnpKhL6nlAIMR4P40Gb7r96j4QayDuRZFuSRz6UZVa9OGoHQNsDHlGEakkldZw56NGNwV.BdQbA5LDzc18GQa69eRE3BLqUjyonqcIhnIiN9NEX4uAQA9stwgJFBLciaH7T_jgp6K_1OkgKSYys4Xfq3QiT34-", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/movies.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Movies News- News18.com", "title": "Kangana's Sister Slams 'Uncle' Hrithik Over 'Baseless' Stalking Complaint", "title_full": "Kangana's Sister Slams 'Uncle' Hrithik Over 'Baseless' Stalking Complaint", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/05/hrithik-kangana.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7310494ffcceea4d1577dafca7ab0ea119d42b72", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qeovsflNKoMiAmfmnpKhL6nlAIMR4P40Gb7r96j4QayDuRZFuSRz6UZVa9OGoHQNsDHlGEakkldZw56NGNwV.BdQbA5LDzc18GQa69eRE3BLqUjyonqcIhnIiN9NEX4uAQA9stwgJFBLciaH7T_jgp6K_1OkgKSYys4Xfq3QiT34-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kangana's Sister Slams 'Uncle' Hrithik Over 'Baseless' Stalking Complaint", "text": "1-min read Kangana Ranaut's Sister Rangoli Hits Out Against 'Uncle' Hrithik Roshan Over 'Baseless' Stalking Complaint Rangoli\u2019s outburst came a day after Republic TV aired the contents of a 29-page complaint filed six months ago by Hrithik and his legal counsel in which he had alleged that he was stalked and hounded by Kangana.

(Image credit: PTI) \nVijayawada: Spinners Karn Sharma and Shahbaz Nadeem wreaked havoc as India A thrashed New Zealand A by an innings and 26 runs to win the two-match unofficial \u2018Test series 2-0, here Tuesday. After scoring 211 in their first innings, the visitors managed only 210 in their second essay, courtesy another batting collapse despite starting the final day at 104 for 1.India A had scored 447 in their only innings. Leg-spinner Karn (5/78 in 20.3 overs) and left-arm spinner Nadeem (4/41 in 26 overs) ran through the opposition line-up as they added only 106 runs losing nine wickets in theprocess. Pacer Shardul Thakur took the other wicket. After a match haul of eight wickets in the first game, Railways\u2019 Karn once again got another eight wickets (8/129) in the second match. \nHenry Nicholls (94) played a lone hand, which incidentally wasn\u2019t enough as none of the other batsmen were able to support him. Save the second wicket stand of 105 runs between Raval and Nicholls, there wasn\u2019t a single partnership of more than 30 runs. New Zealand A have been completely outclassed in the series having lost the first \u2018Test\u2019 by an innings and 31 runs. \nThe batsmen simply didn\u2019t have any clue how to negotiate Karn-Nadeem duo. While Karn ended the series with 16 wickets, Nadeem wasn\u2019t far behind with 14 in his kitty. \nBrief Scores: India A 447 bt New Zealand A 211 & 210 (Henry Nicholls 94; Karn Sharma 5/78, Shahbaz Nadeem 4/41). \nFirst Published: October 3, 2017, 4:59 PM IST SHARE", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shahbaz nadeem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nadeem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shardul thakur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicholls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henry nicholls", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karn sharma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pti", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new zealand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:13:13.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "28e6b45d376698c7c30ae9476caaf362acc6347f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDNWj1JY.ygU0jQqKpEoQkj1Yz4m5eSUWk4YxIKop.qACTZPci_f9nMTufwoAyQ1u8Sogz_0pk0dRyTFwf5nmg_KKtVS.XmcuJyLbvH.E_vZeg--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://nowbreaking.in/feed", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Now Breaking News India", "title": "FIFA U-17 WC: Three Lions Arrive in Kolkata Without Jadon Sancho", "title_full": "FIFA U-17 WC: Three Lions Arrive in Kolkata Without Jadon Sancho", "published": "2017-10-03T19:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://nowbreaking.in/wp-content/uploads/www.news18.com", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "28e6b45d376698c7c30ae9476caaf362acc6347f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDNWj1JY.ygU0jQqKpEoQkj1Yz4m5eSUWk4YxIKop.qACTZPci_f9nMTufwoAyQ1u8Sogz_0pk0dRyTFwf5nmg_KKtVS.XmcuJyLbvH.E_vZeg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "admin", "published": "2017-10-03T19:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "FIFA U-17 WC: Three Lions Arrive in Kolkata Without Jadon Sancho", "text": "6 \nFIFA U-17 WC: Three Lions Arrive in Kolkata Without Jadon Sancho \u201c}var y=\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d;$(\u201c#main_score_strip_top\u201d).html(y),set_score_slider_style()}else $(\u201c#top_strip_cricket_widget\u201d).html(\u201chttp://www.news18.com/\u201d),\u201dundefined\u201d!=typeof updateTopScoreWidgetNews18&&clearInterval(updateTopScoreWidgetNews18),console.log(\u201cno live match in progress\u201d)},error:function(e){console.log(\u201cerror in live score widget\u201d),$(\u201c#top_strip_cricket_widget\u201d).html(\u201chttp://www.news18.com/\u201d)}})} function get_live_team_scores(e,s,i){var e=get_ipl_teams_short(e),t=s,i=i,a=\u201dhttp://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/ibnhome/cricketnext/microsite/teamsicon/\u201d,r=a+e.toLowerCase()+\u201d.png\u201d,n=\u2019\u2018,c=t.length;if(c>0){for(var o=1,v=\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d,l=0;c>l;l++){var m=t[l].scores,p=t[l].wickets,f=t[l].overs,g=t[l].active;if(1==g)var d=\u201d \u201c,_=\u201d \u201c;else d=\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d,_=\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d;if(2==o)var b=\u201d & \u201c;else var b=\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d;\u201dtest\u201d==i?(v=v+\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d+b+d+m+\u201d/\u201d+p+_,o+=1):(v=v+\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d+d+m+\u201d/\u201d+p+\u201d(\u201c+f+\u201d)\u201d+_+b,o+=1)}var h=d+e+_;h=\u2019\n\u2018+n+h+v+\u201d \n\u201c}else h=\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d;return h} function convertToSlug(e){return e.replace(\u201d (W)\u201d,\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d).replace(\u201d (C)\u201d,\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d).toLowerCase().replace(/[^w ]+/g,\u201dhttp://www.news18.com/\u201d).replace(/ +/g,\u201d-\u201c)} function get_ipl_teams_short(a){var r=new Array;return r.Kolkata=\u201dKKR\u201d,r.KOL=\u201dKKR\u201d,r.MUM=\u201dMI\u201d,r.Mumbai=\u201dMI\u201d,r.HYD=\u201dSRH\u201d,r.Hyderabad=\u201dSRH\u201d,r.PUN=\u201dRPS\u201d,r.Punjab=\u201dKXIP\u201d,r.PNJ=\u201dKXIP\u201d,r.Bangalore=\u201dRCB\u201d,r.BLR=\u201dRCB\u201d,r.Delhi=\u201dDD\u201d,r.DEL=\u201dDD\u201d,r.Pune=\u201dRPS\u201d,r.Gujarat=\u201dGL\u201d,r.GUJ=\u201dGL\u201d,r.TBC=\u201dTBC\u201d,a in r?r[a]:a} var updateTopScoreWidgetNews18=setInterval(function(){news18_top_widget_live_scores() }, 20000);});

While he is \u201cnot done yet\u201d, Hogg remains realistic about his chances of making another comeback for Australia.He is currently commentating in the limited-overs series between India and Australia and if it was not for a surgery on his left knee, he may well have been preparing back home to make another First-Class comeback for Western Australia. \n\u201dI am not worried about my age mate. I am still trying to play First-Class cricket for Western Australia. I don\u2019t think I will ever announce my retirement from international cricket because it is a privilege to play for your country and if I am doing well enough I would never say no,\u201d Hogg told PTI. \nThe boom in T20 cricket has pushed a host of cricketers to stretch their careers. Hogg is a prime example of that alongside India\u2019s \u201cageless\u201d Ashish Nehra, who, at 38, has earned a recall to the Indian team for the three T20s against Australia beginning October 7. Hogg was 44 when he last played for Australia in 2014 and still thinks he is good enough to bowl at the highest level. He also remains a regular at the Big Bash League and evenplayed the IPL as recently as last year. \n\u201cIf I get the opportunity to play again (for Australia), I would take it. Because once you are long time retired (it is difficult to comeback). If it stops now, it stops now, I know I won\u2019t get to play again. \u201cI am fortunate that at my age I am still wanted. Whether it happens or not, it is another matter but yeah I am not done yet,\u201d he says. \nHogg says the constant curiosity over his age doesn\u2019t bother him and he is focused on getting back to full fitness, having undergone a knee surgery three months ago. \u201cWhile I am doing that (recovering), I am using thetime to do commentary. I feel at a very fortunate place to be honest and thoroughly enjoying it. The recovery is taking longer than expected but I should be back on the ground soon.\u201d \nIs it tough to maintain fitness as one grows older? \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Hogg. \u201cIf you look after yourself, it is not an issue. But as sportsmen, a lot of us have wear and tear. Sometimes it happens early in your career, sometimes it happens late. I am very lucky that it is late in my career. \u201cIn fact I would not call it (injury layoff) a difficult period. I have been extremely lucky to play the game. I am grateful for that. You rather think about the things you have.\u201d \nWhile commentating, he has also found time to help fellow Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav, who calls the Australian his mentor with both having spent a lot of time together at the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL. Yadav has been making rapid strides in international cricket ever since making his Test debut against Australia in March, and Hogg is not at all surprised. \u201cEveryone\u2019s career graph is different.

The marquee tournament starts October 6, and the Manipuri boy is excited to be a part of India\u2019s first-ever World Cup team.\n\u201cAll my days of sacrifice and hard work will be rewarded and I am very much excited to be a part of the first Indian team to feature in a FIFA World Cup,\u201d Dheeraj said three days before the start of the tournament. Dheeraj, who hails from Moirang in Bishnupur district, said he prefers to strike a balance between aggressive goalkeeping and composed goalkeeping. \u201cYou have to pick your moments and chose what type of goalkeeping will suit the moment. \nSometimes the aggressive goalkeeping can lead to difficulties and even conceding a goal whereas composed goalkeeping could work and vice versa. For a goalkeeper, both ways of goalkeeping are important.\u201d Asked how tough is a goalkeeper\u2019s job, he said, \u201cStaying in the moment is the job of a goalkeeper and a slight lack of focus or concentration can easily lead to a goal. \u201cGoalkeepers are the last barriers and it makes the job all the more tough when there is a pressure of performing in every single game associated with it.\u201d \nIndia will be up against some of the top teams in the world, but Dheeraj is prepared for the challenge. \u201cIt is a challenge that I am prepared for. We respect our opponents but as a goalkeeper it is my job to be the hardest barrier the opponents face and I will try to be the hardest barrier that they will ever face in scoring a goal.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dheeraj", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dheeraj singh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kkr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manipuri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bishnupur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moirang", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:13:22.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3409275d8b0ca5bf98201321ddc6e1ff138d20be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTAq_3QhpdppM3evBP9EMpPavVgTXIigKrcNaFiTS6dFXe7bKFygu98nwLzUykxsrZMEm_GeLgKNqtZuh1n831HuseyVGo28J.Bcr7evd_7FcJUpGdlwZoWKNv2QHhWjTM8o9v_OKCADCtFWlLKBnJpA", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/india.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top India News- News18.com", "title": "All Members of SC Collegium Were Unanimous in Transfer of Karnataka HC Judge Justice Patel", "title_full": "All Members of SC Collegium Were Unanimous in Transfer of Karnataka HC Judge Justice Patel", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/PATEL-KTAKA-HC-875.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3409275d8b0ca5bf98201321ddc6e1ff138d20be", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTAq_3QhpdppM3evBP9EMpPavVgTXIigKrcNaFiTS6dFXe7bKFygu98nwLzUykxsrZMEm_GeLgKNqtZuh1n831HuseyVGo28J.Bcr7evd_7FcJUpGdlwZoWKNv2QHhWjTM8o9v_OKCADCtFWlLKBnJpA", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "All Members of SC Collegium Were Unanimous in Transfer of Karnataka HC Judge Justice Patel", "text": "1-min read All Members of SC Collegium Were Unanimous in Transfer of Karnataka HC Judge Justice Jayant Patel Justice Jayant Patel's transfer had created a controversy since the judge was shifted out of Karnataka at a time when he was set to take over as the acting chief justice of Karnataka HC. Updated: October 3, 2017, 10:07 PM IST File photo of Karnataka High Court. Justice Jayant Patel (inset). New Delhi : Amid a controversy over his transfer and subsequent resignation by Karnataka High Court judge Justice Jayant Patel, sources in the Supreme Court Collegium Tuesday said that the decision to move out the judge was \"unanimous\". According to the highly placed sources, all the five SC judges in the Collegium were on the same page in taking a call to transfer Justice Patel from Karnataka HC to Allahabad HC. \"The decision was an unanimous one, based on the inputs before the Collegium. All the members of the Collegium took this decision unanimously,\" sources told CNN-News18 . They added that there was no dissent recorded by any of the five senior most judges in the apex court during the meeting of the Collegium, following which Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra took the final call to send Justice Patel to Allahabad HC. Besides, there were pertinent inputs on record regarding Justice Patel, further justifying the decision to transfer him, added the sources. Justice Patel's transfer had created a controversy since the judge was shifted out of Karnataka at a time when he was set to take over as the acting chief justice of Karnataka HC. His transfer to Allahabad HC at the age of 61 meant he could not become a chief justice in any HC nor could he be elevated to the Supreme Court since a HC judge retires at 62. Justice Patel resigned immediately after receiving the transfer order and his resignation was accepted by the President as well. A section of lawyers alleged Justice Patel's transfer was a punitive one. They further claimed the judge had to suffer this fate only because he, while functioning as a judge in Gujarat HC, had transferred the probe into Ishrat Jahan encounter killing case to CBI. The encounter killing case had then named Amir Shah as one of the accused.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ishrat jahan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jayant patel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amir shah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dipak misra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "karnataka high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court collegium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "karnataka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gujarat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "allahabad hc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:17:35.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "25c758914a092c39148e4472eb5d0011f3b2b922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTC.sWl9f9NV.sreRGjV7TUBEVGN2Bf_hwj0De0DhvPEfkirVSpyLFMH8NFHlQ17QJuVoF0aR67_2QWoTxPSEVbQ9BefurckwLIV2rQm_skXAg--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/india.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top India News- News18.com", "title": "'China Quickly Becoming No 1 Tourist Destination For Indians'", "title_full": "'China Quickly Becoming No 1 Tourist Destination For Indians'", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2016/06/great-wall-of-china.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "25c758914a092c39148e4472eb5d0011f3b2b922", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTC.sWl9f9NV.sreRGjV7TUBEVGN2Bf_hwj0De0DhvPEfkirVSpyLFMH8NFHlQ17QJuVoF0aR67_2QWoTxPSEVbQ9BefurckwLIV2rQm_skXAg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "'China Quickly Becoming No 1 Tourist Destination For Indians'", "text": "1-min read 'China Quickly Becoming No 1 Tourist Destination For Indians' It is estimated that the number of outbound tourists from India will reach 50 million overall by 2020, up from 21.87 million in 2016, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Updated: October 3, 2017, 8:38 PM IST File photo of the Great Wall of China. (Image: Reuters) Beijing : China is becoming one of the most popular destinations for Indian tourists with over six lakh visiting various destinations so far this year, a Chinese official has said. Recent years have witnessed India's outbound tourism soar, with more and more Indians choosing China as their top destination. It is estimated that the number of outbound tourists from India will reach 50 million overall by 2020, up from 21.87 million in 2016, state-run Xinhua news agency reported. Tian Xin, an official from the New Delhi office of the China National Tourism Administration, revealed that in 2014, the number of Indian tourists to China was 709,900, up 4.6 percent year-on-year from 2013. In 2015, the number increased to 730,500 and in just the first nine months of 2016, the number had already reached 600,900. China and India, the two most populous countries in the world, started to strengthen tourism cooperation back in 2015. In that same year, 'Visit India Year' in China was hosted, and in 2016, 'Visit China Year' in India was launched. Both countries have also been working together to improve service quality, simplify visa procedures and increase direct flights to boost tourism. Tian told Xinhua that both countries have natural advantages in tourism development, noting that both also have friendly people and abundant tourism resources. Besides those attributes, the low cost of transportation between the two countries and the same consumption levels have both contributed to mutual tourism development. Tian believes that there is still \"huge development space\". \"China and India are neighbouring countries and have a long, good relationship. The Silk Road once closely connected China and India.

The delegation, led by Finland's minister for environment and energy Kimmo Tiilikainen, discussed a wide range of development projects related to renewable energy, bio-fuel, electric vehicles, smart grid and smart cities. Twenty three Finnish companies also made a presentation on the projects. UP\u2019s energy minister Shrikant Sharma and industrial development minister Satish Mahana were also present. Sharma said that bio-fuel, electric vehicles and eco-friendly smart cities were the focal points of the seminar.

We want people to use bio-mass products,\u201d he said.

Via its propaganda news agency Amaq, Islamic State has twice said that the Las Vegas shooter, a 64-year-old retired accountant, was a \"soldier\" of the group. Updated: October 4, 2017, 7:25 AM IST Stephen Paddock pictured in a photo on Marilou Danley's Facebook page. Paris : Claims of responsibility for terror attacks by the Islamic State group were once seen as credible, but in the wake of the Las Vegas atrocity, experts stress that the retreating jihadists are increasingly spreading fake news. Via its propaganda news agency Amaq, IS has twice said that the Las Vegas shooter, a 64-year-old retired accountant, was a \"soldier\" of the group. On Monday, it put out a second statement claiming serial gambler Stephen Paddock had recently converted to Islam and was known by the nom de guerre Abu Abdel Bar al-Amriki. American investigators are scrambling to understand the motive for the worst shooting in living memory on US soil, but IS experts are sceptical that Paddock was linked to the terror group. The FBI said Monday it had so far found \"no connection\" between him and any international terrorist group. \"ISIS in recent months has made a number of demonstrably false claims for attacks and incidents that had no jihadi terror nexus,\" Paul Cruickshank from the US-based Combating Terrorism Center said. One theory is that, as the extremists face military defeat on the territory they once held in Iraq and Syria, they are seeking to generate publicity to show they are still a force to their supporters. \"ISIS, desperate for attention, will claim just about anything these days knowing their supporters won't believe the government or media,\" Cruickshank added. French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb made the same point on Tuesday, saying the group \"tended to claim every attack\" in order to \"maintain a presence in the media space.\" Dubious claims Discerning who is ultimately responsible for attacks is an inexact science. The gunmen and suicide bombers behind the carnage in Paris in November 2015 for example are believed by investigators to have carried out an attack which was planned in part from the fanatics' base in Syria. But other killings have been perpetrated by people seemingly inspired by the group's murderous ideology, but without necessarily having been in contact. Some have left flags or a video message to indicate their allegiance. Last week, IS released a recording of what it said was its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi urging followers to use any weapon at their disposal to strike the West. \"If the guy is a convert and made contact with ISIS, someone would have to know,\" Islamic State specialist Shiraz Maher wrote on Twitter, referring to the Las Vegas shooter. \"Friends, family, law enforcement will shed light on that,\" added the researcher and author from King's College London university. The problem, like all fake news, is that once a story spreads on social media or elsewhere on the internet it is very difficult to correct it. Farhad Khosrokhavar, an expert on Islam from the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris (EHESS), used the example of a truck attack in Nice in July 2016 that left 86 people dead. IS claimed Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, a drug-taking Tunisian with no religious education, was one of its \"soldiers\" following the attack, but there remains no evidence tying him to the group. \"This massacre had nothing to do with jihadism, the perpetrator had huge psychological problems,\" Khosrokhavar told AFP. \"But no one listens.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 10:45 PM IST File photo of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. (Photo: Reuters) Gaza City : The Palestinian cabinet met in Gaza for the first time since 2014 Tuesday, as Israel warned it would reject any reconciliation deal between the Palestinian factions unless Islamists Hamas disarm. The meeting comes as part of moves to end a decade-long split between the internationally recognised Palestinian Authority, based in the occupied West Bank, and Hamas, which runs the Gaza Strip. The return of the PA to Gaza had been cautiously welcomed by the United States and the United Nations, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it could be a \"bogus\" reconciliation \"at the expense of our existence\". Hamas has controlled Gaza since seizing it from the PA in a near civil war in 2007, and since then multiple reconciliation attempts have failed. But following Egyptian pressure the Islamists announced last month they were willing to hand over civilian control to the PA, which is dominated by Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas's Fatah movement. Tuesday's cabinet meeting was the first in Gaza since November 2014, and comes a day after Palestinian prime minister Rami Hamdallah entered the territory for the first time since a unity government collapsed in June 2015. At the beginning of the meeting, which took place at the official Gaza residence of Abbas in Gaza, Hamdallah pledged to end the rift. \"We are here to turn the page on division, restore the national project to its correct direction and establish the (Palestinian) state,\" he said. Afterwards government spokesman Yusuf Al Mahmud said a full reconciliation deal would take time. \"The government does not have a magic wand,\" he told reporters. Egypt has brokered the rapprochement between the two sides. Its intelligence chief, Khaled Fawzi, visited the strip in the afternoon and met with Hamdallah and Hamas head Ismail Haniya. In a pre-recorded speech played at the meeting, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi backed the talks. \"The whole world is waiting for your efforts to achieve reconciliation among the Palestinian people,\" he said. The sides will hold further talks on Tuesday in Cairo. Hamas disarming More than two million people live in impoverished Gaza, which has been blockaded by Israel and Egypt for years. Hamas hopes to convince Egypt to ease its border restrictions, which, along with the isolation of key regional ally Qatar, have left the Islamists weak. The Palestinian Authority has also sought to punish Hamas for setting up what was seen as a rival government, reducing electricity payments for Gazans. A key sticking point between the two Palestinian sides will likely be Hamas's powerful military wing that has fought three wars with Israel since 2008. The Palestinian Authority has signed peace deals with Israel, but Hamas was not party to them and does not recognise Israel's right to exist. The United States and the European Union blacklist Hamas as a terrorist organisation, complicating the formation of any potential unity government. Israel said any deal would be unacceptable unless Hamas disarmed. \"We are not prepared to accept bogus reconciliations in which the Palestinian side apparently reconciles at the expense of our existence,\" Netanyahu said in a statement. \"Whoever wants to make such a reconciliation, our understanding is very clear: recognise the State of Israel, disband the Hamas military arm, sever the connection with Iran -- which calls for our destruction.\" In response Hamas said Israel was the primary beneficiary of the division. In an interview on Monday night Abbas said there would be \"one state, one system, one law and one weapon\" -- in an apparent reference to Hamas's military wing. Hamas could not \"copy or clone Hezbollah's experience in Lebanon,\" he added, referring to a situation where an independent armed group exerts major influence on national politics. Hamas officials reject the possibility of disarming. Hamas leader Haniya said they were willing to \"pay any price\" for reconciliation but analysts say disarming would effectively mean the end of the movement. The United States cautiously welcomed Hamdallah's visit Monday. But US special envoy Jason Greenblatt also said any Palestinian government \"must unambiguously and explicitly commit to nonviolence, recognition of the State of Israel, acceptance of previous agreements and obligations between the parties and peaceful negotiations.\" UN Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov said he was \"encouraged\" by the developments and wanted to see the Palestinian Authority government exercise full control in Gaza. \"This is essential for resolving the humanitarian situation as soon as possible, most notably the crippling electricity and health crises,\" he said in a statement.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 10:26 PM IST Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson addresses the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, October 3, 2017. (Photo: REUTERS) Manchester: British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson lauded Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday for taking on the duty of making a success of Brexit, adding that her top ministers were united behind every syllable of her EU exit plans. Johnson, who led the leave campaign in last year\u2019s EU referendum, had provoked the ire of cabinet colleagues by repeatedly attempting to portray himself as the champion of a genuinely \u2018bold Brexit\u2019. Johnson praised May for winning the snap election which lost her party its majority in parliament and said the cabinet was united behind May's recent Brexit speech in Florence. \"You won \u2013 we won. Theresa May won,\" he told Conservative Party activists in the northern English city of Manchester. \"The whole country owes her a debt for her steadfastness in taking Britain forward, as she will, to a great Brexit deal, based on that Florence speech on whose every syllable, I can tell you, the whole cabinet is united,\" Johnson said. Johnson kept largely to the prepared text of his speech, which did roam beyond the remit of foreign affairs. Ahead of Johnson's speech, May repeatedly faced questions from reporters about whether she would sack Johnson. She sidestepped those questions. The European Parliament savaged the British government's handling of Brexit negotiations, voting against opening talks yet on future trade and condemning disarray in May's team.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 10:34 PM IST The devices, also known as suppressors, do not eliminate gunshot noise entirely. (Photo: Reuters) Washington : The US Congress on Tuesday shelved a controversial plan to make it easier to purchase gun silencers, as President Donald Trump signalled a future debate about the nation's gun laws was possible. The announcement about the bill came days after the tragic shooting massacre in Las Vegas, Nevada. \"That bill is not scheduled now,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters, referring to a measure that also includes language making it more difficult to classify certain ammunition as \"armor piercing.\" \"I don't know when it's going to be scheduled,\" Ryan added. \"Right now we're focused on passing our budget.\" The Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act advanced through a key House committee in mid-September, setting up a possible floor vote. Following the Las Vegas shooting, in which a retiree murdered 59 people and wounded more than 500 when he sprayed a festival crowd with gunfire, gun-control groups and several Democrats warned that the measure would only make it more difficult to locate such shooters. The devices, also known as suppressors, do not eliminate gunshot noise entirely. One of the bill's sponsors Republican Jeff Duncan, argues that reducing gun noise is a safety issue for hunters. Trump, who said he will visit Las Vegas on Wednesday, signalled that a debate about gun control might be coming. \"We'll be talking about gun laws as time goes on,\" he said. Asked specifically about the House measure to ease restrictions on silencers, the president said: \"We'll talk about that later.\" Democrat Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in the 2016 election, was among those expressing concern about easing access to silencers. \"The crowd fled at the sound of gunshots,\" Clinton tweeted on Monday. \"Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer.\" Debate on the measure stalled after number three House Republican Steve Scalise was gravely injured in June at a congressional charity baseball practice. Scalise returned to Congress last week to standing ovations, and on Tuesday he briefly addressed the Las Vegas tragedy. \"Those families need our prayers right now. They need to be uplifted,\" he said. Ryan also spoke out against the \"horror\" of the shooting but stressed that \"we can not let the actions of a single person define us as a country.\" Some Democrats, like Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, where a shooter murdered 20 schoolchildren in 2012, demanded prompt debate on gun control. \"Your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers,\" Murphy tweeted to his colleagues. \"None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff duncan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scalise", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress delays vote on gun silencers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us congress delays vote on gun silencers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:37:50.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6be9137232064e04d1e929bae9b9145e8b1d18f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3zOe_DXs4czHOrJwjHwCdqCncSXZw3L9qG.5IkabXLt4Kypr2PgE__tAmWVALDyevS_A221cQYWjhnv287XPYz7nHzDu_QdHAw-", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/world.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top World News- News18.com", "title": "Iraq ex-president and Kurdish Leader Jalal Talabani Dies at 83", "title_full": "Iraq ex-president and Kurdish Leader Jalal Talabani Dies at 83", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/TALABANI-875.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6be9137232064e04d1e929bae9b9145e8b1d18f7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3zOe_DXs4czHOrJwjHwCdqCncSXZw3L9qG.5IkabXLt4Kypr2PgE__tAmWVALDyevS_A221cQYWjhnv287XPYz7nHzDu_QdHAw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Iraq ex-president and Kurdish Leader Jalal Talabani Dies at 83", "text": "2-min read Iraq ex-president and Kurdish Leader Jalal Talabani Dies at 83 An official with Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said he had died in Germany where he was undergoing medical treatment. \nAFP Updated: October 3, 2017, 10:32 PM IST File photo of Kurdish rebel leader Jalal Talabani who sought Iraqi unity as president of the nation. (Photo: Reuters) Sulaimaniyah, Iraq : Ex-Iraqi president Jalal Talabani, a veteran leader of the struggle for Kurdish self-determination and a unifying elder statesman, died Tuesday in Germany aged 83, Kurdish officials said. Talabani was Iraq's president from 2005 to 2014 and a key figure in Iraqi Kurdistan, where voters last week overwhelmingly backed independence in a referendum. An official with Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) said he had died in Germany where he was undergoing medical treatment. A family member said his health had worsened and he been transported to Germany, along with his wife and two children, before the referendum. Iraqi Kurdish lawmaker Zana Said paid tribute to Talabani as \"the only president whose death saddens Arabs, Kurds and all other ethnicities\". \"We pray to God that his death will help to bring back good relations between the brothers of Iraq.\" Talabani's death, following a decades-old struggle for Kurdish statehood, came after Iraq's Kurds voted 92.7 percent in favour of independence in the September 25 referendum. The vote, rejected by Baghdad as illegal, has put deep strain on ties between the Kurds and central Iraqi authorities, who have cut off international flights to the region and threatened further action. Talabani was an avuncular politician and a skilled negotiator, who spent years building bridges between the country's divided factions, despite his efforts for Kurdish independence. Uncle Jalal Born in 1933 in the mountain village of Kalkan, he studied law at Baghdad University and did a stint in the army before joining the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Mullah Mustafa Barzani, father of current Kurdistan regional president Massud Barzani. Talabani took to the hills in a first uprising against the Iraqi government in 1961 but famously fell out with Barzani, who sued for peace with Baghdad, and joined a KDP splinter faction in 1964. Eleven years later, he established the PUK after Barzani's forces, abandoned by their Iranian, US and Israeli allies, were routed by Saddam Hussein's army. He became president in April 2005 after the first post-Saddam election in Iraq and continued in the post until 2014, when he was replaced by the current president, Fuad Masum. Iraq's head of state plays a largely ceremonial role and is elected by members of parliament. In his mountainous northern fiefdom of Sulaimaniyah, Talabani was known simply as Uncle (Mam) Jalal. In August 2008, the married father of two underwent successful heart surgery in the United States, then in 2012 he was flown to Germany after suffering a stroke, casting doubt over his ability to ever return to Iraq. He did go back in July 2014, with Iraq in crisis after the Islamic State group had taken control of swathes of the country, and was replaced by Masum following a parliamentary election.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "talabani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jalal talabani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jalal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zana said", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mullah mustafa barzani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barzani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jalal born", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuad masum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "masum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massud barzani", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patriotic union of kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kalkan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sulaimaniyah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:37:50.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "34b7d5dea84b028a980f03ed8cc3b178bb417e32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3wqJD_WJRbnTNw7Tz5BXbCWVoNE64Xn3TVBZ3v1Dvw5YJoJoAUWEKGCBsGgyZQ.zcToRdx14jFsXk.fbXyUOpYsQ3MuSA_wHtfbJkXiOw_73FNzX3znMK.O", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/world.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top World News- News18.com", "title": "US Orders Expulsion of 15 Diplomats From Cuba's Embassy in Washington", "title_full": "US Orders Expulsion of 15 Diplomats From Cuba's Embassy in Washington", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/CUBA-DIPLOMACY-875.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "34b7d5dea84b028a980f03ed8cc3b178bb417e32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qSnfhrU_iZ3wqJD_WJRbnTNw7Tz5BXbCWVoNE64Xn3TVBZ3v1Dvw5YJoJoAUWEKGCBsGgyZQ.zcToRdx14jFsXk.fbXyUOpYsQ3MuSA_wHtfbJkXiOw_73FNzX3znMK.O", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "US Orders Expulsion of 15 Diplomats From Cuba's Embassy in Washington", "text": "1-min read US Orders Expulsion of 15 Diplomats From Cuba's Embassy in Washington US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the latest decision was made due to Cuba's \"failure to take appropriate steps\" to protect American personnel in Cuba who have been targeted in mysterious \"attacks\" that have damaged their health. \nReuters Updated: October 3, 2017, 9:56 PM IST In this filephoto, the Cuban national flag is seen raised over their new embassy in Washington. (Photo: Reuters/Carlos Barria) Washington : The Trump administration on Tuesday ordered the expulsion of 15 diplomats from Cuba\u2019s embassy in Washington following last week's US move to pull more than half of its own diplomats out of Havana. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the latest decision was made due to Cuba's \"failure to take appropriate steps\" to protect American personnel in Cuba who have been targeted in mysterious \"attacks\" that have damaged their health. The steps being taken by President Donald Trump's administration mark a further blow to his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s policy of rapprochement between Washington and Havana, former Cold War foes. A State Department official said the number of expulsions was selected to make sure the US and Cuban embassies would have \"equitable staffing levels\" while investigations continue into the unexplained \"health attacks.\" The US decision to expel a large portion of Cuban staff at the embassy was communicated to Cuban Ambassador Jose Ramon Cabanas on Tuesday, and the diplomats were given seven days to leave the United States, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The move follows an announcement on Friday that the United States was sharply reducing its diplomatic presence in Cuba as it warned US citizens not to visit because of attacks that have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in US embassy personnel. \u201cUntil the Government of Cuba can ensure the safety of our diplomats in Cuba, our embassy will be reduced to emergency personnel to minimize the number of diplomats at risk of exposure to harm,\u201d Tillerson said in a statement. \"We continue to maintain diplomatic relations with Cuba, and will continue to cooperate with Cuba as we pursue the investigation into these attacks,\" he added. The number of American diplomats suffering symptoms has increased to 22, the State Department official said. The official maintained that despite the US moves, Washington was not assigning \"culpability\" to Cuba's Communist government. Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including US Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be expelled in retaliation for the Cuban government's failure to get to the bottom of the attacks.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:37:50.028+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7d73b4a5ff3c98365f87334f9e1a5f286bb54821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTBIgzeForoMLmRf1IwwY7pWNRAF_9AmUEdO8uyaV3NozUvzwZxT4by5oCvkJWle8T73xQbmopJ2x7iPNtPhaNmhWmdZ0Og2AmHoKEWt.1Jbp2njdo4BNlcn88McWqmHdlg-", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/india.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top India News- News18.com", "title": "Srinagar Attack: Terrorist Impersonated CRPF Personnel to Ambush Soldiers", "title_full": "Srinagar Attack: Terrorist Impersonated CRPF Personnel to Ambush Soldiers", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/10/army-attack.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7d73b4a5ff3c98365f87334f9e1a5f286bb54821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33qw9gRuWdOYTBIgzeForoMLmRf1IwwY7pWNRAF_9AmUEdO8uyaV3NozUvzwZxT4by5oCvkJWle8T73xQbmopJ2x7iPNtPhaNmhWmdZ0Og2AmHoKEWt.1Jbp2njdo4BNlcn88McWqmHdlg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Srinagar Attack: Terrorist Impersonated CRPF Personnel to Ambush Soldiers", "text": "1-min read Srinagar Attack: Terrorist Disguised Himself in CRPF Uniform to Ambush Soldiers An assistant sub-inspector of the BSF was killed and four security personnel were injured in the attack on the security camp, which is close to the Humhama airport. \nArunima24 Updated: October 3, 2017, 11:08 PM IST Security personnel launch an operation at the building where militants were believed to be hiding after they stormed a BSF camp near Srinagar International Airport on Tuesday. (PTI Photo) Srinagar: The last of the three terrorists to be killed in the attack on the BSF camp near Srinagar on Tuesday had disguised himself as a CRPF personnel before mounting a final assault on the soldiers stationed at the base. An assistant sub-inspector of the BSF was killed and four security personnel were injured in the attack on the security camp, which is close to the Humhama airport. According to an official, after the first terrorist was killed, the two others ran into two buildings \u2013 the mess and the administrative block \u2013 and started firing from there. While the terrorist who ran towards the mess was killed in retaliatory firing by the security personnel, the third one came out of the administrative block wearing CRPF-like camouflage and tried to slip into the defensive perimeter set up by the security forces. He also positioned himself facing the administrative building and signalled a CRPF soldier to come closer. The soldier, assuming that it was a colleague who had run out of ammunition, moved towards him to supply more ammunition. It was then that the terrorist turned around and tried to shoot down as many CRPF men as he could, but was neutralised in retaliatory fire, said the official. The gun battle had lasted close to 10 hours. Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad called a local news agency and claimed responsibility. However, police sources said that the fidayeen squad has taken a lot of precautions to hide their Pakistani links. Police also believe that the attackers are from the same group that killed eight security personnel in Pulwama on August 26. \u201cThis group infiltrated from the Sakhdar side in Jammu region.

Updated: October 3, 2017, 11:29 PM IST Image credit: Reuters. FIFA have punished numerous African nations for offences during 2018 World Cup qualifiers last month, the world football body said Tuesday. Gabon forfeited by a mandatory 3-0 scoreline a match against Ivory Coast in Libreville for fielding suspended midfielder Merlin Tandjigora. However, the Gabonese lost the match 3-0 so the punishment effectively amounted to a $6,200 (5,300 euros) fine. Fielding ineligible players was a major problem in Africa during 2014 World Cup qualifying, but Portugal-based Tandjigora is the first culprit since. Nigeria were fined $30,000 after spectators invaded the pitch in Uyo during a 4-0 triumph over Cameroon. The Democratic Republic of Congo must pay FIFA $20,000 after the crowd hurled bottles and let off incendiary devices during a 2-2 draw with Tunisia in Kinshasa. Mali were fined $15,000 because fans flung bottles and chairs on the pitch in a 0-0 stalemate with Morocco in Bamako. The earlier qualifier between the same countries in Rabat led to a $3,000 fine for Morocco over whistling while the Malian national anthem was being played. Zambia received a $7,000 fine after the crowd hurled various unspecified objects on the pitch during a 3-1 victory over Algeria in Lusaka. Senegal and Burkina Faso were warned for late kick-offs in the qualifiers between them in Dakar and Ouagadougou. The fines are a serious blow as most African national football associations struggle financially with many relying on government bailouts for survival.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "merlin tandjigora", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cameroon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ouagadougou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kinshasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zambia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivory coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burkina faso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morocco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dakar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senegal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic republic of congo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rabat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libreville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "algeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lusaka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigeria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tunisia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bamako", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:25:20.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee76419940ae8ab99a1b4b426f3d0a80f0871197", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDPzEMSs5UIsvbkUnf4JXCt21bzAeLizG18QZAUUJKfbTQgbl7WDKjgcatehDxuCV7AZd1LAeLYZGk4IYmDPhARcXKC9FxcB_H4-", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/football.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Football News- News18.com", "title": "Putin Says 2018 World Cup Venues on Track Despite Delays", "title_full": "Putin Says 2018 World Cup Venues on Track Despite Delays", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/07/Putin1.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ee76419940ae8ab99a1b4b426f3d0a80f0871197", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDPzEMSs5UIsvbkUnf4JXCt21bzAeLizG18QZAUUJKfbTQgbl7WDKjgcatehDxuCV7AZd1LAeLYZGk4IYmDPhARcXKC9FxcB_H4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Putin Says 2018 World Cup Venues on Track Despite Delays", "text": "2-min read Putin Says 2018 World Cup Venues on Track Despite Delays Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that some construction work on the 2018 World Cup stadiums remained behind schedule Updated: October 3, 2017, 11:31 PM IST Russian President Vladimir Putin (Photo: REUTERS) Moscow: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that some construction work on the 2018 World Cup stadiums remained behind schedule, but he was satisfied with the overall condition of the venues. \"These delays are not critical, there is nothing terrible there, but as I have always said ... it is the most difficult thing to resolve tasks at a final stage,\" Putin said at a meeting with senior sports officials, regional governors and prominent athletes to discuss preparations for next year's tournament. \"If we relax, we will not fully accomplish the work.\" Moscow has eased visa regulations for foreign soccer fans and pumped billions of dollars into stadiums, hotels and other infrastructure. Yet while officials were upbeat about the country's progress in preparing for next year's tournament, they stressed that much still needed to be done. Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said preparations to host the 2018 tournament were in full swing but they had not been without difficulties and delays. Kolobkov said the 45,000-seat World Cup stadium in Samara, which has been plagued with delays over the past year, remained behind schedule. \"There are some delays at different stages of construction at the stadium in Samara,\" Kolobkov said, adding that the company building the venue had been fined. \"A timetable for making up for the delays and (a system) for the daily monitoring of the venue's completion have been established.\" The company building the stadium said in August it was 30 days behind schedule but hoped to make up for lost time and end work on the venue by the end of the year, the initial deadline for its completion. Russia showcased four of its 12 World Cup venues during this year's Confederations Cup, a two-week tournament that featured the home country, defending world champions Germany and the champions from FIFA's regional confederations. Many of the remaining venues, however, are still under construction and have yet to be tested. The post-World Cup future of some of the stadiums -- including those in cities that do not have Russian Premier League clubs -- remains under discussion. At the meeting on Tuesday, the governor of the Kaliningrad region, Anton Alikhanov, asked Putin to ensure that \"at least some regions\" receive state support to maintain the venues after the tournament. \"For Kaliningrad, where there is no Premier League team for now, handling a 35,000-seat stadium is quite difficult,\" Alikhanov said. Russia is set to host the World Cup from June 14-July 15 in 12 venues spread across 11 cities including Moscow, St Petersburg, Kazan and Sochi.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anton alikhanov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alikhanov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kolobkov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pavel kolobkov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kazan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "russian premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "premier league", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fifa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "st petersburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaliningrad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sochi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:47:56.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1a114a367f3847e1221ac834e6a78456f94aa614", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q9zu7tjWXCoMn1LFL1dq93sPg_q6g3HUSH7bMqN0r_34dCOcL5X_XHDQomb5ZQx51LnlUBh2nPlaxGnHYjAQQ4S5CAeaqPUKxT3anjtSdxfj5oB9k17Rzbw--", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.co.in/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=in&hl=en&topic=s&output=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sport - Google News", "title": "Pro Kabaddi League 2017: Telugu Titans Thrash Tamil Thalaivas 58-37 in Chennai - News18", "title_full": "Pro Kabaddi League 2017: Telugu Titans Thrash Tamil Thalaivas 58-37 in Chennai - News18", "published": "2017-10-03T21:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/08/tamil.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1a114a367f3847e1221ac834e6a78456f94aa614", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q9zu7tjWXCoMn1LFL1dq93sPg_q6g3HUSH7bMqN0r_34dCOcL5X_XHDQomb5ZQx51LnlUBh2nPlaxGnHYjAQQ4S5CAeaqPUKxT3anjtSdxfj5oB9k17Rzbw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T21:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pro Kabaddi League 2017: Telugu Titans Thrash Tamil Thalaivas 58-37 in Chennai - News18", "text": "1-min read Pro Kabaddi League 2017: Telugu Titans Thrash Tamil Thalaivas 58-37 in Chennai Telugu Titans swatted away the challenge of the Tamil Thalaivas with absolute ease to hand them their fourth straight home loss at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium and register a morale boosting 58-37 win. Updated: October 4, 2017, 12:12 AM IST Tamil Thalaivas (Twitter) New Delhi: Telugu Titans swatted away the challenge of the Tamil Thalaivas with absolute ease to hand them their fourth straight home loss at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium and register a morale boosting 58-37 win. Rahul Chaudhari, Mohsen Maghsoudlou and Nilesh Salunke picked up a Super 10 each to completely overshadow Ajay Thakur\u2019s 20-point performance. The southern derby started with Chaudhari picking up the first point for the Titans followed by K. Prapanjan for the Thalaivas. The first major action of the half was initiated by Thakur through a super raid in the 5th minute but thereafter everything went downhill for the hosts. The Titans answered back with a super tackle and Salunke\u2019s super raid in the span of a minute to push the Thalaivas to the brink of an All-Out. With Chaudhari\u2019s back-to-back raids, the hosts fell to their first All-Out in the 9th minute to hand the visitors a 16-8 lead by the end of the first quarter. Chaudhari continued his onslaught on the frail Thalaivas defence. Maghsoudlou and Chaudhari\u2019s two-point raids in quick succession handed the Thalaivas their second All-Out in the 15th minute. Even amidst a dismal show from the hosts where they failed to pick up a single tackle point, Thakur managed to complete his Super 10 in the 16th minute. The half ended with the Titans leading 30-15. The Titans continued their dominance into the second half with Chaudhari quickly completing his Super 10. Within two minutes, the Thalaivas disappointingly fell for their third All-Out to give the Titans a 21-point lead. Thakur continued his lone battle against a fervent Titans defence, and the hosts also managed to pick up their first tackle point as late as the 28th minute to enter the last 10 minutes trailing 20-41. With 21 points separating the two teams, the Thalaivas changed their strategy and enforced do-or-die raids to put pressure on the Titans raiders while picking up quick raid points themselves. Soon, they handed the Titans their first All-Out in the 36th minute to reduce the deficit. But the visitors weren\u2019t done yet. In the final minutes, both Maghsoudlou and Salunke completed Super 10s to initiate the Thalaivas\u2019 fourth All-Out and end the match with a commanding 58-37 win.

(Getty Images) \nNew Delhi: Former Australia opener feels that the recent incident involving Ben stokes has diverted all the attention from cricket, and that could have contrasting effects on the team. Stokes and his England teammate Alex Hales was handed indefinite bans by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). The matter is currently under investigation, after which the ECB is will make a decision on the future of the team. The southpaw also drew parallels from the 2013 incident that involved David Warner, and how the then coach Darren Lehmann handled the situation. \nRogers told The Mirror, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a factor; I just think it needs to be addressed. You have to get it out in the open, deal with it and move on. Credit to Darren Lehmann, that\u2019s what he did. One of the first bits of business he did was call (David) Warner on it and say, \u2018This is your last chance, you\u2019ve got to start doing the right things\u2019.\u201d \n\u201cIt almost galvanised us a bit (and) it could have that effect on England during The Ashes. It could have the opposite effect as well \u2014 it could cause a bit of friction, but it\u2019ll come down to the characters involved and the leaders, they\u2019re the most important people,\u201d Rogers added. \nRogers also hinted that it may not be the best idea to leave stokes out of the team right now, but could lead to more problems if he is allowed to play without getting a closure on the issue. \u201cIt will be interesting to see which characters step up to fill the void. But at the moment I don\u2019t see how you can fill that hole.

(Photo Credit: Reuters) Beijing: Rafael Nadal said on Tuesday that sport and politics must be separated, after Barcelona and Spanish football were dragged into the fall-out of the independence referendum in Catalonia. The world's number one tennis player is an icon in Spain, and had spoken earlier of how he was moved close to tears by Sunday's banned referendum and ensuing police crackdown and clashes, with hundreds injured. The 16-time Grand Slam champion was critical of the plebiscite in the lead-up, but appeared to change tack following his hard-won victory over France's Lucas Pouille in the first round of the China Open. \"We need to start separating things,\" the 31-year-old said in Beijing Tuesday, using his hands to underline the point. \"Sport and politics are not the same, in my opinion. And it is sad what's happening, but that's all.\" Nadal, who grew up and lives on the Balearic island of Mallorca, and is a Catalan speaker, described the situation as \"very delicate\". Barcelona on Sunday played their Spanish football league game against Las Palmas in an eerily empty Camp Nou as chaos unfolded on the streets. Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu said the decision to play the match behind closed doors was a protest against the violent clashes between police and activists in Catalonia, rather than a security issue. Two of the club's board members later resigned, having reportedly favoured Barca refusing to play altogether, even if it meant incurring a sporting sanction of forfeiting the match. The club's star defender Gerard Pique, a Spanish international, has been targeted by some Spanish supporters angry at his vocal pro-independence stance.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "josep maria bartomeu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas pouille", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerard pique", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "las palmas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barca", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camp nou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mallorca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:34:46.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ff1c001e9c02f5132acef77e76abb54d7a02faaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDOggnqrkot1cZoHlSG_gCrCyS5dy_Mz1nqAO2uFV2GB2c3btwTfy7Xv_NeAWodI2kwykMj8e2DQyAvzq8rHM8u7", "site_full": "www.news18.com", "site": "news18.com", "site_section": "http://www.news18.com/rss/sports.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Top Sports News- News18.com", "title": "Gujarat Fortunegiants Thump Dabang Delhi 42-22", "title_full": "Gujarat Fortunegiants Thump Dabang Delhi 42-22", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "IN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img01.ibnlive.in/ibnlive/uploads/2017/09/UP-Yodha-Dabang-Delhi.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ff1c001e9c02f5132acef77e76abb54d7a02faaf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.LFRYdQByCB64nQYVHo33q4Ulpm5GwdDOggnqrkot1cZoHlSG_gCrCyS5dy_Mz1nqAO2uFV2GB2c3btwTfy7Xv_NeAWodI2kwykMj8e2DQyAvzq8rHM8u7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gujarat Fortunegiants Thump Dabang Delhi 42-22", "text": "1-min read Gujarat Fortunegiants Thump Dabang Delhi 42-22 With this win Gujarat maintain their status of leaders in Zone A, while Delhi are still at the bottom \nPTI Updated: October 3, 2017, 9:59 PM IST With this win Gujarat maintain their status of leaders in Zone A, while Delhi are still at the bottom Chennai: Gujarat Fortunegiants made short work of Dabang Delhi, posting a crushing 42-22 win in Vivo Pro Kabaddi Season 5 at Nehru Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday. Sachin and Chandran Ranjit combined to score 20 raid points for Gujarat. It was yet another dismal showing by the team from Delhi as it crashed to their 14th defeat in the campaign. Dabang Delhi's defence was terrible as they scored just four points. Gujarat Fortunegiants are top of the table in Zone A with 67 points from 18 matches. Dabang Delhi are rooted to the bottom of the table with 31 points after 19 matches. Gujarat made a blistering start and led 4-1 in the fourth minute with Sachin scoring two raid points. Delhi forced a super tackle in the sixth minute to trail 3-9. In the next minute, Gujarat inflicted an allout to lead 12-3. Sachin and Ranjit continued to pile on points for Gujarat as they led 17-5 after 12 minutes. Dabang Delhi raiders couldn't keep up with Gujarat defence whereas their defenders were finding it difficult to contain the opposition raiders.
