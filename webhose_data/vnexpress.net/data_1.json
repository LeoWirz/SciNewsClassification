Photo by AFP/Hoang Dinh Nam Rival taxi companies that are losing out to Grab claim it is shifting money into overseas accounts to foil detection. Grab Vietnam has dismissed accusations made by traditional taxi firms that it has been transferring money overseas to dodge taxes in Vietnam. Nguyen Thu An, director of communications for the local subsidiary of the Malaysia-based ride-hailing company, said in a statement that the accusations were \u201ccompletely false and groundless.\" They also violated the law and damaged the reputation of the company and its partners, she said. An was responding to a petition filed by the Hanoi Taxi Association last week that asked authorities to curb the development of Uber and Grab, which it said have been transferring a combined VND3.6 trillion ($158.4 million) overseas every year. An said that Grab Vietnam has always fulfilled its tax obligations, and that its tax payments in Vietnam have been increasing nearly fourfold each year. Uber Vietnam, whose CEO stepped down this month, has not commented on the matter. Grab entered Vietnam in February 2014 several months before its main rival Uber. Both operate car and motorbike taxi services. Like in most other countries where they are available, the tech-based apps have all but upended traditional services in Vietnam. Taxi firms in Hanoi and Saigon have repeatedly harped on losing business to the newcomers who they claim are subject to more relaxed tax and operational regulations. Vinasun, the country\u2019s largest taxi firm, said 8,000 of its drivers quit in the first half of this year, while Mai Linh, another major firm, reported 6,000 drivers leaving. In the latest petition, the Hanoi Taxi Association said that the number of taxis in Hanoi and Saigon, including Uber and Grab cars, has reached 80,000, and far beyond the number planned for both cities. \u201cWe need to immediately stop further growth of these cars,\u201d it said. Saigon, the country\u2019s largest city where traffic jams occur at any time of day now, has already taken action. Last month, the city instructed Uber and Grab to delay any plans they have of expanding their fleets. The city\u2019s transport department said that the number of cars providing ride-hailing taxi service in the city has increased from 300 in late 2015 to more than 23,000 today. Together with traditional taxi cars, the city\u2019s roads are now filled with more than 34,000 cabs, sabotaging its plan to cap that figure at 12,700 in 2020, the department said.

Photo by Reuters /Carlos Barria/File Photo At least 21 U.S. embassy employees in Cuba have been reported injured. The Trump administration will order nearly two-thirds of Cuba's diplomatic personnel to leave the United States after months of mysterious \"attacks\" that have damaged the health of American embassy staff in Havana, according to a congressional source and a person familiar with the plan. The U.S. State Department is expected to announce the expulsion on Tuesday, the sources said on Monday. The decision follows an announcement on Friday that the United States was cutting its diplomatic presence in Cuba by more than half as it warned U.S. citizens not to visit because of unexplained incidents that have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in U.S. embassy personnel. The latest plan was first reported by the Miami Herald, which cited a source as saying the expulsion of Cuban personnel was in \"reciprocity\" for the U.S. drawdown from Havana. The steps being taken by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration mark a further blow to his predecessor Barack Obama\u2019s policy of rapprochement between Washington and Havana, former Cold War foes. The State Department declined to comment on an expulsion plan, except to say that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson \u201ccontinues to evaluate steps that the Department can take to ensure the Cuban government is accountable to its responsibility to protect diplomats.\u201d Several Cuban-American Republican lawmakers, including U.S Senator Marco Rubio and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, had urged that Cuban diplomats be expelled in retaliation for the Cuban government\u2019s failure to get to the bottom of the attacks. Trump administration officials planned to brief lawmakers on their Cuba policy on Tuesday, another congressional aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity. At least 21 U.S. embassy staffers affected The State Department announced on Friday that in addition to drawing down staff in Havana to essential personnel, the embassy was halting regular visa operations for Cubans seeking to visit the United States and would offer only emergency services to U.S. citizens. At least 21 U.S. embassy employees in Cuba have been injured and reported symptoms such as hearing loss, dizziness, headache, fatigue, cognitive issues, and difficulty sleeping, the State Department said on Friday. Cuba's Foreign Ministry Chief for U.S. Affairs Josefina Vidal said last week that the U.S. decision to reduce staff at its Havana embassy was hasty and will affect bilateral relations, Cuba, the United States and Canada have investigated the attacks, but the probe has not yielded any answers about how they were carried out or who was responsible for them. Cuba has denied involvement in the attacks. The State Department has not directly blamed Havana for them but asked two Cuban diplomats to leave Washington in May. The U.S. measures will stop short of breaking off relations or closing the two countries\u2019embassies, which reopened in 2015 following more than five decades of hostility. But the bizarre case has brought simmering U.S.-Cuba tensions since Trump took office to a boil. Trump, who in June vowed to partially roll back the detente with Cuba agreed by his Democratic predecessor Obama, called the Cuban government \"corrupt and destabilizing\" in his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month. He said he would not lift the U.S. trade embargo on the Caribbean island until it made \"fundamental reforms.\" Cuba described his comments as \"unacceptable and meddling.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:32:11.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8536c744fce8b2da04093ee9f9893f46015a7548", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CKRkHlp7fqWNT.9zgdtQb3mjPnlqMCSHpR3LWV7dLlRmG2TDyrBk234dXdDAVEccCSj3WN0cAE8Vh31EKGYMo7incUgRN0fx6_ueVyofgfaNHFJWIz1Jdzh9Hz3ds9sJrY-", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Ahead of key Party gathering, Vietnam reaffirms \u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 anti-graft push", "title_full": "Ahead of key Party gathering, Vietnam reaffirms \u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 anti-graft push", "published": "2017-10-03T18:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/03/Corruption1-1507045083_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 22, "comments": 0, "shares": 22}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8536c744fce8b2da04093ee9f9893f46015a7548", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CKRkHlp7fqWNT.9zgdtQb3mjPnlqMCSHpR3LWV7dLlRmG2TDyrBk234dXdDAVEccCSj3WN0cAE8Vh31EKGYMo7incUgRN0fx6_ueVyofgfaNHFJWIz1Jdzh9Hz3ds9sJrY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ahead of key Party gathering, Vietnam reaffirms \u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 anti-graft push", "text": "Ahead of key Party gathering, Vietnam reaffirms \u2018no-holds-barred\u2019 anti-graft push By Staff reporters  October 3, 2017 | 10:46 pm GMT+7 Any action to be taken against Da Nang's top leaders will not affect the APEC summit to be held in the central city this November. Vietnam\u2019s top leadership will continue to press ahead with the \u201cno-holds-barred\u201d crackdown on corruption that has ensnared scores of officials, a government minister has said just on the eve of a major meeting of senior Communist Party members. Mai Tien Dung, Minister and Chairman of the Government Office, reiterated the political will from the Party and the government to fight corruption at a press conference on Wednesday that took place after the monthly cabinet meeting. Dung also said the punishment facing the two top leaders of Da Nang would not affect the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit to be held in the central city this November. Essentially, according to Dung, preparations for the summit have been calibrated and managed by top leaders in Hanoi and are not intertwined with any action to be taken against the leaders of the host city. Last Friday, the Communist Party\u2019s top watchdog gave a slightly clearer inkling of what will become of the two top leaders of Da Nang after naming and shaming them for misconduct, mismanagement and dishonesty. Huynh Duc Tho, Da Nang\u2019s chairman, received a warning from the Communist Party, which has four modes of punishment for misconduct by official members: reprimand, warning, demotion and expulsion. Meanwhile, Nguyen Xuan Anh, Da Nang\u2019s Party chief, will have to await a final verdict from the Politburo, the Party's decision-making body. The Politburo is expected to issue such a decision at a key gathering that opens Wednesday in Hanoi with over 200 senior Party members in attendance. Such regular biannual meetings are usually one week to ten days long. Vietnam\u2019s Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, who is spearheading the anti-corruption campaign, said in July that the fight against corruption has become a movement. Photo by AFP/Hoang Dinh Nam State energy giant PetroVietnam and the banking sector have been at the center of the crackdown that has netted a slew of high-ranking officials. Chief among them is Dinh La Thang , who was ousted from the Politburo last May and fired as the top leader of Ho Chi Minh City soon after. Just last Friday in Hanoi, a former chairman of the state energy giant PetroVietnam was sentenced to death and a former CEO of a scandal-hit bank got a life sentence in what has been considered the biggest fraud trial in Vietnam\u2019s history. The OceanBank trial, as referred to by local media, also saw a raft of officials and bankers receive jail terms of up to 22 years. According to analysts, restructuring and reorganizing are expected to be high on the agenda of the Party gathering this time. Disciplinary actions against senior Party members seem to be another major theme, analysts say. At a similar meeting in 2012, the Party\u2019s Central Committee struck down a Politburo proposal to punish itself as a group and a government leader. But that was an extremely rare occasion in which the Politburo and the Central Committee were not on the same page on disciplinary decisions. Such discordance seems unlikely this time, analysts say. In August, the Party issued a directive that for the first time set out rules for top officials with an emphasis on fighting corruption, avoiding nepotism and living modestly. Top officials must display \"no corruption or opportunism... and be determined to push back against the degeneration in political ideology,\" said the directive, agreed by the Politburo. They must have \"absolutely no ambition for power\", \"absolutely not let relatives and acquaintances benefit from their positions\" and should lead \"an honest, modest, sincere, transparent, simple and generous life,\" according to the directive. \u201cThe Party is clearly concerned about corruption. It is their Achilles heel, and they know it,\u201d Zachary Abuza, a Southeast Asia analyst in Washington, said. \u201cThe leadership wants to send a clear message that it is serious about countering corruption, and that even the senior leadership is not above scrutiny,\u201d Abuza said.

A 2013 hack affected all three billion accounts at Yahoo, triple the original estimate, the online giant's parent company said Tuesday following a new analysis of the incident. The disclosure from Verizon, which acquired Yahoo's online assets earlier this year, revised upward the initial estimate of one billion accounts affected. The statement said the estimate is based on \"new intelligence\" following an investigation with the assistance of outside forensic experts into the incident in August 2013. \"While this is not a new security issue, Yahoo is sending email notifications to the additional affected user accounts,\" said a statement issued by Verizon's internet unit known as Oath. \"The investigation indicates that the user account information that was stolen did not include passwords in clear text, payment card data, or bank account information. The company is continuing to work closely with law enforcement.\" The Yahoo breach was already believed to be the largest ever in terms of numbers of users affected. But a recently disclosed breach by credit agency Equifax is seen as potentially more damaging because of the sensitivity of the data leaked. Yahoo brand lives on Although Yahoo is no longer an independent company -- its financial holdings are in a separate company now called Altaba -- Verizon has continued to operate the Yahoo brand, including its email service and a variety of news and entertainment websites. Oath includes the Yahoo internet operations along with those of another former internet star, AOL. \"Verizon is committed to the highest standards of accountability and transparency, and we proactively work to ensure the safety and security of our users and networks in an evolving landscape of online threats,\" said Chandra McMahon, the company's chief information security officer. \"Our investment in Yahoo is allowing that team to continue to take significant steps to enhance their security, as well as benefit from Verizon's experience and resources.\" Yahoo, which was once one of the leading internet firms, sold its main online operations to Verizon in a deal that closed in June for $4.48 billion. The purchase price was cut following revelations of two major data breaches at Yahoo. In addition to the 2013 breach, Yahoo said that hackers in 2014 stole personal data from more than 500 million of its user accounts. The US Justice Department charged two Russian intelligence operatives and a pair of hackers over one of the attacks, which had apparent twin goals of espionage and financial gain. Canadian authorities this year arrested Karim Baratov, 22, an immigrant from Kazakhstan, on a US warrant. US authorities allege Russian intelligence agents hired Baratov and another hacker to carry out attacks on Yahoo from 2014 to 2016. The attacks at Yahoo and Equifax have raised troubling questions about online security and data theft which may be used for fraud or espionage purposes. Earlier Tuesday, a White House cybersecurity aide said officials were looking at using new types of identifiers online which would eliminate the use of social security numbers, which were leaked in the Equifax incident. \"I feel very strongly that the social security number has outlived its usefulness,\" Rob Joyce said. For years, social security numbers have been used by Americans to open bank accounts or establish their identity when applying for credit.

Photo via Social media/Handout via Reuters 'We've never even thought about our locking doors. We didn't know we lived two doors down from a lunatic.' In America's macabre recent history of mass shootings, it has become something of a cliche: the loner who moved silently in his community, never getting too close to neighbors or revealing his hand. Stephen Paddock, the gunman behind the deadliest such attack in modern U.S. history who murdered 59 people in Las Vegas on Sunday, joins that chilling roll call of reclusive killers. Neighbors in Mesquite, a fast-growing casino town on Nevada's border with Arizona, described their shock Tuesday at discovering the evil lurking within their close-knit locale of fewer than 20,000. \"I didn't realize until I started watching the news that the lunatic lived right here. When I heard he lived in Mesquite and I saw all the traffic, that's when it sunk in,\" said Rod Sweningson, whose home is yards from Paddock's stone-clad and faux stucco bungalow. Sweningson recalled his alarm when the FBI showed up in the small hours of Monday, letting neighbors know they were about to hear a bang as federal agents broke into the killer's potentially booby-trapped home. Earlier that night, officers had found 23 firearms -- including 16 assault rifles -- inside Paddock's 32nd floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel on the Las Vegas Strip, where Paddock had killed himself before they arrived. \"I suspect that from what they found... they had no idea what was going on in that house. I think they took every precaution they could when they went in. They weren\u2019t joking around,\" Sweningson told AFP . He described that part of Mesquite as a \"quiet, sleepy little community\" where security was usually an afterthought. \"We've never even thought about our locking doors. We didn't know we lived two doors down from a lunatic.\" He added that, even though he lived among them, neighbors hardly ever clapped eyes on Paddock. \"We could have passed each other going back and forth to the mailbox -- and we probably did a number of times -- but even now, looking at the news, I don't know him,\" he said. 'Too close to home' Residents speculated that Paddock may have played golf and that he was to be found occasionally having lunch at the local senior citizens' club, although staff at the club itself said they did not have his name on any visitors list and didn't recognize his face, a mainstay on television news in the last 24 hours. Freelance writer and local resident Teri Nehrenz revealed that she had lived in the next town along from Bath, Ohio, where \"Milwaukee Cannibal\" Jeffrey Dahmer grew up, and says she even dated someone who went to school with the notorious serial killer. \"That was bad enough, now this is a second time. It kind of has a tendency to rattle a person a little bit,\" she told AFP, breaking down in tears. \"It's a little too close to home. You always think you're protected from this kind of thing and it slaps you in the face that you are not.\" The 54-year-old, who has covered community events in Mesquite for the local newspaper for several years, described Paddock as having gone \"completely under the radar\" since moving in from Florida two years ago. \"I have spoken with people I know who work at the casinos in the cashier positions. \"He did frequent the casinos -- he was very into gambling -- but he stayed with the machines. He didn't interact with the hotel security guards, never caused any problems with them, never got a traffic ticket in the city,\" Nehrenz told AFP . 'Pretty numb' \"He never attended any community events. Civic organizations -- he didn't belong to any of those. I heard he might have golfed... He's the most notoriously unknown person in town, seriously.\" Nehrenz said one of Paddock's neighbors had revealed that he would occasionally embark on \"political rants\" but she added that the neighbor \"didn't specify what party or whether he was angry-political or whatever.\" Nehrenz described the community of fewer than 20,000 residents as \"pretty numb.\" \"It was shocking, and more than a little devastating, but we have a strong community here -- one of the best -- they'll pull together through it. \"They are handling it. It was a very quiet day here yesterday. We had friends and family members here in Mesquite who were attending the concert, of course. A couple were injured but okay. One returned, thank God, uninjured.\" Mesquite, one of the fastest-growing towns in the U.S., is a traditional stopping point on the road from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City. The community around Paddock's home is described by residents as mainly elderly, with affluent inhabitants who often spend their summers in cooler nearby ski resorts such as Park City, Utah. \"If people don't come knocking on your door -- the people here respect the quiet that most people come to get -- nobody would pry into his business,\" Nehrenz said. \"We're a small, tight-knit community but they're not all up in everybody else's business unless you want them to be.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephen paddock", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rod sweningson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweningson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeffrey dahmer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teri nehrenz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nehrenz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "milwaukee cannibal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paddock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandalay bay", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salt lake city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T04:24:15.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e47520efeb43b148f849d2b9156000423481ec32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695n6T7q4gqKmlfE.u7BFYZ7QOAgOAVDhveiOgqjL2gjSsx4S6XH2yyD1W8UFpwjthjBAID6ubb_YTvGYcMhUpF7pxI6gv44hEBNPEVmv_OS_wSfAZaHLELQrg--", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Chanel models parade past Paris waterfalls", "title_full": "Chanel models parade past Paris waterfalls", "published": "2017-10-04T05:14:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/04/FASHIONPARISCHANEL5JPG-1507080-6878-9382-1507080880_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e47520efeb43b148f849d2b9156000423481ec32", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695n6T7q4gqKmlfE.u7BFYZ7QOAgOAVDhveiOgqjL2gjSsx4S6XH2yyD1W8UFpwjthjBAID6ubb_YTvGYcMhUpF7pxI6gv44hEBNPEVmv_OS_wSfAZaHLELQrg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T05:14:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chanel models parade past Paris waterfalls", "text": "October 01, 2017 GMT+7 Chanel models parade past Paris waterfalls By Reuters/Mark Hanrahan  October 4, 2017 | 09:14 am GMT+7 A model presents a creation by German designer Karl Lagerfeld as part of his Spring/Summer 2018 women's ready-to-wear collection show for fashion house Chanel at the Grand Palais during Paris Fashion Week, France, October 3, 2017. Photo by Reuters/Gonzalo Fuentes An army of 'water nymphs' and modish mermaids in glittering white and blue-green outfits were sent out. Karl Lagerfeld brought the drama of the natural world indoors for Chanel's catwalk show on the final day of Paris Fashion Week, with a huge cliff complete with waterfall towering behind the catwalk. Held inside the beaux-arts-style Grand Palais exhibition hall, Chanel unveiled its spring/summer 2018 ready-to-wear collection to a crowd including \"Specter\" star Monica Bellucci and Chinese actress Baihe Bai. The models came equipped for the perils of such an unconventional setting - many sporting thigh-high, clear plastic rain boots as well as plastic hats, ponchos and gloves as they strode past the waterfall which flowed beside the catwalk. The collection also featured examples of the label's traditional tweed suits, as well as 1960s-inflected miniskirts, transparent skirts, oversize trousers and ruffled lace dresses. Model-of-the-moment Kaia Gerber, the 16-year-old daughter of supermodel Cindy Crawford opened the show, continuing her run of high-profile appearances, sporting a loose-fitting, tassled jacket with a miniskirt and a tube top, accented with plastic boots. Earlier in the week she appeared in both the Yves Saint Laurent and Valentino catwalk shows. Underscoring the fashion house's attempts to connect with customers in Asia, social media was abuzz with the presence of South Korean celebrities at the show, in the form of rapper G-Dragon and actress Park Shin-hye. More than 80 fashion houses have showcased looks for next year during the course of this Paris Fashion Week, which closes the latest season of shows that have whizzed through New York, London and Milan.

North Korea's U.N. envoy accused the United States on Tuesday of working to block economic development and denounced sanctions imposed on poor countries as a bid to \"destroy modern civilization.\" Ambassador Ja Song Nam said North Korea will withstand the blow of sanctions and continue \"along the road of building the socialist power by dint of the spirit of self-reliance and self-development.\" Ja spoke at a debate at the General Assembly that focused on the U.N.'s global development goals that aim to eradicate extreme poverty by 2050, advance health and promote education. \"The U.S. is clinging to unprecedented nuclear threats and blackmail, economic sanctions and blockade to deny our rights to existence and development but they only result in our sharper vigilance and greater courage,\" said Ja. The United States led the drive at the Security Council to impose two recent sets of sanctions on North Korea to punish Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile tests. In August, the council cut off North Korea's exports of coal and other minerals and last month expanded the export ban to textile, North Korean guest workers and also capped oil exports. Washington has also slapped unilateral sanctions on firms that do business with North Korea. To achieve the U.N.'s development goals, \"we should immediately obliterate the high-handed measures of the U.S. including the sanctions imposed on the developing countries,\" Ja said. The U.S. measures \"are trying to destroy modern civilization and to plunge this world into the medieval darkness,\" he said. According to U.N. figures, about 70 percent of North Korea's population lack basic services and are suffering from food shortages, partly caused by droughts, floods and landslides that have devastated agriculture.

Photo by Reuters/Mike Blake/File Photo The woman from Nova Scotia, Canada, who slid into the backseat of Paul Hwangpo's car got right to the point: Take me to the nearest blood bank. It was not a typical request for an Uber driver in America\u2019s capital of gambling, all-you-can-eat buffets and spangled entertainment. But it was no typical day. It was the morning after 59 people were slain and more than 500 injured in gunfire that rained down on an open-air country music concert near Las Vegas' strip of neon-lit casinos. The gunman, identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock who lived in a Nevada retirement home, ended Sunday night's shooting spree, the deadliest in modern U.S. history, by killing himself. Hwangpo took the visitor from Nova Scotia to a blood donation place near the medical center where surgeons labored to repair organs battered and bones broken by bullets. She got in line with hundreds of other people who would wait hours to give what they could \u2013 a pint from the heart. \"That's solidarity,\" Hwangpo observed. The queues outside Las Vegas blood donation centers were a reflection of the city \u2013 a place swelled daily by tens of thousands of tourists and conventioneers, all served by legions of immigrants driving cabs, cleaning rooms and tending bar. Blood bank workers said they met donors from Arizona and California and as far away as China, Japan, Honduras, Venezuela, Brazil and Switzerland. Some from Mexico said it was a way to make up for being unable to contribute to the recovery from a disastrous earthquake there two weeks ago, said United Blood Services donor recruiter Laura Alvarado. To accommodate the outpouring of goodwill, the blood bank organized a pop-up center nearby. The effort began before dawn the morning after the shooting. As their shifts ended at the UMC Trauma Center, hospital workers volunteered to scout a location, settling on a parking lot across the street. \"It started with a couple of tents and a sign-in sheet,\" Alvarado said. By evening, there were two mobile buses, awnings, folding chairs and a steady supply of pizza, donuts and water donated by merchants. Sal Messina went straight from the airport to a blood donation center. \"As soon as I landed, before the hotel, I told the cab driver, take me here,\" said Messina, a security officer and native Italian who flew in from his home in northern California for work meetings. \"It's the only way you can combat the insanity and evil in the world,\" Messina said. In a typical day, hospitals in the Las Vegas area use about 300 units of blood products, which take a couple of days to test and prepare. In the hours immediately after the shooting, the bank sent 200 units to one hospital alone, UMC Trauma, which received the most critical patients. \"That left a pretty bare shelf,\" Alvarado said. An appeal went out, which usually draws a bump in donations. But, within hours, more than 1,000 people had signed up. Javier Wong, a restaurant worker who moved to Las Vegas from Panama 25 years ago, waited more than eight hours to give blood. He said he saw it as a way to support the victims the way his adopted home had supported him. \"I'm giving back,\" Wong said. The need was met by donors who gave up a day of a vacation or a day off work.

Photo by VnExpress/Xuan Hoa Aviation authorities have promised to look into the matter and order carriers to add more flights to ease prices if necessary. Vietnamese travelers have been puzzled over unusually high air fares in the middle of the low season, and airlines have been unable to come up with a satisfactory explanation for the sudden jump. Domestic air fares have surged by up to three times since the beginning of this month, to around VND3.6 million ($158) for a one-way ticket from Hanoi to Saigon, for example. Air fares from the capital to popular resort towns such as Da Lat and Nha Trang have risen around 50 percent. Even ticket retailers said they have been caught off guard, and that customers are no longer receiving better rates by booking a week in advance. \u201cThe price hikes are unreasonable,\" a source from a ticket office in Hanoi said. \" They are as expensive as the Lunar New Year holiday season, but this is the low season.\u201d But carriers have cited the low season itself as the root of the problem. They said they have reduced the number of flights because demand is less, and services on some long routes have been cut by half. A source from budget carrier Jetstar said that there may have been a miscalculation between operational planning and actual demand. He said the demand for this year\u2019s low season might be higher than last year, but carriers plan their flight cuts based on previous years\u2019 data. The cuts aim to reduce costs and allow aircraft maintenance to be carried out ahead of the year-end peak season, he said. Air tickets are still available for a range of prices, but late birds will be left with all the expensive fares, he said. A representative from private carrier Vietjet also said that price fluctuations are driven by supply and demand. But carriers said the high prices are still below the limits set by the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV). A CAAV official said it is checking the prices and will order the carriers to add more flights if necessary, according to Tin Tuc , a Vietnam News Agency news website .

Vietnam Airlines has called for a police investigation after many of its customers reported their flight and contact information had been leaked, according to a representative of the national airline. The Ministry of Transport has also instructed the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam to look into the issue. The airline cited customer complaints as saying they had received text messages and phone calls inviting them to use certain taxi services upon their arrival at Hanoi's Noi Bai International Airport. Having never been contacted by these taxi companies before, most of these passengers said they found it unusual for the companies to have their personal and flight information. Nguyen Huy Duong, deputy director of Noi Bai airport, told local media that keeping passengers' flight and personal information secure is the airline's responsibility, not the airport's. However, a representative of budget airline VietJet Air said the airline is not the only party with access to customer information, which is by regulations also available to booking offices, booking agents and ground services at the airports. In a recent investigation into the case, Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper interviewed some of the taxi drivers involved. They claimed they received passenger information either directly from booking offices or from third-party companies.

Dozens fall sick after eating home-cooked pork dishes and drinking rice wine. Three people in the northern province of Ha Giang have died from suspected food poisoning after attending an engagement party held by neighbors. Food safety officials said they have yet to ascertain the cause of death, but the most probable explanation is the food and drink served at the party on Sunday. A family from Vi Xuyen District near the Chinese border, around 300 kilometers (180 miles) north of Hanoi, had invited 66 guests to their celebrate their son\u2019s engagement, and served home-cooked dishes including stir-fried pork, papaya soup and rice wine. A total of 66 people attended the party, but dozens fell sick suffering from nausea, stomachache and vomiting shortly after. Three men aged 42, 47 and 59 died in hospital on Tuesday. Mass food poisonings are not uncommon in Vietnam and occur mostly in factory and school canteens, but the list of victims also includes guests at big parties in rural areas. In August, 183 guests at a wedding party in the central province of Ninh Thuan were rushed to hospital with food poisoning. More than 50 wedding guests suffered the same problem in Ha Giang in February, the same month that eight people died of poisoning after drinking wine at a funeral wake in the nearby Lai Chau Province. Official figures showed that 73 cases of food poisoning killed 16 people and affected nearly 1,600 others in the first half of this year in Vietnam.

The captain of the Malaysian Airlines aircraft that vanished somewhere in the southern Indian Ocean with 239 people on board had flown a route on his home flight simulator six weeks earlier that was \"initially similar\" to the one actually taken, Australian authorities said on Tuesday. The details were contained in a 440-page final report by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) on the unsuccessful search for flight MH370. The disappearance of the Boeing 777 on March 8, 2014, on a flight to Beijing from the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, has become one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries. The report concluded that the reasons for the loss of the aircraft could not be established with certainty until the aircraft was found. \"It is almost inconceivable and certainly societal unacceptable in the modern aviation era...for a large commercial aircraft to be missing and for the world not to know with certainty what became of the aircraft and those on board,\" the ATSB said. The aircraft was thought to have been diverted thousands of miles off course out over the southern Indian Ocean before crashing off the coast of Western Australia. Australia, which led the underwater hunt, and Malaysia and China called off a A$200 million ($160 million) search for the plane in January, despite the protests of families of those onboard. Home simulation Six weeks before the aircraft's disappearance, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah used his home simulator to fly a route that was initially similar to part of the route flown by MH370 up the Strait of Malacca, with a left-hand turn and track into the southern Indian Ocean, the ATSB said in its report. \"By the last data point the aircraft had flown approximately 4,200 nautical miles,\" the report said. \"This was further than was possible with the fuel loaded on board the aircraft for flight MH370.\" The simulated aircraft track was also inconsistent with those modelled using satellite signal data from MH370, the report said. However, the ATSB said there were enough similarities to the flight path of MH370 for the agency to carefully consider the possible implications for the underwater search area, including whether it glided after fuel exhaustion or was ditched in a controlled manner. Aircraft debris found later indicated the flaps were most likely retracted, which wasn't consistent with a controlled ditching, the report said. Australia's main scientific agency said in August it believes with \"unprecedented precision and certainty\" that the plane crashed northeast of the search zone. But those findings were dismissed by Australia's government at the time as not specific enough, and the search has not been re-opened. Doing so depends on finding credible, new evidence about the plane's whereabouts. The ATSB report published on Tuesday detailed the unsuccessful 1,046-day hunt for the plane, above and below the surface of the Indian Ocean, and scientific analyses of satellite pictures, sea currents and even barnacles found clinging to a piece of the plane found on Reunion Island. \"The understanding of where MH370 may be located is better now than it has ever been. The underwater search has eliminated most of the high probability areas,\" the ATSB said. \"We...deeply regret that we have not been able to locate the aircraft, nor those 239 souls on board that remain missing.\" It recommends aircraft and aircraft equipment manufacturers investigate providing better methods of automated satellite tracking for planes if they encounter problems during flight in future. Malaysia has continued to investigate the plane's whereabouts and in August said it received an offer from a private seabed exploration firm, Ocean Infinity, to resume the search. Malaysian investigators said in 2015 there was nothing suspicious in the financial, medical or personal histories of pilots or crew.

A Myanmar beauty queen says she was stripped of her pageant title after posting a graphic video accusing Muslim Rohingya militants of driving communal violence in Rakhine state, a conflict fraught with controversy in the mainly Buddhist country. Myanmar's army is accused of waging an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya in the far west, where more than half a million of the Muslim minority have fled across the border to Bangladesh since August 25. In the face of intense global condemnation, Myanmar authorities have staunchly defended the security operation as a legitimate crackdown on Rohingya militants who attacked police posts last month. The conflict has curdled religious tensions inside Myanmar, fanning Buddhist nationalism and a hatred against the Rohingya that has been steeping for years. In a video posted on her Facebook last week, Miss Grand Myanmar Shwe Eain Si accused the Rohingya militants of leading a \"media campaign\" to trick the world into thinking \"they are the oppressed\". Shots of Shwe Eain Si speaking to the camera were interspersed with graphic images of people with bloody gashes across their faces, nude babies and screenshots from videos posted by the militant group, known as ARSA (Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army). On Sunday the firm behind the beauty pageant announced Shwe Eain Si had been stripped of her title for breaching contract rules, in a statement that did not mention the video on Rakhine. But in a reply posted on Facebook Tuesday Shwe Eain Si said these accusations were \"groundless\" and linked the move to her comments on the Rohingya. One of the company's complaints, the beauty queen wrote, was that she \"failed to project a decent image of a pageant contestant\". \"Yes, Shwe Eain Si made a video about the reign of terror brought about by the ARSA militants in Rakhine State, but that was hardly qualified as a failure to project a decent image of a pageant contestant,\" her post said. Miss Universe Myanmar was not immediately available for comment. It is not the first time Myanmar's nascent beauty queen scene has been rocked by drama. Earlier this year a prominent transgender pageant winner was detained after a famous actress sued her for defamation over insults posted on a popular celebrity gossip page. And in 2014 a Myanmar beauty queen was dethroned for alleged dishonesty and bad behavior, after which she ran off with her crown to South Korea.

Sydney and Melbourne could regularly face 50 degree Celsius (122F) days within 25 years even if Australia meets its Paris global warming targets, a new study warned Wednesday. Other areas across the country should also prepare for extreme heat, said the research led by the Australian National University (ANU) and supported by the Center of Excellence for Climate System Science, an international consortium. The study assessed the potential magnitude of future extreme temperatures under the 196-nation Paris Agreement, which targets curbing increases in global temperatures to between 1.5C and 2.0C above pre-industrial levels. \"Major Australian cities, such as Sydney and Melbourne, may experience unprecedented temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius under 2.0 degrees of global warming,\" said lead author and ANU climate scientist Sophie Lewis, adding it could occur by the 2040s. \"The increase in Australian summer temperatures indicates that other major cities should also be prepared for unprecedented future extreme heat.\" The study's climate modeling projected daily temperatures of up to 3.8C above existing records in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, despite efforts to curb warming. In ratifying the Paris agreement last year, Australia set an ambitious target to reduce emissions to 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. This would represent a 50\u201352 per cent reduction in emissions per capita between 2005 and 2030. With its heavy use of coal-fired power and relatively small population of 24 million, Australia is considered one of the world's worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters. Lewis said dealing with such heat in cities would need proper planning, with hospitals better equipped to cope with more admissions. Australia has just experienced its hottest winter on record amid a long-term warming trend largely attributed to climate change. Maximum daytime temperatures were 1.9C above the long-term national average of 21.8C during the June-August season, the Bureau of Meteorology said last month. Data from the weather bureau and national science body CSIRO shows Australia has warmed by approximately 1.0C since 1910. More recently, over 200 weather records were broken during the last summer, with intense heatwaves, bushfires and flooding plaguing the December 2016-February 2017 season. The study, published in Geophysical Research Letters, said only immediate climate action internationally could prevent record extreme seasons year after year. \"One of the hottest years on record globally in 2015 could be an average year by 2025,\" said Lewis. Fellow researcher Andrew King, from the University of Melbourne, said the study team used a combination of observations and modeling to assess how the magnitude of record-breaking events may change in the future. \"Previous scientific studies have focused on how current temperature extremes have been impacted by climate change, or on how the frequency of these current extremes will change in the future,\" said King. \"This study takes a different approach and examines how the severity of future temperature extremes might change in the future.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sophie lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lewis", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "csiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bureau of meteorology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geophysical research letters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australian national university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new south wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T11:18:42.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8510466585fc1799eb17ecd95875401684f2d555", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nJQexE_RSbya3zWjPjg5hD4r7y_L7Zo8y9BGhB0KIn68pXDuyTRLaRXudKOLAhqO1yhAaRwc1OU5a38GlhS8sd_TzF5jH2k9XiZBjg3paNSff5BN_7eHRf7ZGIqWNXkaecFtMTXfYGLYsX6tQG3AakQ--", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Generational clash?

Demystifying Vietnamese millennials' obsession with bubble tea Over the past month, Vietnamese netizens have been eagerly discussing the 'paradox' of low wages and 'wasteful spending'. We're here to dissect it. \nThe new school year had already kicked in but a tea house overlooking Hoan Kiem Lake on a Thursday afternoon was still packed with students. \nIn groups of four or five, the so-called bubble tea generation was either busy discussing trending topics or staring at their phones. \nAs one pact had just left for a new picture perfect spot in Hanoi, four 19-year olds were busy discussing the recent H&M opening in Saigon and why it hadn\u2019t made it to Hanoi. The conversation then quickly turned to the latest beauty trends, including the pros and cons of microneedling, a procedure which involves using fine needles to create hundreds of tiny puncture wounds in the top layer of skin. It it said to minimize the signs of aging and improve the appearance of acne scars. \n\u201cWe meet up everyday at cafes, mostly for bubble tea. It's sweet and tasty,\u201d said second year university student Ha Trang to the approval of her BFFs (best friends forever) from middle school, Phuong Linh, Trung Hieu and Le Hieu. Three of the four are studying business and management at different universities, a major they consider to be \"hot\" and highly employable, but Le Hieu failed to make the grades to continue his education in Vietnam and is hoping for an opportunity to study in the U.S. \nA survey conducted in May of 350 men and women aged from 15 to 39 in Hanoi and Saigon by Vietnamese market research firm Q&Me revealed that 50 percent of them drink the tea at least once a week. Bubble tea fever even increased land lease prices on \u201cteahouse streets\u201d in Saigon by 20-90 percent in August compared to a year ago, according to a report by Gachvang, a city-based property research firm. \nUrban Vietnamese, especially young people in large cities, have recently found themselves at the center of online criticism over their \u201cwasteful spending habits.\" \nIt all started with an article on the Vietnamese edition of VnExpress written by Nguyen Thi Thu Huyen, a recent PhD graduate who found city life too expensive for her level of income. \nShe compared it to her lifestyle when she was still studying in the U.K. Working three hours per week earned her GBP26, which was enough to buy food for an entire week. In contrast, her full time job as a lecturer in Saigon paid only VND5 million, the equivalent of GBP165 or $220 per month, just enough to pay for meals which she made sure never exceeded VND100,000 each. \nThis left Huyen baffled because she had no idea how fancy restaurants and cafes in HCMC were always packed, especially tea houses selling bubble tea to students, many of whom still depend on their parents. \nThe article garnered dozens of follow up pieces and comments, each with its own reasoning. Those who agreed with the author said spending so much on bubble tea was shallow and inconsiderate, while the other side of the debate stressed on freedom of choice. \n\u201cWhat we see here is an interesting generational gap, but not the the gap between parents/grandparents and their children\u201d said Phan Tuong Yen, a psychology lecturer at Hoa Sen University in Saigon. \u201cIt\u2019s much closer than that and it\u2019s clearly a conflict of personal values.\" \nThe majority of comments criticizing the wasteful spending came from young people who had been working for quite a while, aged from 28-40. Those who defended these habits were mostly aged from 18-25 or young people with high incomes. \nThe former, born from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, grew up in a transitionary period when traditional values still largely shaped lifestyles and moral standards. These were tough times economically and tightening your belt became part of life, even a worthy \u201ctrait\u201d. This generation was also the first to access the internet and western cultures and ideals. \nBut it\u2019s those born from the mid 1990s onward who have welcomed a strong cultural wave that carried the concepts of freedom, individuality and right to indulge along with an economic boom. \nWhile the average Vietnamese worker earned only $2,200 last year, according to the World Bank, around 450,000 people now make more than $100,000 per year, three times the current number of tea houses. \nThe so-called \"middle and affluent class\" earning $714 a month or more in Vietnam will double to 33 million people, about a third of the population, between 2014 and 2020, according to Boston Consulting Group. \nThe bubble tea generation, globally referred to as millennials, \u201cfeel they are part of this booming wealth, more so than in the earlier days of austerity,\u201d said Yen, who\u2019s been working with Vietnam\u2019s urban youth for six years. \u201cTherefore, the notion of freedom between these two generations somewhat differs, and so does the concept of cautious spending.\u201d Promotional photo for \"Buoc nhay xi tin\" (Cool dance moves), a popular TV show in 2009. Photo by Galaxy Studio A decade ago, hip hop, Converse shoes and smartphones were considered cool. Today, it\u2019s the experience you get from fancy services. Phan Tuong Yen, psychology lecturer at Hoa Sen University, HCMC. Checking in on Instagram is \"customary\" for millennials when they go for bubble tea. Photo by linhchimm on Instagram \nWhile Huyen, the lecturer, argues that $2 for a cup of bubble tea is twice the cost of a typical office lunch, the millennials see it differently. \n\u201cOur time together is more valuable than a cup of bubble tea,\u201d said student Trang. \u201cBubble tea shouldn\u2019t be a reason for us not to meet. Just a short walk together is already tiring and we have to drink something. I can\u2019t think of anywhere else we could go.\u201d \nHer group said they've already tried everything in Hanoi, a city notorious for lacking public space. In March, the Administration of Technical Infrastructure under the Ministry of Construction warned that Vietnam\u2019s biggest cities have only two to three square meters of green area per person. That is less than a third of what the World Health Organization has recommended for a healthy urban life. \nTrung Hieu, the quiet one in the group, added his own two cents on the economics of bubble tea. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think bubble tea is expensive. I only need to work for two hours to pay for it.\u201d \nThree members of the gang work part-time in cafes, fast food chains or cinemas in the evenings, which pays them on average VND15,000 per hour. In a day, the young Hanoians who still largely depend on their parents but don't want to ask for extra pocket money can make from VND100,000 to VND250,000. \n\u201cHe [Le Hieu] is the exception,\u201d they laughed, pointing at the \"joker\" of the group and the only one without a job. \u201cHe\u2019s rich.\u201d \nIt\u2019s now quite common for students, especially those in their third or fourth years at university, to work part time or even run small online businesses. \n\u201cThe money they earn during their studies helps prove themselves and opens opportunities for them to live freely and \u2018enjoy life\u2019 as they wish, going beyond the enclaves of family or other financial barriers,\u201d said Yen, the psychologist. \nAnd so the bubble tea group shrugged off the notion that their long chit-chats reflect they\u2019re lazy and waste money. \n\u201cWe put a lot of effort into work so we deserve time to rest and enjoy the fruits of our labor. I can go out, but when I\u2019m home, I still have to do chores like cooking and washing the dishes,\u201d said Linh. \u201cWhatever I earn, I spend so we can all have a good time. I\u2019ll start saving once I start work,\u201d said Linh, referring to a full-time job after graduating. \nWith \u201ca lot of free time at university\u201d, as Linh put it, they can divide their time among things that matter to them. Studying for a better future, going to the gym to stay healthy, family, shopping, holidays and of course, meeting up with friends. \nWhen their pockets are half empty, they go for cheaper alternatives like iced tea. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not just today\u2019s youth but people aged from 13-23 in any generation want to prove themselves,\u201d said Yen, referring to psychological research that shows in this period each individual tries to define him or herself through talent, character or social status. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s important is whether society accepts this and gives them a sense of direction instead of criticizing them,\u201d said Yen. \u201cThe question is whether they take responsibility for how they spend, not what they buy.\u201d \nThe bubble tea group tries not to take the online criticism personally, saying every story has two sides to it. \n\u201cThey wrote these articles from a point of view of an older person. Our parents don\u2019t like bubble tea; they like tea and coffee,\u201d said Trang. \u201cYou can\u2019t compare two generations. [\u2026] Living standards are increasing, we just want to perfect ourselves.\u201d \nOr as Le Hieu said: \u201cToday's parents do as their children say\u201d - a way of twisting a saying to describe the previous generations - \u201cChildren do as their parents say\u201d (Cha m\u1eb9 \u0111\u1eb7t \u0111\u00e2u con ng\u1ed3i \u0111\u1ea5y). \nThe group quickly jumped to dismiss it as a joke, saying young people today have simply more freedom to do what they want, and that parents are more ready to trust their decisions.

Photo by Reuters/Kham While many are heading to the country's top tourist destinations, others are on the hunt for property deals. An increasing number of Chinese tourists are setting their sights on overseas travel, and regional destinations such as Vietnam are proving popular destinations. The country is forecast to be the fourth most popular destination among Chinese tourists during their National Day break from October 1-8 this year, according to a report conducted by Ctrip, a Shanghai-based travel agency. Topping the list were Thailand, Singapore and Japan, while Hong Kong and South Korea have fallen out of Chinese favor this year. By climbing three places in this year's rankings, Vietnam has even surpassed the U.S. in terms of popularity, the report revealed. However, Chinese visitors are not just looking for a bit of R&R, according to the report. They are also interested in investment opportunities, particularly in the real estate sector. The revised Vietnamese Law on Residential Housing that allows foreign ownership has fueled Chinese interest in Vietnamese properties over the past year. During the first five months of 2017, Chinese enquiries into Vietnamese properties surged by 442 percent against the same period last year, according to Juwai.com , China's largest overseas property platform . Around three million Chinese visitors touched down in Vietnam during the first nine months of 2017, an on-year increase of 47.7 percent. Juwai.com predicted that by the end of this year, the total number of Chinese arrivals in Vietnam could reach 4 million, a massive leap compared to 2.69 million visitors last year. Mainland China accounted for 30 percent of all tourists to Vietnam in 2016. Such large numbers of Chinese arrivals and their growing interest in Vietnam's property market are expected to influence the country\u2019s economic growth. This surge in Chinese arrivals is partly due to simplified visa procedures that were rolled out at the beginning of this year. They include e-visas for short-term Chinese visitors and a three-day visa-free entry for Chinese visitors entering the northern province of Quang Ninh by car or in groups. But the trend has also created legal problems. The Vietnamese tour guide community in Da Nang has lodged a petition to the central city\u2019s leaders calling for action to be taken against Chinese nationals who have been offering illegal tours around town. Vietnamese law bans foreigners from working as tour guides. Some of the unlicensed Chinese tour guides have been distorting Vietnam\u2019s history and culture. According to the petition, one reportedly said that Vietnam still relies on and pays tribute to China; and another claimed that Da Nang\u2019s My Khe Beach belongs to China.

Gulabi Kumawat was an elderly widow living in a modest home in India's Rajasthan state, until the day she was branded a witch by fellow villagers and her life went catastrophically wrong. Beaten. Buried. She was set alight and left for dead. Somehow Kumawat escaped the pit and lived to tell the tale, first fleeing her Borda village for the safety of a relative's home and then onto Bhilwara city, where she now lives. Fourteen years later and she remains landless. Her plot - little more than an acre (4,046 sq mt) - and her home of almost 50 years are both gone. \"They tried to grab my land and sell it without my consent. When I confronted them, they called me a \"dayan\" (witch), blamed me for many bad things in the village and nearly killed me,\" said Kumawat, 95, her voice rising barely above a whisper. \"They have known me all their life. How did I suddenly become a dayan?\" she said, her gaunt face etched with sadness. Blame the women Kumawat's story is not unusual in Rajasthan, a state better known for stately forts and grand palaces than witch hunting. Scores of women have been brutally attacked after being branded a witch over the last few decades; several have died. The Mewar region, a former princely state that includes Bhilwara and the popular lake city of Udaipur, is particularly notorious, accounting for most cases in Rajasthan. Activists say women have been beaten, knifed, sexually assaulted, stripped naked and paraded, thrown into wells, buried alive, set alight or disfigured with acid. Others are killed. In most cases, the victims were poor, lower-caste, single women who either had no sons or lived alone. Most had land or property coveted by a relative or higher-caste person. The practice of blaming \"witches\" for everything from inadequate monsoon rains and failed businesses to infertility, illness or a sudden death, is widely prevalent across several Indian states, and dates back centuries. In such cases, villagers consult with a shaman or godman, who often blames a witch for some misfortune. Family members are also complicit, and often use this as a way to settle scores, often over land, or to throw a female relative out of the house. \"The feudal system, a rigid caste hierarchy and patriarchy encourage the practice, with illiteracy and superstition also to blame,\" said activist Tara Ahluwalia, who has recorded 88 cases of witch hunting in Bhilwara since 1982. \"We file reports, but no action is taken,\" said Ahluwalia, who keeps meticulous records of each case in a folder with photographs, hospital statements and related police reports. Living corpse The practice of witch hunting is not unique to India. Instances have been recorded elsewhere in Asia and in Africa. Thousands of elderly Tanzanian women have been strangled, knifed to death and burned alive over the last two decades after being denounced as witches, usually for their land. In India, nearly 2,500 murders related to witchcraft have been recorded since 2000, according to official data. Victims are often expelled from their homes and villages. Those who stay are isolated and live in constant fear. Despite a 2015 state law banning the practice, there have been no convictions in Rajasthan, such is the reluctance of local officials and police to check the custom, activists say. \"We fought for a law for 25 years, but the law is not being implemented. What is the point of the law if it cannot protect these women?\" Ahluwalia told the Thomson Reuters Foundation . \"The case is forgotten, and only the victim continues to suffer. Once you are branded a witch, the stigma is for life, and it slowly kills her; she is like a living corpse,\" she said. Rehabilitation At least half a dozen Indian states have introduced special laws against witchcraft and witch hunting in recent years. But many cases are not reported for fear of reprisal. Cases that are filed are often dismissed, or are not registered as related to witchcraft, activists say. They are often difficult to investigate and prosecute as they are sometimes in remote areas and people are not willing to give evidence, a senior police official in Bhilwara said. \"Any case that is brought to our notice is fully investigated,\" said police superintendent Pradeep Sharma. \"Several arrests have been made related to witch hunting; they may get bail, but we follow the procedure. Many of the cases are also false,\" he said. The Rajasthan Prevention of Witch Hunting Act went further than similar state laws, with a prison sentence of up to seven years, a collective fine and rehabilitation and resettlement for victims. If a woman is killed, it can lead to life imprisonment. Last month, cases were filed against seven godmen in Bhilwara for abetting the practice of witch hunting. About a dozen women in Bhilwara have received compensation of at least 50,000 rupees ($770) under the law. Recognising trauma and funding rehabilitation are crucial, said Madhu Mehra, of advocacy Partners for Law in Development. \"We cannot depend on our legal system to bring many convictions or a big drop in cases,\" she said. \"More than special laws with lax implementation, what is needed is a robust system of compensation and victim care.\" The Rajasthan government is now training officials and police - but it is too little and far too late for Kumawat. \"My only wish is to die in my home,\" she said. \"But I no longer have a home, and I am too scared to go back to my village.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kumawat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "borda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pradeep sharma", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahluwalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tara ahluwalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulabi kumawat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madhu mehra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "thomson reuters foundation", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bhilwara city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udaipur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bhilwara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajasthan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T13:23:19.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "818aad9609006ea92bc6215e46d1a300e21527e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nKvVZpOTsujYfNHsEPOXTK9Z7xK3jlccV040Z9peAJCjxoV9q_5sajiIV2BqisRpOiFJOyw1Y2iz3cXFB59ABFauwE7W0uPQ5N2jUyQR.GAkq045Vk.b2Rz8FGpv11uFd", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Tensions on Korean peninsula may hit Vietnam\u2019s economy hard: Moody\u2019s", "title_full": "Tensions on Korean peninsula may hit Vietnam\u2019s economy hard: Moody\u2019s", "published": "2017-10-04T13:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/04/LG-1507108872_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6, "comments": 0, "shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "818aad9609006ea92bc6215e46d1a300e21527e3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nKvVZpOTsujYfNHsEPOXTK9Z7xK3jlccV040Z9peAJCjxoV9q_5sajiIV2BqisRpOiFJOyw1Y2iz3cXFB59ABFauwE7W0uPQ5N2jUyQR.GAkq045Vk.b2Rz8FGpv11uFd", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T13:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tensions on Korean peninsula may hit Vietnam\u2019s economy hard: Moody\u2019s", "text": "October 03, 2017 GMT+7 Tensions on Korean peninsula may hit Vietnam\u2019s economy hard: Moody\u2019s By Minh Nga  October 4, 2017 | 05:09 pm GMT+7 Workers at a plant of South Korea's LG Electronics in Vietnam. Photo by VnExpress/SH Vietnam will suffer one way or another through its close business relationship with South Korea. The escalating military conflict on the Korean peninsula between the U.S. and North Korea will harm not only the two insiders but also others in their economic networks, with Vietnam among those that will be hardest hit, credit rating firm Moody's has said. The problem for Vietnam will come from its business relationship with South Korea, which is an obvious victim of this ongoing conflict, Nikkei cited Moody\u2019s as saying in its Wednesday report. \"Vietnam is the most vulnerable to any disruption to the global supply chain caused by a cessation or weakening of production in South Korea,\" Moody's senior credit officer Martin Petch was quoted in the report as saying. South Korea is the biggest foreign investor in Vietnam. According to the Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency, South Korean firms invested more than $50 billion in Vietnam between 1988 and 2016, making up more than 30 percent of total foreign investment in the country with over 6,000 projects. Many South Korean companies, such as appliance and cellphone giants Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, now have their own component supply chains in Vietnam. Other major Korean companies with a presence in Vietnam include Kumho Construction, Posco Group, Hanjin Logistics and Kumho Tire. In its updated report on East Asia and Pacific (EAP)\u2019s economy released on Wednesday, the World Bank said \u201cgrowth prospects for 2017 and 2018 remain positive for developing East Asia and the Pacific.\u201d It said that economies in the region are expected to expand by 6.4 percent this year and slow slightly to 6.2 percent in 2018, primarily reflecting China\u2019s gradual slowdown. Yet the bank pointed out that \u201ccontinued uncertainty about global economic policies and the escalation of geopolitical tensions could jeopardize growth prospects in the region.\u201d It said escalation of disputes related to North Korea\u2019s testing of nuclear and missile technologies could have serious economic consequences. Due to the region\u2019s central role in global shipping and manufacturing supply chains, escalation of these tensions could disrupt global trade flows and economic activity, said the bank. North Korea has launched dozens of missiles this year, several of them flying over Japan, as it accelerates a weapons program aimed at enabling it to target the U.S. with a nuclear-tipped missile, according to Reuters . The U.S. and South Korea are technically still at war with North Korea because the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with a truce and not a peace treaty. The North accuses the U.S., which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, of planning to invade and regularly threatens to destroy it and its Asian allies. U.S. President Donald Trump told the 193-member U.N. General Assembly last month in New York that if threatened, the U.S. would \u201ctotally destroy\u201d the country of 26 million people and mocked its leader, Kim Jong Un, by calling him \u201crocket man,\u201d Reuters reported.

Photo by Reuters Mu Sochua, an outspoken politician of Cambodia's opposition party, has also fled the country, for fearing of safety. Nearly half of Cambodia's opposition parliamentarians have fled abroad in the past month to escape a government crackdown that has battered their party with legal cases, an MP said on Wednesday. The exodus further imperils the prospects of a party that poses the only viable challenge to premier Hun Sen in next year's national poll. The strongman has smothered dissent in the lead-up to the election and is accused of picking off his critics through a series of dubious court cases. The crackdown was ramped up last month when opposition leader Kem Sokha was thrown into a remote jail on treason charges, a dramatic arrest that sent fear rippling through the embattled opposition movement. Since then, more than 20 opposition politicians have fled the country, MP Mao Monyvann said of his Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which has 55 members of parliament. \"Now there are only a few more than 10 (MPs) still in the country,\" he told AFP , with others having fled before Kem Sokha's arrest. Many have left for the US or European countries where they have family or dual citizenship. Mu Sochua, an outspoken deputy of Kem Sokha, was the latest to bolt on Tuesday, a day after Hun Sen said there would be no let-up in his crackdown. \"After (receiving a) warning, she decided to leave the country,\" Mao Monyvann said, adding that a government official had informed Mu Sochua about her possible arrest. Human Rights Watch's Phil Robertson said the departure of MPs raises the spectre of the \"death of Cambodian democracy\" at the hands of Hun Sen. \"Hun Sen wants to run in a 2018 election in which he will not face any meaningful opposition,\" said HRW's Deputy Asia Director. \"It looks like he plans to use intimidation and fear to triumph before the votes are even cast.\" In a message sent through his lawyers, Kem Sokha on Monday denied the treason charge as \"total slander\", a view echoed by the US and other democratic countries which have called for his immediate release. Hun Sen has accused Washington of involvement in Kem Sokha's \"secret plan\" with foreign entities to overthrow the government -- an allegation rejected as \"absurd\" by the US Ambassador, who warned that elections would not be free or fair in the current climate. Hun Sen has held power for 32 years in the impoverished democracy, using a mix of political guile and hard power to undermine his rivals and secure the loyalty of the bureaucracy, judicial system and security forces. But his popularity slipped in a 2013 election and he has since moved to silence critics in politics, the media and NGOs. Last week the UN's human rights envoy to Cambodia warned the country was \"moving inexorably towards a precipice\".

Women in developed countries are now more educated than men, yet they still earn less, are poorly represented in politics, and less likely to join the top ranks in business or become an entrepreneur, a global think-tank said on Wednesday. From Canada, Japan, Norway to Australia, young women on average earn almost 15 percent less than men, even though they are more educated, said the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The gender pay gap has remained stubbornly consistent over the past decade despite better policies for working parents, transparency in workplace pay gaps, and quota systems to boost the number of women on boards and senior roles, OECD said. \"Every country faces its own obstacles to reaching gender equality, and to make a real difference we must change public policies in tandem with stereotypes, attitudes and behaviors,\" Angel Gurr\u00eda, Secretary-General of the OECD said in a statement. Having to stall careers after childbirth due to inflexible work policies or underlying gender stereotypes, as well as workplace discrimination against women are key factors that prevent women from earning the same as men, the report said. Apart from work-related issues, unequal parental duties, poor political representation, and engrained social stereotypes were also barriers to achieving gender equality, it said. But most OECD countries surveyed in the report said preventing violence against women was their top priority. \"These inequalities should have long been resolved. There is no reason for women to trail behind men in social, economic, and political outcomes,\" Gurr\u00eda said \"Gender equality is essential for ensuring that men and women can contribute fully at home, at work, and in public life, for the betterment of societies and economies at large,\" he added. If the gender pay gap reduced by a quarter by 2025, could add an extra percentage point to projected economic growth across OECD countries between 2013 and 2025, it said. The think-tank added that if there was an equal number of female and male entrepreneurs, global GDP could rise by 2 percent, equivalent to about $1.5 trillion. \"In the face of sluggish growth, ageing societies and increasing educational attainment of young women, the economic case for gender equality is clear,\" said Gurr\u00eda. \"We must advance in making gender equality a reality.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "angel gurr\u00eda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/lin taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurr\u00eda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "organization for economic co-operation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T13:24:35.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc3e8a0b5bc3c15f24cd74132900e4038c8eaa64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nCubvwPmUV3rZZYzaN6wUuAn0TatUDMR3F6PMLItBvIzJwTvDXeDjg.uKQecxFJPHOEZKJ712EajHiEoGEvL8BN4lBLTTOEs504qBkczO90Av2q0Q9_jy_dgy1gwP8DpV", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Dozens of homes swept away following dam breach in southern Vietnam", "title_full": "Dozens of homes swept away following dam breach in southern Vietnam", "published": "2017-10-04T12:23:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ivcdn.vnecdn.net/english/images/web/2017/10/04/dozens-of-homes-swept-away-following-dam-breach-in-southern--1507110168_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc3e8a0b5bc3c15f24cd74132900e4038c8eaa64", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nCubvwPmUV3rZZYzaN6wUuAn0TatUDMR3F6PMLItBvIzJwTvDXeDjg.uKQecxFJPHOEZKJ712EajHiEoGEvL8BN4lBLTTOEs504qBkczO90Av2q0Q9_jy_dgy1gwP8DpV", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T12:23:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dozens of homes swept away following dam breach in southern Vietnam", "text": "Dozens of homes swept away following dam breach in southern Vietnam By Nguyen Khoa  October 4, 2017 | 04:23 pm GMT+7 Authorities were able to evacuate the area in time, but houses and crops have been completely wiped out in Ba Ria - Vung Tau Province.

The slogan reads \"U.S. troops out immediately!\". Photo by Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji 'We don't do politics, we do art.' Seated beneath tall windows and dressed simply in singlets and trousers, North Korean painters are hard at work. The artists staple canvases to frames or copy idyllic landscapes from laptop computers. One wears headphones as he brushes a group of running horses onto his canvas. The nine men have come to the Chinese border town of Dandong from Mansudae Art Studio, North Korea's largest producer of art. There are many outlets like this along the border; they house some of the thousands of North Korean artists who cater to burgeoning demand for their work. \"Chinese have begun collecting art, and North Korean art is much easier and cheaper for them to obtain,\" says Park Young-jeong, a research fellow at the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute, a Seoul-based organisation. In recent years as countries have responded to North Korea's weapons tests with sanctions, Mansudae and other art studios have increasingly played a more controversial role \u2013 helping Pyongyang raise cash abroad. North Korea has long been punished for alleged underhand dealings in minerals, finance and arms; art was seen more as a channel for mutual understanding. That is changing. Mansudae is run by the North Korean state. Its output ranges from statues of global leaders to propaganda posters, embroidery and more. It has built monuments and statues in at least 15 African countries, according to independent United Nations sanctions experts. In a report in February, they said that a part of Mansudae called Mansudae Overseas Projects was a front for the North Korean state to cash in on military deals. As well as monumental statues, they found it built military installations such as a munitions factory and bases in Namibia. The North Korean U.N. mission did not respond to a request for comment and no one from Mansudae could be reached. The U.N. Security Council banned Mansudae's statue business in 2016. On Aug. 5, after Pyongyang conducted more weapons tests, the Security Council blacklisted Mansudae Art Studio, subjecting it to a global asset freeze and travel ban. Diplomats say this will prevent Mansudae from conducting business. \"With this listing, anything Mansudae produces - including paintings, other artwork, monuments, buildings, and other construction - cannot be bought and should be frozen per the asset freeze,\" said a U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. In a further resolution on Sept. 11, the Security Council decided that all joint ventures with North Korean entities or individuals must be shut down within 120 days, or by mid-January. Exactly what the measures mean for existing Mansudae art has yet to become clear. In Beijing's art district, a gallery called the Mansudae Art Gallery says it is the studio's official overseas gallery. Its head insists the sanctions do not apply to it and says they have had no impact on his business. \"Now more than ever we need avenues like art to create understanding between North Korea and the rest of the world,\" said Ji Zhengtai. It is not possible to estimate the total value of Mansudae's dealings, but the Security Council diplomat said the business had earned tens of millions of dollars globally. \"We don't do politics\" People look at paintings created by North Korean artists at the China-North Korea Cultural Centre in Dandong, Liaoning province, China. Photo by Reuters/ Aly Song Mansudaeartsudio.com, a website in Italy which calls itself Mansudae's \"official website abroad,\" says the studio is \"probably the largest art production centre in the world.\" Mansudae's Pyongyang studio covers 120,000 sq m (nearly 30 acres), employs about 4,000 people including around 1,000 artists, and is divided into 13 creative groups, seven manufacturing plants and more than 50 supply departments, the website says. The website is run by Pier Luigi Cecioni, who sells Mansudae works online and at fairs through what he calls an exclusive agreement with Mansudae Art Studio. He declined to say how much he sells, but in August after the sanctions on Mansudae Art Studio were announced, he told Reuters that the revenues go direct to the studio to pay for paints and equipment. Cecioni said he sells works from his personal collection, most of them bought several years ago - before sanctions on Mansudae were announced. His website makes clear that any online purchase is made with his Italian company, not Mansudae. U.N. sanctions are not retroactive. A panel of independent experts is charged with monitoring U.N. sanctions on North Korea. It reports violations and recommendations to the Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee. Its reports are confidential, but the committee traditionally publishes annual reports. Hugh Griffiths, who heads the panel, declined to comment, saying \"the matter is subject to an ongoing investigation.\" Cecioni said, \"the last thing I want is to have trouble with Italian or American authorities. I have strong contacts, especially with the Italian ones, and they help me to respect all the rules.\" An Italian foreign ministry source said it is customary to keep contact with everyone who has ties to countries under sanctions, to ensure they respect Italy's international commitments. In September, Cecioni said that he had no plans to shut down his operation. \"I consider it very important to let people know that ... North Koreans do not make only bombs but also art and are common people,\" he said. He postponed an exhibition of propaganda posters he had planned for September in Treviso, but said this was because Mansudae's representatives told him they thought it unwise to showcase their anti-U.S. tone in the current climate. Word of the sanctions has been slower to reach China. A circular from its Commerce Ministry announcing the start date of the measures which included Mansudae Art Studio does not name Mansudae. Asked why not, the ministry did not respond. The Dandong centre works in partnership with Mansudae, said its manager, Gai Longji. Asked on the day the sanctions took effect if they were affecting business, he did not answer directly. \"We don't do politics,\" he said. \"We do art.\" Liaoning Sanyi, the firm behind the centre, did not respond to a request for comment. White tiger Reuters spoke to at least 30 experts - collectors, art historians, academics and people who have sold North Korean art globally. Many said the market for paintings is niche and amounts to little in terms of revenue compared with the billion-plus dollars North Korea has raised every year selling coal and other minerals abroad. Even so, they say North Korean diplomats in Europe have been enthusiastic to promote art exhibitions with the simple aim of bringing in hard currency. In China, demand has really taken off. Dandong is a popular attraction for tourists who come to peep at North Koreans over the Yalu River border. Busloads of tourists show up every morning. Visitors sample a North Korean speciality of noodles in cold soup, watch North Korean women sing and dance, and buy North Korean paintings. Besides Mansudae, just about every ministry and almost all the local authorities in North Korea have an art studio, said Koen De Ceuster, a lecturer in Korean studies at Leiden University who has been studying North Korean art for over a decade. \"There's studios all across the country,\" he said. Other prominent studio names include Paekho and the Central Arts Studio. Paekho, which means \"white tiger\" in Korean, is the biggest seller of popular paintings in Dandong, traders there said. Collectors who have dealt with Paekho say it is run by North Korea's military - Reuters could not independently establish this. Paekho's varied output includes propaganda posters calling for a nuclear-free world. The Dandong centre that Reuters visited has hosted around 500 North Korean artists since 2014, manager Gai said. They stay for between six months and three years. Many Dandong galleries house North Korean painters. Staff there said they have sold North Korean paintings for as much as $100,000 to buyers around the world. Art experts agree the pieces can very occasionally fetch six-figure sums. Not all the proceeds go to Pyongyang. Mark-ups can reach four or five times the dealer's purchase price, according to one Dandong dealer. Long game Choi Sang Kyun, head of Gallery Pyongyang, arranges North Korean propaganda posters that he collected. Photo by Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji While the Security C ouncil's Aug. 5 sanctions targeted only Mansudae, its September resolution on joint ventures also included restrictions on North Korean labour: This combination could hurt everyone in the art business, Dandong traders say. But there are ways around the measures, they add. For instance, paintings from Mansudae could be sold under the name of an art studio that hasn't been sanctioned. Artists come to China under cultural exchange visas, not as workers. And two businessmen said paintings have long been accepted instead of cash in the barter deals that fuel the region's economy. At the other end of the border from Dandong in the city of Yanji, Chinese antiques dealer Zhao Xiangchen said people usually roll up a couple of paintings and carry them quietly across the border to him. His antiques stall was thick with dust as he camped in a vacant slot next door, selling the paintings online. Since the sanctions were announced, Zhao said, Chinese customs have become more vigilant. \"But I'm playing the long game,\" he said. \"I still think there's huge latent demand for North Korean art in the Chinese market, that's only set to grow.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fanny potkin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luigi cecioni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gai longji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "park young-jeong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "giselda vagnoni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koen de ceuster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paekho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhao xiangchen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zhao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/kim hong-ji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "choi sang kyun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cecioni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hugh griffiths", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ji zhengtai", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leiden university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korea culture and tourism institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n. security council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central arts studio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commerce ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mansudae overseas projects", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mansudae art studio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/ aly song mansudaeartsudio.com", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mansudae art gallery", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.n.", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "liaoning sanyi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yalu river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallery pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china-north korea cultural centre", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treviso", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liaoning province", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paekho", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "namibia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yanji", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mansudae art studio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dandong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T14:58:54.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7dd939042da371d1a303b948c50e7f5bcf664b2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CK.LqeD2HluWTGC1fJvZCTk2Ih1.n.4u525EMkGjoGfIGdsKhmLKn3XTepu7HPsmSThIgMU2P_YKqxd4SGpFrKF.8YwhYiswX8zwlxRGfx3yHljs2GML7n2Qz_ywIkyOuc-", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Saigon residents accuse notorious landfill site of polluting waterways, again", "title_full": "Saigon residents accuse notorious landfill site of polluting waterways, again", "published": "2017-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/04/waste-1507112587-4202-1507112930_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7, "comments": 0, "shares": 7}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7dd939042da371d1a303b948c50e7f5bcf664b2f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CK.LqeD2HluWTGC1fJvZCTk2Ih1.n.4u525EMkGjoGfIGdsKhmLKn3XTepu7HPsmSThIgMU2P_YKqxd4SGpFrKF.8YwhYiswX8zwlxRGfx3yHljs2GML7n2Qz_ywIkyOuc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saigon residents accuse notorious landfill site of polluting waterways, again", "text": "Saigon residents accuse notorious landfill site of polluting waterways, again By Huu Nguyen  October 4, 2017 | 07:00 pm GMT+7 A photo captured by people near Da Phuoc landfill shows foamy water leaked from the site into the environment. The operator claims the foaming, strange-smelling liquid locals have spotted is just a mixture of water and sand. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the notorious Da Phuoc landfill site on the outskirts of Saigon earlier this week after foaming waste water from the site was spotted leaking into local waterways. The disgruntled locals blocked the entrance to the site in Binh Chanh District from Monday night through to the next morning, preventing garbage trucks from entering. They said the strange-smelling water was a threat to their health and their fish farms, and deman ded an explanation from Vietnam Waste Solutions (VWS), the site's operator. People sit at the gate of the landfill site in Binh Chanh District on Monday night. Officials from the city\u2019s environment department have taken samples for testing, and the protesters were later dispersed by district police. Kevin Moore, the American managing director of VWS, denied the foaming water was sewage in a statement sent to the city\u2019s government, saying instead that it was a mixture of sand and water that had been washed away by heavy rain while it was being pumped into the site for construction purposes. He said that test results will be available in a week. The company also criticized locals for spreading rumors of pollution and staging a protest that scared hundreds of its workers. The $107-million Da Phuoc site, covering 138 hectares (341 acres), is about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) south of the city center and was the culprit behind a stench that plagued the city\u2019s southern suburbs for months last year.

TT News Agency/Claudio Bresciani via Reuters Cryo-electron microscopy has enabled scientists to fill in previously blank spaces in research, generating images of everything from proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, to the surface of the Zika virus. Scientists Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson won the 2017 Nobel Prize for Chemistry on Wednesday for developing cryo-electron microscopy which simplifies and improves the imaging of biomolecules. Cryo-electron microscopy has enabled scientists to fill in previously blank spaces in research, generating images of everything from proteins that cause antibiotic resistance, to the surface of the Zika virus. \"This method has moved biochemistry into a new era,\" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards Nobel prizes, said in a statement. The awarding brings a 9 million Swedish crown ($1.1 million) prize. \"Researchers can now freeze biomolecules mid-movement and visualise processes they have never previously seen, which is decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals.\" Scottish-born scientist Henderson used an electron microscope to generate a three-dimensional image of a protein at an atomic resolution, showing the potential of the technology. His breakthrough was further developed by German-born scientist Frank while Dubochet of Switzerland used rapidly frozen water to preserve the natural shape of the biomolecules. Chemistry is the third of this year's Nobel Prizes after the winners of the medicine and physics prizes were announced earlier this week. The prizes are named after Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, and have been awarded since 1901 for achievements in science, literature and peace, in accordance with his will. While the chemistry award has sometimes been overshadowed by the towering reputations of physics winners such as Albert Einstein, laureates include ground-breaking scientists such as radioactivity pioneers Ernest Rutherford and Marie Curie, though she also won the physics prize. The award passed over one of the highest-profile fields of research, the so-called CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology that earlier this year allowed U.S. scientists to alter genes in a human embryo to correct a disease-causing mutation.

Photo by Thomson Reuters Foundation/Amantha Perera 'There is no work. Everyone, big or small, has lost out to the drought.' At 52 years old, with two grown children, Newton Gunathileka thought he should be working less by this point. Instead he has never worked so hard \u2013 and earned so little. Gunathileka, from the Sri Lankan village of Periyakulam, in the North Western Puttalam District, is among hundreds of thousands of rural Sri Lankans who have borne the brunt of the worst drought in four decades. He has not seen any substantial rains on his farm in at least a year and has lost two harvests, resulting in a loss of over 200,000 Sri Lankan rupees ($1,325) \u2013 and growing debts. He has now abandoned his two acres of rice paddy land and spends his time looking \u2013 mainly unsuccessfully - for other work in 40 degree Celsius heat. \u201cThere is no work. Everyone, big or small, has lost out to the drought,\u201d he said. According to data released in September by the United Nations, there are hundreds of thousands of households like Gunathileka\u2019s facing serious food security issues in Sri Lanka. With rice production for 2017 expected to be the lowest in a decade, \u201cover 300,000 households (around 1.2 million people) are estimated to be food insecure, with many households limiting their food intake and in some cases eating just one meal a day,\u201d the United Nations update said. The worst affected areas are the North Western, North Central, Northern and South Eastern Provinces that rely heavily on agriculture. The U.N. Office in Colombo said that affected households were in some cases limiting their food intake, which was hampering people\u2019s day-to-day lives. Eating their seed Gunathileka, who hails from the North Western Province, said his family was now eating some of the rice that he had put away to use as seed for the next growing season. \u201cFor the next month or two we are okay with rice, but we have been limiting eating meat, eggs and vegetables we buy from outside. The other big problem I have is my children\u2019s higher education. If we can\u2019t get a harvest at least by the end of the year both of them will have to work,\u201d he said. His daughter is taking a course in secretarial work while the son is getting ready to sit university entrance exams. The family now survives on about Rs 800 ($5) or less a day, and both Gunathileka and his wife earn cash doing whatever work they can find. The U.N report also said that household debt was rising due to the drought. A World Food Program survey released in August said that debts of surveyed families had risen by 50 percent in the last year. \u201cHouseholds reported that the amount of money owed in formal loans has not increased, indicating that families are turning to informal lenders for credit,\u201d the WFP survey said. Gunathileka said that he was thinking of using the deeds to his paddy rice land as collateral and seeking a small loan from local money lenders. \u201cThe banks will not lend because I can\u2019t show any income. (But) if I don\u2019t get to pay back the money lenders, I lose my land,\u201d he said. Rain and aid Government officials said they anticipated the island had weathered the worst of the drought, and rains expected in late October would bring more relief. Recent rains have dropped the overall number of people affected by drought from 2.2 million a month ago to 1.7 million now, said G.L. Senadeera, director general of the government Disaster Management Centre. He said the government planned to distribute relief food packs worth Rs 5000 ($34) to about 200,000 drought-hit families and provide compensation up to Rs 8500 ($56) per acre for harvest losses this year. The government\u2019s drought relief efforts, which began in August and were accelerated in September, officials say, are expected to cost about Rs 2.5 billion (about $16 million), according to the Treasury department. The World Food Program said in its August report that of 81,000 families surveyed in the 10 worst-hit districts, only 22 percent had access to government relief by early August. For now, Gunathileka and his wife look up to the sky each time they step out looking for work. \u201cAll we see are clear skies. All we want to see are dark clouds over the horizon,\u201d he said.

The first 12 train cars were slowly lifted onto the rails of Hanoi\u2019s first elevated railway line running from Cat Linh to Ha Dong on Wednesday morning. The project had been scheduled for a test run in September but that was canceled due to delayed disbursement of $250 million in official development assistance from China. Each train will have four cars measuring 19 meters in length, 2.8 meters in width and 3.8 meters in height (62-9-12.5 feet). The 133-ton trains will be able to carry more than 1,000 passengers each. The entire line will run 13 kilometers (8 miles) as part of a planned metro system that will cover 318 kilometers. A worker hooks up electricity connections on a car. Two cars coupled together. Cables that link the cars together. The cars are also connected by 108 electrical wires. A technician checks a car. Air suspension for a smooth ride. Many train cars have been left under canvas due to multiple delays. The state-owned China Railway Sixth Group Co. started the project in October 2011 and it was originally scheduled for completion in 2013. Delays have caused the original cost estimate of $552.86 million to balloon to more than $868 million, including $670 million in loans from China.

Other suspects could have poisoned the half-brother of North Korea's leader besides the two women on trial for his audacious assassination in Malaysia, an expert witness said Wednesday. Pathologist Mohamad Shah Mahmood said it was possible four other suspects who are mentioned in the charge sheet but are still at large could have administered a nerve agent before Kim Jong-Nam was attacked by the women. Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong are on trial accused of smearing poison VX on Kim's face at Kuala Lumpur international airport on February 13, in a Cold War-style hit that stunned the world. The women, who were arrested a few days after the killing and face death by hanging if convicted, have pleaded not guilty to murdering the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un as he waited to board a flight to Macau. The defendants, both in their 20s, say they were duped into believing they were taking part in a prank for a reality TV show and their lawyers blame North Korean agents. The murder sparked a fierce row between Malaysia and North Korea, which is suspected of ordering the hit. Pyongyang denies the allegation. The charge sheet blames Kim's death on the women along with four other people still at large, who are not named. Four North Korean suspects fled Malaysia on the day of the murder. On the third day of proceedings Wednesday, Naran Singh, a lawyer for Huong, asked Mohamad Shah during cross-examination the possible ways for VX to enter a person's body. \"The possible route of entry is via skin contact, ingestion, inhalation, injection and via the eye,\" he told Shah Alam High Court, outside the capital Kuala Lumpur. The lawyer asked Mohamad Shah if it was possible that the four others mentioned in the charge could have poisoned Kim before the victim arrived at the airport. \"There is a possibility,\" the pathologist, who carried out the post-mortem on Kim, responded. CCTV footage of the attack shows the women coming up behind Kim and swiping his face with a substance before running away, and a post-mortem report showed his death was caused by VX. But experts had been confounded by how the women allegedly carried out the hit using a chemical so deadly it is a listed as a weapon of mass destruction without causing any harm to themselves. Earlier, defence lawyers put on face masks and gloves as they examined bags of Kim's blood samples and swabs taken from his face. A bag containing some of Kim's personal effects, including underwear, was opened, sending an unpleasant smell wafting across the room. A post-mortem report submitted to the trial Tuesday revealed new personal details about Kim, such as that he had several tattoos, including one of a dragon and another of a dragon's head breathing fire.

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons' director general Ahmet Uzumcu urged countries to pressurize Pyongyang to get rid of them. Estimates say there are between 3,000 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons in North Korea's arsenal, Uzumcu told AFP in an interview. Pyongyang publicly claims that it has no chemical arms. But according to the Washington-based Nuclear Threat Initiative, a non-profit organization, the isolated country possesses deadly nerve agents including sarin and VX. \"The international community should be concerned about North Korea because of its unpredictability,\" Uzumcu said. They should apply \"more pressure\" to get Pyongyang to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty, which aims to ban the world's chemical stockpiles, Uzumcu added. The Hague-based OPCW's director said several letters written by himself and the U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have gone unanswered by the North Korean regime. The last request was sent to Pyonyang in March. Uzumcu said that \"demarches as well as requests for meetings with North Korean officials\" were ignored. \"They did not want to meet us and discuss those matters,\" Uzumcu said.

A senior police officer in Dak Lak Province is facing disciplinary measures after footage showing him kicking and throwing street vendors\u2019 trays went viral online. Le Tan Thinh, chief of police in Quang Dien Commune, was featured in various media reports with a video of him attempting to clear a sidewalk market on Tuesday. Thinh appears angry in the video and can be seen screaming and kicking and throwing vendors\u2019 trays from the sidewalk. At one point he also picks up and smashes a chair, with the vendors looking on helplessly. Locals said that vendors have been using the sidewalk for years, mostly because they do not have an official space in the market just steps away. One vendor whose basin was kicked flying in the video said she was just trying to sell some fish that her husband had caught. She said she was not a regular vendor and did not have a space in the market. \u201cI know what I did was wrong but the officer was so rude and his actions were completely unethical,\u201d the 66-year-old woman said, as cited in a local media report. Through the media, Thinh has asked the vendors for their forgiveness for his \u201cimpulsive\u201d actions. He said his unit had cleared the market many times, but vendors kept coming back and some were rude to him . Dak Lak police department said on Wednesday it is looking into the matter and will propose the appropriate punishment. A senior officer said local police receive public order training every year. The officer said Thinh\u2019s action was \u201coffensive\u201d and it would affect the local police force\u2019s image. The Global Corruption Barometer 2013 ranked the police force as the most corrupt institution in Vietnam.

Vietnam has sent a coast guard vessel to transport the fishermen home. Maritime and fisheries issues were among the topics discussed during Party leader Nguyen Phu Trong's visit to Indonesia in August. The two countries have agreed to strengthen cooperation in these areas, especially to deal with illegal fishing. Hundreds of Vietnamese fishermen have been arrested for illegal fishing in recent years in the waters of nearby countries, including Brunei, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.

Photo by VnExpress/An Phuoc Tourism overkill is threatening to destroy the environment in Nha Trang. Authorities in the central province of Khanh Hoa have fined a resort complex VND105 million ($$4,620) for filling in part of Nha Trang Bay, whose title as one of the world\u2019s most beautiful has been undermined by rapid tourism development. The provincial government said the Champarama Travel JSC had filled in more than 1.7 hectares (4.2 acres) of the bay for the construction of a high-end resort and conference complex. The $52.8 million project had been allocated 44 hectares of land by the bay. Khanh Hoa has ordered the company to restore the area in question to its former state. But members of the public have dismissed the mission as impossible, saying that the damage is irreversible. They have also asked why it has taken authorities so long to take action, according to comments in local media reports. Nha Trang Bay entered the exclusive club of the Most Beautiful Bays of the World in 2003. The club also includes the world-renowned Ha Long Bay and Lang Co Bay in the central resort town of Hue. But a lot has changed since then. In 2010, National Geographic rated it among the worst beach destinations in the world, criticizing it for \u201coverdevelopment without a watchful eye\u201d. The Institute of Oceanography based in Nha Trang warned a couple of years ago that the ecology of the 500-square-kilometer Nha Trang Bay has deteriorated rapidly due to tourism construction projects, leaving many native species teetering on the verge of extinction. In January 2016, a resort project was also fined VND200 million ($8,920) for dumping construction materials to fill in 2.3 hectares of the bay. Khanh Hoa received nearly one million foreign tourists in the first half of this year, up 80 percent from a year ago. Most of the visitors were from China and Russia, according to Khanh Hoa Newspaper .

Australian wildlife staff needed a crane to rescue a lovelorn female koala who escaped from her enclosure at the start of her first mating season, impatient to find a partner. Irene the koala was discovered missing from her holding yard at the Australian Reptile Park outside Sydney early Thursday, park officials said. The two-year-old was eventually found stuck in a nearby tree after a \"Houdini-style\" escape through an opening in her pen, they said. General manager Tim Faulkner said Irene had only recently reached sexual maturity and this week marked the start of the annual koala mating season. \"It's not the first time we've had a young female koala keen on finding a mate, and it's no coincidence she made her way out of her yard to find a mate's yard,\" he said.

The banner reads \"The people of Dong Tam commune absolutely trust the policy and path of the Party and the State\". Photo by Reuters The study examined conflicts in many Southeast Asian countries, including Vietnam, and found that land grabbing is the major cause of conflict. More than half of land rights conflicts in the developing world have not been resolved, pitting companies, governments and businesses against indigenous communities, researchers said on Tuesday. The most common cause of these often violent and sometimes deadly disputes is the displacement of indigenous and local people from land they have lived on for generations but for which they do not hold legal title. The research by TMP Systems and the Rights and Resources Initiative found that 61 percent of 288 land conflicts since 2001 have not been resolved, but in Southeast Asia that number rose to 88 percent. More than 65 percent of such conflicts in Southeast Asia delayed business operations and 71 percent resulted in lawsuits, while almost three quarters have lasted more than six years, the researchers found. \"Many investors in land in Southeast Asia have become embroiled in intractable disputes because they did not recognise the legitimacy and importance of customary tenure rights,\" said research lead author Ben Bowie, a partner at TMP Systems, a consultancy based in Britain. Research has shown conflicts over land can increase a company's operating costs by as much as 29 times and can even result in businesses abandoning operations. The study examined 51 conflicts that started after 2001 as companies sought to develop indigenous and communal land for agriculture, logging, tourism and energy projects in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Myanmar. Over three quarters of such conflicts in Southeast Asia started before development operations began, which typically reveals a lack of faith by the affected people that companies and governments will respect their rights, the study said. This compares to 56 percent in Africa. Andy White, co-ordinator of the Rights and Resources Initiative, a global network working to advance land rights, said companies have an important role to play in avoiding conflict over land. \"Private and investors that recognise the risk of insecure land rights and work with indigenous people and communities can set an example for other businesses,\" he told reporters. White said the International Land and Forest Tenure Facility, launched at a conference in Stockholm on Tuesday, will help local people to take advantage of existing laws and policies to establish their rights over land. The Tenure Facility, funded by the governments of Sweden and Norway and the Ford Foundation, is the first initiative to put indigenous people and local communities at the helm of such efforts, White said. Clear legal ownership and demarcation of indigenous land will in turn help companies to respect land rights, he added.

File photo Strong growth in the third quarter may have put the country's annual target back within reach. HSBC has revised up its growth forecast for Vietnam this year to 6.6 percent following record growth in the third quarter, while the World Bank estimated that growth will accelerate slightly from last year to 6.3 percent. The forecasts came days after data from the General Statistics Office showed the Vietnamese economy expanded 7.46 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, its strongest third quarter growth since 2010. HSBC said in a recent statement that the July-September growth was \u201csurprising\u201d. The bank had lowered its growth forecast for Vietnam from 6.4 to 6 percent in July after the economy hit a three-year low of 5.2 percent growth in the first quarter. This robust growth has been fueled largely by exports of Samsung cellphones and other electronic products, analysts said. It has driven overall growth for the first nine months to 6.41 percent, the highest since 2015 but still below this year\u2019s target of 6.7 percent, one that both officials and industry insiders have lamented as being too ambitious. Vietnam recorded its highest GDP growth in five years at 6.7 percent in 2015, but growth dipped to 6.21 percent last year, the first slowdown in four years, amid low coal and oil prices as well as damage from a major drought and mass fish deaths caused by Taiwanese steel plant Formosa along the central coast. The World Bank said Vietnam\u2019s real GDP growth is projected to accelerate slightly to 6.3 percent this year, boosted by buoyant domestic demand, rebounding agricultural production and strong export-oriented manufacturing. Over the medium term, growth is going to stabilize at around 6.4 percent in 2018-2019, the bank said in an October report, which also raised growth forecasts for other Asian economies including China, Malaysia and Thailand. The World Bank in January said that Vietnam\u2019s economy would expand at an average of 6.3 percent over the next three years buoyed by strong foreign direct investment and manufacturing exports.

Photo by Reuters/Ahim Rani Brunei sultan is now the world's second-longest reigning monarch. Oil-rich Brunei\u2019s absolute ruler marked 50 years in power on Thursday, with elaborate celebrations that included a glittering procession through the capital on a gilded chariot. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, 71, is now the world\u2019s second-longest reigning monarch, after ascending the throne in the tiny northeast Borneo nation in 1967. Dressed in gold brocade, the sultan entered the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan, with his wife, Queen Saleha, and their children on a carriage pulled by 50 members of the royal household clad in traditional black and gold woven cloth. A military band led the five-km (three-mile) procession, which was greeted by more than 80,000 well-wishers, some of whom had arrived as early as 5 a.m. to secure a good spot. The procession was part of a month-long celebration of the golden jubilee, which includes the opening of Brunei's first cable-stayed bridge, the unveiling of a major new urban park and a state banquet at the gold-domed palace on Friday, attended by regional leaders as well as British and Middle Eastern royalty. \"The responsibility of the king is to his people and the people have a responsibility to the king,\" the sultan told an audience at the palace. \"Together, the king and the people hold the trust of the nation.\" Brunei, a former British protectorate of about 400,000 people, relies heavily on oil and gas exports for its wealth. People wait to see Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah during a street procession to mark his golden jubilee of his accession to the throne in Bandar Seri Begawan October 5, 2017. Photo by Reuters/Ahim Rani The country does not hold elections but any discontent is assuaged with generous government polices, including zero taxes, subsidised housing and free healthcare and education. Despite tight social controls, the sultan is hugely popular. His rule has seen Brunei gain full independence from Britain and living standards soar to among the highest in Asia. \"When we go to Friday prayers at the mosque, he is there. We can go up to him and shake his hand or pass him letters if we have complaints,\u201d said Aizzat Bakar, 32, a businessman working in the capital. But the sultan also presided over the adoption of tough Islamic law in 2014, which raised concerns among tens of thousands of non-Muslims, including Western expatriate workers. The sale of alcohol is banned in Brunei and evangelism by other religions is strictly forbidden. Details of the lavish lifestyle of the sultan\u2019s brother, Prince Jefri, including owning hundreds of luxury cars and a yacht, became public during a family feud, grabbing global headlines and shocking many in the country. The sultan, once the world's richest man, has a firm grip on power, but Brunei has also become a microcosm of the trouble faced by oil-dependent states. As global energy prices tumbled over the past three years, government revenue nosedived by 70 per cent. Brunei is the only Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) country to have seen a recession for three straight years. The price collapse prompted Brunei to embrace Chinese investment, with Beijing pumping billions into key infrastructure projects. In return, the sultanate has remained largely silent on Beijing\u2019s vast territorial stake in the South China Sea, which overlaps Brunei\u2019s own claims in the disputed waters.

Photo by Reuters/Mike Segar/File Photo 'The themes Ishiguro is most associated with are already present here: memory, time, and self-delusion,' the Academy said. British author Kazuo Ishiguro, best known for his novel \"The Remains of the Day\", won the Nobel Literature Prize on Thursday, the Swedish Academy said. The 62-year-old, \"in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world,\" the Academy wrote in its citation. Born in Nagasaki, he moved to Britain with his family when he was five years old, only returning to visit Japan as an adult. Both his first novel \"A Pale View of Hills\" from 1982 and the subsequent one, \"An Artist of the Floating World\" from 1986, take place in Nagasaki a few years after World War II. \"The themes Ishiguro is most associated with are already present here: memory, time, and self-delusion,\" the Academy said. \"This is particularly notable in his most renowned novel, 'The Remains of the Day',\" which was turned into a film with Anthony Hopkins acting as the duty-obsessed butler Stevens. \"Ishiguro's writings are marked by a carefully restrained mode of expression, independent of whatever events are taking place,\" it said. Apart from his eight books, Ishiguro has also written scripts for film and television.

Japan's public broadcaster apologised Friday to the parents of a young reporter who died of heart failure after logging 159 hours of overtime in a month. NHK reporter Miwa Sado, 31, who had been covering political news in Tokyo, was found dead in her bed in July 2013, reportedly clutching her mobile phone. \"The chairman met the parents at their home in the morning and apologised,\" an NHK spokesman told AFP . A government inquest a year after her death ruled that it was linked to excessive overtime. She had taken two days off in the month before she died. NHK eventually made the case public four years later, bowing to pressure from Sado's parents to take action to prevent a recurrence. The case has again highlighted the Japanese problem of \"karoshi\" -- meaning death from overwork -- and is an embarrassing revelation for NHK, which has campaigned against the nation's long-hours culture. Sato covered Tokyo assembly elections for the broadcaster in June 2013 and an upper-house vote for the national parliament the following month. She died three days after the upper-house election. \"My heart breaks at the thought that she may have wanted to call me\" in her last moments, her mother told the Asahi daily. \"With Miwa gone, I feel like half of my body has been torn off. I won't be able to laugh for real for the rest of my life.\" The revelation shocked the nation as NHK has actively reported tragic deaths at other companies, including the 2015 suicide of a young woman at major advertising agency Dentsu who logged more than 100 hours of overtime in one month. 'Physical and mental limit' NHK's chief has pledged to improve work conditions at the broadcaster. \"We are sorry that we lost an excellent reporter and take seriously the fact that her death was recognised as work-related,\" President Ryoichi Ueda said Thursday. \"We will continue to work for reform in cooperation with her parents,\" he told reporters. Every year in Japan, long working hours are blamed for dozens of deaths due to strokes, heart attacks and suicides. In July, the parents of an unnamed 23-year-old worker on Tokyo's Olympic stadium who killed himself applied for compensation and asked the government to recognise his suicide as a case of death from overwork. The construction firm employee, who began working on the project in December, clocked 200 hours of overtime in the month before his body was found in April with a note that said he had \"reached the physical and mental limit\". According to a government report on death from overwork released on Friday, there were 191 \"karoshi\" cases in the year ending March 2017. The report also showed that 7.7 percent of employees in Japan regularly log more than 20 hours of overtime a week. Labour minister Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Friday that the government will \"do its best\" to reduce the number of people who die from overwork to zero, according to NHK. In an attempt to tackle the problem, the government in May released its first nationwide employer blacklist, naming-and-shaming more than 300 companies including advertising giant Dentsu and an arm of Panasonic for breaching labour laws. In February, Japan launched \"Premium Friday\", calling on employees to knock off early on the last Friday of the month. But critics slammed the plan as it was not mandatory and several companies simply opted out.

Photo by AFP/Lillian Suwanrumpha On October 6, 1976, at least 41 students protesting the return of a military dictator were shot, beaten to death. Up until now, no one has been charged over the killings. Tears flow freely as Chumpol Thummai stands in front of the rusty gate where his brother was lynched by royalists 41 years ago, an act that set off a chain of events that ended in a student massacre. The bloodshed was one of the darkest chapters in Thailand's violence-flecked modern history, a century that has seen the kingdom lurch between military dictatorships and democratic rule. On October 6, 1976, at least 41 students protesting the return of a military dictator were shot, beaten to death or hung from trees at Bangkok's Thammasat University by state forces and royalist mobs. Four decades later academics are finally documenting the lives of those who died -- and who did the killing -- despite the extreme sensitivity of the subject in a kingdom once again under ultra-royalist military rule. \"I wept so much (when they contacted me). It's a miracle that after 40 years, they could find me and I\u2019m still alive to tell it,\" Chumpol told AFP , crying in disbelief that the loss of his brother Chumporn had not been forgotten. Chumpol is the subject of a new documentary, \"The Two Brothers,\" that tells the story of two activists -- including his brother -- whose lynching set off the unrest that culminated in the massacre. The film was released as part of a landmark digital archive pieced together by academics who have unearthed new testimony, reports and photos about a massacre that is barely touched on in Thai history classes. No-one has ever been charged over the killings, with the role of royalist militias an especially taboo topic. Sensitivity about all things royal has intensified since the late King Bhumibol Adulaydej passed away in October 2016, plunging the kingdom into a year of official mourning. The country is preparing for his cremation later this month. But the academics behind the project, called the \"Documentation of October 6\", believe that shedding light on the Thammasat massacre is a crucial step towards freeing Thailand from a carousel of brief democratic government, street violence and coups. \"We don't want to remember the victims by their name tags or numbers only,\" said Pattaraphon Phoothong, one of the project researchers. \"To tell their story is to return humanity and dignity to the victims.\" Democracy cut by coups At the time of the massacre Thailand was at a crossroads in its tumultuous experiment with democracy. A student-led uprising three years earlier had toppled a 15-year military regime as a leftist pro-democracy movement emerged. But by 1976, the optimism for democracy had dimmed. Eager to claw back power, arch monarchists spread fears that students were plotting a socialist revolution and the kingdom would go the way of Vietnam. Two activists -- one of whom was Chumpol's brother -- were lynched in late September 1976 after taking part in a protest against the return of ex-dictator Thanom Kittikachorn from exile. Thammasat students, enraged by the activists' death, staged a play imitating the lynching. But it was seized on by monarchist mobs who said one of the actors bore a passing resemblance to the then-crown prince, who is now Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn. Anger spilled over into violence. At dawn on October 6 royalist militias fired on students, turning Thammasat's sports pitch into a killing field. Survivors say more than 100 students and demonstrators died -- though the official toll is half of that. Later that night, the military staged a coup and held onto power for 16 more years. 'Nobody cared to ask' Chumpol Thummai touching the abandoned gate where his left-wing activist brother was lynched by Thai royalists, an incident that led to the October 6, 1976 Thammasat University massacre, in the central Thai province of Nakhon Pathom. On October 6, 1976, at least 41 students protesting the return of a military dictactor were shot, beaten to death or hung from trees at Bangkok's Thammasat University by state forces and royalist mobs. Four decades later academics are finally documenting the lives of those who died -- and who did the killing, despite the extreme sensitivity of the subject in a kingdom once again under ultra-royalist military rule . Photo by AFP/Lillian Suwanrumpha Photographers documented the violence of October 6 in graphic detail -- some students were shot point blank, while others were raped, burned or lynched from trees. But most of the perpetrators, victims and bystanders, have never been identified. \"This should be the basic information that we should have known four decades ago but nobody cared to ask,\" Puangthong Pawakapan, an academic at Chulalongkorn University who leads the archival project. Her team of researchers has scoured through autopsy reports, phone books and survivor contacts, tracing the families of 27 of the dead. Many refused to speak about issues deeply buried in Thailand's past. But for Chumpol, revisiting the site of his brother's death -- unknown until the academics tracked it down -- was cathartic. He hopes that confronting the past will give vital lessons to a younger generation once again grappling with an authoritarian regime. \"If we begin to talk again, one day it will be clear what the event was and how it came to be,\" he said.

Two late-night text messages in an hour, one from sources in the military, the other from the cops, warned Cambodian opposition politician Mu Sochua her arrest was at hand. The next day she bolted from the country, joining half of the kingdom's opposition lawmakers in self-exile. Photo by AFP/Lillian Suwanrumpha 'I don't intend to sit and wait for a kangaroo court to give us a trial that is a total joke.' Two late-night text messages in an hour, one from sources in the military, the other from the cops, warned Cambodian opposition politician Mu Sochua her arrest was at hand. The next day she bolted from the country, joining half of the kingdom's opposition lawmakers in self-exile. They have fled since September 3 when their party chief was arrested in the middle of the night by hundreds of officers, a dramatic escalation of a purge of rivals to Cambodia's strongman premier Hun Sen, one of the world's longest serving leaders. \"I don't intend to be captured,\" Mu Sochua told AFP from Bangkok, where she arrived on Tuesday and will stay before heading to Europe. \"I don't intend to sit and wait for a kangaroo court to give us a trial that is a total joke.\" Her anxiety is well founded. Through a mix of threats, harassment and legal entanglements, Hun Sen's government has been clearing out critics ahead of key elections that will test the premier's 32-year run. And the odds are looking good for the 65-year-old, a master of manipulating the country's malleable democratic institutions in his favour. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP)is in tatters, with more than 20 MPs skipping abroad in the past month after their stand-in leader Kem Sokha was locked up in a remote prison on dubious treason charges. His arrest comes months after a series of legal convictions and new laws forced the party's long-time frontman Sam Rainsy to step down. Many civil society groups railing against corruption and repression have also been shut down or sidelined by court cases. Outspoken media -- including the respected and recently shuttered Cambodia Daily -- have found the cost of criticism is a crippling tax bill. Repression the 'new normal' Deputy party leader Mu Sochua is no stranger to intimidation. The 63-year-old is a veteran of an opposition movement that has spent most of its time dodging Hun Sen's machinations. But the latest crackdown, she says, feels different. \"For the first time I felt unsafe. And politically speaking, this is the first time I felt we no longer have the possibility of a dialogue,\" Mu Sochua told AFP , adding that police have been following the movements of her party's members around the country. \"I didn't want another leader caught, another voice being silenced. That left me with one choice only, which is to leave.\" Despite the roadblocks set up against it, the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) fared well in recent elections, buoyed by growing frustration over graft and inequality. But the recent exodus of MPs abroad is unprecedented and severely cramps the party's ability to mount an effective campaign in next year's poll. At this rate, a boycott of next summer's national vote is on the table if Kem Sokha remains in jail and repression of the media and civil society continues, said Mu Sochua. She and others in exile will now travel the West to whip up global pressure on Hun Sen and his cronies from abroad. But whether Western democracies -- once a source of vital aid for the impoverished country -- can still wield influence over the premier is in question. China has steadily pulled Hun Sen into its orbit in recent years by lavishing the leader with aid and investment free of pressure to safeguard human rights. That has relieved the autocrat from needing to at least maintain the semblance of a functioning democracy and free press. In the past, his crackdowns were often followed by spells of relative freedom to keep democratic donors on board. But with Chinese cash flowing into the coffers, that let-up might never come. \"What's new in all this is the feeling of permanence,\" said Sebastian Strangio, an expert on Cambodian politics. \"It looks like the current repression is becoming Cambodia's new normal.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T11:28:51.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "66239e82064d8c627525aed539db6a8dc68b8b6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nKvVZpOTsujaMDQa5S.xXZn10pW_ANhIdbSyWBlwIG0I.1C9wvTVBtlcPR_Qy_I1fW25DfFBo2baTAkg4jIwrThtwDslbYymvAfIN3ovtt7L9Y1pTdEJMExiEesYavOcFyO9X0LYA6GYZtr6SlQvR9g--", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Foreign firms paying staff 29 pct more than local companies in Vietnam: survey", "title_full": "Foreign firms paying staff 29 pct more than local companies in Vietnam: survey", "published": "2017-10-06T10:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/06/Coworkingspace1-1507276299_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 61, "comments": 0, "shares": 61}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "66239e82064d8c627525aed539db6a8dc68b8b6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nKvVZpOTsujaMDQa5S.xXZn10pW_ANhIdbSyWBlwIG0I.1C9wvTVBtlcPR_Qy_I1fW25DfFBo2baTAkg4jIwrThtwDslbYymvAfIN3ovtt7L9Y1pTdEJMExiEesYavOcFyO9X0LYA6GYZtr6SlQvR9g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T10:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Foreign firms paying staff 29 pct more than local companies in Vietnam: survey", "text": "October 06, 2017 GMT+7 Foreign firms paying staff 29 pct more than local companies in Vietnam: survey By Nguyen Ha  October 6, 2017 | 02:51 pm GMT+7 The gap has narrowed since last year, but it's still wide enough to make a huge difference. Foreign companies in Vietnam are paying their employees 29 percent more than their domestic rivals, a new survey has found. The comprehensive survey, conducted by global human resources and business consulting firm Mercer with Vietnamese partner Talentnet, questioned 289,236 people from 592 companies operating in 16 different sectors across the country. This year's results revealed that salaries for managers at foreign firms are 41 percent higher than the same positions at Vietnamese companies, while the average payments for experts and low-level employees are 30 and 15 percent higher, respectively. Last year, Mercer and Talentnet found that foreign companies in Vietnam were paying their staff 31 percent more than their local peers. Managers' salaries at foreign firms were 38 percent higher, while the respective rates were 30 and 20 percent more for experts and low-level staff. The survey explained that the pay gap is bigger for managers at foreign and local firms this year because foreign firms want to give their managers what they deserve, as they are usually required to work hard and shoulder a lot of responsibility. In its \"2016 Best Places to Work\" survey released in March, solution firm Anphabe and market research firm Nielsen found foreign firms accounted for 15 of the 20 best companies in Vietnam. This survey collected feedback from 26,128 employees working in 24 different sectors. Rankings were based on salary levels, bonuses, welfare and work-life balance for employees.

Photo by VnExpress/Pham Du He claims he is innocent of embezzlement and has asked the court to commute his sentence. A former chairman of state fuel giant PetroVietnam has appealed against the death penalty he received last week from a court in Hanoi for his role in the infamous multi-million-dollar graft case at OceanBank. On September 29, the court sentenced Nguyen Xuan Son, chairman of the board at the oil and gas group from 2014 until his arrest in 2015, to death for appropriating VND246 billion ($13.6 million) from OceanBank. PetroVietnam had acquired a 20 percent stake in OceanBank during that time, meaning Son had stolen VND49 billion in government money, prosecutors said. The 55-year-old was charged with embezzlement, abuse of power and deliberately violating state regulations on economic management. The court on Friday said it had received Son's appeal, in which he claimed he was innocent of embezzlement and charges of abusing his power to steal money, local media reported. He admitted in the appeal that he had broken lending regulations at credit institutions and accepted the charge of deliberately violating state regulations on economic management. But he said he would like the court to reconsider the case and reduce his sentence. After the sentence was announced last Friday, Son called it \"an unjust verdict\u201d, and Reuters quoted his lawyer as saying that he would appeal. Judges at the one-month trial also sentenced Ha Van Tham, former chairman of the board at OceanBank, to life in jail on charges of embezzlement, deliberately violating state regulations on economic management and breaking regulations on lending activities at credit institutions. Tham is accused of offering deposit rates above those set by the central bank to various customers including PetroVietnam between 2010 and 2014, causing losses of nearly VND1.6 trillion ($70.4 million). Other bankers received up to 22 years in jail. OceanBank was founded in 1993 with a 20 percent stake from Ocean Group, which also invests in hospitality, securities, media and retail. It was taken over by the central bank in April 2015 after the scandal broke out. The high-profile trial, with 51 bankers and businessmen in the dock, could go down as the biggest fraud trial in Vietnam\u2019s history. The Ministry of Public Security has launched a separate investigation into who else benefited from the illegal money. According to the indictment, more than 50,000 individuals and nearly 400 organizations and businesses received preferential deposit interest payments from the bank, including many state-owned units besides PetroVietnam. But only 19 businesses have admitted to having received a combined VND3 billion, while 124 have denied taking any money and the rest have remained silent. At least three PetroVietnam units were put under investigation earlier this month for colluding with OceanBank execs to appropriate $5.2 million. PetroVietnam and the banking sector are at the center of Vietnam\u2019s sweeping corruption crackdown that has ensnared scores of high-ranking officials, including Dinh La Thang, a former member of the Communist Party\u2019s decision-making Politburo who headed PetroVietnam from 2005 to 2011.

From the organizer: Do women dream too much? Too many dreams lead to too many desires, uncontrolled desires, dangerous desires. That\u2019s what patriarchy wants us to believe. But in the small city of Bophal, four women have decided to try to set their desires free. Auntie, Rehana, Leela and Shereen, in their individual lives, challenge the borders imposed by social fetters. Getting a few inches of freedom is not easy, but it\u2019s a collective effort that starts from our very own dreams and desires. In India, Alankrita Shrivastava\u2019s film was censored by the Central Board for Film Certification because it was \u201ctoo lady-oriented\u201d. However, the controversy that followed forced the board to overturn the decision and actually forced dialogue on questions that are never debated publicly.

Photo by Reuters/Denis Balibouse The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons just won the Nobel Peace Prize. The Norwegian Nobel Committee, warning of a rising risk of nuclear war, awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize on Friday to a little-known international campaign group advocating for a ban on nuclear weapons. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) describes itself as a coalition of grassroots non-government groups in more than 100 nations. It began in Australia and was officially launched in Vienna in 2007. \"We live in a world where the risk of nuclear weapons being used is greater than it has been for a long time,\" said Berit Reiss-Andersen, the leader of the Norwegian Nobel Committee. In July, 122 nations adopted a U.N. Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, although the agreement does not include nuclear-armed states such as the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France. \"This award shines a needed light on the path the ban treaty provides towards a world free of nuclear weapons. Before it is too late, we must take that path,\" ICAN said in a statement on its Facebook page. \"This is a time of great global tension, when fiery rhetoric could all too easily lead us, inexorably, to unspeakable horror. The spectre of nuclear conflict looms large once more. If ever there were a moment for nations to declare their unequivocal opposition to nuclear weapons, that moment is now.\" The Nobel prize seeks to bolster the case of disarmament amid nuclear tensions between the United States and North Korea and uncertainty over the fate of a 2015 deal between Iran and major powers to limit Tehran's nuclear programme. The Iran deal is seen as under threat after U.S. President Donald Trump called it the \"worst deal ever negotiated\". A senior administration official said on Thursday that Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the pact, a step towards potentially unwinding it. The committee raised eyebrows with its decision to award the prize to an international campaign group with a relatively low profile, rather than giving it to the architects of the Iran deal, who had been widely seen as favourites after hammering out a complex agreement over years of high-stakes diplomacy. \"Norwegian Nobel Committee has its own ways, but the nuclear agreement with Iran achieved something real and would have deserved a prize,\" tweeted Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister who has held top posts as an international diplomat. The leader of the Norwegian Nobel committee denied that the prize was \"a kick in the leg\" for Trump and said the prize was a call to states that have nuclear weapons to fulfil earlier pledges to work towards disarmament. \"The message is to remind them to the commitment they have already made that they have to work for a nuclear free world,\" Reiss-Andersen told Reuters. The United Nations said the award would help bolster efforts to get the 55 ratifications by countries for the U.N.

Photo by VnExpress/Nguyen Dong Nguyen Xuan Anh is the latest political casualty of Vietnam's corruption crackdown and the second top leader of a major city to be fired since May. Vietnam\u2019s ruling Communist Party has fired the top leader of Da Nang and dismissed him from a powerful grouping as punishment for his misconduct that has been uncovered in the host city of the upcoming Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The Party on Friday signed off on a proposal by the Politburo to strip Nguyen Xuan Anh of his role as Party chief of Da Nang and removed him from the Central Committee, a powerful grouping of 200 senior Party members. The 18-member Politburo is the Party's decision-making body. The move took place at a time when the Central Committee has been convening for a key gathering that opened last Wednesday in Hanoi. Disciplinary actions against senior Party members are a major theme of the meeting. Anh\u2019s violations \u201csparked annoyance among Communist Party members, state officials and the public\u201d and were serious enough to merit punishment, the Party said in a statement Friday. In fact, the punishment is just a foregone conclusion as last week the Party\u2019s top watchdog already gave an inkling of what will become of Anh after implicating him for misconduct, mismanagement and dishonesty. The Central Inspection Committee concluded last Friday that Anh violated the Party\u2019s democratic centralism principles by making multiple decisions without consulting others, besides personal misconduct. He also set a bad example by accepting a car and two houses as gifts from businesses, the committee said. The inspectors have also flagged his academic credentials. Anh also showed sign of nepotism, the Politburo said without elaborating. Embarking on his career as a journalist, Anh quickly rose through the ranks of Vietnam's political apparatus. In 2014, when he became vice Party chief of Da Nang, analysts said the major challenge for young leaders like him would be the formal and informal institutional arrangements within the state that limit the efficiency, efficacy and transparency of government. For some, the challenge would also lie in the battle against the deep-seated public grievance against a political apparatus that has been plagued by nepotism and cronyism and not based on meritocracy. Anh is the son of Nguyen Van Chi, who used to chair the very watchdog that has proposed punitive measures against him. He was elected Da Nang's Party chief in October 2015 at the age of 39 and became one of the two youngest Party chiefs in Vietnam besides Nguyen Thanh Nghi in the southern province of Kien Giang. Nghi is the son of Vietnam\u2019s former Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung. His fate has been dominating daily gossip in what has been widely dubbed \"Vietnam's most livable city\" among both average citizens and local bureaucrats alike. \u201cPeople are likely to pay attention to what happens in Da Nang, which became an acknowledged model of smart governance,\u201d David Brown, a retired U.S. diplomat and expert on Vietnam, said. \u201cThey're also likely to keep a close eye on Nguyen Xuan Anh, one of the Party's princelings,\u201d Brown said. Da Nang has gained kudos as one of the most modern places in the country, and its leadership is often hailed as an example to follow. Yet following a recemt spate of management scandals, the Party\u2019s top watchdog last month proposed disciplinary measures against Anh and Huynh Duc Tho, Da Nang\u2019s chairman. Tho has received a warning from the Party, which has four modes of punishment for misconduct by official members: reprimand, warning, demotion and expulsion. He has been held mainly accountable for land management violations in the city. For a high-ranking official like Tho, receiving a warning also means that his position is anything but certain. Da Nang will host world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in November. On the eve of the Party meeting, Mai Tien Dung, minister and chairman of the Government Office said the punishment facing the two top leaders of Da Nang would not affect what will be Vietnam's most important political event this year. Preparations for the summit have been calibrated and managed by top leaders in Hanoi and are not intertwined with any action to be taken against the leaders of the host city, Dung said.

His dismissal is strikingly similar to how the top leader of Ho Chi Minh, Dinh La Thang, fell from grace.

Photo by VnExpress/Huu Cong 'Now all we can see is a city filled with floods and trash. There is no vision for a smart city.' Saigon has rolled out a so-called master plan to turn itself into a \"smart city\" by 2020, promising a bright future for both local residents and businesses, a move that has immediately raised eyebrows over its feasibility. Tran Vinh Tuyen, the city's vice chairman, said advanced technology will be used in administration and other areas that have a direct impact on local residents. \u201cThe city will learn from residents' feedback and be proactive rather than just trying to fix existing problems,\u201d he said at a recent meeting. Locals and businesses will be able to complete administrative procedures online instead of wasting time in governement offices waiting for the final seal of approval. The plan also promises \u201cadvanced tools\u201d for better management that will prevent state officials from causing problems for residents and businesses. The same solution will be applied in public hospitals, allowing patients to book appointments and services online. In order to make the plan work, the city will have to spend time building a database on infrastructure, population, and public and private investment. The city believes that it is following a global trend that can help improve living standards and enhance the city's competitiveness. Singapore, London, Chicago, New York, Seoul and Hong Kong have already achieved that, it said. However, the plan has been met with widespread skepticism since it was announced on Friday morning. Many VnExpress readers have commented that the plan is macroscopic and unfeasible, saying what they need now is a city that does not flood so easily with less traffic jams and trash on the streets. \"Is there any smart city that gets flooded for half a day every time it rains for five minutes?\" a reader with nickname thoinay wrote in a comment. \"Traffic gridlock, floods, broken plans.

Admiral Scott Swift joined a U.S. delegation on Friday as he visited the site of a river battle where Vietnam defeated Chinese invaders three times a thousand years ago. Swift, now serving as the commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, visited the Bach Dang River Heritage Site in the northern port city of Hai Phong with Ted Osius, the U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. Admiral Scott Swift visits the Bach Dang River Heritage Site in northern Vietnam on Friday. Photo by VnExpress/Vu Anh The river witnessed three important battles in Vietnamese history. It was where Ngo Quyen, who later became king for five years, led rebels to defeat invading forces from the Southern Han state of China and put an end to nearly a thousand years of Chinese imperial domination in Vietnam. Wooden poles were set up in the river as traps against the Chinese, the same tactic used in two other battles in 981 and 1288 against two other invasions from China. Some of the poles are still visible today. Ambassador Osius said in a Facebook post following the visit that the victories, won with \u201cresilience, determination, and ingenious tactics,\u201d serve as \u201ca testament to the Vietnamese peoples\u2019 tenacity.\u201d \u201cThe patriotic spirit and determination of the Vietnamese people, so well reflected through these monuments of the past, is alive and well in the people today,\u201d he said. Admiral Swift also expressed his admiration for the Vietnamese heroes who stood against an enemy much stronger than them. He said the spirit would be a big inspiration to his career in national defense. He also hailed the growth of Vietnam and U.S.\u2019s naval cooperation, pressing its importance in times of common threats and instability in the region.

Danish police said Saturday that divers had recovered the decapitated head and the legs of Swedish journalist Kim Wall, who vanished in August while interviewing a Danish inventor aboard his homemade submarine. In a grisly case worthy of a Nordic noir thriller, Copenhagen police inspector Jens Moller Jensen told reporters that divers had found bags containing her missing clothes, her head and legs in Koge Bay, south of the Danish capital. \"Last night our forensic dentist confirmed that it was Kim Wall's head,\" he said. Her headless torso was found floating in waters off Copenhagen on August 21, 11 days after she went missing. Self-taught engineer and inventor Peter Madsen, 46, has been accused of Wall's death, with prosecutors saying he dismembered her body before throwing it overboard. Madsen, who is married and has been in custody since August 11, claims Wall died when a 70-kilo (154-pound) hatch door fell on her head, and in a panic, he threw her body overboard. He has insisted her body was intact at the time. But Jensen said the decapitated head contradicted Madsen's version of events. There is \"no sign of fracture on the skull and there isn't any sign of other blunt violence to the skull,\" he said, citing an autopsy carried out overnight. Locating Wall's head has been a priority for investigators, as the final autopsy on the torso was not able to establish the cause of death. However, it did show multiple mutilation wounds to Wall's genitals. Fetish films Prosecutors believe Madsen killed 30-year-old Wall as part of a sexual fantasy, then dismembered and mutilated her body. Earlier this week, prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen told a court custody hearing that a hard disk found in Madsen's workshop contained fetish films in which real women were tortured, decapitated and burned. \"This hard drive doesn't belong to me,\" Madsen insisted, saying numerous people had access to his workshop. Madsen has insisted there was no sexual relationship between him and Wall, and their contacts had been purely professional. Jensen said the divers on Friday found the clothes and body parts in bags weighed down with metal pieces. Her torso had also been weighed down when it was found, also in Koge Bay. \"Yesterday morning we found a bag within which we found Kim Wall's clothes, underwear, stockings, and shoes. In the same bag laid a knife, and there were some lead pipes to weigh the bag down,\" he said. \"Around dinnertime we found one leg, and then another leg. And then we found a head that also laid in a bag, and was weighed down with multiple metal pieces.\" Jensen said police would continue to search for her arms. Copenhagen Police Chief Investigator Jens Moeller Jensen gives a press briefing in connection with new findings in the case against submarine captain Peter Madsen on October 7, 2017 in Copenhagen, Denmark. Photo by AFP/Jens Noergaard Larsen Link to Japanese tourist? Police have previously said they were re-examining the unresolved case of a Japanese tourist whose mutilated body was found in a Copenhagen harbour in 1986, to see if there was any possible link to the Wall case. Kazuko Toyonaga, a 22-year-old student, was on vacation in Europe when she disappeared. Her legs were found in a plastic bag floating in the waters off Islands Brygge, a harbor in Copenhagen. Wall worked as a freelance journalist based in New York and China, and her articles were published in The Guardian , The New York Times and others. At the time of her disappearance, she was believed to be working on a feature story about Madsen, an eccentric, well-known figure in Denmark. Madsen has successfully launched rockets with the aim of developing private space travel. His homemade submarine Nautilus, launched in 2008, was the biggest private sub ever made when he built it with help from a group of volunteers. But the group became engaged in a long-running dispute over the Nautilus, before members of the board decided to transfer the vessel's ownership to Madsen, according to the sub's website.

Indonesian police have detained 58 men including several foreigners in a raid on a gay sauna, an official said Saturday, the latest sign of a backlash against homosexuals in the Muslim-majority country. Police late Friday raided a building in the capital Jakarta that houses a sauna and a gym after they received information from the public that it was being used for prostitution. \"We secured 51 and seven employees for allegedly providing pornographic services,\" Jakarta Police spokesman Argo Yuwono said in a statement. Six foreigners were among those detained, including four men from China, one from Thailand and one from Holland. Homosexuality and gay sex are legal everywhere in Indonesia except in conservative Aceh province, but police have used the country's tough anti-pornography laws or drugs charges to criminalise LGBT people in the past. Yuwono said six of those detained would be charged under Indonesia's anti-pornography law, and could face up to six years in prison. It is not clear what -- if anything -- the remaining 52 would be charged with. Friday's raid comes at a time of growing hostility towards Indonesia's small lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. Ministers, hardliners and influential Islamic groups have lined up to make anti-LGBT statements in public recently. In similar incident in May, 141 men were detained for allegedly taking part in a sex party in Jakarta promoted as \"The Wild One\". Andreas Harsono, senior Indonesia researcher at Human Rights Watch, condemned the arrests. \"This is part of the ongoing anti-LGBT campaign in Indonesia that has been going on since January last year,\" he told AFP. \"Human Rights Watch demands police release them and not make up charges against them.\" He said the increase in discrimination towards LGBT Indonesians was related to the rise of conservative Islam.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "yuwono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andreas harsono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argo yuwono", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "jakarta police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "human rights watch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aceh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muslim-majority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-08T06:42:01.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dfcba4c86306dba10ac2dd1650c6a5c1ee91c9a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695n6T7q4gqKmlfE.u7BFYZ7QGH9u2qeGkoGuVQv9TmSTeZ3JaOH4akv2Sj.mP7iCOvOparSBFr7iSjzrGjk5LF3jhU6Ck_yGDQWbji6Q_WBQ4oxUbjIjegRpg--", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Daredevil pedestrians ignore footbridges in Saigon - VnExpress International", "title_full": "Daredevil pedestrians ignore footbridges in Saigon - VnExpress International", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.003, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/06/13-1507289185_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dfcba4c86306dba10ac2dd1650c6a5c1ee91c9a8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695n6T7q4gqKmlfE.u7BFYZ7QGH9u2qeGkoGuVQv9TmSTeZ3JaOH4akv2Sj.mP7iCOvOparSBFr7iSjzrGjk5LF3jhU6Ck_yGDQWbji6Q_WBQ4oxUbjIjegRpg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Quynh Tran", "published": "2017-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Daredevil pedestrians ignore footbridges in Saigon - VnExpress International", "text": "October 07, 2017 GMT+7 Daredevil pedestrians ignore footbridges in Saigon By Quynh Tran  October 8, 2017 | 10:51 am GMT+7 Many people are willing to risk their lives on the manic streets to avoid taking the stairs. Crossing the streets in Saigon is intimidating. Thousands of motorbikes speed by just a hair's breadth away, stopping at traffic lights appears to be optional and zebra crossings are completely ignored . Last month Tuoi Tre (Youth) newspaper quoted the municipal Traffic Safety Committee as saying that 26 people were killed trying to cross the road in the southern metropolis in the first nine months of the year. But in many cases, the vehicles were not at fault. While authorities have been trying to ease the problem by building expensive footbridges across the city\u2019s busy roads, many of them have been largely ignored by risk-taking pedestrians. No Trang Long footbridge in Binh Thanh District is the most notorious in town. Built in front of the crowded Tumor Hospital to help patients and doctors avoid the fast-flowing traffic, it has been underused for years. \u201cPeople cut across the street to save time, it\u2019s a narrow road anyway\u201d, said a vendor. \u201cWe hear the sound of screeching brakes every day and collisions happen all the time, but I think everyone has got used to the jaywalking.\u201d Some patients said the footbridge is not wheelchair-friendly and too high for elderly people. \u201cI know it\u2019s dangerous, but it\u2019s really exhausting walking up there multiple times a day,\u201d said Nguyen Thi Nga, after weaving her way through moving traffic. \u201cFor people in wheelchairs, risking their life to cross the street is the only option here.\u201d A bridge on Pham Van Dong Boulevard has become a shelter for homeless people. Left almost disused, the overpass is filled with trash and sometimes becomes an open-air toilet. \u201cThe bridge is dirty and smelly, and has become a hang-out for drug users and thieves,\u201d said Ngoc Hau, a guard. \u201cThey scare people away.\u201d The bridge in front of Suoi Tien Theme Park is used more often. Vendors use the space to display their goods. A drinks stall has been set up in the shade of the overpass. The city's transport department plans to build eighteen more footbridges across the city for an estimated VND25 billion ($1.1 million). Several existing bridges have already been improved with flower beds and ramps for cyclists . Vo Van Kiet Boulevard, famous for being the most modern road in the city, has nine overpasses covered in flowers and plants. People come to take a break and enjoy the view from the bridge .

When I told my friends, both Vietnamese and foreign, that I was going to Vanuatu for five days, over half of them had never heard of the country. So I was surprised to come across a store in Port Vila, the capital, called \"Thai Viet Hardware\", and find a young Vietnamese woman working behind the counter. She was from northern Vietnam and had been in Vanuatu for just over a year. Her uncle owns the hardware store \u2013 he has been in Vanuatu for over 20 years. After leaving the hardware store and walking to the city center, I immediately saw a Vietnamese restaurant called Joe\u2019s. Later on, I came across a number of roadworks with signs bearing the company name \"Dinh Van Tu\". I also found out that one of Vanuatu\u2019s most prominent businessmen and former politicians is called Gilbert Dinh Van Than. The Vietnamese restaurant called Joe in Vanuatu. Photo by Joe Buckley \nI was in Vanuatu to run focus groups. When I went to speak to some subsistence farmers \u2013 the work I was there to do - they were very interested to hear I lived in Vietnam, and told me that there are a lot of half ni-Vanuatu, half Vietnamese people today in Vanuatu. One even had an uncle who had married a Vietnamese woman. What was going on? How had I arrived in Vanuatu, a country that over half of my friends in Vietnam had never heard of, and been hit by signs of Vietnam everywhere? All was revealed when I got talking to an older ni-Vanuatu man, who introduced himself as John from the River Jordan. He had worked for the British colonial government when Vanuatu was a French-British colony, known as the New Hebrides. After finding out I was British, he paused, and looked at me inquisitively: \u201cDo you live in Australia or somewhere though? Because nobody sensible would come here all the way from Britain for just five days.\u201d \u201cI live in Vietnam.\u201d \u201cVietnam!\u201d And so John from the River Jordan began telling me about the large Vietnamese community that used to live in Vanuatu. It\u2019s a story that\u2019s largely forgotten in Vietnam these days, but is definitely not forgotten in Vanuatu. At the beginning of the 20th century, plantation owners in the New Hebrides had a labor recruitment crisis. Unable to recruit or force enough local peasants to become workers on the plantations, they found their solution in French Indochina, which was at the time stricken with poverty, famine and overpopulation. From 1921-1940, over 21,000 indentured workers from Indochina \u2013 especially Ninh Binh, Nam Dinh and Thai Binh \u2013 were brought over to the New Hebrides to work for French settlers, creating a substantial Vietnamese community. In around 1929, the Vietnamese made up about 10 percent of the colony\u2019s population. Vietnamese laborers were employed on five-year indentured contracts. Despite attractive promises on the documents they signed before coming over, they were generally forced to work in poor conditions, akin to slavery. They were frequently deprived of the food and other benefits they had been promised, and often victims of violence at the hands of their employers. Other Vietnamese laborers were put to work as domestic workers in the homes of plantation owners and other wealthy Europeans. Many Vietnamese women, however, did not like this work, and preferred work on the plantations \u2013 there, it was easier to avoid the gaze of predatory masters who had been known to sexually assault and rape their staff. Thai Viet Hardware store owned by a Vietnamese man who has been in Vanuatu for 20 years. Photo by Joe Buckley After the Second World War, the French liquidated all labor contracts and the Vietnamese were suddenly freed from their indentured status. Many demanded to go home and there were large demonstrations by the Vietnamese population demanding repatriation, which forced the French, initially slow to respond, to speed up the process. Pamphlets supporting the Viet Minh began to circulate around Vanuatu, and many people openly declared their support for the anti-colonial movement in Indochina. This scared the French into thinking that if they repatriated these Vietnamese, it would strengthen the Vietnamese Communists. Repatriations were halted in the early 1950s, but resumed again in the 1960s. By the middle of that decade, most Vietnamese had \u201creturned\u201d to Vietnam \u2013 an odd phrase as over half of them had been born in Vanuatu. This left only a very small Vietnamese community, and John from the River Jordan lamented to me that most of them have died now. But the community, although small, still remains. And while back in Vietnam this history is largely forgotten and unknown, the Vietnamese language does contain one legacy of the Vietnam-Vanuatu link \u2013 ch\u00e2n \u0111\u0103ng , the most interesting thing I learnt during my trip. This noun refers to Vietnamese people who were brought to New Caledonia and Vanuatu \u2013 specifically these two places \u2013 as indentured laborers. It is also the first time \u2013 and almost definitely the last time \u2013 that I have successfully taught a Vietnamese word to my Vietnamese teacher.

South Korean giant Samsung Electronics has expressed interest in investing in Vietnam's telecommunications industry. The electronics company's president and CEO Shin Yong-Kyun revealed the company's plan at a meeting with Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc on Friday. Since entering Vietnam 10 years ago, Samsung's total investment in the country has risen to $17 billion and it now has 29 Vietnamese partner suppliers, according to Shin. The company's factories in Vietnam are also among its largest and most modern. Samsung will export over $50 billion worth of products from Vietnam in 2017, making up more than 20 percent of the country's exports, and aims to become partners with up to 50 Vietnamese companies in the next three years, Shin said.

The prime minister expressed his hope that Samsung will expand its investments in Vietnam to cover more fields in addition to the electronics sector. He asked the company to continue its assistance for Vietnam with training and technology transfer so more Vietnamese auxiliary companies will be able to provide materials and components for Samsung's projects. Stressing high technology as one of Vietnam's priorities, the prime minister said the country's ministries and authorities are always available to work with Samsung should it encounter any problems. Samsung currently has six factories in Vietnam and employs 136,700 workers. Products from these factories had been exported to 52 countries by the end of 2016. The company's production of mobile phones and electronic components increased by 45.5 percent in the third quarter of 2017 alone, contributing to overall growth of 16.6 percent in Vietnam's manufacturing industry. South Korea is Vietnam's biggest foreign investor. According to the Korea Trade Investment Promotion Agency, South Korean firms invested more than $50 billion in Vietnam between 1988 and 2016, making up more than 30 percent of total foreign investment in the country with over 6,000 projects.

North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un has promoted his sister to a senior ruling party post, state media said Sunday, and praised the country's nuclear weapons programme which has sparked international alarm. Kim Yo-Jong becomes an alternate member of the party's powerful politburo, the decision-making body presided over by her brother, the official KCNA news agency said. The promotion was announced along with those for dozens of other top officials at a party meeting led by the leader on Saturday. It came as the regime faces growing global pressure to curb its weapons drive following recent nuclear and missile tests. Tensions soared as Kim traded verbal threats with US President Donald Trump, who tweeted on Saturday that \"only one thing will work\" to tame the isolated nuclear-armed state. The sister, in her late 20s, has frequently been seen accompanying her brother on his \"field guidance trips\" and other events and is known to have been involved in the party's propaganda operations. Both were born to the late former ruler Kim Jong-Il and his third partner, former dancer Ko Yong-Hui. The family has ruled North Korea since its creation in 1948. The current ruler came to power after the death of his father in December 2011. Since then he has overseen four of the country's six nuclear tests -- most recently in September -- while cementing his grip on power through a series of purges, including those targeting his uncle and half-brother. The uncle, Jang Song-Thaek, was executed in 2013 for treason and the half-brother Kim Jong-Nam was killed by a toxic nerve agent in a Cold War-style assassination at a Kuala Lumpur airport in February. Both the North's missile and nuclear weapons capabilities have made significant progress under the current Kim, despite a growing layer of UN sanctions. During Saturday's party meeting, Kim acknowledged the country faced with \"ordeals\" under a \"stern\" situation, but claimed that its economy had grown this year despite ever-tighter sanctions. He described the North's atomic weapons as a \"treasured sword\" to protect it from aggression. \"The nuclear weapons of the DPRK (North Korea) are a precious fruition borne by its people's bloody struggle for defending the destiny and sovereignty of the country from the protracted nuclear threats of the US imperialists,\" Kim was quoted as saying.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "kim jong-nam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ko yong-hui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim yo jong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jang song-thaek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-il", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim yo-jong", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dprk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kcna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "n. korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryomyong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kuala lumpur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-08T13:49:36.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae3e82c1b9149bd5ce53c24dd0f81fc88786c62c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CJpkVaxBF4RrikHEWfDVKiEPRoAt6wAlHSsCMe15Kid4k9EcfqdY4BdI5qW.UyKNJv99mciZgM4CNOelKrm_xd9y5_qGDWvl.BQIiMZWKstb8eXzkMBnq3MpQCFM2ZU4Jc-", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Uphill battle to ban use of cancer-linked white asbestos in Vietnam: experts", "title_full": "Uphill battle to ban use of cancer-linked white asbestos in Vietnam: experts", "published": "2017-10-08T14:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/08/tamton71171505749447-1507456169_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3, "comments": 0, "shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae3e82c1b9149bd5ce53c24dd0f81fc88786c62c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CJpkVaxBF4RrikHEWfDVKiEPRoAt6wAlHSsCMe15Kid4k9EcfqdY4BdI5qW.UyKNJv99mciZgM4CNOelKrm_xd9y5_qGDWvl.BQIiMZWKstb8eXzkMBnq3MpQCFM2ZU4Jc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-08T14:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Uphill battle to ban use of cancer-linked white asbestos in Vietnam: experts", "text": "By Duong Tam, Trang Bui  October 8, 2017 | 06:11 pm GMT+7 Only 25 countries in the world still allow the use of the cheap building material, but at what cost? Health industry and construction experts in Vietnam have long been arguing the pros and cons of the use of chrysotile, otherwise known as white asbestos, but construction insiders have so far prevailed by claiming that the material is safe and cheap. A clash of opinions on both sides of the debate at a conference in 2014 shook the public, but ended with former Vice Minister of Construction Nguyen Tran Nam giving his approval for its use due to a lack of \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d about its potentially harmful effects. This October, researchers from the Vietnam Union of Science and Technology Associations are meeting again to discuss the country's growing use of what they say is a deadly material. A 2017 report by the World Health Organization showed that as of 2013, Vietnam was among the top 10 consumers of white asbestos out of the 25 countries in the world that were still using it. Back then, the country was using up to 70,000 tons a year. Fast-forward to 2017 and the country now has more than 40 asbestos roofing tile factories that churn out 100 million square meters a year, a quantity that satisfies over 60 percent of the country's roofing material demands. It also buys products containing white asbestos like insulation materials, brake linings, gaskets and pads for automobiles from China, Thailand, India, the U.S., Korea, Japan and Singapore, some of which have already banned the use of the substance domestically. White asbestos is one of six forms of asbestos, all of which are alleged to cause cancer in humans. A 2014 WHO report stated that asbestos in general caused at least 107,000 deaths each year. About half of the fatalities were caused by occupational cancer, but thousands of deaths were attributed to exposure to asbestos in the home. Top 10 asbestos consumers, 2013. Data extracted from the US Geological Survey via the WHO's 2017 Asbestos Report. Despite worldwide concerns, white asbestos remains a contentious topic in Vietnam. Experts at the latest meeting, which took place on Friday, said that Vietnam lacks the research into asbestos-related diseases to put a stop to the use of the material. They agreed it would take at least 20 years to look into the impacts of white asbestos. Three years ago at a conference in Hanoi, experts on the other side of the debate provided research that even dismissed the link to cancer. David Bernstein, a Swiss mediator with extensive experience in public health who was invited to speak at the conference by the Ministry of Construction, said white asbestos is not cancerous like the blue and brown varieties. He said its weak structure allows it to be easily dissolved by the body over the course of 3 to 15 days. Bernstein is an American-born toxicologist based in Geneva who has been researching chrysotile since the late 1990s. According to The Global Investigative Journalism Casebook, Bernstein is the most active of industry-backed scientists who helped fuel the asbestos trade. His work has been cited over 5000 times, yet most have been underwritten by the industry. Court documents show that one sponsor, Union Carbide, paid $400,623 for work by Bernstein in 2003 and 2005, the casebook reports.

Court documents show that one sponsor, Union Carbide, paid $400,623 for work by Bernstein in 2003 and 2005, the casebook reports. At the same conference, Le Thi Hang, deputy director of the Hanoi-based Construction Hospital at the Construction Ministry, said a survey of workers at Vietnam's white asbestos roofing tile factories found no cases of cancer or asbestosis. However, researchers did find a number of workers suffering from chronic respiratory inflammation. After hearing the various arguments, the then Vice Minister of Construction Nguyen Tran Nam said Vietnam would continue to allow the manufacture and use of white asbestos due to a lack of \u201cconvincing evidence\u201d against it. The argument seemed to be supported mainly by the material's exceptionally low price. Bach Dinh Thien, director of the Institute for Tropical Construction Materials Research, said they had explored alternatives to white asbestos, but every other option had proved more expensive. He did not go into specifics. Vietnam produced its first roofing materials from white asbestos in 1963 in Ho Chi Minh City and neighboring Dong Nai Province.

The Nobel committee spurned an opportunity to celebrate the Iran nuclear deal, but still found a way to send a message to US President Donald Trump. Trump is a stern critic of the 2015 accord, and US officials say that he intends to tell the US Congress next week that Tehran is not honoring its side of the bargain. He is also engaged in a perilous game of brinksmanship with nuclear-armed North Korea, threatening \"fire and fury\" and exchanging insults with young dictator Kim Jong-Un. Some supporters of the deal had hoped the jury would honor the architects of the Iran deal and in doing so send a message to Trump about the power of diplomacy. In the end the committee chose not to provoke Trump by handing prizes to Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif or former US secretary of state John Kerry. But in celebrating the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) they sent a strong message about the world's concerns over nuclear escalation. \"The message that has been communicated is a more subtle indirect messaging,\" said Melissa Dalton, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"It's potentially a message and an encouragement to uphold the JCPOA as a commitment that the US has made with allies to non-proliferation,\" she said, referring to the Iran deal. ICAN is a global civil society movement pushing for a global treaty to ban nuclear arms, one that was signed by 122 countries -- although none with such weapons -- in July. The US reacted coolly to the award, and a State Department spokesman said Washington has no plans to sign the treaty. \"This treaty will not make the world more peaceful, will not result in the elimination of a single nuclear weapon, and will not enhance any state's security,\" he told AFP. Speaking in Geneva, ICAN head Beatrice Fihn made an explicit link between the award and concerns about Trump's attitude to the Iran deal and non-proliferation efforts. Next week, Trump is expected to announce he is \"decertifying\" Iran's compliance with the 2015 agreement it signed to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. Officials insist this will not sink the deal itself but open the way for Congress to possibly develop new measures to punish other aspects of Iran's behavior. Global opinion Trump has called the deal an \"embarrassment to the United States\" but rather than scrap it he is exploring a risky middle path to turn up the pressure on Iran. Ever scornful of the record of his Nobel laureate predecessor Barack Obama, the US leader is unlikely at this stage to be influenced by a Norwegian committee. But the timing of the award underlines the extent to which his hostility to the pact is out of step with global opinion, including with US allies in Europe. And even if, as is now expected, the accord survives Trump's Washington maneuvers, his position may have weakened his ability to negotiate with another foe: North Korea. The US strategy to deal with Kim's nuclear bravado is to use sanctions and diplomacy -- backed by a credible military posture -- to bring him to the negotiating table. But doubts hanging over the Iran deal make success less likely, say observers, including Jung Pak of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution. \"Even if North Korea and the US came to an agreement, Kim has no reason to think that an agreement would stick from one US administration to the next,\" he warned. \"The message is loud and clear, the US cannot be trusted.\" Washington's European allies are also nervous that Trump's criticism of the deal will encourage US hardliners to undermine the entire agreement. \"We told the administration: certification or not, that's not our problem, this is an American domestic issue,\" one Western diplomat told reporters. \"But beware of a demarche that would endanger the agreement. Our concern now is what the Congress will do if Trump doesn't certify,\" he said. There are some hawks in Washington who will seize on any opportunity to toughen the US stance -- despite the international solidarity symbolized by the Nobel award. Influential conservative Senator Tom Cotton is known to have Trump's ear and he advises pushing ahead with both decertification and new sanctions. \"If anything, certifying the disastrous deal with Iran will show the North Koreans that we lack the will to confront them,\" he said, arguing that Kimwould respect a strong stance. \"Isn't it curious that North Korea's nuclear and missile tests have accelerated so rapidly since we agreed to the Iran deal?\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "afp/francesco fontemaggi  oct", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "john kerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beatrice fihn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammad javad zarif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa dalton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom cotton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jung pak", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookings institution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east asia policy studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for strategic and international studies", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "western", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-08T15:58:44.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f719050b8197b5d00e2d6f26ff2b951a6c2fc93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CJN6PHEILW5G..7NPCPlOq9_lAqJ1faCAPmjaOwGyJrzRrKuBfbvO0mUT1nIsLmny.u4TJBXtJan4fH13hjK2qsdVBFlf9TjrmCw7y3CxvFWjfSH.KYKhhS310xmUK6mJQ-", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "In Vietnam, ingrained prejudice leaves police between a rock and a hard place", "title_full": "In Vietnam, ingrained prejudice leaves police between a rock and a hard place", "published": "2017-10-08T16:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/08/Cops-1507468337_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 41, "comments": 0, "shares": 41}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f719050b8197b5d00e2d6f26ff2b951a6c2fc93", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nqZCJkrIL0CJN6PHEILW5G..7NPCPlOq9_lAqJ1faCAPmjaOwGyJrzRrKuBfbvO0mUT1nIsLmny.u4TJBXtJan4fH13hjK2qsdVBFlf9TjrmCw7y3CxvFWjfSH.KYKhhS310xmUK6mJQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-08T16:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "In Vietnam, ingrained prejudice leaves police between a rock and a hard place", "text": "In Vietnam, ingrained prejudice leaves police between a rock and a hard place By Dien Luong  October 8, 2017 | 08:26 pm GMT+7 A policeman directs traffic on a street in Hanoi. In the era of social media, deep-seated public prejudice against corruption and misconduct is working increasingly against the police, insiders and analysts say. Photo by Reuters/Kham Social media reports of corruption and misconduct are working increasingly against the police, putting them on the defensive. On a recent afternoon in Saigon, a woman was pulled over by a traffic cop for driving in the wrong lane. She jumped out of the car, lashed out at the cop and apparently tried to attack him. The officer, on the other hand, appeared meek and remained on the defensive. Such resistance against traffic cops is all too common in a country where the masses are already of the opinion that the traffic police force is the most corrupt institution here. Video clips and photos of police officers being shoved away by taxi drivers or clinging to the windshield wipers of speeding buses are constantly popping up online. The problem became serious enough for the Ministry of Public Security to in early July allow the police to use \u201c any legal means necessary\u201d to deal with those who break traffic laws and resist officers on patrol. The order came in the wake of a disturbing video showing a traffic cop being thrown off a speeding truck whose driver had refused to pull over. The officer, who was desperately clinging to the front of the truck, was critically injured. In the era of social media, deep-seated public prejudice against corruption and misconduct is working increasingly against the police, putting them on the defensive and making it more difficult for them to carry out their duties, insiders and experts say. \"The police and the people have always had a strained relationship,\u201d a Vietnamese police official said on the condition of anonymity. An apparent rise in public action against the police with the latest incident reported just this Sunday in the Central Highlands province of Dak Lak, coupled with corruption and misconduct stories widely reported in the local media recently, have tainted the image of the police force, he said. \"The police are actually worried about every move they make now. They easily give in to strong public reaction, even though their actions may be totally justifiable.\" In 2011, police in the central province of Thanh Hoa tried using giant fishing nets to snag the wheels of illegal motorbike racers, but had to stop following a public outcry. Photo by VnExpress/Le Hoang In 2011, police in the central province of Thanh Hoa grabbed international headlines for devising what many called a novel initiative to stop illegal motorbike racers in their tracks: using giant fishing nets. The police would throw the nets into the rear wheels of the racing bikes to get them tangled and slow the bikes to a stop. Though the provincial police said this unorthodox tactic had not caused any major accidents or proved dangerous to the racers, they decided to suspend the tactic in the wake of a public outcry. Many dismissed the method as too risky because of the collateral damage it could have caused to other road users. But proponents of the tactic said the police had bowed to public pressure too soon, and that the decision would put them on the back foot again. In 2013, the Ministry of Public Security floated a new law to allow officers to shoot at \"those who showed signs of resistance\u201d. It said the right to shoot at suspects under a wider range of circumstances would allow the police to protect themselves in life-threatening situations. Such an otherwise legitimate proposal did not come at the most propitious time, however. Just in late 2012, the World Bank released the results of a survey in which 5,460 Vietnamese respondents overwhelmingly identified the traffic police as the most corrupt group of individuals in the country. It is in this context that naysayers all but nipped the law in the bud, saying trigger-happy cops could abuse it. Since then there has been no final word on the draft law. That was the last time the World Bank commissioned a survey on public attitude towards traffic police. But just last March, Transparency International, a Berlin-based advocacy group, released an 18-month long survey of more than 20,000 people in 16 Asia-Pacific economies that included Vietnam. The survey found that nearly two in five respondents agreed that the police were mostly or entirely corrupt. The finding was on the one hand emblematic of a common bugbear plaguing the region, but on the other corroborated such ingrained public attitude in Vietnam in particular. But experts remain cautious over the assumption that public attitude towards the police, especially traffic cops, is getting worse in Vietnam. \u201cStories of police misconduct were not new even a decade ago,\u201d Phan Tuong Yen, a psychologist at Ho Chi Minh City's Hoa Sen University, said. \u201cIt is the blooming social media that is the key driving factor in exposing them more to the public, sometimes even leaving people overwhelmed by an information overload,\u201d Yen said. \u201cAlso thanks to social media, there have been increasing numbers of different viewpoints defending police actions online, seeking to counter extreme criticism of the force. That's added another layer of complexity to this already complicated issue.\u201d In a country that is among Facebook\u2019s top 10 countries by users, the police have also shown signs of embracing the platform. In Da Nang and Saigon, police officials are using Facebook to report traffic-related information or crimes to the public. But in reality, media reports or Facebook posts of police misconduct have appeared to grab more public attention, eclipsing the positive efforts being made by officers to help civilians. Experts concur that social media, chiefly Facebook, will play an increasingly crucial role in shaping and the public stance in this regard, leaving the police facing a double whammy: increased public scrutiny and self-inflicted pressure. \u201cThis makes them even more tense when they're on duty and puts them more on the defensive,\u201d said Yen. In Vietnam, it is a no-brainer for any junior reporter to ask people about how traffic cops have elicited bribes from them. From a taxi driver to an office worker, everyone seems to have their own accounts of police bribery. But another narrative has emerged in which the people too are blame for condoning corruption by agreeing to bribe officers on the spot out of fear of going through the hassle of paying fines. \u201cIt is just too accepted as \u2018the Vietnamese way\u2019,\u201d said Dennis McCornac, a professor of economics at Loyola University in Baltimore (Maryland) who lived and worked in Vietnam in the 1990s. \u201cRight now, the attitude about corruption is still \u2018this is Vietnam\u2019. Until there is a change in the mentality of the population and all levels commit to reducing corruption, the problem will persist,\u201d he said. VnExpress International spoke to nearly a dozen people about their encounters with traffic cops. Some said the main priority for traffic police is to \"trap and fine\u201d rather than regulate and direct traffic; but most said they deserved to be pulled over. \u201cFrankly, there are still many Vietnamese drivers in frequent breach of traffic rules,\u201d Bui Quang Huy, a taxi driver, said. \u201cThere's no way of understanding the police's job until you're in their shoes.\u201d But still, the onus is on the police to initiate change, analysts say. \u201cVietnamese society is changing faster than police culture nurtured for decades by the Ministry of Public Security,\u201d Carl Thayer, a longtime Vietnam analyst in Australia, said, referring to the government agency that manages the police force across the country. \u201cPublic scrutiny would act as an independent check on the powers of the ministry whereas the ministry operates from a culture of relative impunity,\u201d Thayer said. The bottom line is the ministry should work to \u201cchange its culture from impunity against the public to working with the public to ensure fair law and order,\u201d he said.

Photo by AFP/Goh Chai Hin Indonesia is becoming the next tech hub in Southeast Asia. Big-name investors including Expedia and Alibaba are pumping billions of dollars into Indonesian tech start-ups in a bid to capitalise on the country\u2019s burgeoning digital economy and potential as Southeast Asia\u2019s largest online market. Indonesia has seen a surge of cash into its technology sector over the past two years, helping support dozens of homegrown start-ups ranging from ride hailing apps to e-commerce firms. And with a population of more than 250 million, a swelling middle class and growing availability of cheap mobile devices, firms from across the world are piling in. \"We believe that Indonesia is poised for a huge leap forward for its digital economy, following China's growth and becoming the leading tech destination in the Southeast Asia region,\" Adrian Li, a partner in Jakarta-based Convergence Ventures, told AFP . Last year $631 million in disclosed venture capital was ploughed into the country, according to research firm CB Insights, up from $31 million in 2015. But that figure has already been shattered in 2017, with $3 billion worth of deals clinched as of September 2017, said Meghna Rao, a tech industry analyst at the firm. Tokopedia -- a marketplace that allows users to set up online shops and handles transactions -- won $1.1 billion in capital from China\u2019s Alibaba in August. Motorbike on-demand service Go-Jek secured $1.2 billion from Chinese tech giants JD.com and Tencent Holdings in May, according to data from Crunchbase. In another sign of confidence, Koison became Indonesia's first e-commerce service to go public in October. \"While it's too soon to say that this investment is indicative of a larger pattern of Indonesian startups pulling in many big ticket investors, it is part of a growing clutch of mega-rounds,\" Rao said. A golden opportunity Internet use is growing faster in Southeast Asia than any other region in the world, with 124,000 users coming online every day over the next five years, according to a 2016 report from Google and Singapore\u2019s Temasek Holdings. By 2020 an estimated 480 million people are expected to be connected to the internet, up from 260 million in the region last year. Indonesia's mobile-first market will comprise more than half of Southeast Asia\u2019s e-commerce market by 2025, with an estimated value of $46 billion, the Google report said. \"When you do startup business in Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia, the cost, effort and time that you spend is almost even. But when you go to Indonesia (growth) is unlimited -- the market is so big,\" said Willson Cuaca, whose venture capital firm East Ventures specialises in early-stage investments. As a result, big names like US venture capitalist Sequoia Capital, Japan's Rakuten Ventures and travel company Expedia -- as well as Chinese tech giants -- have all made investments in the country. Navigating challenges Indonesian president Joko Widodo has been a vocal supporter of digital innovation, most notably in his plan to create 1,000 local tech start-ups worth $10 billion by 2020. But the sector still faces a number of challenges. A limited pool of engineering talent to draw from, low rates of internet penetration outside densely populated Java, bureaucratic delays, and poor quality infrastructure are all obstacles to growth. For e-commerce companies, the large number of \"unbanked\" Indonesians limits the scope of online transactions, and logistics problems make it hard to move goods. While young entrepreneurs and small businesses are flocking to co-working spaces springing up in major centres, it is a decidedly different scene in most parts of the country. Farid Naufal Aslam, the chief executive of Aruna, an e-commerce company that links fishermen to buyers, said navigating Indonesia's disparate communities is a challenge too. \"One of the biggest challenges faced is on social approach,\" Aslam, 23, said. \"Indonesia is a unique country with diverse communities and different customs in each region.\" Yet many venture capitalists and entrepreneurs remain optimistic. \"The window of opportunity is there,\" Cuaca said. \"As long as you can innovate and solve real problems using technology, you can be successful.\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "afp/goh chai hin indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adrian li", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "koison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willson cuaca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joko widodo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuaca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meghna rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farid naufal aslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aslam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "convergence ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sequoia capital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tencent holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "expedia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east ventures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cb insights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "temasek holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakuten ventures", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "indonesia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southeast asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jakarta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alibaba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malaysia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thailand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crunchbase", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aruna", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T06:00:05.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e569e26b23a48f761cbddcc60613f73f7a8c30f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nCubvwPmUV3qBUTcAZl_lmccEG.103VNuO25ly9R4_5h4f_VCUpTZxxVMjdIVum24jnHGJy9KRn.i2mgCGpfX3ELIFOspKYVP0PlOdxbUS3cDTUeOATD2H87_U0h1rZut", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "On Putin's birthday, opposition activists protest, call for him to quit", "title_full": "On Putin's birthday, opposition activists protest, call for him to quit", "published": "2017-10-09T05:42:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ivcdn.vnecdn.net/english/images/web/2017/10/09/on-putins-birthday-opposition-activists-protest-call-for-him-1507515841_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e569e26b23a48f761cbddcc60613f73f7a8c30f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nCubvwPmUV3qBUTcAZl_lmccEG.103VNuO25ly9R4_5h4f_VCUpTZxxVMjdIVum24jnHGJy9KRn.i2mgCGpfX3ELIFOspKYVP0PlOdxbUS3cDTUeOATD2H87_U0h1rZut", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T05:42:00.000+03:00", "title": "On Putin's birthday, opposition activists protest, call for him to quit", "text": "On Putin's birthday, opposition activists protest, call for him to quit By Reuters/Pascale Davies  October 9, 2017 | 09:42 am GMT+7 Police detain more than 200 opposition activists on Saturday for taking part in a wave of anti-Kremlin protests across Russia, according to a monitoring group.

An estimated 70,000 people thronged the streets outside a mausoleum in this town 300 kilometers (186 miles) east of the capital Havana which houses the remains of Guevara and of some of his former comrades. President Raul Castro, dressed in his general's uniform, was among those attending the ceremony in Santa Clara, which was the site of a December 1958 battle that finally sent Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista into exile. Raul Castro fought alongside Guevara during the Cuban revolution led by his brother Fidel Castro. The 39-year-old Guevara was captured and executed by a CIA-trained unit of the Bolivian army on October 9, 1967. This year's ceremony was the first in the absence of Fidel Castro, who died last year, and an excerpt from one of his speeches honoring Guevara was played for the crowd. The anniversary comes amid the dying gasps of other Latin American guerrilla movements such as the FARC in Colombia, which last year reached a peace deal with the government and recently disarmed. The 86-year-old Raul Castro took a back seat at Sunday's ceremony to Miguel Diaz-Canel, who is expected to replace him as president next year. 'Che is still here' File video via Reuters. Diaz-Canel, 57, denounced American \"imperialism\" in a speech and referred to increased tension in Cuba-US relations since Donald Trump became president. Cuba will \"never negotiate away its principles or give in to blackmail,\" he said. Elena Gonzalez, a 56-year-old textile worker, was among those who turned up at the crack of dawn to pay her respects to Guevara. \"Yes, we got up very early but it's worth it,\" she said. \"We're keeping his example alive and his legacy of independence and sovereignty for Latin America and the world.\" \"For me, Che is still here -- his life, his work, his example,\" said 79-year-old Luis Monteagudo, who fought alongside Guevara in the Congo and was wearing a white T-shirt with his picture. Che's remains were transferred from Bolivia to Cuba in 1997 and interred in a mausoleum here which features a large bronze statue of the guerrilla leader. Born in the Argentine city of Rosario, Guevara traveled across Latin America in 1952 and 1953 -- a road trip that was immortalized in the 2004 film \"The Motorcycle Diaries\" -- and was shocked to see the economic disparity in the region. It convinced him that violence was necessary to overturn Latin America's unjust social order. Spreading revolution His life changed dramatically when he met Fidel Castro in Mexico in 1955 and joined his guerrilla expedition to Cuba. In the early 1960s, Guevara worked with Castro to consolidate the revolution, supervising the repression of counter-revolutionaries, and even for a time heading the Central Bank and industry ministry. But his key motivation was to spread revolution elsewhere. In 1965, he bid farewell to Cuba in a letter to Castro in which he resigned his posts and wrote: \"Other nations of the world summon my modest efforts of assistance.\" After leading a group of Cuban revolutionaries fighting with Marxist guerrillas in the Congo, Guevara traveled to Bolivia in late 1966. Struggling with asthma, he led a small clutch of rebels in Bolivia for 11 months trying to spread revolution. But he was tracked, cornered and wounded in the mountains in a gun battle that wiped out most of his remaining forces. The Bolivian army and two Cuban-American Central Intelligence Agency agents captured him. He was executed in a schoolhouse in La Higuera the following day, October 9, 1967. The small revolution he had started in Bolivia died with him. Guevara remains omnipresent in Cuba, particularly visible in the iconic image of the bearded and beret-clad revolutionary that adorns posters and T-shirts the world over.

Photo by Reuters/Kevin Lamarque The White House priorities, if enacted, could result in the deportation of Dreamers' parents. U.S. President Donald Trump, who pledged to work with Democrats to protect \"Dreamers\" - young people brought illegally to the United States as children - called on Sunday for money to fund a border wall and thousands more immigration officers to be part of any deal. Trump's list of immigration \"principles,\" laid out in a document seen by Reuters , was a non-starter for Democrats, who are seeking a legislative fix for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that Trump ended last month. The proposal includes a crackdown on unaccompanied minors who enter the United States, many of them from Central America. The plan was delivered to leaders in Congress on Sunday evening. The White House wants the wish list to guide immigration reform in Congress and accompany a bill to replace DACA, an Obama-era program that protected nearly 800,000 \"Dreamers\" from deportation and also allowed them to secure work permits. \u201cThe administration can't be serious about compromise or helping the Dreamers if they begin with a list that is anathema to the Dreamers, to the immigrant community and to the vast majority of Americans,\" said House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cThe list includes the wall, which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations. If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so,\u201d they said in a statement The White House priorities, if enacted, could result in the deportation of Dreamers' parents. The proposals include a request for funds to hire 370 more immigration judges, 1,000 attorneys for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, 300 federal prosecutors and 10,000 additional ICE agents to enforce immigration laws. \"The president has made clear he wants Congress to act and pass responsible immigration reform in conjunction with any legislation related to DACA,\" said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters. Trump told Congress it had six months to come up with legislation to help Dreamers, who are a fraction of the 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, most of whom are Hispanic. The document calls for tighter standards for those seeking U.S. asylum, denial of federal grants to \"sanctuary cities\" that serve as refuges for illegal immigrants, and a requirement that employers use an electronic verification system known as \"E-Verify\" to keep illegal immigrants from securing jobs. Hard line Trump campaigned for president on a pledge to toughen immigration policies and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. He vowed repeatedly that Mexico would pay for the wall, but began prodding Congress earlier this year to approve funding. Mexico has said it will not pay for the wall. Trump's suggestion after a meeting with Schumer and Pelosi that wall funding would not have to be part of a DACA fix alarmed some of his supporters. A White House official told Reuters on Sunday the principles were a guide for the legislative process it hopes Republicans and Democrats will take up. \"Funding for the wall is a priority for the administration. Whether it is part of DACA or there is a different pathway to get it done, it will remain a priority,\" he said, adding it would be up to Trump to determine what was negotiable and what was not in a future deal. The official said the White House would be pushing for \"legal status\" for the Dreamer population but would not be advocating for citizenship. Republicans in Congress have introduced several bills that would include aspects of Trump\u2019s priorities, but many Democrats and immigration groups see the proposals as too harsh. The White House's wish list targets the flow of unaccompanied minors into the United States. It would require such children to be treated the same, regardless of their countries of origin \"so long as they are not victims of human trafficking and can be safely returned home or removed to safe third countries,\" the White House document said. It would also expand the list of \"inadmissible aliens\" to include members of gangs, those who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and former spouses and children of drug and human traffickers if they receive benefits from such behavior. Trump's White House has not been able to achieve a major legislative victory, casting doubt on the potential for a breakthrough on immigration reform, which Republican and Democratic presidents have tried before without success. Since Trump took office in January, his fellow Republicans have failed to repeal and replace former Democratic President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and a White House plan for tax reform needs more support.

Photo by VnExpress/Bao Ha An investigation is also underway into her claim that she paid $1.5 million for her parliamentary seat. Vietnam\u2019s top prosecutors called for a life sentence on Monday for a former legislator accused of cheating potential homebuyers out of VND377 billion ($16.6 million) through an unlicensed property project. Chau Thi Thu Nga, 52, who was a member of the legislative National Assembly, is on trial in Hanoi for swindling money from more than 500 people through a bogus apartment development. The Land and Housing Construction and Investment JSC (Housing Group), where Nga worked as chairwoman and general director, collected large deposits for the project in Hanoi\u2019s Cau Dien District between 2009 and 2013. Many prospective buyers filed complaints after seeing no work carried out for years, and a subsequent investigation found the project had never been licensed and that Nga had pocketed most of the money. Nga was arrested in January 2015. During the hearing, which is a week into its scheduled 18 days, Nga said she had used the money to pay her employees and business partners, buy company cars and invest in several projects, including several film productions. Investigators are still verifying her claims that she paid $1.5 million of the money to buy her seat on the national legislature. The court silenced her twice last week when she tried to raise the subject. Nine former company execs are also in the dock. Nguyen Van Tuan, former chairman and director of another Hanoi housing company which jointly invested in the project, was brought to trial in May last year but the court shelved the case pending a further investigation. The National Assembly has some 500 members, 90 percent of whom are Communist Party members. Arrests of serving lawmakers are rare. Before Nga, the two most recent arrests took place in 2005 and 2006.

Photo by VnExpress/Vo Thanh Rough seas and heavy rain are forecast for central and northern parts of the country over the next couple of days. A tropical depression with wind speeds of around 50 kilometers (31 miles) per hour is forecast to make landfall in Da Nang and surrounding areas along Vietnam\u2019s central coast on Monday night. The National Center for Hydrometeorological Forecasting said the depression is picking up speed and will hit Da Nang and neighboring Hue, Quang Tri and Quang Binh at around 7 p.m. More than 300 kilometers of coastline will be directly affected, and locals have been asked to watch out for thunderstorms and rough seas around major tourist attractions such as the Cham and Ly Son islands. Heavy downpours are forecast over the entire central region for a couple of days. Rainfall of 150-200 mm is likely to drench popular tourist destinations in Da Nang and Hue, as well as Vietnam\u2019s cave kingdom Quang Binh, according to weather forecasters. The depression, which will also bring rain to Hanoi and some northern provinces, is expected to continue on its course to Thailand where it will weaken. Da Nang, widely considered the third most important city in Vietnam after Hanoi and Saigon, will host the APEC Summit with world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping expected to attend next month. Vietnam has already suffered destructive stormy weather this year. Floods in northern Vietnam killed at least 26 people and washed away hundreds of homes in August before Typhoon Doksuri, the strongest to hit the country in years, killed at least eight people in the central region last month. Last year, tropical storms and flooding killed 264 people in Vietnam and caused damage worth ND40 trillion ($1.75 billion), nearly five times more than in 2015.

Photo by Reuters/Athit Perawongmetha Traces of the poison were found on clippings of Vietnamese suspect's fingernails and Indonesian suspect's clothes last week. The trial of two women accused of murdering the North Korean leader's half-brother moved Monday to a high-security Malaysian laboratory to view clothing worn by the defendants and contaminated by a nerve agent. The visit to the government lab near Kuala Lumpur came after a chemist last week testified there were traces of VX on the women's clothes. Raja Subramaniam's testimony was the first evidence directly linking the women to the poison used to kill Kim Jong-Nam as he waited at a crowded airport near the capital. Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, in their 20s, are accused of smearing VX on Kim's face in February in a hit that stunned the world. The women, who were arrested a few days after the killing and face death by hanging if convicted, have pleaded not guilty to murdering the estranged half-brother of Kim Jong-Un as he waited to board a flight to Macau. The defendants say they were duped into believing they were taking part in a prank for a reality TV show, and their lawyers blame North Korean agents for the assassination. On Monday the judge, prosecutors and defense lawyers headed to the laboratory along with Raja. A member of Aisyah's legal team put on a lab coat, mask and gloves and entered a room to examine clothes, nail clippings and blood samples, said Aisyah's lawyer Gooi Soon Seng. \"The whole process was to identify the exhibits,\" Gooi said. But he added that a blazer said in court to have been worn by Kim Jong-Nam and to be contaminated with VX was not shown to them. The trial was supposed to move back to Shah Alam High Court, near the capital, and resume in the afternoon. But it was postponed until Tuesday after Raja, who was due to be questioned by the defence, complained of feeling tired. The murder sparked a fierce row between Malaysia and North Korea, which is suspected of ordering the hit. Pyongyang denies the allegation.

Remittances to Saigon has continued to hit new highs with most of the money coming from Europe and the U.S. Photo by Reuters/Kham Most of the money was sent by Vietnamese people living in Europe and the U.S. Foreign remittances flowing into Saigon increased by 6 percent on-year during the first nine months of 2017 to $3.3 billion, according to the central bank. The HCMC branch of the State Bank of Vietnam said remittances to the southern metropolis had continued to hit new highs with most of the money coming from Europe and the U.S. Each month Vietnamese people residing abroad sent home from $375-$400 million, according to a branch representative. He estimated the city will rake in $5.7 billion in remittances this year. \u201cMore remittances are being invested in business operations rather than in property or savings as before,\u201d he added. Vietnam recorded $13.4 billion in overseas remittances last year, and was ranked ninth by the World Bank among the world\u2019s biggest beneficiaries of remittances. It was also third in Asia-Pacific after China and the Philippines. Remittances from overseas Vietnamese remain a key source of funding for the country's economy, equivalent to about 8-10 percent of gross domestic product. But some experts have warned that, with Federal Reserve officials in the U.S. tipped to raise interest rates and the tighter border controls imposed by the Trump administration , overseas Vietnamese in the U.S. may have fewer incentives to send money home.

Photo by VnExpress/Phuoc Tuan The drivers have sought to disrupt operations over the past month at a toll station that they say is in the wrong place. The Ministry of Transport has agreed to lower toll fees on a major road running through Bien Hoa Town in Dong Nai Province by 20 percent from next month, apparently bowing to pressure from drivers who have left to stone unturned to vent their indignation. The decision was made following a proposal by local authorities. The station was built to recoup an investment of VND1.5 trillion ($66 million) spent in 2014 to upgrade a 10-kilometer (6.2-mile) section of National Highway 1 and build a 12-kilometer bypass running around Bien Hoa, around 35 kilometers to the northeast of Saigon. Sitting before the junction of the bypass and the highway, it is scheduled to be in place for the next 10 years charging VND35,000-180,000 per vehicle. But drivers say the location of the station is unreasonable because many of them don't use the bypass and have to pay twice for using the same stretch of highway. To make themselves heard, drivers have been trying different tricks over the last month to disrupt operations at the toll station. They've ranged from using VND200 ($0.01) and VND500 notes (the smallest denomination in the country) to pay the toll fee, to driving slowly in a horizontal line into each lane of the toll station, creating a massive tailback behind them, or simply just parking up in front of the station to block access. Last Thursday, the situation descended into chaos and police were called in to clear up the mess. Locals said the congestion that day was the heaviest it had been in a month. The situation has been causing a headache for everyone involved, from the staff who have to spend more time counting the toll fees and local residents who have to sit in the gridlock, to passengers who are left stranded in the tailbacks and the drivers themselves, forcing Dong Nai authorities to step in and ask the ministry to cut the toll fee. In August, drivers also tried to disrupt operations at a station on National Highway 1 in the southern province of Tien Giang by paying with stacks of low denomination notes. Tien Giang authorities said they would propose cuts to the toll fee while the transport ministry would decide if the station should be moved. There are toll stations every 62 kilometers along the highway, according to a report released at a meeting of the legislative National Assembly last year. The standard distance set by the government is 70 kilometers.

Photo by Reuters/Philippe Wojazer Whoever wins out of the seven candidates will have to restore the relevance of a cash-trapped agency hobbled by regional rivalries. When Israel's envoy told UNESCO delegates last July that fixing the plumbing in his toilet was more important than their latest ruling, it highlighted how fractious geopolitics are paralyzing the workings of the agency. Whoever wins the race to replace Irina Bokova as head of the U.N.'s cultural and education body next week will have to try to restore the relevance of an agency born from the ashes of World War Two but increasingly hobbled by regional rivalries and a lack of money. Its triumphs include designating world heritage sites such as the Galapagos Islands and the historic tombs of Timbuktu - rebuilt by UNESCO after Islamist militants destroyed them. But in a sign of how toxic relations have become, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly last month that UNESCO was promoting \"fake history.\" Like Israel's plain-speaking envoy Carmel Shama Hacohen, Netanyahu was referring to UNESCO's designation of Hebron and the two adjoined shrines at its heart - the Jewish Tomb of the Patriarchs and the Muslim Ibrahimi Mosque - as a \"Palestinian World Heritage Site in Danger.\" Jews believe the Cave of the Patriarchs is where Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and their wives, are buried. Muslims, who, like Christians, also revere Abraham, built the Ibrahimi mosque, also known as the Sanctuary of Abraham, in the 14th century. Israeli-Palestinian hostilities, though, are only part of a minefield of contentious issues on which the U.N. body has to hand down rulings. Japan, for example, threatened to withhold its 2016 dues after UNESCO included documents submitted by China on the 1937 Nanjing Massacre in its \"Memory of the World\" program. UNESCO's struggles worsened in 2011, when the United States canceled its substantial budgetary contribution in protest at a decision to grant the Palestinians full membership. UNESCO has been forced to cut programs and freeze hiring. \"It's an organization that has been swept away from its mandate to become a sounding board for clashes that happen elsewhere, and that translates into political and financial hijacking,\" said a former European UNESCO ambassador. The Paris-based organization, which also promotes global education and supports press freedom, convenes its executive council on October 9 to begin voting on seven candidates. Azerbaijan, China, Egypt, France, Lebanon, Qatar and Vietnam have put forward candidates. There is no clear frontrunner. All the candidates have vowed a grassroots overhaul and pledged independence from their home nations. France and China, both permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, argue the agency needs \"strong leadership\", which can only come with the backing of a major power. Chinese candidate Qian Tang has almost 25 years experience at UNESCO. His bid fits into Beijing's soft power diplomacy, though Western capitals fret about China controlling an agency that shapes internet and media policy. Former French culture minister Audrey Azoulay carries the support of France's new young president, Emmanuel Macron. But the last minute French candidacy has drawn the ire of Arab states, notably Egypt, who believe it should be their turn. The Arab states face their own political tests. Their three entries underscore their own disunity, something the Egyptian hopeful Moushira Khattab has indicated stymie the Arab bid. The crisis engulfing Qatar and its Gulf Arab neighbours, who have called Doha a \"high level\" sponsor of terrorism, meanwhile may have hurt the chances of former Qatari culture minister Hamad bin Abdulaziz al-Kawari. The Vietnamese candidate, Assistant Foreign Minister Pham Sanh Chau, has 17 years experience at UNESCO. Pham Sanh Chau, Vietnam's candidate for UNESCO's general director, speaks at a conference at the agency in Paris. Photo by Vietnam News Agency Just last week, Vietnamese ambassador Duong Chi Dung, head of the Permanent Mission of Vietnam to the U.N. and other international organizations in Geneva, was selected to chair the World Intellectual Property Organization General Assembly at the organization during the 2018-2019 term. Experts have called these instances of Vietnamese involvement in large U.N. agencies as being representative of the country's soft power. \"We are moving out into the world,\" Nguyen Thi Hien, deputy head of the Vietnam National Institute of Culture and Arts Studies, was quoted by the government portal as saying Monday. \"The Vietnamese presence at these international agencies shows our equal footing with other countries, as well as our voice and leadership power,\" she said. Voting for the UNESCO post takes place over a maximum five rounds. If the two finalists are level, they draw lots.

Coming on the heels of a growing movement to take down statues commemorating the pro-slavery Confederate Army from the civil war, it's a question many US cities are now asking themselves. On Monday, crowds filled New York streets to recognize the so-called \"man who discovered America,\" even as he is increasingly denounced as embodying the genocide of indigenous Americans. Ruth Edelstein-Friedman watched from a folding camping chair while the traditional Columbus Day parade wound along a damp Fifth Avenue. \"We brought our children. We wanted them to see the parade and the statues and everything before they get rid of them,\" the retiree said. A government holiday in the United States, Columbus Day is named for the explorer, from what is now Italy, who landed in the present-day Bahamas in 1492. For Edelstein-Friedman and her husband Eduardo, who travelled specially from Miami, homages to Columbus could soon be a thing of the past. And the controversy has only escalated following the August clashes in Charlottesville, Virginia where a liberal protester was killed at a white supremacist rally seeking to prevent the removal of statue of General Robert E. Lee, who led the southern Confederacy during the 19th century American Civil War. However, no one has yet announced the end of the New York parade which, in good weather, draws more than a million spectators. It is as much a celebration of New York's powerful Italian-American community, which is represented at its highest levels by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo. Both men proudly marched in Monday's parade. President Donald Trump brushed aside criticism on Monday by describing the arrival of Columbus as \"a transformative event that undeniably and fundamentally changed the course of human history and set the stage for the development of our great nation.\" Unlike his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump cited no possible failings in the \"discovery\" of America. Dozens of US cities have already replaced Columbus Day with one honoring indigenous people, after a 1992 initiative from the leftist bastion of Berkeley, California. Over the past two years more than 50 cities across the country have followed. These include Los Angeles, the country's second-biggest city which voted in August to honor indigenous people and not the explorer. New York's parade continues but, even there, the fate of its Columbus statues is uncertain. One was erected in 1892 at the top of a 75-foot (23 meter) column above Columbus Circle at the foot of Central Park. 'Genocide' or 'revisionism' Last month somebody vandalized another Columbus monument, smaller and in the center of the park. One of its hands was covered in red paint to protest the blood that the explorer had on his own hands, while graffiti on the plinth read: \"Hate will not be tolerated.\" On Monday a handful of protesters, who have arrived several times, gathered in front of the Columbus Circle statue to denounce \"genocide\" and \"slavery.\" Police now guard the statue daily. Petitions and counter-petitions circulate, while the debate continues on Twitter where some denounce Columbus and seek the removal of statues but others condemn \"the revisionism of history.\" An electric nationwide debate over symbols of racism followed the Charlottesville violence. Heather Heyer, 32, was killed and 19 others were injured when 20-year-old James Fields allegedly drove into a crowd of protestors. New York Mayor de Blasio in August named a commission to decide on the fate of controversial monuments. It will announce its decisions in early December, a month after the municipal election in which de Blasio hopes for a second mandate. Given this, some people like Laura Scheyer and her husband Steve Cohn see the New York parade as something to be preserved. The couple were spending several days in New York after arriving from Seattle, where Columbus Day is no longer celebrated. \"Every country has had problems with its history, where they suppressed people,\" Cohn said. The parade \"is people having fun, and we all deserve a little fun when you look at the world today, don't you think?\" Related News:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T05:28:52.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "05e47e70aa2f43859f229eb40d268cb9e87dafd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695n6T7q4gqKmlfE.u7BFYZ7QOAgOAVDhveifMmjpiXbPZ_zy64GTUnW.t518Ci9XjSZadNLVUqhb6AavfIbJTot0fNuQW1lCCZV2RBkJKsfrZdsLn3MB0df3V8X4sP65mD7f8j_WjkYbJqGSuAZn8VYfw--", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "Streep, Judi Dench slam Weinstein over sexual harassment claims", "title_full": "Streep, Judi Dench slam Weinstein over sexual harassment claims", "published": "2017-10-10T05:11:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/10/download6-1507601196-7338-1507601204_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1, "comments": 0, "shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "05e47e70aa2f43859f229eb40d268cb9e87dafd5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695n6T7q4gqKmlfE.u7BFYZ7QOAgOAVDhveifMmjpiXbPZ_zy64GTUnW.t518Ci9XjSZadNLVUqhb6AavfIbJTot0fNuQW1lCCZV2RBkJKsfrZdsLn3MB0df3V8X4sP65mD7f8j_WjkYbJqGSuAZn8VYfw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T05:11:00.000+03:00", "title": "Streep, Judi Dench slam Weinstein over sexual harassment claims", "text": "October 09, 2017 GMT+7 Streep, Judi Dench slam Weinstein over sexual harassment claims By Reuters/Jill Serjeant  October 10, 2017 | 09:11 am GMT+7 Actress Meryl Streep. Photo by Reuters Lucas Jackson His 'behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,' Streep said a statement. Meryl Streep and Judi Dench, two of Hollywood's most respected actresses, lashed out at movie producer Harvey Weinstein on Monday but said they were unaware of his decades of alleged sexual harassment of women. As Hollywood moved to distance itself from Weinstein, Streep said she had been appalled by the claims made against the film studio executive she once likened to \"God\" in a 2012 awards speech. His \"behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar,\" Streep said a statement. Britain's Dench, who won a supporting actress Oscar in 1999 for the Weinstein-produced film \"Shakespeare in Love,\" said in a statement she was \"completely unaware of these offences, which are of course horrifying.\" Stars like Streep and Dench, whose movies had been championed by Weinstein, have been under pressure to speak out after a New York Times investigation last week detailed claims by multiple women of unwanted physical contact by Weinstein over three decades. Weinstein, 65, initially apologized but later threatened to sue over the allegations uncovered by the newspaper. He has not been charged with any crimes but was fired on Sunday as co-chairman of the Weinstein amid fallout from the Times story. In a statement to the Huffington Post, Streep said she had been unaware of claims that Weinstein undressed in front of actresses and assistants and asked young women to give him massages. \"The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed,\" Streep said. Producer and director Kevin Smith said on Monday he regretted taking money from Weinstein's production company. \"He financed the first 14 years of my career - and now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain. It makes me feel ashamed,\" Smith, known for the comedies \"Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back\" and \"Clerks,\" wrote on Twitter. Film producer Harvey Weinstein attends the 2016 amfAR New York Gala at Cipriani Wall Street in Manhattan, New York February 10, 2016. Photo by Reuters/Andrew Kelly. Actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan have said Weinstein sexually harassed them and movie director Judd Apatow and producer Megan Ellison are among those have spoken out in support of them. Weinstein is the latest U.S. media or entertainment industry titan to face sexual harassment accusations.

Photo by Reuters/Enrique Calvo More firms to consider moving headquarters outside Catalonia. Catalonia's secessionist leader faced increased pressure on Monday to abandon plans to declare independence from Spain, with France and Germany expressing support for the country's unity. The Madrid government, grappling with Spain's biggest political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981, said it would respond immediately to any such unilateral declaration. A week after a vote on independence which the government did its utmost to thwart, the tension also took its toll on the business climate of Spain's wealthiest region. Three more Catalonia-based companies joined a business exodus from the region that has gathered steam since the Oct. 1 referendum. Property group Inmobiliaria Colonial and infrastructure firm Abertis both decided to relocate their head offices to Madrid and telecoms firm Cellnex said it would do the same for as long as political uncertainty in Catalonia continued. Publishing house Grupo Planeta said it would move its registered office from Barcelona to Madrid if the Catalan parliament unilaterally declared independence. Spain's finance minister said it was the Catalan government's fault the companies were leaving. Regional leader Carles Puigdemont is due to address the regional parliament on Tuesday afternoon and Madrid is worried it will vote for a unilateral declaration of independence. Catalan officials say people voted overwhelmingly for secession in the Oct. 1 referendum, which had been declared illegal by the government. Some 900 people were injured on polling day when police fired rubber bullets and stormed crowds with truncheons to disrupt the voting. The issue has deeply divided the northeastern region as well as the Spanish nation. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated against breaking away in Barcelona at the weekend. They say the referendum did not show the true will of the region because those who want to stay in Spain mainly boycotted it. Buoyed by the show of support, Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamar\u00eda said on Monday: \"I'm calling on the sensible people in the Catalan government ... don't jump off the edge because you'll take the people with you.\" \"If there is a unilateral declaration of independence there will be decisions made to restore law and democracy,\" she told COPE radio station. Underlining conflicting pressures on Puigdemont, the small, anti-capitalist Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) party, which has an outsized influence on his government, said the outcome of the vote must be applied. \"We don't want to hold up the declaration of the Catalan republic,\" CUP lawmaker Benet Salellas told a news conference. European heavyweights Germany and France weighed in against a split. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy on Saturday, stressing her support for Spain's unity but encouraging dialogue, her spokesman said. France said it would not recognise Catalonia if the region unilaterally declared independence. If secession were recognised it would lead to Catalonia's automatic exit from the European Union, a French junior minister said. \"This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics,\" France's European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said. The European Union has shown no interest in an independent Catalonia, despite an appeal by Puigdemont for Brussels to mediate in the crisis.

Under Catalonia's referendum law, deemed unconstitutional by Madrid, a vote for independence in the assembly on Tuesday would start a six-month process envisaging divorce talks with Spain before regional elections and a final act of separation. Rajoy gained some political cover on Monday for the so-called \"nuclear option\" of removing Catalonia's government and calling new regional elections. Opposition Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez said he would \"support the response of the rule of law in the face of any attempt to break social harmony\", but stopped short of explicitly saying his party would back dissolving the regional parliament. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau advised Puigdemont against proclaiming independence on the basis of the referendum results and she urged Rajoy to rule out suspending Catalonia's autonomy. Losing Catalonia, which has its own language and culture, would deprive Spain of a fifth of its economic output and more than a quarter of exports. The crisis has reopened old divisions in a nation where the right-wing dictatorship of General Francisco Franco is a living memory easily revived by strong displays of nationalism. A spokesman for the ruling People's Party (PP) invoked the memory of former Catalan leader Lluis Companys, who was arrested for declaring independence in 1934 and later executed. \"We hope they don't declare anything tomorrow, because anyone doing so might end up like him 83 years ago, in prison,\" Pablo Casado told a news conference in Madrid. Many moderate Spaniards, including in Catalonia, oppose a breakaway. Regional authorities say about 90 percent of votes in the referendum were for secession, but turnout was only 43 percent. Sunday's anti-independence demonstration helped calm financial markets, as did credit rating agencies Moody's and DBRS which said they expected Spain to remain united. Spanish borrowing costs fell to a one-week low and the main share index touched a week high. Puigdemont appeared resolute on Sunday, saying the referendum law called for a declaration of independence in the event of a \"yes\" vote. \"We will apply what the law says,\" he told TV3. Catalonia's High Court asked for more security, specifically drafting in the national police, who were called in to stop the referendum when the Catalan police force failed to act. Puigdemont said on Sunday he had not been in contact with the Madrid government for some time because it refused to discuss independence. \"What is happening in Catalonia is real, whether they like it or not. Millions of people have voted, who want to decide. We have to talk about this,\" he said. Rajoy has said repeatedly he will not talk to the Catalan leaders unless they drop their plans to declare independence.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "reuters/sam edwards", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariano rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ada colau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abertis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nathalie loiseau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soraya saenz de santamar\u00eda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benet salellas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/enrique calvo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francisco franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pablo casado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carles puigdemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puigdemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lluis companys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose el\u00edas rodr\u00edguez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cellnex", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dbrs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grupo planeta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opposition socialist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catalan civil society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "inmobiliaria colonial", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "people's party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/enrique calvo more", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moody's", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-10T05:29:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f089ea562c589050f53bd3c6fa44ad0515bbaf5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nUbbpTrrVlKNTWwMajvZrZqNUCwHJCLuVaVkpLHpV5NYIxIyNpofZ6uUsGTmGR0JX06Q0kXGhIkes.BitHgSiFrnDvOZdBBtIbJAli1K1oDpCKIsj001D72cmC71vo7H.tKzPH_a56LY-", "site_full": "e.vnexpress.net", "site": "vnexpress.net", "site_section": "http://vnexpress.net/rss/tin-moi-nhat.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Tin m\u1edbi nh\u1ea5t - VnExpress RSS", "title": "One in three Latin Americans have paid bribes to public employees, report says", "title_full": "One in three Latin Americans have paid bribes to public employees, report says", "published": "2017-10-10T04:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "VN", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://vcdn-english.vnecdn.net/2017/10/10/money26470571280-1507600197-5469-1507600281_680x0.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 776, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f089ea562c589050f53bd3c6fa44ad0515bbaf5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRw616SL1aSNp4iGThJ695nUbbpTrrVlKNTWwMajvZrZqNUCwHJCLuVaVkpLHpV5NYIxIyNpofZ6uUsGTmGR0JX06Q0kXGhIkes.BitHgSiFrnDvOZdBBtIbJAli1K1oDpCKIsj001D72cmC71vo7H.tKzPH_a56LY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-10T04:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "One in three Latin Americans have paid bribes to public employees, report says", "text": "October 08, 2017 GMT+7 One in three Latin Americans have paid bribes to public employees, report says By Thomson Reuters Foundation/Sophie Hares  October 10, 2017 | 08:52 am GMT+7 Most people in the region say corruption is on the rise, and those most likely to have paid off officials were residents of Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Roughly one in three people in Latin America paid a bribe last year to a public employee, from corrupt police to teachers and hospital workers, said a report released on Monday. Most people in the region say corruption is on the rise, and those most likely to have paid off officials were residents of Mexico and the Dominican Republic, said the study by Transparency International, a Berlin-based anti-corruption group. Using results of a survey conducted in 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries, Transparency International estimates more than 90 million people paid a bribe last year in the region. But due to the threat of violent retaliation, only one in 10 reported it to authorities, it said. \"Bribery represents a means for enrichment of the few, and a significant barrier to accessing key public services, particularly for the most vulnerable in society,\" said Jose Ugaz, chairman of Transparency International, in a statement. \"Governments must do more to root out corruption at all levels, especially in law enforcement agencies, which should play a key role in fighting impunity,\" he said. While people across the board paid bribes, poorer people were hit hardest because graft took a larger share of their incomes, the report said. In Mexico, 51 percent of people said they had to pay a bribe over the last year, followed by 46 percent in the Dominican Republic and 39 percent in Peru, it found. About 60 percent of people surveyed said they thought corruption had risen over the last year. In Brazil, rocked by the \"Car Wash\" scandal that uncovered billions of dollars in bribes paid to politicians and state-run enterprises for lucrative contracts, more than three-quarters of people thought corruption was increasing. Majorities in Venezuela, Chile and Peru also said corruption is on the rise, it found. Police and politicians ranked as the most corrupt officials by nearly half of those surveyed. Three-quarters of Venezuelans said their police are highly corrupt, as did nearly 70 percent of Paraguayans surveyed. One in five people said they paid bribes to workers in hospitals and schools, the sectors seen as the biggest bribe risks, while payoffs to court officials were highest in Venezuela and Honduras, said the report. More than half of those surveyed said their governments were doing poorly in the fight against corruption. To address the issue, developing more government systems online would help by reducing the amount of direct contact people have with officials, the report said. Also, clearly displaying fees and streamlining processes to keep officials from making discretionary decisions may stop them from demanding bribes, it said. Protecting whistleblowers and eliminating immunity from prosecution for politicians would help as well, it said.

Google has discovered Russian operatives spent tens of thousands of dollars on ads on its YouTube, Gmail and Google Search products in an effort to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a person briefed on the company's probe told Reuters on Monday. The ads do not appear to be from the same Kremlin-affiliated entity that bought ads on Facebook Inc, but may indicate a broader Russian online disinformation effort, according to the source, who was not authorized to discuss details of the confidential investigation by Alphabet Inc's Google. Microsoft Corp said separately on Monday that it was looking at whether Russians bought U.S. election ads on its Bing search engine or other Microsoft-owned products and platforms. A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment further. The revelation about Google is likely to fuel further scrutiny of the role that Silicon Valley technology giants may have unwittingly played during last year's election. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow's goal was to help elect Donald Trump. Google has uncovered less than $100,000 in ad spending potentially linked to Russian actors, the source said.

Both Twitter Inc and Facebook recently detected and disclosed that suspected Russian operatives, working for a content farm known as the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg, Russia, used their platforms to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive in a bid to influence Americans before and after the November 2016 presidential election. The Internet Research Agency employ hundreds of so-called \"trolls\" who post pro-Kremlin content, much of it fake or discredited, under the guise of phony social media accounts that posed as American or European residents, according to lawmakers and researchers. Facebook announced last month it had unearthed $100,000 in spending by the Internet Research Agency and, under pressure from lawmakers, has pledged to be more transparent about how its ads are purchased and targeted. Google's review had been more robust than ones undertaken so far by Facebook or Twitter, the source said. Russia's ad purchases on Google were first reported by the Washington Post. Google did not deny the story, and in a statement pointed to its existing ad policies that limit political ad targeting and prohibit targeting based on race or religion. \"We are taking a deeper look to investigate attempts to abuse our systems, working with researchers and other companies, and will provide assistance to ongoing inquiries,\" a Google spokeswoman said on Monday. 'Destroy our democracy' Google, which runs the world's largest online advertising business, had largely evaded public or congressional scrutiny until now. On Sunday, the Daily Beast news website reported that the Kremlin recruited at least two black video bloggers to post clips on YouTube during the campaign. They posed as Black Lives Matter sympathizers who were sharply critical of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Though the videos were only viewed hundreds of times, they demonstrated for the first time that Russia allegedly deployed real people, not just fake online accounts or bots, to further spread propaganda. Congressional committees have launched multiple investigations into Russian interference, but concern about Silicon Valley's role has surged over the past month against the backdrop of a cascade of revelations about how Russia appears to have leveraged their platforms to spread propaganda. A study published on Monday by researchers with the Oxford Internet Institute, which is affiliated with the British university, found that current U.S. military personnel and veterans were targeted by disinformation campaigns on Twitter and Facebook over the past year by a nexus of pro-Kremlin, Russian-oriented sites, along with conspiracy theorists and European right-wing ideologues. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have said Russia intended to sow discord in the United States, spread propaganda and sway the election. Some Democrats plan to introduce legislation to require internet companies to disclose more information about political ad purchases on their platforms. \"If Vladimir Putin is using Facebook or Google or Twitter to, in effect, destroy our democracy, the American people should know about it,\" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Monday on MSNBC. Google officials have been invited to testify publicly about Russian attempts to use their platforms to influence the election before both the House and Senate intelligence committees on Nov. 1 alongside Facebook and Twitter. While Facebook and Twitter have confirmed plans to attend, Google has not.

Vietnam has asked Cambodia to provide favorable conditions and guarantee legal rights for ethnic Vietnamese living in the country after Cambodian authorities said they will revoke \u201cimproperly\u201d issued official documents from 70,000 individuals, mostly ethnic Vietnamese born in Cambodia. \u201cVietnam and Cambodia have traditional neighborly relations,\" Le Thi Thu Hang, Vietnam's foreign ministry spokesperson, said in a statement Monday. \"The ethnic Vietnamese community in Cambodia has had many contributions to the development of Cambodia and helped foster friendly ties between the two countries,\u201d she said. Vietnam hopes Cambodia will \u201ccontinue to provide favorable legal conditions and take appropriate measures to guarantee the legal and legitimate rights of ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia as outlined in a joint statement between the two countries and in accordance with Cambodian and international laws,\u201d Hang said. \u201cWe hope that while people are waiting for their legal documents to be completed, they will be able to maintain a stable life and continue contributing to Cambodia's socio-economic development, while consolidating and strengthening traditional friendly relations and the comprehensive partnership between the two countries,\u201d Hang added. Cambodia's Interior Ministry last Wednesday discussed a plan to revoke official documents from 70,000 individuals, mostly ethnic Vietnamese born in Cambodia, according to The Phnompenh Post . The documents are said to have been \u201cimproperly\u201d issued and mistakenly confer citizenship on \u201cimmigrants\u201d, the newspaper reported. Sok Phal, head of Cambodia's Immigration Department, said the individuals will be labeled as illegal migrants, but added that they will not be forcibly removed. They should contact local authorities to see whether they are entitled to immigrant status due to the amount of time they have lived in Cambodia. Many Vietnamese families live around Tonle Sap Lake in Cambodia. Most of them were born there after their grandfathers or fathers left southern Vietnam to seek refuge from the chaotic French colonization and the Vietnam War.

Photo by Reuters/Lee Jae-Won Leaving past politics aside, this year's Busan film festival is ready to kick off. Organisers of the Busan International Film Festival say they are confident they can cast off the politics that has overshadowed the influential event as its 22nd edition kicks off on Thursday. The annual festival, which has long championed independent Asian cinema, is determined to \"preserve its identity\" despite being embroiled in high drama of its own for the past three years, said founder Kim Dong-Ho. Kim, 80, was brought back to help run BIFF in 2015 after previous festival boss Lee Yong-kwan was charged with fraud and removed from his post. That scandal came after the festival decided in 2014 to stick with the screening of a contentious documentary despite pressure from Busan Mayor Suh Byung-Soo to withdraw it from the programme. The film in question, \"Diving Bell: The Truth Shall Not Sink With Sewol\", was critical of the South Korean government's handling of the Sewol ferry disaster that year which claimed around 300 lives. Government funding cuts followed and then boycotts by leading Korean cinema groups such as the Directors' Guild of Korea, which pointed a finger at political meddling. \"Although this year's festival is still facing unsolved problems, we are determined to encourage up-and-coming Asian directors, support new Asian films and further our role in the film industry,\" said Kim. Industry insiders had questioned whether BIFF could repair the damage to its reputation -- a point raised by festival staff earlier this year when they demanded Kim and festival director Kang Soo-Yeon resign over lack of action on the various troubles. The pair have since acquiesced to those demands and will hand over the reins at the end of this year's edition of the festival, which runs from October 12 to 21. Young talent Amid the turmoil, BIFF's programmers have still managed to line up around 300 films and 100 world premieres for this year's festival, which will open against a backdrop of unprecedented growth across Asian film markets. While Hollywood has suffered a summer that saw box office receipts drop by some 16 percent, a series of domestic hits has driven the Chinese market up by 10 percent, while South Korea is on target for a record 2017. BIFF has this year attracted international guests including two-time Oscar-winning filmmaker Oliver Stone, who will head the jury for the festival's main New Currents award for first- or second-time Asian directors. Fellow Hollywood A-lister Darren Aronofsky will also make an appearance as he tours the festival circuit with his horror \"Mother!\" and Hong Kong action maestro John Woo will bring his latest thriller \"Manhunt\" to the Korean port city. Other notables flying in from across the region include Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda and China's Jia Zhangke. BIFF opens Thursday with the premiere of Korean director Shin Su-Won's revenge thriller \"Glass Garden\". It will close with the historical drama \"Love Education\" from Taiwanese director Sylvia Chang \u2013- the first time female directors have book-ended the festival. Other highlights include the world premiere of Jeon Jae-Eun's \"Butterfly Sleep\" starring Japanese superstar Miho Nakayama, as well as a new award for rising Asian directors in memory of BIFF co-founder Kim Ji-Seok, who passed away while attending the Cannes festival in May. Rising Korean filmmakers will be showcased in the 27-film Korean Cinema Today section while this year's New Currents features 10 films representing Asian nations, with much interest surrounding the Chinese comedy \"One Night on the Wharf\" by acclaimed artist-turned-filmmaker Han Dong. There will be politics at play as always in the festival's Wide Angle documentary section with productions in competition including one that looks at the controversial THAAD missile defence deployment in South Korea -- the Park Baeil-directed \"Soseongri\". \"After some hard times we still believe that highlighting and focusing on young Korean and Asian talent, and discovering and supporting them, is what we do best and is the future for BIFF,\" said festival programmer Kim Young-Woo.

Photo by VnExpress/Le Hoang His family believed he had died in the war but he was actually stranded abroad for all that time. For days, Trinh Thi Hay's small house in Quang Xuong District, Thanh Hoa Province has been full of tears, joy and visitors. \u201cNothing can compare to the happiness you feel after finding your lost child. I never thought I'd see him again after all these years,\u201d Hay said. The 82-year-old woman was talking about her son, Nguyen Van Ke. Hay is a mother of seven, and Ke is her middle son. In April 1978, Ke left home to join the army and traveled to the south of the country to fight in the Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War, during which Vietnamese troops helped remove the Khmer Rouge from power in Cambodia. The war finally ended in 1989, and Ke\u2019s fellow soldiers returned to their homelands one after another, but there was no sign of him. \u201cMy son left without a letter, even a message,\u201d Hay recalled. She and her husband waited patiently for Ke to return, but five years later, their hopes came to a painful end when a notice of Ke's death arrived at their home: He had been recognized as a \u201cmissing martyr.\" Nguyen Van Ke cleans a photo of his father on the family altar. Photo by VnExpress/Le Hoang Swallowing the sorrow of losing a child, Hay lived on, carrying a dream of bringing home what was left of her son and giving him a proper funeral. That was also her husband's last wish before he died, b ut her family could not afford the expense of searching for him. Ke's fate became painful to talk about, and for years the only memory of him was a photo placed behind a bowl of incense on the family\u2019s altar alongside a martyr's certificate from the authorities. But, as they say: \"Life is always full of surprises.\" In late September, photos and stories of Ke, alive and well in Thailand, appeared on Facebook. A Vietnamese northerner who was visiting Thailand on business had met Ke and listened to the incredible story of how he had left his home in Thanh Hoa decades ago and become stuck in Thailand, all alone. The man posted the story on Facebook to help Ke, and after being shared by many users, it reached Ke\u2019s family a few days later. With help from many people, the war veteran returned home early this month to the joyful tears of his family and neighbors. Vietnam is among Facebook\u2019s top 10 countries by users. The country now boasts more than 52 million active accounts to advertisers, Reuters has reported, citing social media agencies We Are Social and Hootsuite. Sitting in his home, Ke tells of how he contracted malaria on the battlefield and was sent to a medical camp. According to him, the Khmer Rouge attacked his unit while he was still undergoing treatment. He and his comrades were captured and taken to Cambodia, but he managed to escape. With nothing but the clothes on his back, Ke drifted from Cambodia to Thailand, homeless, nameless and jobless. He survived by collecting scraps and selling them for money. \u201cI slept under a bridge and rarely had a full meal. I wanted to go home but there was no way out. My life was separated from the outside world,\u201d Ke said. Nguyen Van Ke is finally home. Photo by VnExpress/Le Hoang Now he\u2019s back in the arms of his loved ones, and has almost lost his voice from retelling his adventures to the hordes of visitors who have been visiting him. \u201cMany people ask me if I remember who they are but I can\u2019t. They have changed so much over that many years. They have to recall old stories so that I remember them,\u201d he said.

Vietnam\u2019s commercial center Saigon has enjoyed a vibrant year so far with business openings and registered capital both recording strong growth in the first nine months. Figures from the city's government show that business openings between January and September increased 13 percent from a year ago to around 30,000, while newly registered capital went up a staggering 85 percent to VND400 trillion (nearly $18 billion) during the period. The real estate sector continued to lead the way, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the capital. According to property consultants Savills, 5 percent of the new businesses that have opened in the city this year are foreign. Nearly a quarter of the 83,500 foreigners working in Vietnam live in Saigon, making it the country\u2019s biggest expat hub. The megacity also attracted $3.74 billion worth of FDI pledges in the first nine months, a 63 percent increase from a year ago and more than any other province or city in the country.

Confidence among Vietnamese consumers has fallen slightly since last year, but that has not stopped them from being among the most optimisitc in the region, a new survey has found. Photo by Reuters/Kham Vietnam scored 90.8 compared to the regional average of 66.9 in Mastercard's latest consumer confidence index. Confidence among Vietnamese consumers has fallen slightly since last year, but that has not stopped them from being among the most optimistic in the region, a new survey has found. The Mastercard Consumer Confidence Index released last week ranked Vietnam second in Asia Pacific after Cambodia. The survey asked 9,153 adults from 18 Asia Pacific markets to give a six-month outlook on five economic factors \u2013 the economy, employment prospects, regular income prospects, stock market and quality of life. Vietnam's score of 90.8, compared to the regional average of 66.9, was 1.5 points down from the previous survey, but still in \u201cextremely optimistic\u201d territory, the survey found. Its consumers are most positive about the overall economy and regular income, although there's been a slight dip in their outlook regarding quality of life. The index is calculated on a scale of 0 to 100, putting 11 markets in the \" optimistic\u201d territory . Consumers in Taiwan and Sri Lanka fell into the \"pessimistic\" group, scoring below 40, while their peers in big economies such as Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan fell into the \"neutral\" category. South Korea recorded the largest improvement in the ranking with optimism at its highest level since 1995. Heightened expectations in its economic performance and presidential elections in May have given a \u201cmeteoric leap\u201d driving the sentiment from pessimistic to very optimistic in six months, the U.S. payment technology company said in a press release. The Mastercard survey began in 1993 and is conducted twice a year. In February, a Nielsen survey of online consumers in 63 economies named Vietnam the fifth most optimistic nation in the world, after India, the Philippines, the U.S. and Indonesia. Vietnam\u2019s growing middle class population with rising disposable incomes and the country\u2019s stable economic outlook remain the main drivers for its ranking, Nguyen Huong Quynh, Nielson's managing director in Vietnam, said in a statement. The country\u2019s economic prospects have also worked their charms on expats. A HSBC survey last month found half of the foreigners working and living in Vietnam agree that the country is a good place to progress their careers and two-thirds feel confident in the economy. Vietnam\u2019s economy has been one of the best performers in the region in recent years, fueled largely by exports in the FDI sector. Expansion of 7.46 percent in third quarter, the strongest third quarter growth since 2010, has strengthened the country\u2019s hopes of achieving its ambitious growth target of 6.7 percent this year.

Photo by Reuters/Tyrone Siu Taiwan leader vows to defend democratic rights and freedom while China considers self-ruled Taiwan a wayward province. Leader Tsai Ing-wen vowed on Tuesday to defend Taiwan's freedom and democracy amid growing pressure from giant neighbour China, using a National Day speech to warn that the self-ruled island would not bow to pressure. China considers proudly democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Relations with Beijing have deteriorated sharply since Tsai, who leads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year, with China suspecting she wants to push for the island's formal independence, a red line for Beijing. China has cut off a regular dialogue mechanism with Taiwan, ramped up military drills around the island and stepped up international pressure to limit Taiwan's diplomatic footprint. Tsai, who has pledged to maintain peace with China, said her government was still seeking breakthroughs in ties with Beijing and promised consistent and stable policies. \"We need to remember democracy and freedom were rights obtained through all of Taiwan people's countless efforts,\" Tsai said. \"Therefore, we need to use all our power to defend Taiwan's democratic and freedom values and lifestyle,\" she said.

Photo by Reuters/Tyrone Siu Tsai's speech came a week before China holds its twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, where President Xi Jinping, who has taken a robust approach to territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas, will cement his grip on power. Her government has continued to rattle Beijing, with her newly appointed premier, William Lai, telling parliament last month he was a \"political worker who advocates Taiwan independence\". However, Tsai has also sought to give Beijing a roadmap where its \"goodwill\" can be extended, which in turn could give her a chance to reciprocate and rein in the more independence-leaning hardliners on the island. \"We have offered our greatest goodwill,\" she said in her 20-minute address. \"I have repeatedly said, our goodwill doesn't change, our promises don't change; we won't walk on the old path of confrontation, but we won't bow to pressure,\" Tsai said. Tsai reiterated the importance of implementing the island's new \"southbound\" policy of forging closer ties with countries in the region, saying Taiwan was seeking to find a new position in the international community. Taiwan has stepped up efforts to reduce its reliance on China and broaden engagement with 18 countries across the region under the policy, seeking to deepen economic and political ties. \"In the face of rapid change in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan is already prepared to play an even more important role in the region's prosperity and stability,\" she said.

Tokyo's popular governor Yuriko Koike launched a bitter attack on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Tuesday as the gloves came off for the official start of a snap election campaign in the world's third-largest economy. Conservative premier Abe, 63, is facing an unexpected and fierce challenge from the media-savvy Koike, who has upended the sleepy world of Japanese politics with her upstart \"Party of Hope.\" Addressing hundreds of commuters at a busy Tokyo station via loudspeaker, Koike called on supporters to \"end the politics of Abe,\" lashing out at the long-serving premier over recent scandals that have weighed on his popularity. \"The political status quo has continued while politics itself has lost the public's confidence,\" charged the former TV anchorwoman, 65. Abe cut a contrasting figure by kicking off his offensive in the bucolic farming country of Fukushima, signalling his commitment to rebuilding the region hard hit by the 2011 nuclear power plant meltdown. He pledged a major expansion of social programmes, including offering free early-childhood education in a bid to get more women into work, while also talking tough on North Korea. In an obvious dig at Koike, he urged voters to consider his policies, rather than catchy soundbites. \"Boom and slogans do not open the way to the future. Policies unlock the future. We must not lose,\" he said. The 12-day campaign will be fought around reviving Japan's once world-beating economy and the ever-present threat of North Korea which has threatened to \"sink\" the country into the sea. Koike's \"Party of Hope\" has swallowed up and replaced most of the main opposition party in the space of a week, transforming Japan's staid political landscape. But surveys suggest her bandwagon is grinding to a halt as she refuses to run herself for PM in the election, focusing on running the world's most populous city with three years until Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games. A poll in the top-selling Yomiuri daily suggested that 32 percent of voters plan to vote for Abe's conservative LDP with 13 percent for the Party of Hope -- down six percentage points from the previous poll in late September.

Photo by AFP/Kazuhiro Nogi Abe is seeking a fresh term at the helm of the Asian economic powerhouse and key US regional ally and unexpectedly called a snap election to capitalise on a weak and fractured opposition. But Koike stole his limelight by launching her party, attacking Abe's government for being too slow to reform the country, weighed down by an ageing population, deflation and a huge debt mountain. Abe's trademark \"Abenomics\" policy -- a vow to kick deflation and achieve two-percent inflation with stable growth -- has largely fallen flat. Critics argue that Abe called the early election to divert attention from a string of scandals, including allegations of favouritism to a friend in a business deal -- which the premier strongly denies. And analysts say the October 22 vote is effectively a referendum on Abe, who has enjoyed unrivalled political strength for the past five years in part because of a lack of credible opposition, while his key policies remained controversial or unpopular. For her part, Koike says her new group promotes \"compassionate conservatism\" and hopes to distinguish herself from Abe by pledging a phase-out of nuclear power by 2030 and a freeze on a planned sales tax hike. Koike sceptics, however, charge that she repeats vague, catchy phrases and lacks details including how to pay for her ambitious projects. Rival conservative blocs More than 1,000 candidates were expected to run for 465 seats in the all-powerful lower house -- a reduction of 10 seats from the previous election. The outcome could create two rival conservative blocs with broadly similar diplomatic and defence policies, with fragmented leftist forces filling the gap, pundits say. Before the campaign kicked off, Abe's ruling bloc held a two-thirds majority, with his long-ruling LDP holding 287 seats while its junior partner Komeito has 35. Abe has said he would step down if his coalition fails to win a simple majority but few analysts see that as a likely scenario, especially as Koike's party is only putting up 235 candidates.
