When she comes on the line from Toronto, I ask if she\u2019s watching real-time reactions on the comments thread. Alvvays: Antisocialites review \u2013 alluring, nuanced jangle pop Read more \n\u201cI learned very early on that it\u2019s not good to read that stuff,\u201d Rankin says cheerfully. \u201cI\u2019ll probably go for a long walk for a few hours today and then come back and see if there\u2019s been any disaster.\u201d I read a few of the responses out nonetheless: \u201cThis is fricking amazing\u201d; \u201cTotally 80s and totally awesome\u201d; \u201cMolly so cute.\u201d YouTube\u2019s little thumbs-up icon has already been clicked hundreds of times. \u201cThings are always good early on,\u201d Rankin deadpans. \nThe Alvvays singer, guitarist and songwriter isn\u2019t exactly a paragon of self-assurance, but she has every reason to feel upbeat as they prepare to release their second album, Antisocialites . The making of their self-titled debut album was long and precarious \u2013 Rankin had to pay for it to be mastered with waitressing money \u2013 and it took time to find its way into people\u2019s affections after cassette copies were tentatively circulated, eventually getting a full release in 2014. Thanks to intoxicating, swooning songs such as Archie, Marry Me, the album made several critics\u2019 end-of-year lists and sent Alvvays out touring the world for two years solid. Molly Rankin of Alvvays. \nAntisocialites is a jangling bubblegum riot recalling Scottish indie-pop like the Vaselines and Camera Obscura. Rankin has a voice so sweet and yearning she could sing you a prison sentence and still make it sound dreamy. Her steady blossoming as a songwriter is particularly admirable when you consider how a tragedy in Rankin\u2019s youth could quite easily have turned her away from music forever. \nAll five members of the band hail from remote islands in northern Nova Scotia; Rankin is the daughter of John Morris Rankin, a fiddler with the Celtic folk family collective the Rankin Family. In the 1990s they sold 2m records, scooped armfuls of awards including six Junos and were credited with sparking a North American renaissance of Celtic music and culture. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy \u2013 the places they resonated in are still revealing themselves to me,\u201d says Molly of her father\u2019s band\u2019s successes, which all occurred while she was still very young. \u201cPeople come up to me when we\u2019re in Europe and talk to me about them. There was one guy who showed up at one of our shows with a binder full of pictures of my dad playing fiddle.\u201d \nNear dawn on a Sunday in January 2000, John Rankin was driving Molly\u2019s older brother Michael and two of his friends to a hockey match when he skidded off the road, sending his truck plunging off a 75-foot high cliff into a cove . The teenagers managed to break a window and swim to safety. John Rankin didn\u2019t make it back to shore alive. Molly was 12, and lost not only her father, but also, as a promising young fiddler herself, her mentor. \u201cAt the time of his passing I was really growing as a fiddle player, and afterwards there was this sign of life through me and through my playing that everyone noticed,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt was bringing everyone such hope in that time. But it was also a lot for me. I felt like I wasn\u2019t at the stage where I had my own style; I was just trying to retrace his steps, and that became fairly exhausting.\u201d \nAt 19, she has mastered the fiddle \u2013 \u201cone of the hardest instruments\u201d to play \u2013 sufficiently to perform a tribute to her father as part of a Rankin Family reunion tour in 2007. By then her musical interests were already shifting, particularly after she met Alec O\u2019Hanley, with whom she is romantically and professionally involved. Now playing guitar alongside her in Alvvays, he switched her on to indie rock, including Teenage Fanclub, a band she describes as \u201ca door\u201d. \n\u201cAlec gave me, I think, two copies of Bandwagonesque \u2013 one for the car and one for the apartment,\u201d she says. Rankin sent him demos of some songs she\u2019d been working on. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like them,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cHe was the first person to say, \u2018I think you can do better\u2019.\u201d \nTheir relationship has been rocky at times, and Rankin has gone as far to describe the new album as \u201ca fantasy breakup arc\u201d, where \u201clife nearly imitated art\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been sort of pulling each other over mountains for the last few years,\u201d she admits. \nShe has also had to face down pressure put on her by people in the music industry, and herself, to be a more extroverted band leader, with the title Antisocialites nodding to Rankin\u2019s resistance. \u201cWhen we were starting out, there was some expectation that I would be a certain type of frontperson, that I would develop into someone very charismatic and comfortable \u2013 and that\u2019s never really happened,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut it\u2019s not really the school I come from. I don\u2019t like to really rock out on stage or have some kind of strange rock persona. Over time, I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019m allowed to be just this reserved, awkward human.\u201d \nBefore leaving Rankin to her long walk, I have to ask: what would her father would have made of Alvvays? \n\u201cSomething that he always instilled in me was that if you\u2019re not going to do something 100% then don\u2019t even bother. That is definitely in the back of my mind constantly. So I\u2019m sure I would be an academic or something if he were still alive,\u201d she laughs. \u201cOr he would be there yelling, \u2018Tune the guitar!\u2019\u201d Antisocialites is out now on Transgressive. Alvvays tour the UK in February.

Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA Construction industry UK construction in contraction for first time since Brexit vote aftermath \nSeptember PMI records negative growth for first time in more than a year following a sustained drop in new work View more sharing options Tuesday 3 October 2017 11.26 BST Last modified on Tuesday 3 October 2017 22.00 BST \nBritain\u2019s construction industry has contracted for the first time since the immediate aftermath of the Brexit vote, as rising political uncertainty leads to a sustained drop in new work. \nSeptember data revealed a difficult month for building companies, as new projects failed to materialise to replenish jobs planned before the referendum. The drop in workload was attributed to fragile confidence and subdued appetite for risk, especially in the commercial building sector. \nThe headline reading on the Markit/CIPS UK construction PMI report (pdf) fell to 48.1 last month from 51.1 in August. That places the industry below the 50-point mark separating growth from contraction and misses a forecast of 51 by economists in a Reuters poll. Slowdown in UK manufacturing as weak pound raises costs Read more \nDuncan Brock of the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which helps to compile the survey of 170 companies in the construction industry, said: \u201cRespondents pointed to obstructive economic conditions and the Brexit blight of uncertainty , freezing clients into indecision over new projects.\u201d \nThe lower volumes of work reflect a marked decline for both commercial and civil engineering activity last month. Civil engineering activity experienced the steepest fall in almost four and a half years, with some companies reporting a lack of new work to replace completed contracts. \nHousebuilding was the only area to register any expansion last month, although the momentum was the slowest in six months amid worries over the immediate future for the housing market. \nThe figures will disappoint government ministers who have been pushing to end a chronic housing shortage. Theresa May, looking to woo younger voters at her party\u2019s conference in Manchester this week, announced a \u00a310bn expansion of the Tories\u2019 flagship help-to-buy scheme to provide loans to first-time buyers. \nConstruction companies will be looking to Philip Hammond\u2019s autumn budget next month for further support to offset the uncertainty created by Brexit. The survey showed business optimism fell to its second-lowest level since April 2013. \nSamuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the readings suggest the government\u2019s shift to a more accommodating stance in Brexit talks had \u201cdone little to convince builders that clients will sanction delayed projects soon\u201d. \nAlthough the construction industry accounts for only about 6.1% of total output, the weak readings suggest the sector could drag on GDP growth. The figures also follow a softer manufacturing survey for September \u2013 with both combining to suggest the British economy is faltering. \nBuilders saw a spike in costs linked to the weak pound, given a substantial amount of building components and materials are imported, with input costs rising at the fastest pace for seven months in September. \nHoward Archer, the chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \u201cMuted economy activity and appreciable economic and political uncertainties threaten to be a highly challenging combination for the construction sector over the coming months.\u201d \nThe weak reading may discourage the Bank of England from hiking interest rates as early as next month, which would be the first rise in the cost of borrowing in more than a decade. Mark Carney suggested the Bank could raise the rate in the \u201ccoming months\u201d should the economy perform as hoped . \nThe pound dropped 0.2% against the dollar to $1.3249 after the release of the data, suggesting markets doubt Threadneedle Street will make the move any time soon. \nChris Beauchamp, the chief market analyst at IG, said the reading \u201cundoubtedly takes the shine off expectations for a UK rate hike later this year\u201d.

Sure you do. Cameron picked This Charming Man as a choice on Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs and in response Marr tweeted: \u201cDavid Cameron, stop saying that you like the Smiths, no you don\u2019t. I forbid you to like it.\u201d And that was just a young, cool, fag-smoking, festival-going remoaner with a tattooed wife and an expensive shed on wheels in his back garden . There are far worse Smiths fans than Cameron. One of them, for example, is Morrissey.\nI keep refreshing Marr\u2019s Twitter account to see when he\u2019s going to ban Morrissey from liking the Smiths. Perhaps you heard the latest. During a live set being broadcast on BBC 6 Music to promote his new album this week, Morrissey decided to veer away from traditionally appropriate crowd patter such as, \u201cThis is a new song,\u201d and \u201cWoo!\u201d to gravely discuss his views on the Ukip leadership contest . \u201cI was very surprised the other day \u2013 it was very interesting to me \u2013 to see Anne Marie Waters become the head of Ukip,\u201d he said, before adding: \u201cOh no, sorry, she didn\u2019t. The voting was rigged. Sorry, I forgot.\u201d\nMorrissey claims Ukip rigged leadership vote to stop anti-Islam activist Read more \nThe response? Silence. Absolute, world-swallowing silence from the crowd, all of whom seemed utterly mortified. They were supposed to be having a fun afternoon out, watching the singer from their favourite teenage band tear through some classics, and instead they found themselves being subjected to Bad Moz and His Suspect Politics. \u201cUkip\u201d just isn\u2019t a word with which to win over a 6 Music audience. \u201cI like secondhand corduroy jackets,\u201d yes. \u201cI miss the Soup Dragons,\u201d yes. Swivel-eyed conspiracy theories about far-right parties not electing a leader with a talent for being cruel to specific religions, less so.\nWe probably should have seen it coming. By yammering on about Ukip, Morrissey ensured that he made the news again. If he hadn\u2019t, what would have been the take-home reaction to the concert? \u201c Actor who plays Game of Thrones\u2019 Samwell Tarly seen at a gig \u201d? \u201cMore bad new songs from Morrissey\u201d? Probably.\nInstead, here\u2019s another firestorm that Morrissey can propel himself along with, like when he called the Brexit result \u201cmagnificent\u201d or when he said: \u201cI like Nigel Farage a great deal,\u201d or when he called Chinese people a \u201csubspecies\u201d . These outbursts are becoming so routine and so desperate that Morrissey is seemingly only a couple of bad decisions away from turning up to the Conservative party conference in a wedding dress .\nThe result of all this is that Morrissey is making it harder and harder to enjoy the Smiths. There\u2019s a theory in television of the \u201cbad fan\u201d; typically a male viewer who is so protective, exclusionary and abusive to other fans that he ends up tarring the experience for everybody . Morrissey is becoming his own bad fan. Everyone else in the entire world just wants to hear wistful stories of romantic outsiders from him, but he insists on blurting out guff that couldn\u2019t be more at odds with the sensibility of anyone who grew up adoring him.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morrissey and Marr in 1987. Photograph: Eugene Adebari / Rex Features \nIt\u2019s got to the point that just reading the track list of his new album \u2013 including songs titles such as The Girl from Tel Aviv Who Wouldn\u2019t Kneel, Who Will Protect Us from the Police? and Israel \u2013 is enough to send your sphincter zooming up through your intestines and into your windpipe.\nSo it\u2019s little wonder that Morrissey has joined Twitter . As evidenced by the swirling, suffocating silence that met his Ukip crack this week, this might just mark the moment when Morrissey fans transition from their default he-always-gets-like-this-after-a-sherry stance of old to simply backing out altogether.\nIf Morrissey needs a new audience for his shtick, he\u2019ll certainly find it on Twitter, a realm brimming with eggs who live purely to encourage wrongheaded public idiots to keep telling it like it is. Twitter primarily functions as a way to remind you that every celebrity you\u2019ve ever liked is awful, so it\u2019s bound to play to all of Morrissey\u2019s strengths. Right now, his account is dedicated purely to impersonal album promotion, but he\u2019ll soon enough realise its potential for crackpot shrieking, and then we\u2019ll all be doomed. Morrissey on Twitter is an unexploded bomb.\nSo it\u2019s time for an intervention. Johnny Marr , protector of all that is right and good about the Smiths, we need you like never before. If you can banish Cameron to the wastelands, forcing him to salvage whatever meagre delights he can from the Mighty Lemon Drops, surely you can do the same to Morrissey.

So UK finances were in a precarious state when the crash struck.\n2000-10 saw the size of the state soar from 37% to 50% \u2013 a rise of 13 points. A faster rise than any other country, over any other postwar decade. Most of the damage was done by 2007, before the crash.\nBy the time Lehman Bros collapsed, Brown had already increased Britain\u2019s national debt by 43% to fund his expansion of the state. He was already running up massive deficits: there was no deficit in 2000/01 but Brown (and his lieutenants Balls and Miliband) were running up an indefensible boom-time deficit of 3% of GDP by 2005/6, the maximum allowed under EU rules.\nBrown\u2019s ruinous profligacy defied every rule in the book of financial management.

Thus factories, which had many benefits in terms of improved efficiency and production of the things we need to live, also concentrated wealth. Robots and AI will do so to an even greater extent. So what is the answer?\nIt would seem that the answer to greater concentration is greater diversification. Placing too many eggs in one basket has never been a good idea. And it's not just single corporations that should be considered baskets. One could consider privately owned corporations as a basket. Mass privatisation has placed far too many of our eggs - our means of production and wealth generation - in the single basket of corporations. In the same way, communism places all the eggs in the government basket.\nWe need a system that regulates diversification and thus guarantees an economy in which public, private, cooperative enterprises ranging in size from small to large supply our needs.

The City was deregulated, and the rest of the economy benefited from being linked to the EU. Unfortunately, this has led the extreme right of the Tory party to believe that it is somehow omnipotent in business, and rather than supporting British business, the EU is a straightjacket. The collapse of Monarch, the recent baning of Uber, the scandals in food retailing, all show that British management has learned nothing since the 1970s. It's still the same screw the employees, screw the customer approach. Just don't get found out.\nThe Tories always like to say they are the party of business.
