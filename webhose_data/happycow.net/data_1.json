I eat here all the time, so I figure it's about time to write a review. In all honesty, I hesitate to do this because the place is already getting very popular (crowded) and I'm afraid I have nothing but nice things to say. Nearly all the menu is vegan, so there is a wide range of choices. Most of the warm meals consist of a grain (usually brown rice or quinoa), a wide variety of fresh organic vegetables, some nuts or seeds, and some sort of sauce. You can get these either in a bowl or as a wrap, but I always get a bowl because you can fit more veggies in it (and they do!). I originally wasn't too keen on some of these warm dishes because the put more sauce on it then I would like (many won't mind this, but I prefer my food as unadulterated as possible -- let the veggies speak for themselves). Then I found that they were more than happy to go light on the sauce, or omit it entirely. The staff are very friendly and will do anything they can to help you make the most of your meal. My current favorite is \"The Innocent\", but I am also quite find of \"The Fool\" and \"The Lover\". They also have several meal-size salads, most of which come with one of two varieties of hummus: lemon-garlic or red-lentil. I highly recommend the red-lentil, it is low-fat, protein-rich, and very tasty. On the days that I get a salad, I generally alternate between \"The Explorer\" and \"The Sufi Poet\". There are also soups of the day, some of which are truly awesome (I love the black bean) so definitely take a look at these before you order. A cup of soup and one of their big salads makes a perfect meal. There are also \"warm cheesy wraps\" on the menu, but they aren't vegan (and even if they were I wouldn't be likely to order them, I'm not a big fan of vegan cheese), so I won't say anything about them. And they have an amazing juice bar which I keep meaning to try, but I haven't yet. The atmosphere is awesome -- full of plants and funky artwork. It has a great vibe and is a really cool place to just hang out. Unfortunately this (and the great food) have made it very popular and it can get crowded. I recommend avoiding the lunch hour rush -- go before noon or after 1:30. The only thing that would make Life Alive a more perfect place than it already is would be some homemade whole wheat bread (currently they don't offer bread of any sort, only the whole wheat tortillas they use for the wraps). \nPros: Great food, Great staff, Great atmosphere \nCons: Can be crowded, No bread ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "organic cafe - cambridge massachusetts vegetarian restaurant", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "life alive urban oasis", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "central square", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T06:46:46.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7578c2e5035cf8f70fe635b4e2c6304c75af906c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ZyaPy1bTX43mf1x5xT61KPVn_ru5i3FA1EX.mUZOHRnhj7yx2rbv7VbXqAT3mBnfg-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Churchill's Pub and Grille - San Marcos California Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Churchill's Pub and Grille - San Marcos California Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-05T07:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.559, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/38/51/hcmp38517_48753_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7578c2e5035cf8f70fe635b4e2c6304c75af906c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ZyaPy1bTX43mf1x5xT61KPVn_ru5i3FA1EX.mUZOHRnhj7yx2rbv7VbXqAT3mBnfg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T07:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Churchill's Pub and Grille - San Marcos California Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "Vegan options - Edit Posted by lesterville on 22 Nov 2016.

The hot sauce was tangy and the vegan ranch was tasty too. Some celery sticks would have been a welcome addition. The server was very friendly and told me the owner is vegan. He forgot to bring my beer so I got it for free. They were having a vegan brunch the next day which I was sad to miss. I recommend calling to see what vegan offerings they have that day.

I like this place, the food is great, affordable, right in the midst of Davao, the owners are super nice.

FTE is a small shop off a connecting road through Ashmore, which is easy to miss as you drive by - as my friend and i did on our first pass. They're situated to the side of the road, down a bank, so there's a good chance you'd never find them if not for a huge, hand painted vegan sign at the front of the shop. My friend spotted that as we went past, so we turned around and got it second time. We had three things off their non-pizza menu: 'fish' and chips, 'chicken' burger and onion rings. The 'fish' were tofu slices with a fish-like flavouring and had a really nice, crispy batter. The chips were also nice. My friend was a little alarmed by the 'chicken' burger, since she said it had the taste ad texture of the real thing, but she reconciled herself to that and enjoyed it. She also had the onion rings, which she was almost ecstatic about (she's an onion ring fan). I tried one, and it had a super crispy batter. The person who served us was chatty and friendly - full marks for service. There was a slow stream of people that turned up while we were there, so despite this place's obscure location, people are aware and willing to show up for the semi-industrial takeaway experience. \nPros: top notch fast food, friendly service, reasonable prices \nCons: very limited table seating, might be tricky to find, semi-industrial location ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T10:43:17.775+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d37fcff0d8e764059baf44d6a9ea468f13f1a0c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9aZEsXZpcuKWFrNo_gUgctCn5XlEQGbZIDOYJyXZGt3nu_GKFN2t5b0zC1dRzMjNMo-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Ayaso Concept Store Cafe - Marrakech Vegetarian Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Ayaso Concept Store Cafe - Marrakech Vegetarian Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-06T12:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.645, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/73/23/hcmp73233_149245_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d37fcff0d8e764059baf44d6a9ea468f13f1a0c6", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9aZEsXZpcuKWFrNo_gUgctCn5XlEQGbZIDOYJyXZGt3nu_GKFN2t5b0zC1dRzMjNMo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-06T12:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "Ayaso Concept Store Cafe - Marrakech Vegetarian Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "chia bowl was disappointing , green juice excellent - Edit Posted by Lemanieg on 06 Oct 2017.

As a vegan traveling to Mexico for the first time I was very skeptical about how well I would eat. On my first day we came across this gem in the heart of the city. and all I can say is I ate VERY well for the rest of my trip! Pom Comido is very modern and quirky, with interesting touches, Ike serving drinks in jam jars and beautifully hand written menus. Everything is vegetarian but almost all dishes can be adapted to vegan if requested. The first meal I tried was the veggie burger. Being a vegan and not eating cheese, the cheese in my burger was replaced with Tofu, which worked really well. It was served in a nice basket with crisps on the side. I also tried the \"Burritos\" I had mine with black beans and mushrooms with Tofu. again it was delicious! As for deserts I really wasn't expecting to be able to order one at all, but to my suprise there was at least 3- 4 vegan options. I had the vegan chocolate cookie. Here in the U.K. I actually bake professionally as a vegan, and I honestly could not have made this cookie better myself. It was amazing! The staff were nice and keen to help, despite some of them having limited English. They were very accommodating too. As I arrived in Mexico City from Cancun where everyone accepts dollars. I naively thought that this was the same for the whole of Mexico, but to my suprise. No. The owner manager? was very kind to exchange my $50 note for Pesos on the condition we changed it back with her the following day. This was very trusting of her and showed very good customer service. All I can say is that any Vegan or Veggie traveling to Mexico City much try Pan Comido. \nPros: Almost every dish can be made vegan, It's in a great central location, Food is delicious \nCons: No food marked as \"vegan\" , A lot of cheese is used ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ike", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pan comido", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vegetariano - tonala - mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mexico city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cancun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-07T04:26:05.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a520fd6c6bf985444b9c65a37dd099762fa76773", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ZACYT_nTuEMVPH0N7iSqhN5uDOq9Zya8pGsWGIKxSD.4V9nBkKnCBP5zPqIG_jtgE-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Frida's Mexican Beach House - Lahaina Hawaii Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Frida's Mexican Beach House - Lahaina Hawaii Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-07T08:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.491, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/10/23/hcmp102378_312439_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a520fd6c6bf985444b9c65a37dd099762fa76773", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ZACYT_nTuEMVPH0N7iSqhN5uDOq9Zya8pGsWGIKxSD.4V9nBkKnCBP5zPqIG_jtgE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-07T08:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Frida's Mexican Beach House - Lahaina Hawaii Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "1287 Front St , Lahaina , Hawaii , USA , 96761 Serves meat, vegan options available.

Unfriendly staff. - Edit Posted by TofuCelt on 17 Dec 2016. We were pleasantly surprised to see how good Poland was for vegan food. Unfortunately the friendliness of staff does not reflect the choice. Everywhere we went in Poland, we were met with the most unfriendly staff we've ever come across. Don't expect warm welcomes. This place, however, is slightly more friendly than the Mango Vegan on Zlota Street. This place was also bigger with more room for eating in, than the one on Zlota Street. This is definitely the better of the two Mango Vegan's that we ate in. However, it is more difficult to find it, but be patient. Although the food is the same in both places, this one is definitely a better place to eat in at. We never got to try the third place which, ironically, was nearer to where we stayed. Like Mango Vegan on Zlota Street, there is a decent selection on the menu. As we all preferred the Komoso 'cheese' burger the most on our visit to the Mango Vegan on Zlota Street, we all went for that again here. The burger itself is of average size, but the bun is well filled with extras - lettuce, onion, tomato, sauces, etc. It takes a big mouth to get your fangs around this bun burger. It is quite filling and the taste is nice. We also had a plate of four falafels on a plate of salad. Not the best, or worst, I've ever had, but they were a good size. Bigger than normal with a slightly above average taste. For a drink, we had a Hemp and Green smoothie. Both tasted nice but had a strange consistency to it. They didn't seem 'smoothed out' enough. Slightly below average I'd say. But at least they seemed very healthy. The cost was a fair price and the service quick. All in all, a good place to eat without having to worry if something is vegan or not. Unfortunately, it is almost all ruined by the lack of friendliness of staff.

I had such high hopes for this place. Inspired interior, unique aesthetic, and enticing vegan/gf options. I was so incredibly let down. Earlier in the day, a vegan friend of mine ordered a soy latte and was made sick by the dairy milk and heapings of sugar added to his order. Later that evening, excited by a generous and exciting selection of vegan and gluten free options, we decided to head there for dinner. The waiting staff were attentive. My mother ordered the \"chef's special\" seafood, which (and perhaps I didn't get the joke), was all imported canned fish. When the first of our 5 meals arrived, hard plastic was found in the pizza, and we received an apology and offer of a free drink. When the second lot of meals arrived, the first were well tucked into already. The pizza we received was presumed vegan when ordering as the menu description listed only vegan ingredients, and did not specify that it was a cheese-topped pizza. I passed it onto another attendee. We received the wrong salad (a vegan one was ordered and we received chorizo), and I had to bring this to the main counter to have amended. We were still waiting for my mother's order as the other meals were finished, so I decided to cancel it. Upon advising this, I learned her order hadn't been recorded at all. One of the staff offered to prepare her canned sardine meal for her then (all other meals were finished), on the house, and feeling embarrassed and put on the spot she quietly smiled an agreement. She didn't understand her order hadn't been taken in the first place, and thought it was just being served now. I approached the counter a second time to cancel it. Otherwise, the wait staff were conspicuously avoiding us at this point. We still paid the full price of nearly $90 for the experience and my mother, the most excited for the meal, left hungry. I would like to make a special mention however, of the bartender with the long hair donning the Led Zeppelin shirt, who listened attentively, and goodnaturedly acknowledged my disheartedness on both occasions I explained the situation. \nPros: Vibrant aesthetic / themed decor, Live music, Gluten free options \nCons: Disorganised staff, Disjointed food delivery, Lack of concern for attendee expense & experience ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "dark arts coffee academy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "zeppelin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-08T04:03:20.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3cf95f5a05f7996cc362d2bbb9edd856330a05d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ZtVbDESBcsWvGt1Sk0qv5B2AxSZfhj9vjijwWrSjhtqGgVCOfZrEKuh7vzm1_M6uE-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Rio Grande Mexican Restaurant - Frisco Colorado Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Rio Grande Mexican Restaurant - Frisco Colorado Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-08T03:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.728, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/76/55/hcmp76550_239816_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3cf95f5a05f7996cc362d2bbb9edd856330a05d0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ZtVbDESBcsWvGt1Sk0qv5B2AxSZfhj9vjijwWrSjhtqGgVCOfZrEKuh7vzm1_M6uE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-08T03:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Rio Grande Mexican Restaurant - Frisco Colorado Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "Fresh homemade food! - Edit Posted by Beckie on 08 Oct 2017.

I thought Sedona, being the land of vortexes and crystals, would have a plethora of veg dining options but I turned out to be mistaken. Enter the Whole Foods Market, which I believe took over a storefront called Natural Frontiers a few years ago. As noted in other reviews, Whole Foods does not have the best deli and salad bar selections, certainly nothing like what I am used to seeing at my local WFM. However, they do have an acceptable number of veg offerings and my kids enjoyed roaming through the cold and hot food bars and filling little containers. We visited the freezer section and stocked up on frozen entrees, and we bought groceries to prepare some of our own dinners, plus sandwiches and snacks for hikes. The produce section was a little disappointing but still adequate. We were on vacation and I really did NOT want to cook, but the dining options in Sedona were so limited we wound up visiting the WFM about four times in our five days there. My advice for anyone travelling through Sedona would be to get a room with a kitchen--even something with just a microwave--and keep this Whole Foods in mind. I actually got the idea to visit Sedona with my family because a cashier in my local WFM told me she had worked in the WFM in Sedona. So even though it is the lmost underwhelming WFM I have been in, if it had not existed our vacation would have been appreciably more miserable. And because I feel so grateful, I am awarding it four stars. \nPros: selection of vegan grocery items, granola/hiking snack bar, late hours \nCons: produce section decent but could be better, deli/buffet could be better, expensive whole foods prices ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "sedona arizona health-food-store restaurant", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wfm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sedona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T03:13:34.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ae4a022c86bc41ab3725eb1b21c0961fe1d01907", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ayWamkAwuSJUEynW6sR4C05RMik4UQL5JTftDabgP9vsh4kqcj73mgTHEPOl8RK.E-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Kyushu Jangara Ramen Akihabara - Tokyo Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Kyushu Jangara Ramen Akihabara - Tokyo Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-09T07:39:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.179, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/92/38/hcmp92385_261194_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ae4a022c86bc41ab3725eb1b21c0961fe1d01907", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9ayWamkAwuSJUEynW6sR4C05RMik4UQL5JTftDabgP9vsh4kqcj73mgTHEPOl8RK.E-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-09T07:39:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kyushu Jangara Ramen Akihabara - Tokyo Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "Best ramen, very popular with locals! - Edit Posted by Nikki1801 on 16 Jun 2017.

The service is very quick and the meals are made fresh. The environment and employees leave much to be desired though. The employees are abrupt (even by New York standards) and one time, I found them closing up 20 minutes early and refusal to serve any customers. It is an extremely tiny room that is very hot and cramped with not much seating, so it's much better to take it to-go than trying to eat there.

It is very difficult for a Bangladeshi person to understand that you do not want any meat. At least, this was my experience while trying to eat vegan food in Bangladesh. In Bangladesh, everything vegetarian will most likely be vegan too. They never use Ghee, since vegetable oil is way cheaper. This is especially true for street food\u2013places will use mustard or corn oil. The kitchen of Bangladesh is very Indian-inspired. But where India is the master of vegetarian food, Bangladesh has a whole other (meat) culture. One important thing to keep in mind is that there will always be traces of meat in your food. Meat will typically be fried in the same oil as veggie dishes, or your vegan food will be served with the same spoon used for meat dishes. Because of this, I had a bone or two mixed into my vegan dishes. Yuk. The few times this happened, I gave away my food to a person on the street in need. Singharas and samosas are mostly vegan, but don\u2019t trust the ones filled with onions! Sometimes I would repeat 15 times: \u201cNO MEAT!\u201d and still find meat in my dish. People will lie to sell, but many times they just do not understand \u201cno meat.\u201d Luckily during my time in Bangladesh, I had brought some green tea leaves from Myanmar with me so I could add some greens to my rice dishes. This way I at least got my greens in and was able to spice my dishes up with a small selection of spices and Sriracha (which I always carry with me). It\u2019s not a fine dining experience, but sometimes you just have to make do. Myamarian green tea leaves with rice and Sriracha Tour Group BD made my vegan Bangladeshi food experience much easier. They truly understood what \u2018vegan\u2019 means, so on the boat tour to the Sundarbans, I was spoiled like no other. The chef made me a separate delicious dish every day. Moreover, I could always count on these guys to help me out with anything. \nVegan dish on the Sundarban Tour \nThe kitchen on the boat to Sundarbans Govindas (Hindu restaurants) can be found all around the country. In Sree Mangal I tried about four dishes for 750 Taka (+/- 8 Euro). Vegan food in Sree Magal Govindas The people of Bangladesh are very hospitable. They\u2019ll take you in and feed you without any questions. I\u2019ve enjoyed several beautiful vegan meals made with love and only in traditional ways. I have never seen as many small dishes packed with flavor as I have in Shylet\u2013fried eggplant and zucchini, soy no-meat balls, mashed potato with onion, fresh salad, dahl (lentils), ..etc. A true feast compared to the bland rice I was eating most of the other time. Home cooked vegan meal in Shylet At one point during my travels, I met the wonderful guides of Tour Group BD in Cox Bazar and went on a camping adventure to Sonadia Island. While there, I enjoyed simple yet delicious meals cooked on improvised wooden fires. While there, I lived off of rice with potato and an occasional tomato or two. Once again, I spiced it up with Sriracha, since means were very scarce on the deserted island. Wood fire cooked meal on Sonadia Island Back in Dhaka, I really felt like spoiling myself with something other than fried food and potatoes. I took the hike to the restaurant Shadhu Bhojon in Dhaka, which I found through HappyCow . The food was pricey compared to elsewhere, but it satisfied my western craving for sure! Rice with greens at Shadhu Bhojon And of course, I wouldn\u2019t be a Belgian if I wasn\u2019t craving chocolate at least once a day. It had been such a long time since I had tasted any cacao delight, so I mixed up some coconut oil with cacao powder and coated some pomegranate with it. Chocolate with pomegranate Long story short: Bangladesh is by no means a vegan heaven, so keep this in mind if you want to travel to this hidden gem and maintain a vegan diet. Understand that this is a poor country where dietary choices are foreign or strictly religious. Here are some final tips for vegan travel in Bangladesh: book tours with Tour Group BD and avoid eating street food, unless it\u2019s fresh fruits and veggies of course. On the streets, go raw! And when in someone\u2019s home, kindly explain you don\u2019t eat animal products and you\u2019ll surely get spoiled beyond your expectations. \n\nAbout the author: I am Marie, a simple farmer\u2019s daughter without a plan.

Pfc definitely offers too many options, I've always struggled with choosing what to eat (which means I will have to go there again so many times!). The place itself looks nice, though I found it unbearably loud while sitting in the middle of the room and only slightly better when sitting next to a wall on my next visit. This is something they definitely need to work on. It feels like a bar or a fast-food joint, not a nice restaurant. On the other hand, all of their food as nothing but impressed me. Let me list what I had the pleasure of enjoying: * Pfc seitan foccacia: loved everything about it: the bread, the \"cheese\", the seitan, pesto,... It was just about twice as much as I could eat. Though no big deal, as they will happily wrap up the rest to go. This was a great meal the day after as well. * Cheeseburger on foccacia: my boyfriend had it, I tried a bit, it was very tasty. Great patty too - he said if nobody had told him it's vegan, he wouldn't have taken it for meat. The foccacia is a nice twist on the usual burger buns, and the onion rings add some great texture. * Macho nachos: are advertised as an appetizer, but I just made them my entree :) I was quite impressed, they appear to fry their own tortilla chips. Great toppings; maybe there could have been more guacamole, but I love that stuff, so I might not be the average customer. * Fresh gingerade: if you love ginger (like me), you'll love this. * Strawberry cheesecake: a true New York cheesecake. Vegan. Tasty. And a h ge slice. * Mini brownies: some of the best brownies I've had. * Macaroon: alright, nothing I'd order again. Price-wise, it's not cheap, but I can't complain. \nPros: extremely tasty food, huge selection, great desserts that you can look at before choosin \nCons: noisy atmosphere ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york city new york vegan restaurant", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peacefood cafe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T13:22:19.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d0b4d1abd508bcec8b1c2caa990159d83a21ddcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9YyCTmP.OEiILUicaHHTj9xPqzyoNgm77R5j96Haa62VXoEEY2n_5GsIeWXotbO9sg-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Free Farma Burgerownia Roslinna - Krakow Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Free Farma Burgerownia Roslinna - Krakow Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-12T17:55:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.737, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/73/85/hcmp73850_152542_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d0b4d1abd508bcec8b1c2caa990159d83a21ddcc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9YyCTmP.OEiILUicaHHTj9xPqzyoNgm77R5j96Haa62VXoEEY2n_5GsIeWXotbO9sg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T17:55:00.000+03:00", "title": "Free Farma Burgerownia Roslinna - Krakow Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "A really nice place with very friendly staff - Edit Posted by k-girl80 on 12 Oct 2017.

Me and my date first went into this other restaurant next door (treehouse) and I just wasn't feelin' it at that place, on top of it being pretty expensive. So when we left I saw hookah and falafel on the sign for this place so I was sold. Pretty sure I had the baked eggplant and it was AHmazing, my date loved his choice of food too (both vegan options). I had to pack mine up because it was such a big portion! It was a perfect sunny day so we had hookah with our food, which gave a fun ambiance. We had no issues other than not getting the correct hookah flavor and it being kinda nasty (tasted unclean), but thats not a food complaint so it's kinda irrelevant for the majority but keep in mind when getting that option. There were lots of families this day and they were pretty busy and we still got served promptly and kindly, no complaints! There were more vegan options here than compared to other places and I'll definitely be coming back here again soon. \nPros: Yummm, Cheap , Great Ambience \nCons: None with food and service!, Hookah was Bleh By submitting this post you agree to HappyCow Terms Post Your Response Great family place - Edit Posted by mg66 on 17 Apr 2016. This is a great family place, and you'll see many middle eastern families eating here. The reason it's great for my family is the price - we can have falafel night for $20! You just can't beat that for a family of four. The food is very good and the staff is cheerful. What more could we want? For the record, i tried to give 5 stars, but Happy Cow limits non-vegetarian restaurants to 4 stars max. OK, I understand. \nPros: affordable, falafel is always a good thing, friendly staff By submitting this post you agree to HappyCow Terms Post Your Response falafel! - Edit Posted by MeM on 18 Mar 2016. Take out orders regularly missing essentials, like sauce, or all the food, or sides, or extras you paid for. Dont bother. Better places on South Grand. Their falafel dinner is good. Decent portion size (although the falafel dinner went from 10pc to 9pc) everything I've had there is good: Fries, lentil soup, hummus, sandwiches. Never really impressed with the staff and I always double check my order, I've had to drive back for missing pita. I'd like to blame it on the fact that they're always doing brisk business...but I don't think that's it. I've been ignored, treated curtly, and i went around and around with a staff that said i should have a yogurt salad, in response to me looking for a vegan substitute for the soup they were out of.

Yes, three wows! I'm stopped in St. Louis this evening on my way across the country and a friend took me to dinner here. On the drive over he mentioned how much he loves the food and that he's never had anything here he hasn't loved. He's omni, so I wasn't sure if the same would prove true for me. Oh boy, did it ever! We both started with the lentil soup and it was a flavor explosion in my mouth. So perfectly balanced and complex it made me wish my lentil soups were even half as good. He got a pot of coffee with cardamon and was so excited by the flavor, I had to try, despite the fact that I don't really do caffeine. It was served in a beautiful pot with two dainty cups and it only took a small sip to realize what he was in love with. It was thick, strong, and flavorful. If I was a regular coffee lover, I would have ordered one for myself. I wasn't so sure about my dinner choices. The menu is very clearly marked with vegan selections and I wasn't super-excited by the basic descriptions. With our server's hearty recommendation of the mixed vegetable plate, I ordered that and was more than pleasantly surprised. It was so incredibly delicious and beautifully presented. It was a combination of cauliflower, zucchini, eggplant, and peppers over a wonderfully spiced rice served with some pickled vegetables. My only caution is that it was served with a tahini sauce which appeared too light in color to be vegan. I asked the server and she immediately apologized, saying that there is yogurt in it. The meal was incredibly delicious without it. We also split grape leaves which were perfectly done and had a pot of mint tea after dinner. The service was excellent - attentive and friendly and we felt extremely welcome. If I lived in St. Louis this would definitely be a place I frequented often!

I wish I lived nearer to this place, they do a cooked vegan breakfast at 70p an item (apart from toast which is still a reasonable \u00a31 for 2 slices). Items included fried mushrooms, baked beans, hash browns, sausages, bacon and tofu scramble. My dad is not veg*n but still really enjoyed this, and I was very pleased to be able to opt for a vegan pain au chocolat, not a choice I think I've ever seen in a commercial establishment before and an extremely welcome one! I was also impressed with the amount of useful groceries they had for sale, including Hodmedod dried beans and quinoa, vegan marshmallows, Vego bars, Suma vital wheat gluten, and many more, dotted around on a few different shelves! We also liked the shelves full of games and puzzles provided for customers, and the big jug of water which was brought over after we asked for a glass of tap water. The proprietor was really friendly too, and kindly wrote down a cake recipe for my mum. The only improvement I would suggest is that I think there should be more indication that items are vegan (even if it's just a V by each item, as that's usually a code we understand!), I almost didn't think to ask if the pain au chocolat were vegan, I found out because I asked if there were any vegan cakes and were told they all are, and it was only later on that I saw a blackboard stating that everything is plant-based apart from dairy milk for drinks. \nPros: Friendly and helpful, inexpensive, tasty food \nCons: labelling could be clearer, location a bit out of the way ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "st albans vegan restaurant", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "happycow great", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-14T12:08:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b3fbe3924fa132e05c16acc377567a57699f699d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9bFNl4MgPFFoeKeg7bl1MEUg_CAynK5kBVP_BNfJwkAVd_37on253iPXoV.X6YvNPk-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen - Sedona Arizona Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen - Sedona Arizona Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-14T07:47:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.999, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/32/23/hcmp32230_189704_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b3fbe3924fa132e05c16acc377567a57699f699d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9bFNl4MgPFFoeKeg7bl1MEUg_CAynK5kBVP_BNfJwkAVd_37on253iPXoV.X6YvNPk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-14T07:47:00.000+03:00", "title": "Picazzo's Organic Italian Kitchen - Sedona Arizona Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "keep your expectations low - Edit Posted by jenly on 18 Apr 2017. I am always eternally grateful to Happy Cow when we are travelling, so I feel compelled to leave reviews after visiting restaurants I learned about on this site. Picazzo is an upscale, airy pizza restaurant with a full bar and fairly extensive menu. Yes, they have Beyond Meat chickn strips but the kitchen overall needs a culinary upgrade. We ordered the Zoe salad which came with the chikn but I don't think it had been cooked well before adding it to the salad since it had that hard texture it gets right from the package. Otherwise the salad was nice and family enjoyed it. Other items we ordered included a Daiya pizza with vegan crust and a couple of toppings, a regular cheese pizza, some kind of alfredo noodle dish with the Beyond Meat, and the zucchini noodle dish with the cauliflower sauce. The item was the vegan pizza with the gluten free crust and spicy sauce.. The dairy pizza was completely tasteless and the pasta dishes also flavorless and not enjoyed by the kids. I found the zucchini noodle dish to be a gloppy mess and overwhelmingly garlicky. A woman at the table next to us had ordered the same thing and sent her order back. There were a lot of good intentions here but execution was lacking. We went for lunch and it was pretty expensive for the five of us, so it would have been nice if the meal had been better.

I never thought that vegan cuisine can be SOOOO tasty. There was only one negative and I think that the owners ought to fix it.

First, thank you Happy Cow for helping me to find a vegan friendly restaurant, and what a wonderful find this was! The place appears very fun, funky and clean. The service was excellent, everyone was attentive and the food was AMAZING! They have a separate menu for vegetarian and vegan options and you do have to compare it to the main menu for the dish descriptions. The dishes are reasonbly priced and our selections were colorful, appealing and very flavorful. I have found my new favorite restaurant!

The vibe was cool and I love what they do for charity. I want to like this place but honestly the food was meh and overpriced for portion and flavour.

It came with 2 (small) falafel patties which were good, hummus and plain yogurt... pretty much it. There was no variety in flavors or textures, it was all just was kinda soft and mushy. My partner got the chili stir fry. Again, not bad but really nothing special. Tasted like generic sweet chili sauce and standard vegetables. Small portion and no tofu or beans or anything of the sort.

I really enjoyed my meal here. Cheap, plentiful and delicious. I had the beet down juice which was very flavourful but the garlic was a bit zingy for my liking. I had the raw collard wrap which was nice although fell apart easily. I sampled my friends' dishes which were great (more flavourful than mine). They really do the sauces very well! The sesame chicken (seitan) was well flavoured, the chopped BBQ quesadilla (not vegan) had a strong BBQ flavour within the sauce but was nice and crisp. The special of the day was crispy asian eggplant with a delicious sauce over rice and steamed broccoli. The kale salad (side) was delicious. Simple but very flavourful. The refried beans were more like baked beans and were ok. My friends thought the vegan cupcakes were very good but I didn't try them. I wish I was staying longer so I could go back. I ended up taking half my collard wrap home as leftovers. Edited to add: The food can be a bit hit-or-miss. I came back a second day and the kale salad was so spicy I had to return it. The macrobiotic plate was great though, which I took home mostly as leftovers since it was so huge. The raw sushi was a bit lacklustre.

Slow, slow, slow your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily the wait is hella extreme! We waited so long that the seasons changed. The service is so slow that I literally forgot what I had ordered. Here's the truth about Lovin' It Live. The wait is aweful. The service is unengaging and nonchalant. But the food will set you right! The food is consistly good. Been going for years and never had a bad meal so I keep going back. Now make sure you got a good job or your own business balling and even with that take your nitro-glycerine because the prices will give you a heart attack. It's definitely uptown compared to Tassili's (yuck). At Lovin' It Live after you grow accustomed to the \"process\" it's kinda like the soup nazi on Seinfeld. You go in, you don't make eye contact after you order and you graciously wait. Once your food arrives, you are happy as heck. The place is intimate and has a great vibe and nice art pieces.

Finally made it here! There are not many reviews online for this place but the ones that are there are well deserved 5s! After strolling along the main stretch in Condado, we decided to make the stop here for dinner. We met Ernesto who puts the menu together who recommended the burger and taco for us. ( The lunch buffet was already over) We ordered his suggestions and added a quesadilla to share. This food was so flavorful. The tortillas, if I understood properly are made from a gluten free cassava flour and added to the flavor of the taco and quesadilla. Ernesto kept checking in on us to make sure everything was good and he let me sample some of the macaroni salad he had left over from the lunch buffet. AMAZING! We took some to go to bring back to our hotel. He explained that the buffet normal starts when they open at 11. He decides on the menu every morning so it is different pretty much everyday. The buffet goes until around 3-4 when most things run out. He then has the standard menu which includes the food we ordered, plus a few additional items that can be put together quickly. This place is a definitely a must try for the service and flavor. \nPros: Great, friendly service, Excellent local flavors, Nice selection \nCons: Parking, Area is a little sketchy, go during the day ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-19T11:30:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "751a681e869358fdd07f83b1c9b239680571b88d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9aVOG.yr8Gw7yelS.XohFqZOMoHg8lMJ8iu6iER2zXfACkuo9ifg8kY", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Native Foods - Wicker Park - Chicago Illinois Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Native Foods - Wicker Park - Chicago Illinois Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-19T20:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.995, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/27/74/hcmp27740_194796_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "751a681e869358fdd07f83b1c9b239680571b88d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9aVOG.yr8Gw7yelS.XohFqZOMoHg8lMJ8iu6iER2zXfACkuo9ifg8kY", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-19T20:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Native Foods - Wicker Park - Chicago Illinois Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "GREAT addition to Chicago!!! - Edit Posted by SynthVegan on 08 Aug 2011. Native Foods Cafe has been one of my favorite restaurants to visit while in California for quite some time now. Luckily for us Chicagoans, we can now stuff ourselves silly with as much NF's as we'd like - I'll have to step up my workout routine, but it's totally worth it! I was delighted to meet the mastermind behind all of the super-tasty menu items, Chef Tanya, she was very delightful, fun, and clearly passionate about what she does. All of the other employees were super nice too, as well as the manager, whom I had previously met in Tustin, CA. We ordered a few appetizers, entrees, desserts, and drinks - in sum the food was AMAZING. Appetizers: Native Nachos (chips, black beans, veg taco meat, chipotle crema, veg cheese, salsa, guacamole) - this was a tasty dish, although it wasn't my favorite. I really enjoyed the veg meat but didn't care for the cheese flavored drops that resembled fancy butter. Native Chicken Wings (crispy battered \"chicken\" wings served with ranch) - this dish was very tasty, even my non-vegan friends loved it. The ranch dressing that came with it is the best in the city! Entrees: Oklahoma Bacon Cheeseburger (seitan, daiya cheese, \"bacon\", caramelized onions, BBQ sauce, ranch dressing, and battered dill pickle chips) - this is, and always has been, my favorite dish! It's perfect for when you're craving a burger and fries, or just when you'd like to treat yourself to a good meal. This time I decided to be on the healthier side and ordered potato salad as my side, it was good and had a lot of dill in it, although I prefer the mayonnaise (vegenaise) based potato salads - I'll likely stick with fries next time. Chicken Run Ranch Burger (crispy battered \"chicken\", ranch dressing, lettuce, carrots, and onions) - my bf got this so I tried several bites. We both agreed that it wasn't much different from the chicken wings appetizer, so get one or the other, but not both at the same time. Rockin' Morracan Bowl (\"chicken\", veggies, quinoa) - my friend let me try this and I didn't care for it at all, however, he really enjoyed it...to each his/her own. Desserts: Cheesecake (served with blueberries) - I liked this NF's version better than others. Although you can taste the tofu flavor, it's very tasty! Strawberry Parfait - I loved this dessert! It was shockingly good. Chocolate Love Pie - this was good, but it had a carob flavor, and I'm not a huge fan of carob so I prefer the cheesecake, parfaits, and cupcakes to this.

The Hague is the city of peace and law, located on the coast of the North Sea with wide sandy beaches. It is a city of new styles and old masters, with shops, palaces, green parks and beautiful museums like the Mauritshuis. And above all, it is a city where you can eat great vegan food. \nJohn and Carin Galstaun run Veggies on Fire . They offer purely vegetable dishes and beverages. All ingredients they use are, whenever possible, of biological origin and locally grown. To give a dish a little kick they use some exotic products here and there. For example, their Chipotle Burger contains smoked chipotle peppers imported from Mexico. Chipotle Burger \nThey state on their website: \u201cBy eating vegetables, you contribute to the environment, your health, and enhance animal welfare. There is a better economical use of water and other natural resources, and the choice of pure plant nutrition eventually leads to a much more efficient global food distribution. We will bring you good food and harmony in the broadest sense of the word, in our restaurant on the Beeklaan 385 in The Hague.\u201d \nSo, of course we had to check this restaurant out on our city trip to The Hague. Veggies on Fire is a great little restaurant. We made reservations and got a lovely table at the window. The restaurant was completely full. It was nice to see all the people enjoying their food. We liked that the chef came out of the kitchen to serve our dishes and that she gave us an explanation of the food. \nI had the Chipotle Burger. A spicy seasoned burger made of three kinds of beans, oats, rice and smoked Mexican peppers. It is served on a homemade bun with salad and potatoes from the oven. For me the burger could have been a bit less spicy but it was a surprisingly good dish. I especially loved the oven-baked potatoes. While eating we suddenly realized why the restaurant is called \u201cVeggies on Fire\u201d\u2026because that is exactly what the dishes on the menu are\u2026very spicy and hot! \nWhenever you are in The Hague, check this place out. You will be pleasantly surprised\u2026and on fire! \n\nAbout the author: Mari\u00eblle van de Kerkhof \u2014 happy urban gardener who loves to travel and eat great vegan food! www.mariellevandekerkhof.com \n\nPanna Cotta and front restaurant images courtesy of Veggies On Fire Facebook page .

As many have already commented the decor inside the Green Spot is simply stunning, modern and chic but not in a pretentious way. Depending on where you are seated you can also see the marina. The staff are very attentive and friendly too putting you at ease straight away and most importantly the food is great. We went for lunch and ordered the yellow spot curry with black rice (\u20ac14.75) and the Sun choy bao tofu setas (\u20ac10.50), both of which were presented beautifully and tasted even better with a great depth of flavour. Some may say these prices are expensive but we thought it was value for money and will definitely return again. We also got a raspberry lemonade and apple press juice (\u20ac3.25) to wash it down, very refreshing indeed. If I did have one con, I would personally like to see a few more vegan options.

We visited here twice during our recent stay mainly out of convenience as it is open till late. On offer you can get a meal deal consisting of falafel, chips and a drink for about \u20ac12 or just buy a falafel individually for about \u20ac5. We decided to just get a falafel with one white pita and one wholemeal pita, which was tasty but nothing special. However, you can use the salad bar to refill as many times as you want, which was great with some good salad selections available. Unfortunately the shop can be very congested when busy and with limited seating available this can be very frustrating and time consuming. On the second occasion we visited I was extremely disappointed with one particular instance I witnessed where a staff member actually brought a selection of open meat sandwiches into the shop to eat whilst on their break. I'm not saying you have to be vegan to work at vegan outlets but at least show some respect. I just hope they washed their hands thoroughly.

We had the enchiladas suiza, which were excellent - I really enjoyed the beans and rice that went with it and the suiza sauce was good. It came with a little side salad similar to pico de gallo and that was nice too. Free chips and salsa with a salsa bar - I always love that. The chips were good, but the salsa not so much, though I only tried two of them (aguacate and fresh salsa). We also had a chimichanga because I miss them so much, but it was a bit greasy so we probably should have just ordered the burrito, which was the same thing, but not deep fried.

Nama is a bit posh, kind of place you might find the cast of the Notting Hill film in!! But the tea is only \u00a32.50 (I say only! how London am I?) which given it comes in a pot and you can get two cups out of it compares well with other less snazzy joints! But lets cut to the chase. If you like cake, raw cake, refined sugar free cake then you must try this place out. I am a big fan of the raw cakes at Vantra, 222 and Redemption and the occasional ones you get at Black Cat but Nama has in my humble (expert!) opinion surpassed all these. The Cherry, coffee layer cake (special) I had last night was as good if not better than any raw cake I have had before. Sturdy in consistency, thick and creamy with multiple flavours and textures twas a sensory delight. The chocolate ganache cake my cake eating comrade chose was also superb if a little less sophisticated! Photo included of the special layer cake. Staff were friendly and helpful too! It ain't cheap but its worth it. Next time I'll try the tiramisu!

After a visit to the beautiful Fushimi Inari Shrine, there is not better place to grab a bite, or to stuff yourself with delicious food than this adorable little nook. The cafe lies about 15min away by foot from the shrine and it is well worth the walk, even in the sweltering summer heat. It's not hard to find, but it is a bit camouflaged into the corner, so look left if you're coming from the shrine and turn the corner. The cafe has a varied menu consisting of a number of interesting dishes such as casseroles, curry, pizza, etc. Following the suggestion of other reviews, we tried their miso ramen and asked for it not to be spicy. The dish came in a heaping, steaming bowl that was a challenge to finish. We were stuffed by the end of it, but it was so delicious we dared not leave a single spoonful. The ramen came with plenty of noodles as well as soy sprouts and various almost raw vegetables (not soggy) in a delicious miso broth. By far the best vegan ramen we have ever had. We also tried their soft serve ice cream and tiramisu. The ice cream was delicious with a sweet, yet mild, vanilla type tofuish flavor. It had true soft serve ice cream texture and came bathed in a sauce of our choosing, The tiramisu was truthfully disappointing, as it did not taste at all like coffee but rather a bit sour. Not very pleasant. Overall we greatly enjoyed our meal at Vegans Cafe and Restaurant and would undoubtedly return in the future for a delicious bowl of ramen followed by some creamy soy soft serve. \nPros: generous portions, friendly staff, delicious food \nCons: pricey, distant, very little English spoken ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tamy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fushimi inari shrine", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kyoto vegan restaurant", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-23T09:39:36.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2316f7f10d6d77d91b62d13d0bab800cdabd1a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9Y0X637We7YvPbqTJh7LcouSwjD4abcBKvbs.2MLMHBM7wrBplDgzY.0cKCSdwsaTKPnw3ucXS7Dw--", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Bek Semilla de Vida - San Cristobal De Las Casas Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Bek Semilla de Vida - San Cristobal De Las Casas Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-10-24T04:41:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.537, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/99/67/hcmp99672_297688_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2316f7f10d6d77d91b62d13d0bab800cdabd1a1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9Y0X637We7YvPbqTJh7LcouSwjD4abcBKvbs.2MLMHBM7wrBplDgzY.0cKCSdwsaTKPnw3ucXS7Dw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-24T04:41:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bek Semilla de Vida - San Cristobal De Las Casas Vegan Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "small , cosy and tasty - Edit Posted by xclarissax on 24 Oct 2017. small but really cute place where we had first a bowl with quinoa , chickpeas ans some leaves .

I have read it's faster to get the cold foods, but it shouldn't have taken that long to get my food. The food is very good. I just don't think it's good enough to wait 45 minutes for a Togo order. Might by back. But I'll make sure it's slow and no one else is there so I can get my food at a decent time. I even had to buy a premise carrot cake to eat while I waited because i was so hungry. \nPros: good food, nice staff \nCons: parking is terrible unless you already know about , took a long time to get my food.

This place has some really great food, but just be aware that the bread that they use for their burgers and sandwiches is not vegan! This is a bit confusing because they do go to the trouble of using veganaise. Depending on who you talk to they will usually say that all their food is vegan, but this is not true. Everything else is great though. I particularly like their potato salad and their soups and wraps. \nPros: Tasy food, Good Prices \nCons: Not all Vegan delete Delve 22 Feb 2013 - I've already written a review, but found - after visiting again (on three more occasions), that there is a lot of confusion amongst the workers on what is and isn't vegan.

By submitting this post you agree to HappyCow Terms Post Your Response WILL MAKE YOU WANT MORE!!! - Edit Posted by Amazingrobie on 27 Oct 2007. I'm the person who submitted this restaurant to HappyCow and I also submitted 'A Moveable Feast'. Both places are terrific for Vegan/Vegetarian food, but I've recently converted from vegan to a raw food diet and I have to say, Sunfired Foods is THE best place in Houston to go if you eat raw. Hands down. The people are super nice and the food is just out of this world. It's inexpensive and the portions are more than enough. Being new to \"raw\" and not very familiar with the menu there, Arga, the person who cooks everything offered me and my girlfriend samples of most of what was in the raw food case/cooler and right away I knew we were in the right place. We were a little put off because of the location being pretty far from where we normally travel for food, but once we tried the salads, now we're hooked!

What Israeli Falafel and American Bagels share in common, is that they should be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Falafel banin is exactly that! The Falafels here are little yellow balls (which you could eat like popcorn) that are really fresh, with a flavor and texture inside which is much smoother than the more commonly found green falafel balls, Johnny, the owner (and the son of the original owners), is also a character who takes tremendous pride in his product. The first time I went in, I tried ordering without french fries and he strongly persuaded me to include them. Wow, was he right!!! These are no common instant fries, they are fresh potatoes fried up deliciously and one of the best parts of the meal.

Gracias Madre is one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco and Los Angeles! While the whole menu is vegan, it's one of those places you could take a carnivore or a vegan too, because the options are varied and the cashew cheese is phenomenal, so you don't simply feel you're eating a plate of vegetables. We took a friend whose from Mexico City to the San Francisco location, and he requested to go back again when he came back to town with his wife (both are meat eaters) - to me, that's a true testament to this place! However, in comparison to the San Francisco location (quite dark and a bit awkwardly shaped with many communal tables), this location is one of the most gorgeous restaurants I've ever seen! The inside is quite large and there's a good amount of space between tables. The outside area may even be a bit larger, and it again looks like something out of a design magazine. No touch was forgotten about, and you immediately feel comfortable in this place. Service is generally good here too, and the clientele is more of a Hollywood vibe and less of a hipster vibe, which the SF location is more of. Cocktails are strong and creatively designed. They have a variety of drinks (and a mocktail or two) on the menu. Note that they are expensively priced for what you're getting though. Especially with the mocktail - it ends up being a lot of ice for what you pay for! The appetizers and mains are fantastic here! Guacamole is good, anything with cashew cheese on it is creamy and filling and the entrees come with a sizable amount of food. Our favorite dish is the tamal mojado - a very satisfying dish that comes with pickled vegetables and rice. The sauce is thick and spicy, without being overwhelmingly so. Their coconut bacon is also very cool. It doesn't try to impersonate bacon, and instead has an almost bacon-like texture with great coconut flavor, very unique! The only course that sometimes leaves something to be desired is dessert. We've tried cheesecake, their gluten-free black bean brownie and their chocolate cake. I found all to not be quite as deliciously sweet as a non-vegan dessert (we've even had better vegan versions of all three elsewhere). The black bean brownie came with sauces drizzled on top which certainly made it sweet, but not in the best kind of way. I recommend going elsewhere for dessert. Overall, a very solid restaurant - it could be a perfect date spot or a great place to bring the whole family due to its size!

I do not like complaining about food or people or places. But. To spare someone from the same mistake - if you eat vegan, go to the nearby vegan Sushi cafe instead. This place is at the end of a hotel lobby. Was the only customer. Waited quite a while before I got someone's attention. Then, whilst being pressured to ordering (had barely had a chance to look at the menu) I asked what was vegan to smooth the social awkwardness. They said they can make the mushroom-o-something burger vegan. :) So far nice. I asked how. \"We remove the cheese and the mayo.\" \"And what's left then? Is there any salad to go with it?\" \"There is lettuce and pepper sauce.\" \"Well, ok. Let's try. One burger please then\". What arrived gets A for the effort to bring a decent Quorn type of burger to Gerogetown, and and F for everything else. :) What appeared was two honest thick slices of fungi-burger between a bun. And a mini-tad of lettuce. And. The top of the burger was literally cold. I pointed that out, it was taken to the kitchen, and I heard a bell. I suspect it was a microwave. \"Did you also microwave the salad now?\" \"No, we heated the burger up.\" \"Ok...\". \"I'm sorry, I will not eat this, but since I ordered it, I'm happy to pay.\" (I was hoping for a return politeness, which did not compute). So I paid, to support a vegetarian place in their efforts, and to not be arrogant, and asked for the thing for takeway. I tasted it on my way to the vegan Sushi place nearby - the bread had deflated (indicating potential microwaving of the fluffy bread). The flavoring of the sauces was nice, but what was left is very nearly not food :). I suppose if one is a lacto-ovo vegetarian, it goes smoother there. I visited a number of Georgetown's vegan and vegetarian places and this one I would not go back there.

Oh boy oh boy... Little did I know about what to expect as I was approaching this little cosy bistro in a nice area a little outside of the city centre. I had heard about the place from a friend and went there expecting a nice little snack before my flight back home. They have super cheap daily menus and I was considering ordering the soup+lasagne set, but then I remembered that no matter what I should go for the seitan bagel. And I was not disappointed! It was really HUGE, filled with deliciously marinated seitan and various veggies, including one of my all time favourites: pickled cucumber. And it tasted like heaven.

I went to Spicy Thai on a date with a non veg, a carnivore through and through. The building looks really interesting from the outside and it's hard to miss. Bright yellow paint on the outside with SPICY THAI painted in bold red. It's really nice inside. Some \"traditional\" areas to eat where you're sitting kind of on the ground. I didn't see much of this, we got a table, though I would have liked to eat there. Menus not bad, very diverse. Most things can be made vegan and you can tell them how spicey you like it. That's a bonus. WARNING: Mild is no spice, medium is REALLY hot. The staff was super friendly and well informed, so props to Spicy Thai on that one. The food was alright. I had Pad Thai, vegan of course. It was overly sweet and I couldn't eat much. There were these weird vegetables things in it. They looked really freaky and that turned me off. I hate admitting that because I'm usually over the top open minded about food. My date had some seafood meadley thing. Mussels, oeysters, shrimp and so on. He liked it alot. The prices weren't bad. We paid 30$ for both of us.

I never realised vegetables could be so tasty and have eaten here almost every night since. The snack dishes are huge and yummy. I especially recommend the Gespacio and babaganoush with homemade flatbread. The mains are just as delicious, beautifully presented also and very filling. G put's a lot of attention into textures, flavours and it's a visual feast to boot and the prices are very reasonable for the quality and freshness. They make pretty much all of it in front of your eyes from scratch! I highly recommend whether you are visiting Siem Reap or a long term resident. Please note that the star system on this site wont let you vote 5 stars for a restaurant that is veg freindly and not full veg. Veg g Table has one meat dish, which means you can bring your non veg friends, and trust me, they may just convert. Jokes aside tho, this place deserves 5 stars, because it is the best veg food i have eaten anywhere in the world.

We have been here many times over the past few years and loved the place and the food, although always too oily and salty. The creativity with the food is wonderful. Yesterday we were there and all our breads and food was burnt which in itself it very unhealthy to eat black burnt food. The hostess was very rude saying this is how it is always cooked and they must burn the flat bread and put oil on everything. She was not listening to anything we said, such as we have been here many times before and never had burnt food. She was literally angry and upset with us for pointing out the burnt food. We didn't recognize the wait staff maybe they are new but the cooks were not and the food was all burnt. We have brought friends and groups here over the years to introduce them to vegan food, but we will not return again. This experience was so counter all the other and overall they just didn't care what we said, and I believe the staff was just not informed. When a place is consistent then there are none of these issues, so I dont know either they always burn the food and the past 20 times we have been there we got luck and it wasn't burnt, or this one time it is burnt is really the way they cook? Tel Aviv has so many options but I hope this place will educate their staff and cooks to stay consistent hopefully with not burning the food. If they go back to non burnt food it is very tasty but a meal only to eat once a month with how salty, rich and oily it is. If they keep burning the food then it is not worth it at all.

Such a great place to stay! I've never stayed at a B&B before and wasn't originally planning to for my trip, but this little gem popped up on HappyCow and my boyfriend and I decided to try something new and let me tell you...It did not disappoint. The location is just on the other side of the river from downtown and conveniently located within walking distance to many restaurants, bars and boutiques. For the vegans out there, it is minutes away from the vegan strip mall and a great vegan bar called The Sweet Hereafter. Sandy is beyond sweet and she goes above and beyond to make sure your stay is comfortable and unobtrusive (although, ironically, I wished that she would be more intrusive because I love talking to people and hearing their stories. But that's just my personality). The room and the bathroom were huge and we were met with complimentary vegan truffles. The bed was so comfortable and in the morning Sandy had a delicious, vegan, southwest breakfast ready for us (I ate 3 biscuits and would've eaten more if others hadn't wanted the rest). And lastly...her lovely pets. She has the sweetest little dog that looks like the dog from the Caesar food commercials and the absolute sweetest cat named Bill who knows tricks. I highly recommend Sandy and a stay at her B&B. Not only will I be staying there for all trips to Portland, but the stay has also convinced me to explore other B&B's on other vacations. This place is great for vegans because of the guaranteed vegan breakfast, but even if you're not vegan, it's great because the food is amazing and the stay is relaxing. \nPros: Vegan, Location, Sandy ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sandy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "santerra", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "caesar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "portland oregon hotel restaurant", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-28T11:11:35.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0f7888d397474c9eca47dd757673fe69a6f5538a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME5RF9dNTo5Lj2ndxXdW4QSWzg56o9Z2DfORx07leWCmyr2VybUWV5alv.usoxilJGk", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "DIY Vegan Halloween Candy Recipes - The Veggie Blog", "title_full": "DIY Vegan Halloween Candy Recipes - The Veggie Blog", "published": "2017-10-26T00:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.225, "main_image": "https://www.happycow.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/vegan-halloween-candy.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0f7888d397474c9eca47dd757673fe69a6f5538a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME5RF9dNTo5Lj2ndxXdW4QSWzg56o9Z2DfORx07leWCmyr2VybUWV5alv.usoxilJGk", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-26T00:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "DIY Vegan Halloween Candy Recipes - The Veggie Blog", "text": "Cooking / Recipes / Video DIY Vegan Halloween Candy Recipes \nWant to enjoy some sweet treats this Halloween but don\u2019t want to get the store-bought, super processed, non-vegan candy?

If your motto in life is \"CHEEESE!!! I must at least eat half a kilo of it every day \" ... Then WTF might be just the right place for you. If you are vegan, however, or if you simply like to eat healthy food, then possibly not. When I read the description, I got the impression that it is a restaurant with main,y Western style food. That is not the case. About 90 % of their menu is Indian, and they do have a few Western options. Burger, Pizza, cheese sandwich and some Mexican food. The common deniminator is that they are laden with either cheese, butter or ghee, reflecting the school of thought that is - unfortunataly - also often encountered in Vegetarian restaurants, that mankind can not survive without animal products :-( However, their prices are much too high for average Indian food. Aloo mutter for RM 10 is ok, charging RM 2 for each single piece of chapatti on top of that, and RM 2 for a jug of ice water is rather steep, but asking RM 7 for a glass of Lemon Iced tea and RM 9 for a small mango lassi are too expensive IMO. I went there with my non-vegan son, he ate one of the mini-pizzas (the second one was too much for him), I helped him with his fries and had the Aloo Mutter with some Chapattis. The lemon ice tea that I ordered without sugar was very sweet, so when I ordered another one, I specifically asked that no sugar at all be added. The drink I received tasted similar to normal Lipton's out of the can and the \"normal\" lemon ice tea that my son had ordered would probably have sent a diabetic person into a coma after the first sip. After the lunch, both my son and myself had indigestion, something that I, as a vegan, am simply not used to. The redeeming factor of WTF is the friendliness of their personnel. The waiter explained which of their options were vegan, and when my son ordered a Mango lassi, he came back to check if that was really ok, as I had asked specifically for no dairy in the food (and lassi is made of yoghurt). Nevertheless, with only average food and above average prices, this is clearly not sufficient for a better rating. \nPros: Friendly staff, Taste ok \nCons: Prices very high for what they offer, Few vegan options, Food definitely not healthy ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lipton", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tasty food - kuala lumpur vegetarian restaurant - happycow indian", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wtf", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-28T14:10:41.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5a6c878e887da42108d1de04734c0bfdce9ddd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME5JrOXhzJ61OmwFe.2KvMxQIeAy0POx8oPN5bMcsoPoxc-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Pumpkin Spice Truffle - The Veggie Blog", "title_full": "Pumpkin Spice Truffle - The Veggie Blog", "published": "2017-10-27T23:38:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.196, "main_image": "https://www.happycow.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-1.28.01-PM.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5a6c878e887da42108d1de04734c0bfdce9ddd1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME5JrOXhzJ61OmwFe.2KvMxQIeAy0POx8oPN5bMcsoPoxc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-27T23:38:00.000+03:00", "title": "Pumpkin Spice Truffle - The Veggie Blog", "text": "Cooking / Recipes / Video Pumpkin Spice Truffle \nFor a healthier Halloween treat, Feasting On Fruit \u2018s Pumpkin Spice Truffle checks all the boxes!

Having been to 20,000 Cows more than a decade earlier and having enjoyed that experience, we were looking forward to the new owner reopening the place. Our anticipation did not match the reality. If you feel like dining in someone's crumbling loungeroom, then this is the place for you. The lack of care of the premises is just the start. We were so shocked by the prices (which didn't have a hint of being \"suggestions\" in any way) that we decided to try some of the cheaper options; a curry for $25 in Australia in 2012 is found in places with gold cutlery, not with a bunch of cobwebs! Our entree of spinach and nut cheese rolls consisted of two pencil-thin tubes of pastry containing a leaf of spinach and something white. Whether this white stuff was made out of nuts was impossible to say. This was truly a minimalist item both on size and on taste. Our main was a pasta with a coconut milk and mushroom sauce. This was a bland and hastily prepared meal, with a strange mix of cooked and uncooked vegetables. It was at least 1/3 too expensive. Thankfully there was a nice paratha to finish off our meal, but it too was small for the price. We decided to cut our losses and did not order any of the overpriced desserts.

I was so excited to go to a new vegan restaurant in Studio City. The interior is very cute with a wonderful menu. We ordered grilled potstickers as an appetizer.

Then I ordered a steak and cheese sandwich my husband ordered a noodle bowl and we were surprised. His noodle bowl came on a plate... My steak sandwich was a Boca burger. It was a beautiful presentation, but it was something I could easily make at home. The soy beef strips that were on top of his noodle bowl we're the same kind you get out of a bag from the freezer.

I've been a regular customer for years now. I usually go during lunch time on Fridays and Saturdays but I also go at other times. Lunch gets really crowded around noon and some people place orders over the phone and they tend to those orders first. The con about the lunch special is that sometimes they run out of food, which tells you that it's good food too. The whole family is Vegetarian, except for the cook's sister, who is now working as the server. As per the reviewer who talked about the snobbish daughter, I've had that experience as well. Both daughters are a little snobbish but the parents compensate by being extra friendly. The daughters are rarely there, so, please don't let that experience deter you from coming back. I would recommend the fried oyster mushrooms with basil, Dumpling noodle soup, Soy fish in any of the many sauces, KungPao Tofu or soy chicken. In the afternoon, the ladies leave and the cook is left alone tending the restaurant, he does not speak much English, so I would recommend you to take the menu and tell him the numbers. The menu is in English and Chinese. Be patient with him as he'll be alone and cooks the food as you order it. No reheating or microwave in that kitchen so you'll hear him chopping and frying and rattling pans as you wait. In the evenings, the wife or the sister come back to help with dinner, so you don't have to wait that long. Highly recommended vegan restaurant.

I've tried to recreate it at home but it is never just right. The sandwich is delicious too.

I promise we are not demanding or rude, and we've never been there when it is busy. It is kind of a turn off, but once those plates hit the table, all is forgiven. I wish they would open a Nashville location! Update: I have moved on from the culture club and now love the lentil melt. The texture is so good and I love the mushrooms on it.

I was staying downtown and this place was pretty close by so I decided to check it out. Being able to walk here from my hotel was a big plus. It didn't take long, but it was located in a residential community and very much off the beaten path. The neighborhood seemed a little shady as well. For that reason this cafe - being in the LGBTQ center no less - felt like an oasis. The space was roomy, bright, and clean. Vegan options were plentiful and clearly marked. Almost all the baked goods were vegan, and they even had raw vegan cheesecakes. I had the \"bizness\" special where I got to pick three side salads served on a bed of kale. I ordered the carrot and lentil, beet and quinoa, and the red pepper hummus, which also happened to come with a piece of warm pita! I liked how everything tasted so light and fresh, but being the spice lover that I am, I did find the food a tad bit flat and thought it could use more flavors. Nonetheless it was a healthy and enjoyable meal. The real star of the show, though, was the raw chocolate \"cheesecake\". I have had countless raw cakes that were too soft like a mousse and/or too agave-happy. This one was quite spot-on both in terms of texture and taste. I also bought a couple of baked goods to go for later. Those were delicious too. The staff members were the nicest people. They were knowledgeable and very happy to answer my questions regarding the ingredients. I just wish they were more eco-friendly. I ate in and was still given paper/plastic containers and utensils. \nPros: healthy vegan food, friendly & knowledgeable staff \nCons: surroundings, too much waste ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mercredi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veganbeanstalk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sat-sun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "genevajohnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryanguiot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "veganleaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avocadolover", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "lgbt center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grub hub", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "las vegas nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maryland pkwy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "happycow bronze cafe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bronze cafe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henderson", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-01T08:36:32.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85c673b25cc4d0da5644496f291297e6c8492165", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9YBahiYkR4_d94x9BOpHtJH7VuzoFhrmrSnXec0cZvD29GxMt0GZTkGtOop7vsqWn4-", "site_full": "www.happycow.net", "site": "happycow.net", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["food", "vegan"], "section_title": "", "title": "Frankie's East Side Pizza - Farmingdale New York Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "title_full": "Frankie's East Side Pizza - Farmingdale New York Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "published": "2017-11-01T04:04:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.209, "main_image": "https://d32d43o6swa2lo.cloudfront.net/venue_images/10/37/hcmp103775_320327_s3.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 40448, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85c673b25cc4d0da5644496f291297e6c8492165", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4P0TBgxkSaKkS5N6uRME54BaizS0Dm9YBahiYkR4_d94x9BOpHtJH7VuzoFhrmrSnXec0cZvD29GxMt0GZTkGtOop7vsqWn4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-11-01T04:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "Frankie's East Side Pizza - Farmingdale New York Veg-options Restaurant - HappyCow", "text": "Incredible Vegan Menu @ Frankie's - Edit Posted by PDA4Animals on 01 Nov 2017. Absolutely incredible vegan food from appetizers to main meals to desserts!!! Danny, the owner, is doing everything right here! He is so amazing for taking the steps to make our (vegan) lives easier, offering great tasting cruelty free options on a very long island with not many vegan places for us to conveniently enjoy! He is so personable and definitely makes you feel at home once you walk through the doors! And, very importantly, he sees how expensive it is for vegans to indulge and offers very generous weekly discounts to us for choosing to be cruelty free!!! My boyfriend and I went there today for the first time and ordered the vegan drumsticks, drunken grandma slice, whole large vegan pizza, vegetable ravioli, pineapple cake, banana cake, carrot cake, and zucchini cake. Yes all this just for the of us and totally worth it. Everything is homemade and so tasty, just so super satisfying. They impressed us one item after another. We couldn't even decide what was better than the other. Everything was incredible. We very highly recommend Frankie's East Side Pizza on Main Street in Farmingdale, you will be very satisfied with anything that you order. ENJOY!!! \nPros: Excelent food, Very fair pricing, Very friendly \nCons: N/A just began offering vegan, menu will be growin, N/A new vegan menu will be printed soon, N/A not fully vegan, but has great vegan options!
