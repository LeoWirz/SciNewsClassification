Ni a Aureoles Conejo ni a Sigala los vimos por aqu\u00ed, luego entonces aqu\u00ed no son fundadores\u201d.\nHabla luego de que ambos se autocalifican de \u201cecl\u00e9cticos\u201d y \u201cpragm\u00e1ticos y que con esas etiquetas han funcionado al interior del PRD.\nVergara Cruz, quien en d\u00edas pasados renunci\u00f3 al PRD para sumarse a las aspiraciones presidenciales de Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador sin incorporarse al Movimiento de Regeneraci\u00f3n Nacional (Morena), sostiene que \u201cel Pacto por M\u00e9xico fue una alianza del perredismo cupular, pragm\u00e1tico y ecl\u00e9ctico con el PRI y el PAN, que marc\u00f3 \u201cla ruptura definitiva entre quienes concebimos al PRD como un partido de real oposici\u00f3n al r\u00e9gimen priista\u201d.\n\u201cLas c\u00fapulas perredistas cedieron ante un modelo neoliberal en M\u00e9xico, contrario totalmente al pensamiento de izquierda que plantea la b\u00fasqueda de un modelo alternativo al neoliberalismo\u201d.\nFinalmente, remata que ese parteguas par\u00f3 pero no detuvo a quienes luchan por la justicia social y la equidad con la meta de edificar un estado democr\u00e1tico y constitucional que por la v\u00eda pac\u00edfica defienda la educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica, la salud p\u00fablica, el ejido, la comunidad ind\u00edgena y la autonom\u00eda de los

trait of author Grace Burrowes is that whether dabbling in suspense, bursting with atomic attraction or stepping into the throws of ecstasy, she never takes herself too seriously. There is just enough of the fantasy to captivate and entertain. No Other Duke Will Do spins a tale of friendship and seduction that starts with a relationship of convenience. Elizabeth and Julian are the stars of a cast of characters that look to charm their way into the heart as easily as they set up residence in the mind. \nEXCERPT \n\u201cI still want to kiss you, Elizabeth. Rather a lot.\u201d \n\u201cThat sentiment is mutual,\u201d she said, setting off at a brisk pace. \u201cBut where is it written that friends can never kiss, or otherwise express their attraction to each other?\u201d \n\u201cIt ought to be written somewhere,\u201d Haverford said, \u201cin great bold copperplate. Kissing leads to\u2014\u201d \n\u201cI know where it leads, Your Grace, in the general case. The destination has been sadly unimpressive on past visits. I\u2019d like to explore where kissing leads with you.\u201d \n\u201cYou are\u2014\u201d \n\u201cI am lonely too.\u201d And doubtless bound for marriage to some charming, boring viscount with clammy hands. \n\u201c\u2014quite fierce about this friendship business.\u201d His gaze was on the castle, and Elizabeth suspected he was trying not to smile. \n\u201cI\u2019m quite fierce about everything.\u201d And only now coming to admit it. \n\u201cWe shall be fierce friends then, for the duration of a house party. One shudders to think what mischief\u2026 What the devil is he doing here?\u201d \nA coach and four was rattling up the drive a quarter of a mile away. The horses were all white, exactly matched for gait and height, and pulling a black coach with red wheels. A single trunk was affixed to the back, though no crest adorned the door. \n\u201cIt appears you\u2019ve a late arriving guest.\u201d Or a bad fairy calling on the party, based on Haverford\u2019s expression. \n\u201cNot a guest, a problem. A most unwelcome problem.\u201d Windham Brides (Goodreads) \nABOUT THE AUTHOR \nGrace Burrowes grew up in central Pennsylvania and is the sixth out of seven children. She discovered romance novels when in junior high (back when there was such a thing), and has been reading them voraciously ever since.

La politique de Donald Trump et son comportement h\u00e9rissent les poils de milliers (de millions?) d'Am\u00e9ricains.

Une m\u00e8re c\u00e9libataire de 50 ans en a malheureusement fait les frais fin octobre. \nLe samedi 28, alors que Donald Trump se rendait au Trump National Golf Club, suivi comme toujours par des photographes, le cort\u00e8ge pr\u00e9sidentiel est pass\u00e9 \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 de Juli Briskman, la quinquag\u00e9naire en question qui circulait \u00e0 v\u00e9lo \u00e0 droite de la chauss\u00e9e. \nContre la politique migratoire du pr\u00e9sident, furieuse aussi pour la suppression d'Obamacare, comme pour la situation \u00e0 Porto Rico, Juli Birskman n'a pas support\u00e9 le voir passer \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9 d'elle pour aller prendre du bon temps et jouer au golf. C'est d'ailleurs ce qu'elle a expliqu\u00e9 lundi 6 dans son entretien au Huffington Post : \"Il est pass\u00e9 tout pr\u00e8s et mon sang n'a fait qu'un tour\" . Alors elle a lev\u00e9 le bras et lui a fait un beau doigt d'honneur . Elle a m\u00eame r\u00e9it\u00e9r\u00e9 le geste quelques m\u00e8tres plus loin, en retombant sur le cort\u00e8ge arr\u00eat\u00e9 \u00e0 un feu rouge. \nCela aurait pu en rester l\u00e0 mais l'instant a \u00e9t\u00e9 photographi\u00e9 et le clich\u00e9 a fait le tour d'Internet. Elle l'a m\u00eame utilis\u00e9 en photo de profil sur ses r\u00e9seaux sociaux .

REFORMAS EDUCATIVAS Lunes, 06   22:39 Dirigentes de gremios docentes de diferentes modalidades convocaron a una jornada de debate, prevista para el pr\u00f3ximo 17 de noviembre, en torno a las reformas educativas que encararon los gobiernos nacional y provincial y que generan incertidumbre y preocupaci\u00f3n entre los trabajadores del sector. Alertaron que las reformas se encaminan a socavar las bases del sistema de educaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica y gratuita. En conferencia de prensa, los dirigentes de los gremios de ADEP, CEDEMS, UDA, SADOP, ASDEA y ADIUNJU, anunciaron la convocatoria dirigida a todos los trabajadores de la educaci\u00f3n de Jujuy que ven con preocupaci\u00f3n el avance de reformas en diferentes programas y planes que no solo afectar\u00edan a los educadores sino tambi\u00e9n a la poblaci\u00f3n que seg\u00fan alertaron se ver\u00eda privada de un sistema p\u00fablico y gratuito. Precisaron que la jornada debate est\u00e1 prevista para el pr\u00f3ximo 17 de noviembre a partir de las 10 horas en instalaciones de la facultad de Ingenier\u00eda, aunque aclararon que la designaci\u00f3n del espacio quedar\u00e1 supeditada a la convocatoria que se logre. \u201cVamos a tratar diferentes problem\u00e1ticas educativas tanto a nivel nacional como provincial, pero hoy nos aflige por sobremanera la suspensi\u00f3n de diferentes carreras en los niveles inicial y primario de los diferentes Institutos de Formaci\u00f3n Docente; pero a la vez tambi\u00e9n contemplamos la incertidumbre que genera el denominado Pacto Social educativo del cual no tenemos todav\u00eda ning\u00fan avance\u201d, expuso en primer lugar el titular del gremio de educadores de nivel inicial y primario, Dar\u00edo Aban. Con acuerdo a estos primeros planteos el dirigente remarc\u00f3 que en diferentes oportunidades la dirigencia ha solicitado una mayor participaci\u00f3n de las instituciones gremiales en las instancias de definici\u00f3n de los contenidos del mencionado Pacto promovido por el gobierno, sin embargo, alert\u00f3 que hasta el momento el pedido no tuvo eco favorable entre las autoridades. Por su parte, el secretario adjunto de la Asociaci\u00f3n de Docentes E investigadores de la Universidad Nacional de Jujuy, Jos\u00e9 Del Frari, puso de relieve las expresiones de las principales autoridades del Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n de la Naci\u00f3n quienes se\u00f1alaron a los sectores gremiales como responsables del actual estado del sistema educativo. Sobre el particular dijo, \u201cel gobierno nacional ha definido que los sindicatos docentes no negocian no llevan adelante ninguna estrategia, por lo que estamos en una situaci\u00f3n en la que sobre educaci\u00f3n puede opinar cualquiera\u201d. \u201cFrente a esta situaci\u00f3n todos los gremios docentes estamos planteando llevarle informaci\u00f3n a los trabajadores para que vean que el recorte presupuestario es la base de todo, y que nosotros somos los que estamos fuera de contexto\u201d, explic\u00f3, aclarando que tras la jornada de debate se prev\u00e9 la convocatoria a un Congreso general de docentes para definir las acciones concretas a implementar en defensa del sistema educativo. Al mismo tiempo precis\u00f3 que los ejes de la discusi\u00f3n ser\u00e1n la implementaci\u00f3n del Plan Maestro, el Pacto Educativo provincial y paritarias. Respecto de este \u00faltimo punto los referentes de los gremios docentes estatales recordaron que hasta el momento el gobierno ha omitido sistem\u00e1ticamente la reapertura de las mesas de negociaci\u00f3n salarial a pesar de los compromisos asumidos en la anterior instancia de negociaci\u00f3n. A partir de ello, anticiparon que tras la jornada de debate y con miras al Congreso educativo sindical se definir\u00eda junto a los sectores de trabajadores estatales una serie de acciones para ratificar el pedido por reivindicaciones salariales", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "spanish", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [],

With a touch of humor and an abundance of heart and wisdom, Ms. Ridgway sets about making her presence known in an already mind blowing series. Zane is the jock, always on the lookout for his next adventure. Harper has gotten used to watching from the sidelines, now she\u2019s ready to try something different. Less watching, more doing. She\u2019s one step away from rethinking her approach when a matchmaking fur ball, takes a little gamble of his own. With an empowering message and an adorable cast of misfits, Christie Ridgway is on her way to stealing the show. View all my reviews About the Author: \nChristie Ridgway is a California native and author of over forty-five contemporary romances.

He has announced payment of pensions for ex-Biafran police officers who were granted presidential pardon in 2000. This is very commendable, given the backdrop of his leadership. In fact, it sounded too good to be real and I had personally done some checks to ensure I wasn\u2019t hooked to fake news when the copy came to my desk.\n\nIt was real! I tried to create an imagery to underscore the development. It was like defying all the psycho-motive variables and learning to be right-handed at 75. It was also forceful enough to question the fundamentals of nature and conclude that the snake can indeed transform both in skin and character.\n\nFolks who would not associate Buhari with any level of national broadmindedness would have been thoroughly disappointed. Buhari has become a born-again, even at 75. Truly, it is never too late to make paradise.\n\nREAD ALSO :  JUST IN: EFCC Traces Fresh N950m Diezani Loot To 2 PDP Ex-Governors, One Nabbed \n\nPayment of the pension reportedly commenced in Enugu on October 20 to 162 officers and 57 next-of-kins of deceased officers after due verification. I shall not exceed the given circumstances to invent a motive for this sudden love of Ndigbo by Buhari.\n\nSome people have said that the President who is facing increasing opposition to his re-election bid even within the APC has 2019 in mind. I sincerely do not know about that. If every kind gesture is selfishly motivated, the word \u2018philanthropy\u2019 will automatically lose its meaning and may have to be redefined.\n\nAnd so, whether it has become expedient or not for President Buhari to act nicely at this point in time, I have decided to congratulate him on his newly acquired spirit of one Nigeria. Congratulations Mr. President! He could choose to be nasty, and as we all know, nothing would happen. When people do well and they are told so, they tend to do more. And so it is with Buhari.\n\nEarlier, on October 12, while meeting with political leaders from the Southeast, comprising governors, ministers, the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu and Ohaneze leadership at the Aso Rock Villa, President Buhari had promised to complete the second Niger bridge, east-west road and the east-west coastal rail project before 2019.\n\nI will modify that to mean before May 29, 2019, which is about 19 months away. On a different date and occasion but same venue, President Buhari had also told a delegation of Niger Delta leaders that the east-west road, which former President Goodluck Jonathan, a son of the Niger Delta (emphasis is mine) failed to deliver would be completed by him, Buhari, before 2019.\n\nThese are very huge promises. What they effectively mean is that close to N2tr about the cost of the projects and about the budgets of all the 19 Northern States put together in 2016 will be graciously spent in the Southeast and Niger Delta before the next general election.\n\nAnd nobody is shouting: Hosanna! Hosanna! Blessed is he that comes in the name of the savior of the Southeast and South-south! That is not all.\n\nThe President at some other setting had told Ambassador Michael Zinner of Germany that: \u201cWe are studying the instruments of the Amnesty Programme inherited from previous administration with a view to carrying out commitments made that have not been delivered.\u201d\n\nWhat else are Nigerians or more specifically Southern Nigerians looking for in a statesman?\n\nAt this juncture, kindly permit the clich\u00e9, people saying Buhari is only the President of Northern Nigeria on the basis of alleged lopsided composition of his government of which 81 of 100 key government appointments including the service chiefs are said to be Moslems from the North, should shut-up and remain so.\n\nEnough is enough! We cannot continue to hit at an old man who is struggling to learn new tricks, in spite of himself, to please others including even his enemies.\n\nIf still in doubt about the new Buhari, consider the follow-up to the earlier gesture of payment of pension to ex-Biafran police officers. The President became uncharacteristically law abiding and great respecter and believer of court processes.\n\nTo the chagrin of critics, the federal government, which is the same thing as President Buhari, has agreed to pay, wait for it, a whooping N88b in these hard times as compensation to 493 identified civil war victims following a judgment of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) court.\n\nI don\u2019t think you people understand what Buhari has done! He has just made 493 Igbo families or even individuals multi-millionaires with each carting home about N180 million.\n\nActually, my father told me that an uncle of mine who was living in Abagana, in present day Anambra State, in the time of the civil war was tortured and killed in cold blood by federal troops allegedly led by Muhammadu Buhari who was then a lieutenant in the Nigerian Army.\n\nNothing is intended; I am only trying to put that vital piece of information in the public space just in case something like a search for next of kin crops up. I am the next of kin. My father also added that we (the OGBODOs) are somehow connected to Nsukka in Enugu State.\n\nKindly note too that the Buhari who is now obeying court orders and accepting consent judgment like an obedient school boy is the same as the Buhari who had blatantly and serially flouted the orders of the same ECOWAS court and courts in Nigeria regarding bail for incarcerated former National Security Adviser, Col Sambo Dasuki. There is nothing God cannot do.\n\nWe only need more prayers and fasting concerning other things like the nationalistic prosecution of the anti-corruption war and the will, even if it is half as strong as the will to deploy python dancers and smiling crocs, to tackle decisively the Fulani herdsmen and give farmers in the middle belt and elsewhere the peace of mind to produce food to feed the nation.\n\nIt is not all praises. There is yet an area where Buhari is lagging. Critics say as President, he has visited more cities in Europe, (especially in the United Kingdom, where he has spent almost equal number of days in London as he has spent in Aso Rock), America, Asia, the Middle East and even in Africa than he has visited cities in Nigeria.\n\nExcept to Daura, many of his scheduled visits to locations within the country including Lagos and Port Harcourt had been cancelled in the last minute.\n\nThe good news, however, is that I have heard from the grapevine, not through any of his spokesmen anyway, that the President is working seriously to redress this copious deficit in his presidential operations.\n\nAnd that very soon, he will be afield and everywhere in Nigeria talking to stakeholders, including IPOB members and Niger Delta militants, to build a national consensus that will make the clamour for the restructuring of the country sound stupid.\n\nIt has taken time and energy to move Buhari to this point where he is seeing far beyond Daura and clearly too. I am not too sure if he has been successfully pushed to the point where he cannot return to old ways. This is exactly why we must not relent.\n\nThe GOs and Imams must sustain the prayers and fasting to create a statesman out of Buhari. The man can simply refuse to move any further or more disturbingly, relapse into old ways, where, like a scorched snake, he will become more dangerous.\n\nGod will not allow that to happen. If anything, the mood is good for more miracles and something tells me that another batch of the kidnapped Chibok girls shall be secured from Boko Haram captivity in the weeks ahead. Somebody should shout a big amen to that!\n\nWe have all done well in getting Buhari to this glorious point. It remains to add that the prayer and fasting warriors should understand when to apply the brakes so that Buhari\u2019s case is not over pleaded before God. I don\u2019t think too many people would want him to unite Nigeria beyond 2019.\n\nAbraham Ogbodo is a columnist with Guardian Newspaper.\n\nAre you an artiste?

Asimismo alertaron que a partir de las medidas adoptadas por el empresariado se pone en riesgo la calidad del servicio que progresivamente se asigna a personal no calificado. La medida de fuerza que se cumpli\u00f3 ayer, repercuti\u00f3 particularmente en el cese de la atenci\u00f3n al p\u00fablico, no as\u00ed en el servicio de guardia y emergencia que estuvieron garantizados. El principal reclamo gir\u00f3 en torno a la ausencia de nueva convocatoria para rediscutir haberes del personal que demanda una recomposici\u00f3n superior al 16 por ciento para el segundo semestre del a\u00f1o en curso. Frente a dicho planteo la empresa tan solo llev\u00f3 a la mesa de negociaci\u00f3n un propuesta del 3,25 por ciento de recomposici\u00f3n hasta el mes de abril del 2018. El secretario de Prensa del Sindicato de trabajadores de Gasnor de Jujuy y Salta, Carlos Gafres, precis\u00f3 que la medida de fuerza obedeci\u00f3 a la negativa de la empresa de retomar las mesas paritarias para rediscutir las mejoras salariales que presentan un desfasaje en los \u00faltimos 10 a\u00f1os. \u201cNos siguen postergando a pesar de que ya se dieron varios aumentos y mejoras en tarifas con inversiones, pero para nosotros las respuestas no llegan\u201d, afirm\u00f3 el gremialista. As\u00ed pues sostuvo que los empresarios aluden permanentemente a los n\u00fameros en \u201crojo\u201d de la entidad que le impide otorgar una mejora conforme a las demandas de los trabajadores. Con acuerdo a ello record\u00f3 que \u201chace un a\u00f1o y medio resulta notorio el aumento en las boletas del servicio que llegan a los hogares, y diversos momentos los empresarios nos hicieron participar de las p\u00e9rdidas pero ahora en el momento de las ganancias no nos est\u00e1n haciendo part\u00edcipes\u201d. Respecto del alcance de la medida de protesta se\u00f1al\u00f3 que el paro abarc\u00f3 a las provincias de Jujuy, Salta, Santiago y Tucum\u00e1n, donde no hubo atenci\u00f3n al p\u00fablico y solo se respondieron a situaci\u00f3n de urgencia y emergencia. Se puntualiz\u00f3 que en caso de lograr una respuesta satisfactoria de parte del empresariado los trabajadores dispondr\u00edan en asamblea la continuidad de las medidas de fuerza. Por otro lado, el vocero aludi\u00f3 al rechazo frente al vaciamiento y tercerizaci\u00f3n de la actividad que dispuso la empresa y que pone en riesgo la calidad del servicio que se les brinda a los usuarios residenciales. \u201cSe est\u00e1 dando un vaciamiento lento, malicioso siniestro que est\u00e1n haciendo porque cada vez se presta un servicio que es magro y sin los cuidados que merece un servicio esencial\u201d, denunci\u00f3, acotando que tras los recientes aumentos de tarifas la empresa deber\u00eda orientarse a mejorar el servicio. Sin embargo, alert\u00f3 sobre una progresiva p\u00e9rdida de la calidad del servicio y los trabajos que debe realizar la empresa.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "spanish", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:32:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c98b4a9ffb6dbb65ea4c498f08675049a97d43c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaNLI71C3rY64hbM08cLtVfP_pRVfBKAz5s0s0Vph7RfVfqjiwRs3kWeSdhyAP6go1qavVwY0JnRAyeQFsqQjLeUIFlsujNdVulGCLVA2LN1etCSxQBfmFJ_z0Qothx2z1WmJP0xG2luec3sDNk1NsZjMkb_KUGEw-", "site_full": "www.upi.com", "site": "upi.com", "site_section": "https://www.upi.com/Sports_News/NFL/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "NFL News, Photos, Scores - UPI.com", "title": "Detroit Lions tackle Green Bay Packers behind Matthew Stafford", "title_full": "Detroit Lions tackle Green Bay Packers behind Matthew Stafford - UPI.com", "published": "2017-11-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.012, "main_image": "https://cdnph.upi.com/sv/ph/og/upi/5601510045006/2017/1/5e09973d5304136379d5be28a9f8e865/v1.5/Matthew-Stafford-Detroit-Lions-handle-Green-Bay-Packers-30-17.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3692, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 12, "comments": 0, "shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c98b4a9ffb6dbb65ea4c498f08675049a97d43c7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQaNLI71C3rY64hbM08cLtVfP_pRVfBKAz5s0s0Vph7RfVfqjiwRs3kWeSdhyAP6go1qavVwY0JnRAyeQFsqQjLeUIFlsujNdVulGCLVA2LN1etCSxQBfmFJ_z0Qothx2z1WmJP0xG2luec3sDNk1NsZjMkb_KUGEw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "upi.com", "published": "2017-11-07T11:59:00.000+02:00", "title": "Detroit Lions tackle Green Bay Packers behind Matthew Stafford", "text": "GREEN BAY, Wis. -- The Detroit Lions found the perfect remedy for a three-game losing streak.\nThe Green Bay Packers . \nMatthew Stafford threw his 200th career touchdown pass as the Lions beat the punchless Packers 30-17 on Monday night.\nStafford passed for 361 yards and two touchdowns. Detroit's Golden Tate had seven catches for 113 yards, and Marvin Jones had seven receptions for 107 yards and two touchdowns.\n\"We went into this game thinking that this needed to be a statement game,\" Tate said.\nA bye week did nothing to help the Packers (4-4). With Aaron Rodgers on injured reserve and Brett Hundley at quarterback, they have lost three in a row.\nDetroit (4-4) put the game away on a drive spanning the third and fourth quarters. Stafford's 25-yard completion to Jones on third-and-10 was the key play, making the Lions 6 of 9 on third down.\nOn first-and-goal at the 1, Packers linebacker Blake Martinez stripped the ball from running back Ameer Abdullah , but right tackle Ricky Wagner recovered. The Packers kept the Lions out of the end zone on second and third down, too, before Matt Prater 's 19-yard field goal made it 20-3.\nStill, the 17-point lead was too much for the Hundley-led Packers, who couldn't solve Detroit's defense.\n\"We just knew that he wouldn't be able to do the stuff that Aaron does at the line of scrimmage, so we wanted to go out there and make it tough for him,\" Lions cornerback Darius Slay said. \"He is a talented guy. He is an NFL quarterback, for sure, but we knew it would be tough for him to make all the checks like (Rodgers) does.\"\nHundley didn't surpass 100 passing yards until a 46-yard catch and run by Randall Cobb about four minutes into the fourth quarter. Hundley's 1-yard sneak pulled Green Bay within 20-10 with 9:52 remaining.\nDetroit immediately answered with a perfectly timed screen to running back Theo Riddick against a Packers blitz, resulting in a gain of 63 yards. One play later, Stafford threw his second touchdown pass of the night to Jones, an 11-yard connection that made it 27-10.\nAt that point, the 77,575 fans in attendance fled for the exits.\nThe Lions piled up 417 yards of offense and finished 8 of 13 on third down. The Packers finished with 311 yards -- 75 of those were on a garbage-time touchdown drive -- and were 2 of 9 on third down. That led to a time-of-possession disparity of nearly 14 minutes.\n\"I think really the biggest thing for us to improve on is third down and, frankly, defensively third down,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"They totally controlled the third-down battle tonight. I thought that was a huge factor in the game. We have work to do, and that's the fact of the matter. We've got to do it fast, and that's our plan. We got relatively healthy coming out of the bye. I thought we had a very good week of practice and we didn't play as well as Detroit tonight, and that's stating the obvious.\"\nBefore Rodgers sustained a broken collarbone, the Packers were averaging 27 points per game. In the three games with Hundley, they have scored 10, 17 and 17 points in losses to the Minnesota Vikings , New Orleans Saints and Detroit, respectively.\n\"Everybody wants to score five touchdowns, have a perfect quarterback rating and win,\" said Hundley, who completed 26 of 38 passes for 245 yards. \"This game was a step in the right direction. I think I did some good things. Obviously, it wasn't enough of them, but (the) first start for sure wasn't the breakout game everybody wants. There's ups and downs in everything. You can't be perfect all the time. I felt comfortable today. There were some good things done, and we've just got to make those big plays.\"\nStafford completed 26 of 33 passes.\n\"Those guys on the outside were doing a great job of winning,\" he said. \"I was just trying to get it to the open guy. All sorts of guys were winning. And when we can spread people out and use a bunch of weapons like we did tonight, we are at our best.\"\nNOTES: Detroit's Matthew Stafford is the fourth quarterback younger than 30 to throw 200 touchdown passes. ... For the second consecutive week, Detroit LT Greg Robinson was inactive. Brian Mihalik got the start. Mihalik exited with an undisclosed injury in the second quarter and was replaced by Emmett Cleary. With starter Taylor Decker on the physically unable to perform list, Cleary was the Lions' fourth-stringer at the position. ... Mihalik returned and caught Stafford's final pass of the night, a loss of 4 yards on a deflection. ... WR Marvin Jones, who caught six passes for 205 yards and two touchdowns in last year's game at Lambeau Field, has four touchdowns in four career games vs. Green Bay. ... The Packers had their No. 1 offensive line together for the second time all season, but RT Bryan Bulaga sustained an injured right knee in the fourth quarter. ... Green Bay QB Brett Hundley has thrown one touchdown pass in three games.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:32:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4a6e614f10ab53769f33708e4d089c44a87fd7e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU45hp6XMaVxB4o2hLhyS1kfPG1Rgn6vuCFnwguVrwxOcbvnzHGomR3HvckFbnQYH85uJcjMZ0Y620VnnGfaWrtoJmX1CWRuha2ALFSTPEjdM6A--", "site_full": "lashea677.tumblr.com", "site": "tumblr.com", "site_section": "http://lashea677.tumblr.com/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Lashea677", "title": "HAPPY BOOK WEEK: JACOB'S LADDER: GABE (JACOB'S LADDER) BY KATIE ASHLEY", "title_full": "HAPPY BOOK WEEK: JACOB'S LADDER: GABE (JACOB'S LADDER) BY KATIE ASHLEY", "published": "2017-11-07T07:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://78.media.tumblr.com/ec74accdf1c7938ee92b6c56aaf6bdd0/tumblr_inline_oyygksLB6V1tnsjcc_540.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4a6e614f10ab53769f33708e4d089c44a87fd7e2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/SEMpReyPU45hp6XMaVxB4o2hLhyS1kfPG1Rgn6vuCFnwguVrwxOcbvnzHGomR3HvckFbnQYH85uJcjMZ0Y620VnnGfaWrtoJmX1CWRuha2ALFSTPEjdM6A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-11-07T07:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "HAPPY BOOK WEEK: JACOB'S LADDER: GABE (JACOB'S LADDER) BY KATIE ASHLEY", "text": "Kobo: http://bit.ly/2wIbRvL \nAs the lead songwriter for Jacob\u2019s Ladder, the last thing Gabe Renard needs is a debilitating case of writer\u2019s block. After years of meaningless one night stands, he\u2019s finding it hard to pen the love-filled ballads the label is requesting. In an effort to clear his mind, Gabe takes his jeep off-roading in the North Georgia Mountains. When a wrong-turn leads to him getting stuck more than just creatively, he\u2019s forced to call for help. To his surprise, the \u201cRay\u201d who has been sent by Hart Wreckers to his aid is actually \u201cRae\u201d\u2014a sexy-as-hell spitfire in a pair of tight-as-hell jeans. The combination of Rae\u2019s sassy mouth and rocking body might be the inspiration Gabe needs. But for the first time since becoming a rock star, his advances have been shot down. \nReagan Hart has never been a fan of musicians. In fact, just the mention of one might cause her to throw a tire tool. Her disgust for them started when she was just eight and her mother ran off with a traveling country singer, and it only worsened when at seventeen, her rocker boyfriend knocked her up before blowing out of town. As a single mother taking care of her family\u2019s collision business, Rae doesn\u2019t have time for hook ups, much less a relationship. And if she did make time, a musician would be last on her list, even one as good-looking as Gabe Renard. \nCan Gabe find the words to prove not only to Rae, but himself, that she\u2019s the only one for him? \nREVIEW : JACOB\u2019S LADDER: GABE (JACOB\u2019S LADDER) BY KATIE ASHLEY \nMy rating: 4 of 5 stars Jacob\u2019s Ladder: Gabe (Jacob\u2019s Ladder) by Katie Ashley \nHe\u2019s a rock star, with the world at his feet. She\u2019s a single mother and business owner working to make ends meet. Gabe and Rae come from different worlds, but they have one thing in common. Responsibility. He has a band that counts on his talent with words to keep the fans happy and the money coming in. She has a family relying on her to keep the business in the red. Neither has the time for romance, but a chance meeting strikes a chord to the heart. I love a good fairy tale and Ms. Ashley delivered a bit of that with Gabe and Rae. She also went beyond the superficial by giving both characters a depth that is sometimes lacking in romance.

Anno Distillers was founded in Marden in 2011 and wants to grow revenues and production after increasing sales by 45% each year since it sold its first gin in 2013. Its founders Dr Andrew Reason and Dr Norman Lewis launched the fundraising initiative on Monday and had already raised a more than a third of their target on the opening day. \nDr Andy Reason is co-founder of Anno Distillers The former GlaxoSmithKline scientists say investors, who can put in as little as \u00a3100, can \u201cbe part of the gin revolution\u201d which has seen sales reach a record \u00a31 billion in the UK last year. The pair want to use the investment, in exchange for 25% equity in the company, to change the business \u201cfrom a product-led to a sales-led company\u201d as they aim to capitalise on growing thirst for luxury gin. Total sales across the country are expected to exceed \u00a31.3 billion by 2020, outstripping blended whiskey, while UK exports are predicted to pass \u00a3500 million this year. Dr Reason said: \u201cOur ambition for Anno Distillers is to create a luxury British spirits brand drawing on our experience as research and development chemists managing international groups in one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. \nThe opening of the Anno Distillers factory in Marden with, from left, sales and marketing manager Kim Reason, co-founder Dr Andy Reason, Helen Grant MP and co-founder Dr Norman Lewis \u201cMore and more discerning consumers are willing to pay for high quality and innovation. \u201cThese factors are fuelling premiumisation of the gin market, rapid growth in the craft sector and erosion of the market share of mass-produced spirits. \u201cAnno Distillers is well placed to satisfy this growing need and to take a greater share of the expanding market opportunity.\u201d If the campaign on crowdfunding website Seedrs is successful, the company will expand its sales team and increase marketing efforts. Its bosses also want to increase its production capacity to meet increasing demand, which they believe can increase annual turnover to \u00a32.4 million by 2020. \nAnno Distillers makes a range of spirits To date, all investment in plant, premises and staff has been self-funded. The motivation to raise the money through crowdfunding is part of the company\u2019s marketing strategy. Dr Reason said he wants investors \u201cto act as brand ambassadors to spread the word about Anno products\u201d. Since launching, the company has received more than 20 awards and accolades, which its founders say its thanks to their scientific background in the distillation process. Its customers include Majestic Wines, English Heritage, Shepherd Neame and Booker. Dr Lewis added: \u201cOur products are high-quality, complex, involving and very smooth.\u201d Join the debate...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:32:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e6338d893b629b480c28885ad4ab5871a8f666bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWNnPSytmqEwii4qNxviH1YnaYO1fuoWTfJm3h4rIC4WjJcX14As8HWVRq6BGpjwWKNfTQRbvSBU2yk_C0QwfitzaYOFv5vqxSFhZuznO1khw--", "site_full": "noiretvafrica.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://noiretvafrica.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NoireTV Africa on Verizon Fios Channel 269", "title": "FRSC To Induct Actress, Media Gurus As Ambassadors.", "title_full": "FRSC To Induct Actress, Media Gurus As Ambassadors.", "published": "2017-11-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e6338d893b629b480c28885ad4ab5871a8f666bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJWNnPSytmqEwii4qNxviH1YnaYO1fuoWTfJm3h4rIC4WjJcX14As8HWVRq6BGpjwWKNfTQRbvSBU2yk_C0QwfitzaYOFv5vqxSFhZuznO1khw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "OLUSEUN (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-11-07T11:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "FRSC To Induct Actress, Media Gurus As Ambassadors.", "text": "If  you live in the USA, NoireTV now showingnationwide on Verizon Fios on channel 269.

November 2017 \nHab eine Frau angel\u00e4chelt. In der Bahn. Nur ganz kurz und sie schaute auch sofort angewidert weg. Was sie nicht wusste: man kann Menschen auch anl\u00e4cheln, ohne mit ihnen reden/bumsen oder gemeinsam Kehrwoche machen zu wollen \u2013 zum Beispiel, weil sie wahnsinnig gut oder irgendwie witzig aussehen, weil\u2019s halt einfach freundlich ist oder eben, naja: weil die Frau einen stattlichen Rotzbollen am linken Nasenloch h\u00e4ngen hatte. Also, von mir aus gesehen links. Von ihrer Seite aus war das rechts. \nManchmal ist es wichtig, den Blickwinkel zu ber\u00fccksichtigen \u2013 es \u00e4nderte dennoch \u00fcberhaupt nichts an der Tatsache, dass sich der Popel fast poetisch an die Au\u00dfenseite ihres Nasenfl\u00fcgels schmiegte. Wie so ein Kunstwerk. Ich verzichtete nat\u00fcrlich darauf, sie auf den Rotzbollen anzusprechen. Man m\u00f6chte schlie\u00dflich nicht aufdringlich erscheinen. \nEs erscheint mir aufdringlich genug, dass 13 % der Deutschen zu wissen glauben, wovor sich die anderen 87% gef\u00e4lligst zu f\u00fcrchten haben. Das sind Leute, zu egoistisch, irgendwas zu teilen \u2013 aber wenn\u2019s um Hass oder Angst geht, haben sie pl\u00f6tzlich die Spendierhosen an. Nur ein paar Stationen sp\u00e4ter beschimpfte mich schon eine alte Dame, und das, obwohl ich nur bl\u00f6d an der Haltestelle stand und auf die n\u00e4chste Bahn wartete, so wie man eben auf eine Bahn wartet, die dann hoffentlich gleich kommt. Doch die Hemmschwelle f\u00fcr \u00f6ffentlichen Verbaldurchfall ist derzeit so weit unten wie der Anstand von Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. \nDie Dame durchschaute mich allerdings, zumindest grunzte sie, ganz grob, wie sehr sie von Gesindel wie mir die Schnauze voll h\u00e4tte. Ich solle gef\u00e4lligst dorthin verschwinden, wo ich hergekommen sei. \nIch: \u201eH\u00e4?\u201c \nSie: \u201e!%\u00a7\u201c\u00a7/\u00a7%??!!!\u201c \nDa sie derart bockig war, beschloss ich, ihr unter keinen Umst\u00e4nden anzuvertrauen, dass dies sowieso meine urspr\u00fcngliche Absicht war: Dort hinzugehen, wo ich herkomme. Heslach. Wenn ich ehrlich bin, dachte ich sogar \u201eFucking Heslach!\u201c. Sagte ich nat\u00fcrlich nicht, weil haupts\u00e4chlich Doofe so reden. Au\u00dferdem: Es gibt Bahnlinien, in deren Einzugsgebiet die Kommunikation sehr gro\u00df geschrieben wird. Manche Leute reden da sogar mit sich selbst. \nAber manchmal ist man halt etwas unsicher. Bin ja oft genug selbst w\u00fctend, das muss dann raus, wie so ein Hund. M\u00f6hringen bietet in solchen Fallen ungeahnte Chancen. Wenn ich w\u00fctend bin, \u00fcberlege ich mir zum Beispiel, was besser f\u00fcr diese Ecke der Stadt w\u00e4re: Mal ordentlich durchgentrifizert zu werden oder doch so ein G20-Gipfel. Und das alles nur, weil mir ein Furz quer h\u00e4ngt und die Wut irgendwo raus muss \u2013 und ich wohne nicht mal dort. Andererseits, richtig schlimm wird\u2019s erst, wenn Matratzen Concord im Stadtteil die Filiale aufgibt und daf\u00fcr ein D\u00e4nisches Bettenlager einzieht. Da wird die Bahn dann zum Geschenk des Himmels, so wie der Hafen in Hamburg. Man kann tr\u00e4umen oder halt ganz schnell weg. \nAls ich endlich wieder in Fucking Heslach war, atmete ich tief durch. Ein wildfremdes Kind l\u00e4chelte mich schief durch die Zahnl\u00fccken an, ein Typ sprach mit sich selbst, der Kerl aus dem Tabakladen gr\u00fc\u00dfte freundlich und erkundigte sich, ob ich mit den Zigaretten aufgeh\u00f6rt oder was ich sonst f\u00fcr eine Ausrede vorzubringen h\u00e4tte, schon seit zwei Tagen nicht mehr bei ihm am Tresen gestanden zu haben. \nDie Truppe vom Punkerladen schr\u00e4g gegen\u00fcber war auch da \u2013 kurz abklatschen, Bl\u00f6dsinn reden, lachen. Ronny den Hund, hab ich auch gesehen. Er sagte aber lieber nichts. Der wei\u00df genau, dass ich ihn auf dem Kieker habe, seit er mal meinem Hundem\u00e4dchen so lange beim Spielen zugeguckt hat, bis sie ersch\u00f6pft war \u2013 und dann versuchte, sie zu bumsen. Streng genommen w\u00fcnsche ich mir ja, dass die H\u00fcndin gl\u00fccklich und lesbisch ist. Ich kenne V\u00e4ter, die \u00e4hnlich \u00fcber die Zukunft ihrer T\u00f6chter denken. \nVerzeihung, ich schweife ab. Der Mann am Tresen vom Yayla Kebab, der im Sommer immer sehr schwitzen muss, gr\u00fc\u00dfte auch freundlich aus dem Laden heraus, fragte, was derzeit so anliegt und sprach dann die magischen Worte: \u201eHalloumi, oder?\u201c , Ich: \u201eNaguuut, Okeee.\u201c \nZahn\u00e4rztin durch die Fensterscheibe gegr\u00fc\u00dft (hatte Feierabend), noch\u2019n Ayran auf Ex weggepumpt, \u201eTsch\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\u201c und \u201eDankesch\u00f6n\u201c gesagt und dann ab nach Hause. Auf dem Zebrastreifen vor dem Haus h\u00e4tte mich fast noch einer mit dem SUV Mittelklasse-Panzer \u00fcberfahren, bremste aber noch rechtzeitig. Autos mit derartigen Ausma\u00dfen vermitteln mitunter den Eindruck, man sei alleine auf der Welt. \nEr: \u201eSooorrryyyy!\u201c \nIch: \u201ePassiert, kein Problem.\u201c \nManchmal macht mich das alles so ekelhaft milde, dass ich vor lauter \u201ePeace, Love & Understanding\u201c fast noch die verkackten Tauben an der Ecke zum Essen eingeladen h\u00e4tte. Nix daran ist lustig, das wusste schon Elvis Costello. Doch wenn ein Tag so zu Ende geht, kann der Morgen gerne wieder kommen. Da ist schlie\u00dflich eine Wahrheit, die es zu verteidigen gilt. \nUnd: \u201e\u00d6hm, Verzeihung. Sie haben da etwas Popel an der Nase h\u00e4ngen\u201c \nFoto: \u00a9 Heiko Hermann", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "german", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:32:49.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "69b10d99ece0b0e3af9fbb5528127d1de9f43e65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqwVEBNS8V3Elmxsb.Jl2loOqACbrvh0MLOguOoVSXQukI9DDf7iZmbEV5h23Ni3jmcOZ.346Kpnqypx4CZHXckEgrsUOy0qOpqjt8GIJXSo3", "site_full": "www.thesun.co.uk", "site": "thesun.co.uk", "site_section": "http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/rss/", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Football news - transfers, fixtures, scores, pictures | The Sun", "title": "Tony Pulis forgets West Brom woes as he sunbathes in Barbados with his wife", "title_full": "Tony Pulis forgets West Brom woes as he sunbathes in Barbados with his wife", "published": "2017-11-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/sport-preview-tony-pulis-holiday.jpg?strip&#x3D;all&amp;quality&#x3D;100&amp;w&#x3D;1200&amp;h&#x3D;800&amp;crop&#x3D;1", "performance_score": 8, "domain_rank": 2180, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 819, "comments": 5, "shares": 819}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "69b10d99ece0b0e3af9fbb5528127d1de9f43e65", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQD1RVKFqxhqwVEBNS8V3Elmxsb.Jl2loOqACbrvh0MLOguOoVSXQukI9DDf7iZmbEV5h23Ni3jmcOZ.346Kpnqypx4CZHXckEgrsUOy0qOpqjt8GIJXSo3", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "jhutchinson", "published": "2017-11-07T10:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Tony Pulis forgets West Brom woes as he sunbathes in Barbados with his wife", "text": "BEACHED WALE Tony Pulis forgets West Brom woes as he sunbathes in Barbados with his wife \nWest Brom are on a torrid run of just two wins in 20 league games - prompting owner Guochuan Lai to fly in for the next game against Chelsea Pictured 7th November 2017, 8:05 am Updated: 7th November 2017, 12:09 pm Comments TONY PULIS is under big pressure at West Brom so decided to de-stress by taking a holiday to Barbados. \nThe Welsh manager is fighting for his future at the Premier League strugglers as he battles a crisis in results and mounting opposition from supporters.

Las expresiones de la dirigente de los docentes del sector privado aluden a la convocatoria a debatir los alcances de las diferentes reformas que prev\u00e9n tanto el gobierno nacional como el provincial y que impactar\u00edan directamente en las condiciones laborales de los educadores, pero por sobre marcar\u00eda un cambio en el sistema educativo p\u00fablico y gratuito. Con acuerdo a ello la jornada de debate prevista para el 17 de noviembre tiene el objetivo de informar, proveer documentaci\u00f3n y debatir la postura que se adoptar\u00e1 frente a las pretendidas reformas que conllevar\u00edan el Plan Maestro, el programa Secundaria del Futuro, el Plan Estrat\u00e9gico, el Sistema de Reconocimiento Acad\u00e9mico y otros programas a nivel provincia, como el Pacto Social Educativo. Al brindar una referencia del contexto actual en el que se encuentran los educadores frente a esa serie de reformas, Valverde sostuvo, \u201cconsideramos que los docentes debemos ser protagonistas en las instancias de cambio en educaci\u00f3n pero lamentablemente en este momento ni a nivel nacional con el Plan Maestro, ni a nivel provincial con el Pacto Social Educativo, contamos con los elemento suficientes para llevar informaci\u00f3n a nuestros docentes para poder realizar la cr\u00edtica que corresponda\u201d. A continuaci\u00f3n afirm\u00f3 que es \u201cgrande la incertidumbre\u201d entre la comunidad docente respecto de los verdaderos objetivos de las diferentes reformas promovidas por los Estados nacional y provincial, m\u00e1s a\u00fan si se considera que existe una serie de indicios que aluden a una intenci\u00f3n de generar profundos cambios en la estructura del sistema educativo. Con relaci\u00f3n a ello, sostuvo que \u201ces obligaci\u00f3n de los dirigentes llevar a cada uno de los docentes informaci\u00f3n necesaria para que saquen sus propias conclusiones\u201d. Consultada sobre la situaci\u00f3n particular de los docentes privados la titular de SADOP record\u00f3 que desde hace varios meses el gobierno sistem\u00e1ticamente ha excluido de las mesas de negociaci\u00f3n a los dirigentes de ese sector, en una actitud que contradice el contexto nacional en el que el gremio participa activamente de las paritarias. \u201cConsideramos que esa medida es totalmente arbitraria porque el sistema educativo es uno solo pero el gobierno de la provincia dej\u00f3 a todos los docentes privados sin la posibilidad de poder discutir sus salarios\u201d, afirm\u00f3. A partir de esta primera apreciaci\u00f3n no dud\u00f3 al afirmar que \u201ces un momento muy complicado porque m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de que no fuimos convocados todos, los sectores docentes est\u00e1n preocupados (\u2026) se vive una incertidumbre muy grande y para colmo los aumentos de sueldos fueron m\u00ednimos por lo que la situaci\u00f3n es muy grave, y a ello hay que sumar el hecho de que se pierde presentismo\u201d.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "spanish", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:32:49.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52646fee1072f77d31e98736d18b8d5f6ff8a7aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7gV6goSZf1BFmjAyav8Y.I-", "site_full": "pastebin.com", "site": "pastebin.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "", "title_full": "", "published": "2017-11-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1737, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52646fee1072f77d31e98736d18b8d5f6ff8a7aa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS19Sauqk8gS7gV6goSZf1BFmjAyav8Y.I-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-11-07T11:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "\u201cI said sit!\u201d Katie felt a plastic hand on her shoulder that turned her around.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Katie cried out as she kicked and wriggled trying to free herself.\r\n\r\nThe robot teacher would not be denied and she wrapped her impossibly strong arms around Katie\u2019s waist. Katie was carried to a seemingly random seat in the middle of the room and placed in the chair. She tried to escape but the teacher held her down.\r\n\r\n\u201cNaughty girl!\u201d The robot chastised Katie who suddenly felt something wrap itself around her ankles.\r\n\r\nThe robot backed away and walked back to the white board. Katie immediately tried to get up again but quickly realised her legs were now restrained against the chair which itself was fastened to the floor.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat are you doing? What\u2019s going on!?\u201d Katie cried out. She could feel tears in her eyes that she tried to blink away. Panic began to set in very quickly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to teach you.\u201d The robot replied dispassionately, \u201cDid you bring a pen?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWha\u2026 No\u2026\u201d Katie said confused, \u201cWait\u2026 Is this a test?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cDidn\u2019t bring your own pen? Are you sure you are in the right classroom? Maybe you would be better off with the younger children.\u201d The robot said as it made the mechanical steps back to Katie\u2019s desk with a bunch of papers in its hand, \u201cAnd yes. This is a test.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie looked down as the teacher-bot placed a large stack of papers on her desk. The top page had the words \u201cBasic Educational Test \u2013 Grade 7\u201d in big red letters. A pen was placed next to the stack of paper and the robot turned towards the front of the room again.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou have one hour.\u201d The teacher said as it sat down at the desk. It stared at Katie and never moved. It was spooky in the extreme.\r\n\r\nKatie was going to ask what she was meant to do but the thought occurred to her again that maybe this was part of whatever internship process she was now going through. Besides, this was a test meant for young teenagers, surely Katie could breeze through it. Since she was trapped in the seat anyway, she picked up the paper and turned to the first page of the test.\r\n\r\nKatie could feel her heart rate slowing down as she took some deep breaths and she tried to calm her frayed nerves.\r\n\r\nKatie read through the opening question and furrowed her brow. The question was almost incomprehensible in its complexity. It was some crazily long equation with more letters in it than numbers. Katie had done a degree in English Literature and this math was way out of her league. This was supposed to be a test for young teenagers but these questions looked like they belonged in a post-graduate course.\r\n\r\nKatie flicked through multiple pages and found that the questions only seemed to get more and more complex.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 Can\u2019t do this.\u201d Katie said as she felt her panic rising again and she looked up at the robot in the corner.\r\n\r\nThe teacher stood up in its mechanical way and picked up some more papers. It walked around the desk and over to Katie\u2019s seat.\r\n\r\n\u201cMaybe this is more your speed.\u201d The teacher said with a clear condescending tone.\r\n\r\nThe robot picked up the previous test and dropped a new one in front of Katie. The robot walked back to the teacher\u2019s desk and sat down again.\r\n\r\nKatie shook her head slightly in confusion about everything that was happening. For the first time she really looked around the room. A large window against one wall was allowing sunlight to stream inside and providing a lot of natural light. Outside the window was just empty and flat desert, no sign of anything other than a few small plants.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the classroom was just like a school that Katie would have attended years ago. As she shifted in her seat she was reminded of the restraints holding her ankles to the chair, that was the one obvious difference between this classroom and the ones Katie remembered\u2026 That, and the robotic teacher of course.\r\n\r\nKatie turned over the first page of this new test and was almost insulted by what she saw. Instead of the advanced calculus and algebra, now it was simple sums that any small child would be expected to know.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d Katie asked, \u201cIf this is some kind of test for the job\u2026 I can\u2019t do really complex math but I can do better than this.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo talking during the test, little girl!\u201d The robot teacher said with a slightly angered tone, \u201cYou have been nothing but trouble since you arrived.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Katie felt victimised. She had no idea what was going on and was still just trying to keep herself together.\r\n\r\n\u201cShh!\u201d The robot teacher said causing Katie to close her mouth.\r\n\r\nKatie wiped a tear from her eye and sniffed but did as she was told. She picked up her pen and meekly started answering the questions. She tried to distract her distressed brain by doing the sums on the paper. It\u2019s amazing how when you are feeling so overwhelmed, doing something so simple can just consume your mind.\r\n\r\nThe sums weren\u2019t hard but they were extremely boring. Time ticked by at a snail\u2019s pace and Katie found herself almost drifting off.\r\n\r\nFor an hour Katie found herself torn between sleepiness, confusion and embarrassment about what she was made to do. She cursed her own timidity that stopped her from resisting harder. She still thought this could all be some kind of test about pressure situations or something and she was doing her best to stay composed.\r\n\r\n\u201cTime\u2019s up.\u201d The robot said rather suddenly causing Katie to jump.\r\n\r\nKatie had been almost asleep when the robot suddenly spoke up and she quickly put her pen down. She closed up the papers and watched as the teacher walked over to pick them up. She hoped that maybe now she would get some answers but the teacher just took her test papers and turned around again.\r\n\r\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d Katie asked tentatively.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is the end of the test.\u201d The robotic teacher said as she placed the test papers on her desks.\r\n\r\nSo Katie was right! This had all been a test. Katie smiled to herself, she was glad she had stuck it out and maintained her composure for the most part. She sat and waited for the leg restraints to undo. She expected some man in a suit would come through the door and explain everything to her, maybe shake her hand and let her know how she did. It really was a very strange way of testing potential applicants though; it must be a European method or something.\r\n\r\n\u201cSo\u2026 Can I go?\u201d Katie asked when nothing had happened for a minute.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d The teacher stated simply.\r\n\r\n\u201cUgh\u2026 Can I use the phone then?\u201d Katie asked as she slumped in her seat slightly. She was telling herself not to get angry, \u201cSo I can let my Mom know I\u2019m OK.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNo.\u201d The robot replied.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Katie asked as her irritation started rising.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou were informed that the process is around five days long.\u201d The robotic teacher said, \u201cNo contact with the outside world is permitted during the process.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Katie muttered, \u201cA prison?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe door at the front of the classroom opened and the leg restraints withdrew. The teacher stared at Katie with her unblinking face and raised her arm as if to show her the door.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is lunch time.\u201d It said dispassionately, \u201cThis way please.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie stood up and walked reluctantly forwards. The door she had entered through was still shut and sealed so she walked to the front of the room and slowly walked out of the door in trepidation. She could hear the mechanical footsteps of the robot behind her. The corridor only had one door at the end of it so Katie made her way forwards and towards it.\r\n\r\nKatie just couldn\u2019t get over how truly surreal all of this was. Where was everyone else that must normally work here? Why did it seem set up for so many people when there was only one person here? What was all this for? There were just so many questions that Katie could hardly believe this wasn\u2019t all a dream. The fact she was told she wasn\u2019t allowed contact with anyone made her really concerned though.\r\n\r\nPushing open the door, Katie found herself walking into a fairly large cafeteria. There was a bunch of long tables with chairs to the sides of them. A red rope showed where the queue was supposed to be and with the robo-teacher breathing down her neck she followed the rope, grabbed a tray and walked up to the counter.\r\n\r\nBehind the counter were more robots, almost exactly identical versions of the one that had been trying to teach her and she shuddered as she looked around at them all staring at her. Tentatively, Katie held out her tray to the canteen machines.\r\n\r\nThe machine closest too her took the tray and shovelled a large ladleful of a strangely lumpy mush on to a plate that was then placed on the tray. The tray was passed down the line of the robots who contributed a small amount of vegetables and a couple of slices of bread to the tray. The last machine added a small apple juice box with a straw on the side.\r\n\r\nKatie took the tray back and looked down at it with a mixture of disgust and revulsion. The food looked anything but appetising, she wasn\u2019t even sure what the lumpy mush was supposed to be.\r\n\r\nKatie looked around at all the empty seats in the room before taking one at random and sitting down with her tray in front of her. She poked the creamy mush with her plastic fork and tried to imagine it was something a lot more appetising. It wasn\u2019t easy to do.\r\n\r\nKatie looked to the side of her and saw all the canteen robots were staring at her. The one that had been with her in the classroom was standing a little way behind her. The way they stared at her made Katie extremely uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nAs Katie considered the food in front of her and thought about not being allowed to make contact with people outside the facility she felt a deep sense of foreboding. This was not a good situation, the idea of this being a test was increasingly disappearing and being replaced with the idea that this was some kind of sick experiment.\r\n\r\nActing on impulse, Katie stood up. The chair she was sitting on pushed behind her slightly as she looked around at the sinister faces that were staring straight back at her.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease sit down, Katie.\u201d The robot closest to her said. It took a menacing step forwards.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo hell with you!\u201d Katie shouted.\r\n\r\nPicking up the chair she had been sat on, Katie threw it as hard as her small body frame would allow at the machine. The chair hit it square in the chest and bounced off, it staggered backwards slightly but didn\u2019t fall.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are being unruly.\u201d The robot said without a hint of emotion.\r\n\r\nKatie looked around at the machines around her and realised that taking down one of these things would be very difficult, taking down all of them would be nearly impossible. The robots were advancing on her slowly. It was clear they wanted to quell the threat and they were slowly trying to surround the young woman.\r\n\r\nLooking around the room, the only exit that Katie could see was the one she had come through in the first place. She took off towards it, running hard and fast she wanted to find an exit and wanted to find it now. To hell with the money, there was something really weird about this place and Katie needed to leave.\r\n\r\nThe only door Katie could find was the one that lead to the horrid classroom. Remembering the door at the back of that room that went to the lobby, Katie hesitated for a second and then shoved the door open.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d Katie began running through the classroom but slowed and stopped in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nKatie knew that she had come back to the same room as before, there were no other doors to go through after all. So why was this room so different to the classroom from the morning?\r\n\r\nAll the desks that had filled the room had disappeared. In their stead was a low plastic table, red in colour, and little seats next to it. They were meant for kids of pre-school age. The teacher\u2019s desk in the corner was the same but everything around it had changed. Around the two tables were piles of toys haphazardly strewn around the room.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the room were suddenly covered in posters and pictures that would be appropriate for a young child. Posters of the alphabet, of numbers and of things like dinosaurs covered the walls as well as art work that looked like it was finger painting by a very young child.\r\n\r\nEverything was a lot more colourful than before and Katie wondered how the room had transformed so quickly. It was as if someone had waved a magic wand and transformed the whole room.\r\n\r\nKatie shook her head to clear her thoughts and then ran to the back of the room. She found the area where the door was and tried to pry it open again. Just like the last time she had tried to do this, there was no way through the securely locked door.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are being very naughty.\u201d Came the robotic voice that made Katie\u2019s skin crawl.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust\u2026 Just let me go!\u201d Katie pleaded as tears welled up in her eyes. She smacked her hands against the door in frustration.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe internship hasn\u2019t finished.\u201d The robot said dispassionately as it advanced on Katie.\r\n\r\nKatie pulled back her hand and prepared to defend herself. She knew she was outnumbered and outmatched but she had to at least try to fight these horrid machines. Katie went to swing her fist forwards but found she couldn\u2019t move it, a sudden feeling of something grasping her arm near her elbow held her arm in place.\r\n\r\nTurning her head to the side she saw a long black tube with a mechanical hand at the end. It had come out of the ceiling above the door and grabbed the girl\u2019s arm. Katie looked up in horror at where the restraining limb was coming from. This technology was incredible, if Katie hadn\u2019t been so fearful and embarrassed by what was happening she would have marvelled at what she was seeing.\r\n\r\nWhilst Katie was looking away the robo-teacher walked forward and put one of its mechanical hands on Katie\u2019s shirt and tie. Katie didn\u2019t even have time to look down before the machine pulled hard and ripped the schoolgirl clothes off of her body leaving her bare from the waist up.\r\n\r\n\u201cArgh!\u201d Katie felt mortified at being so suddenly exposed and she used her free hand to try and cover her modesty even if there didn\u2019t seem to be anyone around to see her.\r\n\r\nKatie wasn\u2019t even allowed this little bit of modesty as she felt her free arm get grabbed by another of the mechanical limbs and pulled away from her body leaving her totally exposed. Katie could no longer stop the tears and as she blinked she felt the salty liquid rolling down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nKatie watched as the robot\u2019s horribly cold hand now took hold off of her skirt and her underwear underneath it. It paused for just a couple of seconds.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Katie almost whispered in fear.\r\n\r\nThe robot showed no emotion or even any sign that it had heard Katie. It simply pulled very suddenly and ripped the skirt and underwear off of the girl leaving her completely naked except for her socks, these were swiftly pulled off by the robot as Katie blushed and cried out more loudly.\r\n\r\n\u201cCalm down.\u201d The robotic teacher said with very little empathy.\r\n\r\nKatie blushed furiously as she stood fully exposed and naked in the pre-school classroom. She wanted to cover herself up but it was impossible as her hands were held out and away from her body. She took great shuddering breaths as the tears flowed freely from her face. What could this horrible robot want to do with her next?\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Katie pleaded, \u201cMy family have money! They will pay you, just let me go!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot walked over to the teacher\u2019s desk in the corner and picked up a pile of clothes that it carried back over to the Katie. The teacher placed the clothes on a table at the back of the room and looked at Katie with its cold and emotionless eyes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWill you get dressed?\u201d The robot asked, \u201cOr do I need to dress you?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I can do it.\u201d Katie said through gritted teeth as she tried to control her emotions.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you try to run away you will be caught.\u201d The robot continued, \u201cAnd punished.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie felt the grip on her arms release and she pulled her hands back to her side. She rubbed her wrists which were a little red from the strong grip she had been subjected to for the last few minutes. She was grateful to be able to cover herself up and try to regain some modesty and she hurriedly sorted through the small pile of clothes.\r\n\r\nWithout taking much time to think about what she was putting on, Katie first grabbed the panties that were on the top. They were a pastel pink colour and had a picture of a Disney princess on the front. They looked like the sort of panties a very young girl would wear so Katie was very surprised when she pulled them up her legs and they slipped over her hips with relative ease.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to question why these childish panties fit her, she had to cover herself up. Despite her blushing face, she picked up the pair of shorts that were provided. They were a very light yellow and just like the panties, they slipped up her legs and covered her up quite well. They were very short though, only going a little way down her thigh, it may have covered her up but it didn\u2019t do much more than that.\r\n\r\nLastly, Katie picked up the t-shirt and quickly threw it over her head. The shirt, just like the panties, was a light pink colour and was decorated with sprinkles of glitter. There was white embroidery on the front of the shirt that formed the words \u201cLittle Princess.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie only took the time to see how she was dressed once she had fully covered herself up and when she looked down at herself she blushed anew at how young she suddenly looked. These clothes made her look like a little girl and being in these surroundings didn\u2019t help with that.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t you look adorable?\u201d The robot asked rhetorically when Katie had smoothed out her shirt. The robot talked like a mother talking to their little girl and Katie resented that a lot.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Katie replied quietly with a scowl.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou may now play at the table.\u201d The robot continued. It clearly didn\u2019t care what Katie thought of her attire and it retreated over to the desk in the corner leaving Katie free to look at the table.\r\n\r\nThere were a bunch of activities sitting on the table. Katie looked at some dolls without interest, there were some childish books that looked entirely uninteresting and a bunch of other games that wouldn\u2019t entertain her. When Katie saw the teacher staring at her and waiting for Katie to sit at the table, Katie saw some painting supplies and just decided to sit there since it seemed like the best of all the possible options.\r\n\r\nWhen Katie sat down, the teacher sat down as well but it didn\u2019t take its eyes off the girl.\r\n\r\nAs Katie started painting with the childish paints she had to remind herself that she was supposed to be a college graduate. She had no idea what was going on here but she felt scared enough that resistance seemed scarier than just going along with what was happening.\r\n\r\nAs Katie fiddled with the paint supplies, the robot walked over and made the girl jump by placing a sippy cup on the table next to her. Katie eyed the cup and pursed her lips, if these mechanical things thought she was going to drink from that infantile cup they had another thing coming.\r\n\r\nIt felt like hours passed with Katie just sat in the same spot and painting on the paper in front of her. Very soon, she found two major issues arising.\r\n\r\nFirstly, Katie was getting incredibly thirsty. She could barely remember when her last drink was and she knew she must be getting dehydrated, she remembered the juice box she had left in the canteen, she wished she had drunk it when she had the chance. Despite how abhorrent the thought of drinking from the sippy cup was, she found herself getting more and more tempted to pick it up as she grew thirstier.\r\n\r\nHer second problem was an ever increasing need to use the bathroom. Katie could feel her bladder aching for the toilet but she was too scared to risk drawing the attention of the robot again.\r\n\r\nKatie could solve one problem right there and then and she finally decided that her thirst was more important than her dignity. She picked up the sippy cup and held it up to her face, the cup was lime green and had a light blue top. Sniffing the spout area, Katie couldn\u2019t find anything suspicious and so slowly put the cup to her mouth and tipped her head backwards to drink it. It was apple juice, warm apple juice by the time she decided to drink it but in her state of extreme thirst it might as well have been the finest tasting drink she had ever had.\r\n\r\nHer second issue was even more embarrassing and she put the sippy cup down and turned to the robot in the corner of the room and took a deep breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Katie asked as pleasantly as possible. She wanted to get out of this place but resistance hadn\u2019t worked so she would try being a little nicer, it was worth a try.\r\n\r\n\u201cYes?\u201d The robot replied in its monotone voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2026 I need the bathroom.\u201d Katie said quietly. She blushed furiously as she basically asked permission to use the toilet, something she hadn\u2019t done since grade school.\r\n\r\n\u201cCome with me.\u201d The robot replied and it began walking very slowly towards the door that led to the canteen.\r\n\r\nKatie stood up and immediately felt her need for the bathroom increase dramatically. It was as if the gravity had suddenly flushed even more fluid through Katie\u2019s system and she felt even more pressure building, it was almost intolerable. Was there something in the food or drink making her more desperate?\r\n\r\nThe robot ahead of Katie walked incredibly slowly and Katie found herself dancing on tiptoes in her attempts to keep herself together. The robot never walked this slowly before, this was surely on purpose.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease hurry\u2026\u201d Katie said in a whiny voice behind the robot.\r\n\r\n\u201cCalm down. You are a big girl; you can hold it.\u201d The robot replied without looking at the girl.\r\n\r\nBefore Katie could argue that the machine was deliberately going slowly, she saw a door at the end of the hallway that had a sign hanging on it signifying that it was the women\u2019s bathroom.\r\n\r\nKatie didn\u2019t want to wait for the robot to slowly walk down the long hall. She started to pick up the pace and overtake her caretaker. She found that a hand reached out and grabbed her stopping her in her tracks.\r\n\r\nThe sudden grab and the jerk as she stopped moving was almost disastrous for Katie as she felt her bladder jolt and she had to fight to keep her panties clean. A small trickle escaped her and Katie could feel her panties dampen slightly. It wasn\u2019t really enough to be noticeable to anyone else but Katie went red as she moved even closer to what seemed like an inevitable accident.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo running.\u201d The robot said.\r\n\r\nKatie walked as fast as she could to the door that offered her salvation. She sighed with relief as she reached it and gave it a push. The door didn\u2019t move.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no\u2026\u201d Katie whined to herself as she crossed her knees in an attempt to keep control.\r\n\r\nThe door was locked and there was simply no way of opening it without the key, a key presumably held by the robot teacher who seemed to be moving slower than a glacier. Katie could feel that the robot wasn\u2019t going to get here in time. She could feel her control slipping as her body started to go on to auto-pilot. A single tear rolled down her face as she silently begged for mercy.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh no\u2026\u201d Katie whimpered suddenly as she looked down in horror.\r\n\r\nA very sudden and very warm wet patch suddenly appeared on Katie\u2019s panties and shorts. She covered her mouth with a hand and felt her cheeks blazing as the wet spot rapidly spread throughout her clothes.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t long before the warm feeling was trickling down her legs as her body gave up any remaining fight and just let go. Katie could see streaks of urine running down her leg and she shook her head in useless denial as a puddle began to form.\r\n\r\nThe robot had finally caught up with Katie and just looked at the floor where the urine was gathering in silent judgement.\r\n\r\nKatie sobbed slightly as her bladder finally stopped releasing and all that was left was the dripping of her pee soaked clothes into the ever increasing puddle beneath her.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh dear!\u201d The robot said without any true emotion. It had clearly copied the words that people say in these circumstances but it seemed to have no idea about how to say them, \u201cAccidents happen. We can help.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie was a mess. She didn\u2019t want to move thanks to the wet feeling on her lower half. She felt utterly humiliated to have wet herself like an infant who couldn\u2019t hold on for the potty. She hoped no one else could see her in this sorry state, she had no idea what was happening any more but she prayed that she would be allowed to leave and that this embarrassing episode would remain a secret.\r\n\r\nThe robotic teacher stepped forward and lifted Katie with incredible ease. Katie was rather taken aback by it but she knew that resistance was futile as she was held against the robot\u2019s metal chest. It was very disconcerting to be held against a chest like this and feeling no heartbeat or warmth. Just the hard metal covered in some synthetic skin and thin clothes.\r\n\r\nKatie could feel the wet areas of her crotch and legs already cooling and she began to feel increasingly uncomfortable. As the bot started taking her back towards the room Katie had been painting in, Katie shivered slightly. Despite everything that had happened and the worry of what might happen next Katie really hoped that she would be taken out of these wet clothes at least.\r\n\r\nKatie was carried back through and into the pre-school like room and into a corner of the room that she had somehow missed earlier. This corner was hidden behind a curtain that was now pulled back and Katie\u2019s heart sank when she craned her head around to see what was coming.\r\n\r\nThis corner contained three pieces of furniture and none of them pleased Katie to see. A high chair was flanked on either side by a large crib and a changing table. Shaking her head in denial, Katie wriggled to try and get free but that only caused the robot to clutch her more tightly.\r\n\r\n\u201cSettle down.\u201d The robot said as a warning.\r\n\r\nKatie was placed down on the changing table and she almost immediately tried to slip off of it. Obviously this move was expected as the robot reacted with lightning reflexes to block the escape route.\r\n\r\nWhen Katie wouldn\u2019t settle down a sound from the ceiling signified one of the panels being pulled back and four long black tubes with robotic hands came down on the girl who tried to beat them away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as one of Katie\u2019s arms was caught, the struggle was over. The snake-like machines from the ceiling held the girl down and allowed the robot to unceremoniously rip off the clothes Katie was wearing and leave her naked on the table.\r\n\r\nKatie whined and shuddered as she tried to suppress the tears that were threatening to spring forth but she was unable to resist in any physical way. She even felt some joy in being out of the wet clothes, she saw the wet cloth being piled on the floor next to the table and she blushed as she spotted the very clear dark patch that covered most of her shorts.\r\n\r\nKatie jumped slightly as she felt a cold feeling on her legs that moved up to her crotch. She lifted up her head to see the robot wiping up her wet areas. She shuddered as the robot got close to her most sensitive spot but it was never a sexual movement, this was purely for cleaning and Katie would have found it impossible to be excited under these circumstances anyway.\r\n\r\nKatie was very worried as to what was coming next. Seeing the equipment around her made Katie assume the worst and it was without surprise that she saw the robot reach underneath the table and pull out a pull up.\r\n\r\nKatie\u2019s face went bright red and she shook her head in denial but she was physically outmatched and already emotionally beaten. There was little she could do to prevent her feet being slipped through the pull up. She felt it get pulled up her legs and, despite a snug fit, the elastic sides stretched and allowed the absorbent underwear to be pulled up over her hips.\r\n\r\nThe restraints let go and the robot lifted up Katie again. She whimpered as she was stood on the floor. A pale pink thin cloth was pulled down over Katie\u2019s head and as it fluttered down she realised that it was a nightie. A very loose nightie designed to be slept in.\r\n\r\nKatie was pulled towards the crib and despite her continued whimpers and attempts to pull away she was easily lifted into the baby bed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t need any of this!\u201d Katie whined as the bars were raised.\r\n\r\nThe robot didn\u2019t reply and instead just turned and left the room leaving Katie alone in the crib.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that Katie tried to do was to climb out, this was just a crib and it was designed to keep babies in, surely a college graduate could work out the mechanism and break it up. After a few minutes of examining the raised bars she became increasingly frustrated as she saw no way to release the side. Katie was actually trapped in this damn bed. There were few things that made a person feel more helpless than being trapped in this state.\r\n\r\nKatie experienced a surge of anger and frustration and as tears filled her eyes she looked down to her humiliating underwear. The pull up was an embarrassing reminder of what had just happened and she wanted to forget all about it. She moved her hands down to her waist with the intention of taking the disposable garment off.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Katie\u2019s hands touched the pull up there was suddenly a mechanical noise that came from the corners of the crib. Katie looked up just in time to see more of the mechanical arms suddenly spring up.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Katie yelled as she held her hand\u2019s out to try and protect herself.\r\n\r\nThe arms clearly didn\u2019t want Katie to undress and each of her limbs was grabbed and she was forced into a star position whilst laying down in the toddler bed. She was held so tightly that she could barely move a single muscle, it was far from the most comfortable thing in the world.\r\n\r\nKatie felt like she must have been laying there for hours before she was able to finally close her eyes and drift off into a restless and much interrupted sleep. She would have been tossing and turning all night if she wasn\u2019t held in place.\r\n\r\nWhen Katie\u2019s eyes finally opened, she had very little idea of what time it was. There was no window in sight and there was little in the way of clues as to the time. The only thing Katie knew for sure when she woke up was that her bladder was asking to be emptied again.\r\n\r\nKatie bit her bottom lip as she looked through the bars but the room was empty. The caretaker robots had yet to return the room and the eerie silence was broken only by Katie\u2019s occasional whimpers as she tried to keep from having another accident.\r\n\r\n\u201cH-Hello?\u201d Katie called out into the silent room. She hoped there was someone or something listening, \u201cI\u2026 I need the bathroom\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was no response.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour passed before Katie gave up hope of anyone coming to get her. The continued silence gave no indication that anyone was coming and despite intermittent struggling the restraints still wouldn\u2019t budge.\r\n\r\nFinally, the discomfort became too much for the young woman who decided it would be better to allow the inevitable to happen than endure the pain any longer. Katie relaxed and closed her eyes as she tried to let her body do something that felt so unnatural.\r\n\r\nIt took a few minutes for any progress to be made but Katie started to feel a small trickle escape her and enter the padding between her legs. As soon as the first trickle started it became easier to let go and before long Katie felt relief as she wet the pull up that started swelling. She was concerned of leaking and had no idea how much this disposable underwear could take but as she finally stopped wetting she felt confident that the pull up had held everything.\r\n\r\nIt was as depressing as it was predictable but barely a minute after Katie had finished embarrassing herself, the door to the room opened up and the robotic caretaker walked in. Did they know? Maybe they could see when Katie wet herself, maybe they were waiting for her to do it.\r\n\r\n\u201cGood morning, little one.\u201d Came that monotone mechanical voice which sent shudders down Katie\u2019s spine.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not little\u2026\u201d Katie said through gritted teeth, \u201cI\u2019m an adult!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe side of the crib lowered and the robot reached in. It pushed the soggy pull up against the woman\u2019s crotch as it assessed its state. Katie blushed as her arguments over not being a little girl were ruined by the soaking padding. She felt some urine that hadn\u2019t soaked in yet trickle further around her crotch; it tickled her a little and made her squirm.\r\n\r\nThe restraints that had been holding Katie down for so long finally let go and she quickly sat up. She had half a mind to try and climb out and run away but she was given no opportunity and the robot quickly gathered her into it\u2019s arms and carried Katie over to the changing table. Katie didn\u2019t attempt to resist in any serious way as she already knew the robot\u2019s super strength would stop her from being able to get away easily. Besides, where would she go? There didn\u2019t seem to be a way out.\r\n\r\nKatie was laid down on the table and she felt the sides of her pull up ripped apart and pulled out from underneath her. Before she could make any kind of movement or even a sound to protest, a new pull up was already being pulled up her legs.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop!\u201d Katie yelled out, \u201cThis is mad! I want out of whatever is happening here.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot completely ignored her as the pull up was pulled over Katie\u2019s waist. This pull up was even more embarrassing than the previous one. The last one was plain white and fairly discreet. This one had pictures of cartoon ponies on it and was clearly made for children in potty training. Katie went very red when she felt how much thicker this pull up was.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t give me a chance to use the toilet of course this will happen!\u201d Katie complained fruitlessly.\r\n\r\nThe robot placed Katie on the floor. The young woman swayed slightly on her legs, her muscles ached from being held in place for so long. She felt very upset and she quickly sat down on the chair at the table. She didn\u2019t know what to do anymore, she couldn\u2019t run and she couldn\u2019t hide. A bunch of Lego blocks were placed on the table in front of her by the robot teacher along with a sippy cup.\r\n\r\nKatie remained silent as the teacher moved back to the desk and sat down there. She almost felt like she was sulking as she had her pull up open for the world to see. It was absurd how much control she had lost of her life at this moment, she truly felt like a toddler being forced to do things by the adults around her.\r\n\r\nThe only saving grace for Katie was that the advert had said this was just a five-day stay. She had said as much to her mother, if she didn\u2019t come home then people would come looking for her and, thankfully, Katie had written down the address of this facility. It was the only thing that stopped her from going mad.\r\n\r\nKatie folded her hands across her chest and the pink nightgown that she was wearing stretched out across her chest. She refused to take part in these silly games and was just going to sit there in protest.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing your games.\u201d Katie said out loud to no one in particular.\r\n\r\nKatie had no idea how much time had passed but she grew more and more bored as time went by. There was no way to distract herself as she sat at the table, whenever she glanced over at the robot in the corner of the room she saw it\u2019s beady red eyes staring back at her.\r\n\r\nEventually, Katie finally got so bored that the Lego in front of her started to seem more appealing. At least it would be something to do, she could make something interesting and just generally take her mind off the predicament she was trapped in.\r\n\r\nJust as Katie was about to pick up the Lego and start building something she heard the robot teacher move to It\u2019s feet. Katie looked over at the unexpected movement and after a brief pause the robot approached the table.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s lunch time.\u201d Came the familiarly robotic voice, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I at least put some pants or something on?\u201d Katie asked as she tried to maintain a small amount of dignity.\r\n\r\n\u201cFollow me.\u201d The robot repeated without any indication it had heard the woman.\r\n\r\nKatie sighed and just hoped that she was still the only living thing in the building. This was all embarrassing enough without anyone else seeing her like this.\r\n\r\nKatie followed the robot through the hallways and back to the canteen. Katie saw one table near the door with a plate in front of it, on the plate were some sandwiches cut up in bite size chunks as well as an apple that was also cut into segments. She would have worried about the infantile lunch but it was so much better than yesterday\u2019s dinner that she kept her mouth shut.\r\n\r\nSitting down at the table, Katie looked around and saw all the same robots in the canteen staring at her. It was very unsettling as she started trying to eat the food. She didn\u2019t have much of an appetite but knew that she wouldn\u2019t be allowed to leave the canteen until she finished everything.\r\n\r\nWhen the plate was finally clean the robot from the classroom wasted no time opening the door for her to head back to the nursery. Katie stood up and felt the padding between her legs as she walked back to the classroom. As they headed down the corridor back towards the classroom, Katie saw the bathroom from the previous day.\r\n\r\nAlthough she had no crushing need for the bathroom, she felt like she should maybe ask to go just to try to do her best to keep this pull up dry. By the time she decided it would be a good idea, it was already too late. The robot leading the way had walked all the way up to and through the door to the nursery room. It was holding the door open and watching for Katie to come through.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking\u2026\u201d Katie said as confidently as she could in her embarrassing state of dress, \u201cMaybe I should use the bathroom, you know, just to make sure there are no more\u2026 accidents.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot didn\u2019t move. It held the door open and stood still waiting for the girl to come down the hallway. Katie scowled and started walking down the corridor before stopping halfway between the classroom and the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d Katie shouted suddenly, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to wet myself. Let me into the bathroom!\u201d\r\n\r\nStill the robot didn\u2019t move and didn\u2019t speak. The way the machine made no indication of listening to Katie only made her angrier as she felt increasingly indignant at being ignored when she was making a very basic request.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen to me!\u201d Katie shouted. She stomped her foot on the floor of the corridor and could feel her face going red. The longer this went the angrier she was getting!\r\n\r\nAfter another few seconds of silence, Katie decided this was where she was going to put her foot down. Using the bathroom was a basic right! If she wanted to go to the bathroom she should be allowed to go.\r\n\r\n\u201cFine!\u201d Katie said as she folded her arms across her chest, \u201cI can wait here till you let me in.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie quickly sat down on the floor and crossed her legs as well. She looked for all the world like an overgrown toddler having a tantrum but in her mind she was right. She deserved to use the bathroom like the adult she was and whoever was in charge here had no right to stop her.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Katie\u2019s butt hit the floor the robot started walking back out towards her. Katie flinched as it grew near, she had no idea if the robot was about to go and unlock the door for her or whether it was just coming to grab her. Katie didn\u2019t have to wait long for the answer, when the Nanny-bot reached her it stopped.\r\n\r\nKatie closed her eyes and prayed that the robot would pass when she felt the robotic arms wrap around her.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Katie whined uselessly as she was picked up and held against the chest of the metal person.\r\n\r\nKatie was picked up and carried back towards the nursery. When she saw the door to the bathroom moving further away she felt her temper rising again. This whole situation was ridiculous and she quickly began lashing out. It was utterly useless of course but Katie flailed her legs and arms as she was carried back into the nursery room and the door was locked behind her.\r\n\r\n\u201cCalm down.\u201d The robot said simply as it put the girl down in front of the table of activities again.\r\n\r\nKatie felt tears in her eyes but she refused to cry, she didn\u2019t want to give the robot the satisfaction of showing how upset she was. Despite this, it wasn\u2019t long until Katie drank from the sippy cup. Her throat was parched and she blushed as she drank from the infantile mug.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there were repercussions to both the tantrum and the drinking and they soon began to make themselves felt. Katie tried to ignore the growing feeling of needing the bathroom, the pressure on her bladder was slowly growing and becoming harder to ignore.\r\n\r\nKatie brushed her hand across her crotch and felt the cloth-like feeling of the pull up between her legs, it was a reminder of what was expected. She shuddered and all it did was make her more determined to not embarrass herself. Maybe this was a test and all Katie had to do was stay dry as long as possible, eventually the robot had to take her to the bathroom surely.\r\n\r\nTo try and distract herself from her growing need to the bathroom, Katie looked around the room for something to do. Her eyes fell on a bookshelf nearby and she walked over in the hope of finding something interesting. She should have known better, the books were all meant for toddlers and there was nothing that Katie would find genuinely interesting.\r\n\r\nKatie pulled a book about animals off of the shelf. She sat down on the floor in front of the shelf and opened up the first page. It was all simple stuff, a picture of an animal along with some facts about it and their name.\r\n\r\nIt distracted her for a few minutes but not much longer and as the pangs from her bladder increased, she quickly put the book away and picked up another one in the attempt to stay distracted. To a certain extent this strategy worked but after an hour there were no books left and the need for the bathroom was now extreme.\r\n\r\nKatie stood up and almost lost control right away. She was utterly desperate to go, her hand covered her bladder which was aching. She saw the robot still watching her from the far end of the room and she decided to make one more effort to convince the caretaker to let her use the bathroom.\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease\u2026 I really need to go.\u201d Katie said as she stumbled forward slightly.\r\n\r\nThe robot didn\u2019t move. It\u2019s unbroken stare not leaving Katie\u2019s face.\r\n\r\nKatie sighed in frustration and then suddenly came up with an idea. She was being treated like a toddler with these activities and the pull up and everything, so maybe the robots wanted her to act the part\u2026\r\n\r\n\u201cPlease, Miss.\u201d Katie said in her best impression of a little girl, \u201cI need to go potty.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie\u2019s already red face blushed brighter as she staggered across the room and talked like a toddler. She was so immensely glad that no one could see her, if anyone knew what was going on she would die from embarrassment.\r\n\r\nTo Katie\u2019s utter astonishment, her idea actually had an effect. The robotic nanny stood up and started walking across the room. Katie\u2019s eyes lit up and she started shuffling a bit faster as she assumed the nanny was heading for the door. She was going to make it!\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat\u2026 What are you doing?\u201d Katie stammered as she reached the halfway point in the room.\r\n\r\nThe Robo-Nanny had only gone halfway to the door when it stopped and opened a cupboard door. It had reached in and pulled out a large plastic object. It was princess pink and adorned with pictures of unicorns and Katie watched as it was set down on the floor next to the teacher\u2019s desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cA potty?\u201d Katie whispered as her throat constricted from embarrassment, \u201cYou want me to use an actual\u2026 Potty?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe teacher stood expectantly and Katie knew she had to decide what she was going to do right away. Her control was at it\u2019s limit and there was no way she would be allowed out of this room.\r\n\r\nKatie edged herself forwards across the room and felt her control slipping with every movement. She was still several feet away from the potty when she felt a small trickle escape her and enter the pull up.\r\n\r\nKatie paused briefly and squeezed her muscles shut again as she attempted to maintain control. The idea of using a potty in the middle of the room like a toilet training toddler was humiliating but it was still marginally better than wetting her pull up.\r\n\r\nThe robot\u2019s accusing eyes seemed to pierce Katie\u2019s soul and weaken her resistance. She paused again as she felt her control stretched to the limit. She became aware that another step would be the end of her battle and she hunched over forwards, her hands pressed against the front of the pull up as if trying to block the flow that she was certain was coming.\r\n\r\nLooking at the robot, Katie wordlessly begged for it to bring the potty to her. She felt tears rolling down her cheeks as she struggled to hold back the flood. The robot must have known what Katie needed. If it was smart enough to be able to do everything it had done since Katie got here, it would be smart enough to recognise a woman desperate for relief. It didn\u2019t move.\r\n\r\nIt was finally too much for the young woman. Katie felt another trickle escape her clenched body but this time she was unable to stop the flow. Instead, her body felt the trickle and gave up the fight, the trickle became a stream and the pull up quickly started warming around her.\r\n\r\nThese pull ups were not meant for large accidents and it quickly began to overflow. Katie felt the warm urine start running down her inner thigh which prompted her eyes to fly wide.\r\n\r\nAbandoning the attempt at keeping control, Katie ran the last few steps towards the potty. She felt the floodgates open as the pull up couldn\u2019t contain the torrent of liquid. A high-pitched whine escaped from Katie\u2019s mouth as she felt the warm urine cascading down her legs and dripping on to the floor.\r\n\r\nWithout even pausing to pull her disposable underwear down, Katie sat herself down on the potty and heard the tell-tale tinkling sound as her pee dripped down from her pull up and collected in the bottom of the potty.\r\n\r\nBy the time she had sat down, Katie had almost finished and as the last drops hit the potty she looked down at the trail of urine that led away from the toddler toilet.\r\n\r\nKatie felt a deep sense of shame as the evidence of her lack of control pooled on the floor. She could almost feel the glare of the robot behind her as she ashamedly looked at the floor. She sobbed slightly and felt so bad for not making it to the potty even though any reasonable person would have let her go to the bathroom when she asked. She was humiliated more than anything.\r\n\r\nWhen the dripping eventually slowed down Katie didn\u2019t really know what to do. She wanted to get up and run away but that obviously wasn\u2019t an option. She just sat on her little potty and sobbed for a little while as the wet streaks on her legs got colder.\r\n\r\nEventually, the decision as to what to do next was made for her when the robot behind her grabbed her around the waist and lifted her off of the potty.\r\n\r\nKatie kicked her legs a little but any attempt at resistance was rather half-hearted and she was too upset with herself to really try and break free. She allowed herself to be carried over to the changing table where she was rapidly stripped down to just her pull up.\r\n\r\nKatie looked fearfully up at the robot at the end of the table as it seemed to be calculating it\u2019s next move. The blushing woman didn\u2019t even try to get off of the table, she knew it was useless to try, sooner or later she would be brought back and things would only be worse.\r\n\r\nThe bot reached forward and pulled the weak sides of the pull up apart. The wet disposable was pulled down between Katie\u2019s legs and left her exposed to the room. The disposable underwear was saturated from front to back and Katie was surprised it was still holding on.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as if a decision had been reached by the building itself, metallic arms simultaneously sprung forth from the four corners of the changing table. They quickly pinned Katie to the table and held her down securely with their firm but gentle grip.\r\n\r\n\u201cHey!\u201d Katie yelled as she was pinned to the table, \u201cI\u2019m not resisting! Let me go!\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie was broken from her depressed apathy by the frustration of being held down again for seemingly no reason. She had accepted what was coming next; she expected to be cleaned and placed in yet another humiliating pull up. Why hold her down? Why make this experience any longer and harder than it needed to be.\r\n\r\nThe nanny suddenly turned away from the table and towards the door that led to the cafeteria area. Katie watched as far as she could but the robot disappeared out of sight leaving Katie laying alone in the nursery room. It was silent and she felt very vulnerable as she was held down and completely naked.\r\n\r\n\u201cGreat\u2026\u201d Katie muttered to herself.\r\n\r\nIt turned out that Katie didn\u2019t have to wait long to find out what was going on as the sound of heavy, metallic footsteps soon started getting louder again.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan you just hurry up and get me dressed.\u201d Katie called out as the nanny walked back across the room, \u201cWe both know you are just going to stick me in another stupid pull up. Just get it over with.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie was angry. Angry at herself for the accident, angry at this stupid robot for forcing it to happen and angry at the whole building and company for whatever crazy experiment was going on here. Katie no longer cared about whatever mysterious force was behind all of this, she no longer gave a damn about getting a job or even paid for this stay. She just wanted to be allowed to leave but clearly that wasn\u2019t on the cards.\r\n\r\nKatie furrowed her eyebrows when she looked to the side and saw the nanny-bot carrying a bucket that seemed to be full of water to the side of the changing table. What on Earth was this for? Katie saw the robot\u2019s cold eyes look down at her face before slowly working down over her chest and down to her crotch.\r\n\r\nWhen Katie saw it pull out a razor and some shaving cream from one of the shelves her eyes flew wide and she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Katie yelled, \u201cDo not touch me!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot paused as it looked back up at Katie\u2019s face. It put one of it\u2019s shiny fingers to where it\u2019s mouth would have been and gave a short, sharp shush.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t shush me!\u201d Katie yelled again, \u201cThis is too much. You\u2019re going too far, I demand to be le-\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie was cut off mid-sentence when she suddenly felt something rather rubbery tied to her mouth. She twisted and turned her head but it was already too late to dislodge what she quickly came to realise was an oversized pacifier. Even spitting it out didn\u2019t work as it was attached to a strap that wrapped around the back of her head. One of the seemingly endless mechanical arms seemed to be responsible.\r\n\r\nThe robot opened the can and sprayed a liberal amount of the shaving foam on it\u2019s hand. It moved down between the woman\u2019s legs and started rubbing the foam over the areas of Katie\u2019s crotch that had hair.\r\n\r\nKatie gasped at the cold touch and tried to move away from the hand, it was a useless endeavour as she was held down so securely.\r\n\r\n\u201cHold still.\u201d The robot commanded briefly as it picked up the razor and moved it towards Katie.\r\n\r\nKatie closed her eyes and did as she was asked. She stayed as still as possible whilst still trembling slightly from a mixture of fear and the cold cream.\r\n\r\nFor the next several minutes, Katie felt the metal blade of the razor as it meticulously shaved her. A new tear ran down her cheek as she wondered why on Earth the robot was doing this. She had to admit that it had expert precision though, despite it\u2019s proximity to some very sensitive areas it managed to avoid them completely as it did a thorough job in taking off the hair that Katie had.\r\n\r\nWhen it was finally finished it repeated the process that it had done with the bucket. It walked away from the table and carried the bucket back down the hallway to wherever it had originally got it.\r\n\r\nBy the time the robot had returned, Katie was fuming and her fear had turned to anger. When it stood between Katie\u2019s legs again, Katie gave it a stare much colder than the robot could ever manage.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Katie asked simply and carefully around the large bulb in her mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cBabies need to be smooth for easier clean up.\u201d Replied the machine.\r\n\r\nIgnoring the fact that Katie wasn\u2019t a baby, she blushed at the idea of needing easier clean up. The two accidents she had experienced were just that, accidents. She didn\u2019t need changing or cleaning or anything like that. She just needed this stupid machine to let her use the toilet when asked.\r\n\r\n\u201cEathier clean up?\u201d Katie lisped with difficulty, \u201cI don\u2019t ne\u2026 Oh my God\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie felt her face go pale as she watched the robot lean down under the table and then stand back up with a new piece of disposable underwear. She had been expecting another pull up, how could she not after what had just happened? She certainly wasn\u2019t going to be allowed her underwear again.\r\n\r\nAs the plastic crinkled in front of her, Katie realised that what was coming next would be even worse than what came before. With a stomach that felt like it was dropping as if on a rollercoaster, Katie looked into the robot\u2019s hands to see a diaper.\r\n\r\nIt was plain white with a single yellow line running all the way down the centre. As it was unfolded, Katie felt her breath taken away by it\u2019s sheer size. She had no idea they even made diapers this big, though in hindsight it seemed obvious that they must do for those incontinent adults. Her shocked brain was struggling to comprehend anything that was happening though and she felt the thick padding being slid underneath her.\r\n\r\nThis was so much more humiliating than the pull up. It was as if Katie was going through potty training in reverse. She had arrived in panties and slowly regressed all the way to this diaper. Her fragile ego felt beaten, battered and bruised as she blushed anew.\r\n\r\nKatie felt the front of the diaper get pulled up between her legs and over her freshly shaved crotch. This ultimate symbol of babyhood was pulled tightly closed, firmly taped together and Katie was powerless to stop any of it. With the pacifier strapped in and now a diaper between her legs, Katie realised she was starting to look like nothing more than an overgrown baby. It was a horrid realisation.\r\n\r\nKatie felt her limbs released as the robot picked her up and carried her in it\u2019s arms like a mother cradling a new born. It was a bit awkward because of Katie\u2019s size but the robot had seemingly no issue in carrying the woman over to the crib which Katie was lightly deposited in.\r\n\r\nThe bars of the crib slid up automatically as soon as the caretaker had removed it\u2019s arms leaving Katie trapped.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt leatht take out the pathifier!\u201d Katie lisped around the bulb filling her mouth. She quickly pushed herself against the bars like a prisoner trying to escape their cell.\r\n\r\nThe robot either didn\u2019t hear Katie or chose to ignore her. It just walked out of the nursery and closed the door behind it. Katie was left alone in the nursery, trapped in her little crib with nothing on except the crinkling disposable diaper. She felt very exposed but by this point that was a feeling she was getting very used to.\r\n\r\nKatie stomped her foot in frustration, like a frustrated toddler she didn\u2019t think she deserved this at all. She looked down at the diaper that was now loudly crinkling around his waist, she scowled at it like it was her oppressor.\r\n\r\nKatie\u2019s first instinct was to just rip the diaper off. She didn\u2019t care if it would leave her naked, being naked would be less humiliating than being padded like a baby. Cooler thinking prevailed, Katie knew that tearing this diaper off wouldn\u2019t help her at all, in fact it would probably make things much worse. Katie was sure that ripping this diaper off would just provoke whatever was running this place to come back and re-diaper her. Then she would be held down or something and be even more trapped than she was at the moment.\r\n\r\nWith a growl of frustration, Katie sat down backwards on her padded rear and laid down. If she was going to be forced to stay here, the best thing she could do was try and pass the time. She laid her head down on the pillows provided and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nSleep was not easy to come by. Katie had no idea how long she had been left in the crib alone, she only knew that it felt like hours. The mixture of the diaper and the pacifier strapped into her mouth made Katie uncomfortable enough that it seemed like any movement woke her up. The diapers crinkling was the only sound in the room and she blushed every time she heard the soft padding announce it\u2019s presence.\r\n\r\nAt some point in the middle of the night, Katie woke up for a different reason. Katie felt an all too familiar sensation of a full bladder, a feeling of needing the bathroom, of tense bladder muscles that wanted to be relaxed.\r\n\r\nKatie had been dreading this moment. She knew that sooner or later she would need the toilet and with the diaper taped to her waist and the walls of the crib fencing her in, there was just no way for her to avoid an inevitable wet diaper.\r\n\r\nKatie couldn\u2019t understand why she was having to use the bathroom so much. It didn\u2019t make sense to her that she kept needing to use the bathroom. There must have been something in the food; it was the only explanation that made sense to the young woman.\r\n\r\nThe thought crossed her mind, yet again, of tearing the diaper off. She was willing to do anything to avoid wetting herself again but, just like earlier, she knew it wouldn\u2019t help at all. The best she could do then was either wet the bed or try to pee between the bars of the crib. Neither of these options were appealing and she steadfastly refused to act like an animal, not to mention she was sure there would be a punishment for doing it.\r\n\r\nKatie eventually came to the conclusion that it was pointless to just lay there suffering. The need wasn\u2019t going anywhere and she was only preventing herself getting any sleep by fighting it. Climbing to her feet, Katie closed her eyes and tried to relax her aching bladder.\r\n\r\nIt wasn\u2019t an easy task. Deliberately wetting yourself and going against years of toilet training was pretty tough but a deep breath and an effort to relax every muscle eventually led to a sudden warming around her crotch.\r\n\r\nKatie blushed as she felt herself let go into the thirsty padding. She had held on for so long that when she had finally allowed herself to pee, she flooded the diaper. Katie could feel her urine creeping around the padding at the front and the back as the thirsty diaper absorbed everything.\r\n\r\nEventually Katie was done and she slowly opened her eyes and grimaced. The warm wetness between her legs actually wasn\u2019t too horrible of a feeling, but the knowledge she was standing in her own urine was horrible.\r\n\r\nKatie slowly laid back down in the bed and tried to get some rest. She could still feel the pee spreading around her waist and looking for somewhere to be absorbed. It was a strange, almost ticklish, sensation that only distracted her from sleep even more.\r\n\r\nAfter the fitful night with sleep that only came in short bursts, Katie was somewhat relieved to see the robot return to the room. She immediately climbed to her knees and felt the heavy diaper sag dramatically around her waist. Katie blushed as she felt gravity take hold.\r\n\r\nThe passing time had caused the diaper to cool down and what had previously been a relatively pleasant feeling was now a lot less comfortable. Now it was just a constant reminder of what she had done and that she needed another change.\r\n\r\nKatie looked down and grimaced as she saw the discoloured sections of the previously clean and white diaper. Further evidence of her little accident. It was hard for Katie to argue against her need for these diapers when she kept wetting them.\r\n\r\nThe robot\u2019s slow and mechanical walk over to the crib gave Katie plenty of time to contemplate what might happen next. Katie really hoped for a change, preferably into something non-disposable but she knew that was unlikely.\r\n\r\nThe nanny eventually reached the side of the crib which dropped without the robot seemingly pressing anything. Katie was about to step out when she felt the arms of the robot wrap around her, clearly she was not expected to walk anywhere on her own.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d Katie said quietly, \u201cJust let me go.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot carried Katie over to the changing table as if it hadn\u2019t understood a single word that she had said. It laid her down and gave her a piercing stare, it seemed like it was almost challenging Katie to resist, Katie wasn\u2019t going to play those games again and she folded her arms across her bare chest as her only show of defiance.\r\n\r\nIt was as Katie was laid down that she realised the robot wasn\u2019t even talking to her much anymore. In it\u2019s eyes, Katie was clearly nothing more than a toddler.\r\n\r\nThe robot pulled the tapes off Katie\u2019s diaper and lowered the front. Katie blushed as yet another accident was revealed openly to the world. In her mind she knew that she had no choice for any of them, but it was hard to fit having so many recent potty accidents with being an adult.\r\n\r\nKatie felt the cold and wet baby wipes rubbed against her most private area as the robot began the swift process of cleaning her now hairless crotch. She didn\u2019t want to give the robot the satisfaction of blushing and letting it know how humiliated she was but she found herself struggling to stop herself from going red in the face.\r\n\r\nSoon, Katie felt a new diaper being placed under her rear and she felt herself tearing up a little. She had been really hoping that after the previous night she would be given her grown up clothes back, she was at least hoping to not have to wear another stupid diaper.\r\n\r\nWhen Katie felt the diaper taped closed she sighed in resignation. She went back to her one salvation, this was a fixed length of a stay and her Mom would be coming to pick her up at the end of it all. She would be saved from this building in the end.\r\n\r\nKatie was lifted off of the changing table and when she felt her feet hit the floor she was asked by the robot to not move. Katie was barely listening as she was so deep in her own thoughts but she didn\u2019t move anyway.\r\n\r\nHow long had Katie been here? It was so hard to keep track of time when the windows were blocked out by thick curtains, she estimated she must be nearly done with this horrible process but she couldn\u2019t be sure. The complete lack of control about anything that was happening was the most frustrating aspect of this whole thing.\r\n\r\n\u201cArms up.\u201d The command came from the one voice Katie had heard in the last couple of days.\r\n\r\nKatie, still wrapped up in her own mind, lifted her arms automatically and quickly felt some cloth pulled rapidly over them. When Katie saw a collar pulled down past her vision she assumed she was being given a shirt, it was only when she heard a clicking noise between her legs that she belatedly realised this wasn\u2019t a shirt at all!\r\n\r\n\u201cA onesie!\u201d Katie shouted in shock. As the last snap was done up and the robot removed it\u2019s hand, Katie felt the fluffy diaper between her legs pushed up and against her body.\r\n\r\nKatie looked down and twisted her body slightly. The onesie was a pastel pink and had little pictures of cartoon bunny rabbits all over it. It was one of the most infantile pieces of clothing Katie could remember seeing and the crinkling that came from the disposable padding between her legs as she moved didn\u2019t help her feelings of being a child.\r\n\r\nYet again the robot acted like it couldn\u2019t hear the girl as it took a step back. It observed Katie coldly and when it was satisfied that the onesie was a good fit it picked the young woman up and began to carry her towards the exit of the room.\r\n\r\nKatie was very glad that no one could see her at this moment. It was incredibly humiliating to be treated like this and no matter how impossible the situation was to escape she felt like a real adult would never let something like this happen.\r\n\r\nKatie wrapped her arms around the robot\u2019s neck to steady herself as she was carried out of the nursery. She hated her reliance on the robot right now but she couldn\u2019t get away no matter how much she wanted to. Even trying to escape would probably result in everything just getting worse. As much as it pained Katie to think about, her best choice was to just wait it out and hope that when the time period came to an end she would be rescued by her mother. She had to keep her eye on that goal to stop herself going mad.\r\n\r\nThe cafeteria, when the robot carried Katie through the door, looked the same as the previous day except for one difference. A small difference but one that made Katie double take.\r\n\r\nOne of the tables had been taken away, as had all the chairs that had been around it. In it\u2019s place was a large high chair. Katie felt her stomach drop as she was carried over to it; she was sat down in the large seat and held there until the tray was pulled down in front of her.\r\n\r\nKatie half-heartedly tried to push the tray away but it was obviously locked in place very strongly. Her legs swung uselessly below the chair and the padded girl felt incredibly little. It\u2019s amazing how such small things could have such big effects on how you feel. For Katie, just the fact that she couldn\u2019t reach the floor made her feel more like a toddler than nearly anything else that had happened.\r\n\r\nThe robot that had been with her nearly non-stop walked away from Katie and disappeared through a door into the kitchen area. It returned almost immediately, it\u2019s slow and methodical walking gave Katie a long look at was coming and she wasn\u2019t too excited.\r\n\r\nThe robot was carrying a medium sized tray which had just two items on it. Katie could see a bowl that was steaming slightly and that seemed to have a spoon sticking out of it and a large baby\u2019s bottle filled with milk.\r\n\r\nKatie felt disgusted at the treatment and despite her unwillingness to resist and cause more problems, the more she saw of this lunch that was being brought to her the more she was certain she couldn\u2019t eat it. To put it mildly, this food did not look appetising.\r\n\r\nThe robot placed the tray down on the high chair in front of Katie and picked up the spoon, it began stirring the bowl of food as Katie looked down at what she was being given with revulsion.\r\n\r\nThe bowl was full of a lumpy and thick liquid. Katie couldn\u2019t make out what the food was but she did notice little lumps of carrots here and there. It didn\u2019t look appetising and it smelt even worse, it wasn\u2019t necessarily a horrible smell but it wasn\u2019t the smell of something Katie wanted to be eating.\r\n\r\nThe robot brought the spoon up to Katie\u2019s mouth and she saw some of the food drip off of the bottom of the utensil. Katie\u2019s lip trembled and her throat felt tight, she felt like she wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow even if she had wanted to.\r\n\r\nKatie felt pressured to open her mouth. The nanny was standing with the spoon outstretched and not moving, it\u2019s piercing stare seemed to go through the woman\u2019s soul. Reluctantly, and with great hesitation, Katie slowly opened her mouth and almost immediately felt the robot push the spoon in and upturn it, pouring the food into Katie\u2019s mouth.\r\n\r\nKatie felt the taste hit her tongue and she winced, it didn\u2019t taste as bad as it looked but it was still far from an enjoyable dining experience.\r\n\r\nAs the food kept coming, Katie quickly learned to settle into a rhythm of swallowing as soon as the food hit her tongue. The less time Katie had it in her mouth the better and it actually felt good to have a warm meal.\r\n\r\nWhen the last spoonful of food was given to Katie she was feeling quite full. She had no idea what she had eaten but she assumed it was full of nutrients and vitamins, she was just happy to be done with the meal. She could hear and feel her tummy squirming from the unexpected meal.\r\n\r\nIf Katie thought the latest ordeal was nearly at an end she was sorely mistaken. As the robot put the spoon back in the bowl, it turned to the side a little and grabbed the bottle. Katie was already feeling quite full and she looked at the bottle without appetite.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Katie said simply.\r\n\r\nThe robot was unmoved. The only thing it tried to do was put the teat of the bottle in Katie\u2019s mouth but the girl turned her head away.\r\n\r\nFor a minute it became like a duel. The robot trying to force the nipple of the bottle between Katie\u2019s lips whilst the girl refused to let it happen. She could tell that the robot was becoming impatient, if the robot was capable of feeling such a thing, and she saw it eventually reach forward and grab her nose.\r\n\r\nKatie tried to flail around and escape the grasp but she felt her airways blocked by the metallic fingers grabbing her face. She eventually relented and opened her mouth to gasp for air, as she did so she felt the teat of the bottle roughly jammed against her lips. The pressure on her nose disappeared and she finally able to breathe again.\r\n\r\nKatie gave an experimental suck to the latex bottle top and felt cool milk squirt into her mouth, after the food earlier, it tasted heavily heavenly to wash the taste away. After a few seconds of hesitation, Katie began to suck rhythmically. She closed her eyes and felt her cheeks going red as she drank thirstily from the baby cup.\r\n\r\nBefore long Katie was hearing air coming through the bottle and she belatedly realised the vessel was empty. The robot pulled it away from her and Katie looked shyly at the tray in front of her. She saw the empty bowl and the empty bottle and she blushed even further knowing that she had been fed like a helpless baby.\r\n\r\nKatie felt like she wanted a few minutes for the food to go down but the tray lifted up and the robot swiftly picked the woman up again. She was in no mood to resist anything right now as she felt bloated from the meal, she laid her head on the nanny\u2019s shoulder and just let it carry her back through to the nursery. She could feel a growing need to use the bathroom but she made no attempt to get the robot to stop at the toilets. Katie just allowed the robot to carry her back into the baby room.\r\n\r\nAs if she couldn\u2019t feel more embarrassed, the motion of the robotic walking seemed to affect her digestive system and halfway to the nursery door she let out a loud and prolonged burp.\r\n\r\n\u201cExcuse me\u2026\u201d Katie whispered in embarrassment as she went into the nursery.\r\n\r\nKatie was sat back at the now familiar table and given some Lego pieces to play with. The robot took it\u2019s usual space behind the desk as Katie meekly examined the small blocks in front of her. She didn\u2019t feel much desire to play with them but after a few minutes she found herself growing bored. Picking up a few of the pieces, she started building something, anything to keep her mind occupied, she wasn\u2019t really paying that much attention to whatever it was she was putting together.\r\n\r\nKatie\u2019s mind was focused elsewhere. The massive amount of food and drink that she had consumed was working it\u2019s way through her digestive system and Katie was quickly feeling a growing need to release her bladder. From previous experience she knew that asking the robot for help would be a useless enterprise, instead she thought about what would inevitably happen.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m going to wet my diaper\u2026\u201d Katie whispered to herself. It was very upsetting to admit this to herself and yet she saw no alternative.\r\n\r\nKatie turned to look at the robot and saw it was still sitting there with it\u2019s unceasing stare. It would do no good to ask it for help, she had tried multiple times before and always been left disappointed. She shifted slightly in her seat and heard her diaper crinkle from inside her onesie, her bladder was already starting to get uncomfortable and the diaper almost seemed inviting. It was as if Katie\u2019s diaper was telling her that it was OK to let go, it felt like resistance was pointless.\r\n\r\nKatie relaxed and put down the two blocks she was holding. She closed her eyes and tried to pretend she was sitting on the toilet, it felt really strange to be clothed and in a big room as she tried to release her bladder.\r\n\r\nIt took a long time for the flow to start. Katie couldn\u2019t make herself wet no matter how hard she tried and it took until the need to let go was nearly impossible to ignore. No matter how many times she did this it wasn\u2019t getting any easier.\r\n\r\nFinally, after what must have been half an hour, Katie felt a small trickle of urine leave her body. She gasped a little in surprise but was able to relax her muscles enough to comprehensively wet herself. Katie felt the padding around her start warming up as she stared into the middle distance and felt her bladder empty.\r\n\r\nKatie was worried she might leak but as her pee trickled to a stop she could feel the padding thirstily sucking up everything she could give it. She was honestly impressed that the diaper could take this much liquid, she could feel it expanding and the warm gel was pushing against her thighs.\r\n\r\nKatie was now left with a really awkward situation. Did she go and ask the robot to have her diaper changed and suffer the indignity that would bring or did she just sit in her own urine? The diaper change would be inevitable; it was just a question of when it would come.\r\n\r\nDeciding to delay the inevitable as long as possible, Katie stayed seated and continued playing with the Lego. She hoped she was careful enough that no one would notice what she had done, not that there was any human in the facility that Katie had seen.\r\n\r\nAn hour must have passed and Katie started feeling really uncomfortable. The warm feeling that had been tickling her rather pleasantly had become a colder and itchier feeling that made the woman wince. It felt horrid and yet she still couldn\u2019t bring herself to speak to the robot and ask for a change. Something about admitting she needed it, even to a machine, was too much for her fragile ego to bear. She had already put up with so much.\r\n\r\n\u201cDinner time.\u201d The sudden robotic voice right behind Katie made her jump so hard that she nearly tumbled off of the chair.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou scared the crap out of me\u2026\u201d Katie gasped as she caught her breath. She placed her hand over her chest as her heart slowly recovered from the shock.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou require a diaper change?\u201d The robot asked in it\u2019s fuzzy and strangely distorted voice.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat? No, it\u2019s a saying\u2026 \u201cYou scared the crap out of me\u201d just means that you made me jump.\u201d Katie explained. It felt good that just once she was able to explain something to this robot, a tiny amount of control made a huge difference to her attitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cDinner time.\u201d The robot repeated.\r\n\r\nKatie found it quite strange that the robot seemed to take what she said at face value. It seemed like a strange oversight of the programming and very much against how the robot had otherwise been acting.\r\n\r\nAs she was pondering this thought, Katie felt the now familiar metallic arms reach down and pick her up. The cold fingers made her shiver as she felt them through the thin onesie material. The soaked padding underneath her was pushed closer to her body and Katie squirmed slightly as the expanded padding squeezed against her like a wet sponge.\r\n\r\nThe robo-nanny started to carry Katie out of the nursery and towards the canteen area. Katie wished she had been more honest about needing a diaper change, now she was stuck in this cold diaper for even longer and she was far from comfortable. She blushed as she was forced to admit to herself that she would love a dry diaper right now.\r\n\r\nDinner was a repeat of lunch. Katie was placed in the high chair and fed another surprisingly large meal followed by a bottle of cool milk. Liquid was the last thing that Katie wanted or needed but she still drained the whole bottle before being allowed out of the chair and returned to the nursery.\r\n\r\nThis time the robot didn\u2019t even bother asking Katie if she needed a change. It wasted no time at all in carrying her straight over to the changing table and laying her down. Katie was very full and, if she was being honest, was glad to be changed. The wet diaper was chafing her and the warm, fluffy padding was much preferred. She would never admit that out loud obviously.\r\n\r\nThe robot pulled the tapes off of the diaper and opened it up. The cold air made Katie jump as she was exposed to the room. Katie jumped a second time when she felt the cold baby wipes pressed against her smooth skin. She gripped the sides of the table and closed her eyes to stop herself pulling away from the cold feelings.\r\n\r\nAlthough the robot\u2019s face was emotionless, Katie felt as if she was being judged by it and she had to look away before her shame got the better of her and she burst into tears again.\r\n\r\nKatie felt her legs lifted high into the air. For a second she thought she was going to tumble head over heels off the back of the table but as quickly as she was raised up, she was lowered again. When she was lowered down she felt her butt laying on top of some fluffy padding that was rapidly pulled up between her crotch and taped closed.\r\n\r\nThis diaper was different from the last one and Katie blushed when she looked down and saw that this wasn\u2019t just a new diaper; this was a diaper with babyish designs all over it.\r\n\r\nThis diaper was still mostly white but it had pictures of little building blocks all over the front. They spelt out words like \u201cPrincess\u201d and \u201cBaby.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Katie looked down at her crotch, the robot reached forward again and snapped her onesie closed. Yet again, Katie felt the warm hug of a fluffy diaper as the onesie pulled the padding up against her body. She didn\u2019t know if it was good or bad that she was feeling less humiliated this time, she was getting used to being dressed like this. As long as she was kept away from other people she felt like everything would be fine.\r\n\r\nOnce the robot had finished with the onesie, Katie was lifted up again and this time deposited into the crib. It seemed like Katie wasn\u2019t trusted to move anywhere on her own any more. She had to rely on the robot to carry her everywhere.\r\n\r\n\u201cWait! No!\u201d Katie Said as she turned around just in time to see the bars being raised.\r\n\r\nThe robot just walked away from the toddler bed, it ignored Katie as if it couldn\u2019t hear her and despite everything else that had happened recently, it was being ignored that now really annoyed the young woman in the crib.\r\n\r\n\u201cListen to me!\u201d Katie shouted as she pushed herself against the bars, \u201cI\u2019m not tired. You can\u2019t lock me in here all night!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe robot was either willfully ignoring the shouting or it just didn\u2019t care about what Katie was saying. It just continued to walk towards it\u2019s spot behind the teacher\u2019s desk.\r\n\r\n\u201cI will shout all evening and all night!\u201d Katie screamed, \u201cThis is all too far. Let me out or I\u2019m calling the damn cops!\u201d\r\n\r\nStill the robot didn\u2019t move. It stood stoically in the corner despite the threats. Katie was just about to open her mouth to continue her verbal attack when she heard a mechanical clanking coming from the four corners of the crib. Four long black tubes with metallic hands sprang out and grabbed Katie\u2019s wrists and ankles, they were locked on like a laser guided missile and Katie was swiftly pulled down to the mattress. This wasn\u2019t the first time that Katie had been grabbed like this since she got here so it wasn\u2019t as much of a surprise, despite this she couldn\u2019t find them off and they grabbed her with ease.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou think holding me down like this will shut me up!?\u201d Katie yelled almost maniacally, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t be more wrong! Fu-\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie was suddenly cut off and her screaming became very muffled. A fifth mechanical arm, one she hadn\u2019t seen until this moment moved like lightning to push a large pacifier into her mouth. The latex bulb on this soother was so big that it filled her whole mouth. The only thing her mouth could do was suck. This was much like the last pacifier she had experienced except this one filled her mouth much more thoroughly.\r\n\r\nJust like before, the pacifier was attached to a strap which held it tightly in Katie\u2019s mouth. Tears formed in her eyes as she unsuccessfully tried to push the pacifier out with her tongue, she couldn\u2019t budge it even a tiny bit even though the end of the teat was dangerously close to triggering her gag reflex.\r\n\r\nThe next few hours were extremely rough. Katie was held down to the mattress so tightly that she couldn\u2019t move any of her limbs at all and the pacifier had rendered her mute. After struggling for a while, Katie\u2019s energy was sapped and she just lay there trying to imagine how good it would be to leave. One thing was for certain, no matter what, she was calling the police on this sick operation. Katie didn\u2019t know what was happening here and she didn\u2019t want to know, she just knew she had to try and end it. She didn\u2019t even want to think about the possibility that she wouldn\u2019t be released after all. The thought that her Mom knew her location was the one thing keeping her flicker of hope alive.\r\n\r\nKatie didn\u2019t remember falling asleep. All she remembered was laying in that crib without being able to move. The room had slower got darker and Katie had never been released from her bonds.\r\n\r\nShe must have fallen asleep at some point, because Katie suddenly opened her eyes to find the nursery in almost complete darkness. The one source of light was a small nightlight on top of a table by the foot of the crib, it cast a rather eerie green glow throughout the nearby area.\r\n\r\nKatie rubbed her eyes and then belatedly realised that her limbs had been freed. Even the pacifier was loose and Katie pulled it out of her mouth with great relief. Katie\u2019s first thought was to start shouting again but she quickly had second thoughts, she didn\u2019t want to end up being held down again.\r\n\r\nKatie\u2019s thoughts turned to wondering what had woken her up and it didn\u2019t take long to work out as she put her hand to her stomach. A sharp pain briefly shot through her belly before slowly disappearing. Katie looked down with worry as she realised that she hadn\u2019t been for a number two since she had arrived at the facility and now her body was telling her that it couldn\u2019t hold any more.\r\n\r\nThis was a real dilemma. Katie was trapped in the crib and knew that the release catch for the bars was well out of reach, she was left with two alternatives. Katie could either yell to try and get the attention of the robot and then face the likelihood of being strapped down again or she could soil herself like a baby. Both options sucked and they both left her in humiliating positions with a soiled diaper.\r\n\r\nAnother cramp shot through Katie\u2019s body and she realised that she didn\u2019t have long to think before the choice was made for her. She had no idea what time it was, there were no obvious signs as to time except that Katie guessed it must be late at night.\r\n\r\nThe pressure on her rear end was piling up quickly and she found herself putting her hand on the seat of her diaper as if manually trying to hold it in.\r\n\r\nKatie decided she had to at least try to get the robot to take her to the bathroom. For her own self-esteem she had to do everything she could to prevent a humiliating soiling accident. It was only now when Katie scanned the room with eyes adjusted to the darkness that she realised this wasn\u2019t even an option.\r\n\r\nKatie squinted towards the teacher\u2019s desk and felt her heart drop when she realised that the robot that had barely left her side for the last few days wasn\u2019t there. After frantic looking around, Katie realised the machine wasn\u2019t anywhere in the room. All of a sudden the preferable option to save some of her self-respect was removed.\r\n\r\nIt was as if the hope of being allowed to use the toilet, or at least the toddler potty, was the only thing given Katie\u2019s muscles strength. As soon as that hope was removed, Katie felt the pressure grow inexorably to levels that she couldn\u2019t control. Her cheeks blazed red as began to comprehend what she was about to be forced to do. A small amount of gas escaped her aching body and it was almost enough to end Katie\u2019s resistance right there.\r\n\r\nA final cramp hit Katie and this one didn\u2019t subside. An overwhelming urge to push hit her and the inevitable finally happened. It felt like Katie\u2019s whole digestive system was pushing down as she felt a solid log of poop push out of her body, it slowly and irresistibly pushed against the back of her diaper and pulled the plastic disposable tight as it tried to accommodate Katie\u2019s mess.\r\n\r\nKatie felt sweat appear on her forehead as she pushed with everything she could. The log that was separating her cheeks was squeezed out and pinched off, it\u2019s stickiness felt horrid against her skin and she could already feel it smearing over her diaper as it moved into the seat of her disposable pants.\r\n\r\nThe first log was followed by several much smaller ones that dropped into the drooping padding without much effort. She winced as she pushed once more to completely empty herself. The diaper felt full but she knew she couldn\u2019t stop now.\r\n\r\nFinally, the sordid deed was over. Katie straightened up and felt her heavy diaper stick against her a little. It felt absolutely horrible and her eyes teared up in humiliation at what she had been forced to do. The smell was already starting to leak out and she grimaced when she realised she couldn\u2019t get away from it.\r\n\r\nFrom morbid curiosity, Katie reached behind her and felt the bulging diaper. It had lost a lot of it\u2019s springiness, now it felt like a solid mass.\r\n\r\nAs if it was an afterthought, Katie felt her bladder release and she did nothing to stop the hot urine that splashed around the front of her diaper. It hardly mattered to her that she was wetting herself after what she had just done.\r\n\r\nThe question now was what could she do? She was alone and now thoroughly soiled. She couldn\u2019t get out of the crib, she couldn\u2019t see any of the robot helpers and she felt like a little baby who needed an adult to change her. She didn\u2019t even care about the embarrassment and humiliation, she just wanted someone to change her diaper.\r\n\r\nKatie felt the tears overwhelm her as she lost control of her emotions. She started loudly crying and she hoped that someone would hear her and come rescue the situation. She had no shame anymore, she didn\u2019t mind who came in and saw her in this messy diaper, as long as they changed her, she just didn\u2019t care anymore.\r\n\r\nFor once, something went right and after a minute or so of loud wailing the door to the nursery opened and bathed the nursery in light. One of the robots, presumably the one that had been looking after Katie all along, walked in and flicked on the light switch.\r\n\r\nKatie shielded her eyes from the sudden light but she could hear the metal footsteps getting closer to the crib. Her crying died down almost immediately as she realised she was finally going to get the attention she needed.\r\n\r\nKatie was still standing in a half-squat position. She didn\u2019t want to move at all because she knew it would spread the mess in her pants even further. She just awkwardly waddled towards the side of the crib which the robot dropped. Katie shuffled forward and was about to jump down to the floor when the robot walked right up against the side of the crib and wrapped an arm around her back.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Katie realised too late what the robot was about to do and couldn\u2019t stop it in time.\r\n\r\nThe robot\u2019s other arm rested underneath Katie\u2019s butt and it picked her up in a hugging position. Katie immediately winced and shivered as she felt the lumpy mess in her diaper spread even further.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Katie whispered in a whiny voice.\r\n\r\nKatie could have walked to the table. She would\u2019ve had to lay down on the table but at least the damage would have been minimized. Now she felt the poop spreading with each mechanical step the robot made.\r\n\r\nKatie was left very confused when she saw the changing table over the robot\u2019s shoulder. She was being carried away from it and towards the corridor to the cafeteria. Where was she being taken, this didn\u2019t make any sense to her at all. Surely she wasn\u2019t going to be fed in this position.\r\n\r\nThe confusion only grew as Katie was carried past her usual seat in the cafeteria. She was even distracted from the sticky feeling in her diaper as she looked around and tried to work where she was being taken. She only recognized where she was when she started being carried down the long hallway towards the exit.\r\n\r\nKatie felt her heart soar. Was she being let go? It wouldn\u2019t be a moment too soon but surely they would let her clean up. In the distance, Katie could hear two human voices, the first she had heard in the last few days. She felt a mixture of elation and terror as she was slowly carried down the hallway. She heard the voices getting clearer and with a jolt she slowly started recognizing one of them.\r\n\r\n\u201cMom?\u201d Katie whispered. She was still facing away from the voices so she couldn\u2019t confirm her suspicion but it certainly sounded like her Mother.\r\n\r\n\u201cKatie?\u201d Katie\u2019s Mom called, \u201cOh my God! What is going on!?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI told you to prepare yourself Mrs. Adams.\u201d Came an older male voice, \u201cYour daughter volunteered for this program to try and help change criminal justice in future.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat!?\u201d Both Katie and her Mom said at the same time.\r\n\r\nAs the older man prepared to start explaining things, Katie was placed down in a chair just behind her Mother. She felt her disaster of a diaper spread it\u2019s contents further.\r\n\r\n\u201cKatie, what is going on?\u201d Katie\u2019s Mom asked with a look of revulsion, \u201cIs that a dia\u2026 What\u2019s that sme\u2026 Oh God, Katie!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour daughter has just passed through a program we are developing to help rehabilitate criminals.\u201d The older man said, \u201cMy name is Dr. Phelps, I run this facility.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie was shocked at what was going on. Just minutes ago she had been in the crib and now she was standing at the exit and only feet from freedom. It was dark outside but she finally saw a clock, it was only 10pm.\r\n\r\n\u201cKatie, you have been a wonderful participant!\u201d Dr. Phelps said with a big smile. He handed a clipboard to the girl.\r\n\r\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Katie replied dumbly as she took the clipboard. As the shock wore off Katie became increasingly aware of the terrible state she was in.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain\u2026\u201d Dr. Phelps said as he adjusted his glasses, \u201cThe prisons are overcrowded and the government have been looking for alternative ways to treat criminals. This is my proposed alternative.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie\u2019s Mom couldn\u2019t stop staring at her daughter, she couldn\u2019t believe what she looked like. She was absolutely staggered at what she smelled like!\r\n\r\n\u201cRegression is very powerful.\u201d Dr. Phelps continued, \u201cWe want to use it to rehabilitate people. Break them down and grow them up again, this time with better morals and respect for authority.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou volunteered for this!?\u201d Katie\u2019s Mom asked in shock.\r\n\r\n\u201cNo!\u201d Katie said, \u201cIt didn\u2019t say what it was I was volunteering for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou volunteered for something when it was a total mystery to you?\u201d Katie\u2019s Mom asked flabbergasted.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess\u2026\u201d Katie replied sheepishly. Her butt was starting to get itchy now.\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, young Katie here was quite the participant. We have a lot of great data and modifications thanks to her input. She was such a great participant that we could call you to pick her up earlier than expected.\u201d Dr. Phelps said cheerily, \u201cKatie, if you could fill out that form. We will pay you afterwards.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie grabbed the pen that was attached to the clipboard and started quickly filling in the boxes. There were lots of questions asking how she felt when certain things happened and what could have been better.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe apologize for the secrecy.\u201d Dr. Phelps said, \u201cWe wanted this to be as much of a surprise as possible to get the best results.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Katie finally finished filling in the form she banged the forms down on the chair next to her. The sudden noise made her Mom and the doctor jump, they had got into a conversation and apparently forgotten the young woman was there.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan I get dressed now?\u201d Katie asked. Her cheeks were flushed red and her embarrassment wasn\u2019t helped when her Mom pinched her nose.\r\n\r\n\u201cOf course!\u201d Dr. Phelps replied, \u201cThat room just down the hall has a shower and your clothes that you arrived in.\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie stood up and waddled down the hall without a word. She hurried into the room that had been indicated and took the onesie and diaper off. She dropped the diaper in the trash can with a sealed lid to stop the smell. She had a long shower before drying off and getting dressed back into the clothes she arrived in.\r\n\r\nBy the time she came out of the room and back to the lobby, Katie saw that her Mom was leaning against Katie\u2019s car. Katie assumed her Mom had got a taxi here because her car wasn\u2019t outside.\r\n\r\n\u201cKatie, thank you again!\u201d Dr. Phelps said with a wide smile. He held out an envelope which Katie took without a word. It was filled with a lot of notes, at least she was being well compensated for this nightmare.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne more thing\u2026\u201d Dr. Phelps said as Katie headed towards the exit, \u201cWould you like to return next week for another trial?\u201d\r\n\r\nKatie shook her head in disbelief. After everything that had happened, how did this doctor expect Katie to come back? She was angry at the arrogance. Katie stuck up her middle finger and showed it to the old scientist before walking out the door and to her car.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d Was all Katie said to her Mom as she unlocked the car and drove away. Katie didn\u2019t even want to think about what had happened yet alone talk about it.\r\n\r\nKatie\u2019s Mom asked a lot of questions that her daughter refused to answer as the car backed out of it\u2019s parking space and headed out on to the road.\r\n\r\nDr. Phelps watched them go with a snide smile before walking back down the hallway. They never wanted a second trial, it was the biggest evidence that the program was working!\r\n\r\nAlmost the second Dr. Phelps walked out of sight a new car turned into the car park. A young man stepped out and walked into the building with trepidation. Right on cue, Dr. Phelps pushed a button that popped the door leading to the classroom open.\r\n\r\nDr. Phelps sat down at the computer and began preparing for the next test. The cameras watched the young man as he walked into the classroom looking just as confused as Katie was. Dr. Phelps smiled and flipped over a piece of paper and began to take notes.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [],

Tasmania . ***afrphotos.com*** \nWe humans love round numbers. No one was excited when the four-minute-and-one-second mile barrier was broken. We don't celebrate a batsman who scores 99. And we're so attuned to them when we shop that retailers know $1.99 is far more likely to make us buy, compared to the nice, round - and mentally much higher - $2 mark. \nI don't claim to understand the evolutionary biology behind it, but my guess is that our brains find the short-cut of round numbers easier. After all, \"about 10 lions\" chasing you is probably as specific as humanity needed to be for most of our history. \nWhich brings me to ASX 6000. No, that's not a new index but the fact the ASX 200 index hit 6000 points on Tuesday , while the All Ordinaries hit that level last week - both for the first time since the global financial crisis. And to layer on another round number, we're almost exactly 10 years from the market's pre-GFC high. \nWhat does that mean? The \"points\" are a measure of market capitalisation or value. When a stock goes up x points, that means it goes up x dollars. But for an index, it's weighted according to the size of the companies. \nBut what does it mean? \nWell, as any serious investor will tell you, it's completely unremarkable. Whether we're at 5974 points is no more important or useful for investors, than if we were at 6018. And yet that magical, mentally pleasing '6' at the beginning is something that many are fixated upon, as if it unlocked some special level in the computer game of life. \nAnd we shouldn't be surprised that we're here. Over more than a century, the developed world's share markets have gained about 10 per cent per year, on average. So the odds were very good that we'd get here eventually. Just as we're all but certain to pass 7000, 8000 and 10,000 points - and very probably within a decade. (In fact, if the average holds, we'll see the All Ords pass 100,000 in just 30 years!) \nBut there's no guarantee. \nAnd it's very probable that the ASX lags the US markets over that time frame, too. Look at some of the biggest US companies to have reported earnings in the past couple of weeks. Amazon, Google and Facebook, to name three, are growing like topsy. And that's almost an understatement. They are companies with multi-billion dollar revenues, growing like start-ups. \nAnd our largest companies? NAB recently handed down 2.5 per cent growth. And reported that it will cut $1 billion in costs, ostensibly just to stand still in the face of increased competition and technological disruption. NAB and its financial services brethren make up over 40 per cent of the ASX 200. \nI trust you see the problem: if the Australian market is going to continue to increase at a good rate, that two-fifths of the index is going to have to do better than low-single-digit growth. Otherwise, it's the equivalent of swimming fully clothed - you might still make progress, but it's going to be a tough, slow slog. \nOf course, that's if you focus only on \"the index\". While the top end of town lumbers under its own weight, small and medium-sized Australian businesses will continue to do their thing. It may not be apparent - the index calculation gives CBA, for example, 10 times the weighting in (and therefore 10 times the influence on) the ASX 200, compared to our 30th-largest company - but it'll be happening. Foolish takeaway \nIt's something all investors need to be aware of. If the banks do continue to struggle, and your portfolio looks like the market - chock full of banks and insurers - you will too. But if you compile a portfolio based on tomorrow's likely winners, and throw in some exposure to the US for good measure, you stand a very good chance of throwing off the shackles of a slower-growing ASX 200. \nNew report: The \"blue chips\" of tomorrow aren't the blue chips of yesterday.
