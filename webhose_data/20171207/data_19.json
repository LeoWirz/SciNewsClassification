On the occasion of Art Basel in Miami Beach, 300 illuminated drones moved across the sky above the ocean mimicking a flock of birds and creating a performative artwork at the interface between technology, science, and art. (Photo: http://mma.prnewswire.com/media/616816/BMW_FRANCHISE_FREEDOM_Sculpture.jpg ) \nHildegard Wortmann, Senior Vice President Brand BMW, says: \"It was Edmund Burke - in the middle of the 18th century within his well-known treatise on the sublime - who wrote of beauty as being a movement. This is what Studio Drift and Bayerische Motoren Werke both wholeheartedly subscribe to. 'FRANCHISE FREEDOM' is a technological wonder and a breathtaking aesthetic experience.\" \nBy imitating the natural phenomenon of a swarm of birds with drones, it is the first time for this orchestrated movement to be presented by machines working with decentralized algorithms at a very large scale. Additional shows weather permitting are planned nightly at 8 PM until December 10 between 32nd and 33rd Street off Collins Avenue behind the Faena Hotel Miami Beach. They are visible from a large distance - detailed timing will be shared on Instagram by Studio Drift @studio.drift, by Pace Gallery @pacegallery and by BMW on Instagram @bmwgroupculture and Facebook #bmwgroupculture. \nWhile Studio Drift presented their artwork \"FRANCHISE FREEDOM\" in Miami Beach, Bayerische Motoren Werke had one of their latest masterpieces on site: the BMW Concept 8 Series. \nFurther information available at: http://www.press.bmwgroup.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "edmund burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lonneke gordijn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph nauta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hildegard wortmann", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "studio drift", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bayerische motoren werke", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "miami beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "collins avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faena hotel miami beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "art basel", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:22.048+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b20ab9f3ad90a88160e75e34358aad8a48d92af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W91AcN1ihff7FJgyYuO31zQZzIwW7_RQjRiM1q5g_TX7_nTuWXjPTHjv7a1RZdZnvBUaIHs_iLG2H4z.hwF1Ees4NHSOM2LGTA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "Can we all please dedicate a day to protest the repeal of Net Neutrality everywhere in the US?", "title_full": "Can we all please dedicate a day to protest the repeal of Net Neutrality everywhere in the US? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-07T08:46:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 15, "participants_count": 9, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ce054a1eb7ae19181727474a8f6dcfdebfdda240", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W91AcN1ihff7FJgyYuO31zQZzIwW7_RQjRiM1q5g_TX7_nTuWXjPTHjv7a1RZdZnvBUaIHs_iLG2H4z.hwF1Ees2qT913U9.25LjK3th0DwTGuSvnD15z3g-", "ord_in_thread": 4, "author": "Perisharino", "published": "2017-12-07T08:50:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "The public has been talking about it for the better part of a month now", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:22.052+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "180a6f65b45b9d94f7c1c33e46b5d2a24d5fed60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDh2IwHwJl8c5S7_xwHJYPCZpDkUfBNLwisIkIN_Gv.qPI_6Y4GO5GiXzuNeHSy81fo7Tdr7tbKQVt2AbtpK5ylTkMuaRNjgwxaCot4lrhStH", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Financial Survey: Tailored Brands (TLRD) and Destination XL Group (DXLG)", "title_full": "Financial Survey: Tailored Brands (TLRD) and Destination XL Group (DXLG)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://www.marketbeat.com/logos/destination-xl-group-inc-logo.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "180a6f65b45b9d94f7c1c33e46b5d2a24d5fed60", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDh2IwHwJl8c5S7_xwHJYPCZpDkUfBNLwisIkIN_Gv.qPI_6Y4GO5GiXzuNeHSy81fo7Tdr7tbKQVt2AbtpK5ylTkMuaRNjgwxaCot4lrhStH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ABMN Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T10:52:00.000+02:00", "title": "Financial Survey: Tailored Brands (TLRD) and Destination XL Group (DXLG)", "text": "($0.28) -7.68 \nTailored Brands has higher revenue and earnings than Destination XL Group.

Expert reveals what drives a cheating wife to stray \nCheating is taboo in most relationships, which tend to value monogamy \u2013 but why do women really cheat? \nThere have been various studies into why women cheat on their partners, and the results can be surprising. \nOne such piece of research revealed one reason why women cheat is that they are acting out of revenge. \nFourteen per cent of women claimed that they slept with someone else to get back at their partner, while only 9 per cent of men stated the same reason. \nAnother study claimed that one of the reasons why women cheat is that they are not being given enough gifts by their partner. \nThe study found 69 per cent of women cheated because they did not feel appreciated, and cited not getting enough gifts as a major reason for this. \nHowever, an expert has looked into some the cliches about why women cheat and analysed just how true they are. \nA sociologist at Missouri State University, Alicia Walker, claimed that most women do not really want to leave their husbands, despite their infidelity. \nShe told Business : \u201cUnlike what we think about women, the reality is that the women I spoke to are cheating to stay married. \n\u201cThey\u2019re not cheating for revenge, or to get out of a marriage, or get the husband to notice them through bad behaviour \u2014 they were cheating primarily for sexual pleasure and to remain married.\u201d \nThe expert, who has written a book \u201cThe Secret Life of the Cheating Wife: Power, Pragmatism, and Pleasure in Women\u2019s Infidelity,\u201d also claimed that women tend to plan their affairs carefully, and often cheat with more than one man. \nShe said: \u201cThey were very practical and methodical, in their decision making and then their vetting of who they were going to get involved with. \n\u201cOne woman \u2014 I think this was my favourite \u2014 said she had to keep the candy jar full.\u201d \nHow to catch a cheater is one of the questions that plague the minds of those who suspect their partner is playing away. \nYour partner\u2019s mobile phone really is the one place you are most likely to discover your partner is doing the dirty on you. \nCheating website Ashley Madison has revealed most cheaters use their mobile phone to communicate with an affair partner. \nAccording to real cheaters who use the site to cheat on their loved ones, over half (56 per cent) of survey respondents say they use their personal mobile phone to exchange messages.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ashley madison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alicia walker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "missouri state university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:22.056+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9a53885bac8538130149c4bb7296826c2900a265", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5h8EUV4w0b92MWpLxWJs8q0-", "site_full": "forums.overclockers.co.uk", "site": "overclockers.co.uk", "site_section": "http://forums.overclockers.co.uk/", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Overclockers UK Forums", "title": "Road Cycling | Page 614", "title_full": "Road Cycling | Page 614 | Overclockers UK Forums", "published": "2017-12-05T07:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://forums.overclockers.co.uk/styles/default/xenforo/avatars/avatar_m.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13599, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c673f25eaaec37a3164f0aa152a75cdf4b64453d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRzlB.3lY..GwbCvKuuYhLJ8KiWEZqEPPqzLGCuo2iC5h8EUV4w0b92HflJ_UJpyy__CKU9pDyEDQ--", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Fusion", "published": "2017-12-05T08:19:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Damn, my bad.

He's too young for that and won't understand or relate to those values as yet.\nPlease suggest.\n3 places mentioned in this post 1 Paradise Beach Ranked #3 of 69 things to do in Pondicherry 1,790 Reviews 2 Rock Beach Ranked #5 of 69 things to do in Pondicherry 192 Reviews 3 Auroville Union Territory of Pondicherry, India See all 3", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://static.tacdn.com/img2/x.gif", "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/social/no_photo_geo.gif"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:23.040+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c3198978e90821d659674cc7bf9cf5df9f7957e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRinY1EvmxOv6cPXKNwGbY0Lw39OjRGDJ67u3CK3dd_DOICQIS2uz5Or1uVBqDNuq8ZMY6C2nzsTzfHXM2UP3A54fTQF0wVpNymlYI7v0fU53H3uClnB6Jt", "site_full": "www.economicshelp.org", "site": "economicshelp.org", "site_section": "https://www.economicshelp.org", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Economics  Help", "title": "Factors affecting Current Account Deficit", "title_full": "Factors affecting Current Account Deficit", "published": "2017-12-07T07:38:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 47433, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c3198978e90821d659674cc7bf9cf5df9f7957e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRinY1EvmxOv6cPXKNwGbY0Lw39OjRGDJ67u3CK3dd_DOICQIS2uz5Or1uVBqDNuq8ZMY6C2nzsTzfHXM2UP3A54fTQF0wVpNymlYI7v0fU53H3uClnB6Jt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tejvan Pettinger", "published": "2017-12-07T07:38:00.000+02:00", "title": "Factors affecting Current Account Deficit", "text": "Home > Economics help blog > economics > Factors affecting Current Account Deficit Factors affecting Current Account Deficit Tejvan Pettinger \nThe size of current account deficit/surplus is affected by several factors including: Exchange rate (overvalued exchange rate would cause large deficit) Level of consumer spending (economic growth) and hence import spending Capital flows to finance deficit in long-term Saving rates \u2013 influencing level of import spending Relative inflation/competitiveness The balance of trade in goods The balance of trade in services. Net current income e.g. profit from overseas investment. Transfer payments e.g. payments to the EU. \nNotes A deficit implies imports good/services greater than exports. The net balance of trade in goods and services is the biggest factor in determining the current account. If there is a deficit on the current account, there will be a surplus on the Financial/Current account to compensate for the net withdrawals. \n1. Economic growth/consumer spending \nA period of consumer-led economic growth will cause a deterioration in the current account. Higher consumer spending will lead to higher spending on imports. At the end of the 1980s, the UK economy was booming with rising consumer spending and inflation. This led to a widening deficit on the current account. The recession of 1992 led to an improvement and a brief surplus in the mid-1990s. The recession of 2009 also led to a temporary improvement in the deficit as consumers cut back on spending. \nEvaluation Marginal propensity to import . In the UK, consumers often have a high marginal propensity to import \u2013 this means a high percentage of extra income goes on imports. Therefore, in periods of economic growth, we see a significant rise in import spending. Depends on the type of economic growth . Economic growth can be export-led or investment-led. In this case, exports may be growing faster than import spending. For example, economies like China and Germany have experienced high economic growth, but also a current account surplus. This is due to the export-led nature of growth. \n2. Exchange Rate \nA depreciation in the exchange rate makes the currency relatively more competitive. After a depreciation, exports will be more competitive and imports more expensive. This should improve the current account. \nHowever, it requires the demand for exports and imports to be relatively price elastic. If demand is inelastic, then cheaper exports will only cause a small rise in demand and the actual value of exports can decrease. There is often a time lag effect between a depreciation in the exchange rate and improvement in the current account. In the short term, demand is inelastic, but over time, consumers become more price sensitive and the depreciation starts to improve the current account. A depreciation may only cause a temporary improvement in the current account if it causes domestic inflation to increase. A depreciation can cause inflation for three reasons \u2013 1) raises the price of imports, 2) increase domestic demand and also 3) may reduce the incentive of firms to cut costs \u2013 if this causes inflation, then the country will lose competitiveness and this will offset the improvement from the depreciation. \n3. Competitiveness \nIn the long term, the current account will be influenced by the relative competitiveness of an economies export industries.If a country becomes uncompetitive, then exports will decline relative to imports. For example, in the 1950s and 1960s, the UK didn\u2019t have a large current account deficit. However, starting in the 1970s and 1980s, we have seen a steady increase in the underlying current account deficit. In particular, the deficit in goods (manufactured goods) has increased. This suggests that UK industry has become relatively less competitive. For example, it hasn\u2019t been able to compete with low-cost countries such as China or higher productivity countries like Germany. Many factors determine relative competitiveness such as Relative wages", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury bills", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:23.051+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ab52cd7f00c17f038389972442fc65782bb90ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdxtHLUb7Mx8ahpecUjvkeeVTITpFpAh5jJ7Mvt4W08jIVi4Hxxe.tbf.0pmXSq9gEVHv_l9qDYcg--", "site_full": "dv.dvolatility.com", "site": "dvolatility.com", "site_section": "http://dv.dvolatility.com/", "site_categories": ["media", "law_government_and_politics", "politics"], "section_title": "Distressed Volatility", "title": "4pm Update On Creek Fire", "title_full": "4pm Update On Creek Fire", "published": "2017-12-07T10:58:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ab52cd7f00c17f038389972442fc65782bb90ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78UdxtHLUb7Mx8ahpecUjvkeeVTITpFpAh5jJ7Mvt4W08jIVi4Hxxe.tbf.0pmXSq9gEVHv_l9qDYcg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DVNET (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:58:00.000+02:00", "title": "4pm Update On Creek Fire", "text": "...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:24.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c5684c48cea05139e12520555f98c0371c55fe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2Gfvk8fzO8XHUfxkhd2H_aERj51lu9H5YFy1cBRB9ouSRXZvzL61zrrBQGIBe0GGfe1zbKbXUMPVPEfV67V7fc-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What are the dead professions of the world?", "title_full": "What are the dead professions of the world?

But worldwide, 14 million girls - equivalent to the population of greater London - could face a new year without the comforts of home, after being displaced by humanitarian disasters. \nChildren\u2019s author Giles Paley-Phillips has written a fictional children\u2019s story, based on the experiences of girls who ActionAid works with, to show how child sponsorship can make a difference to girls in countries affected by conflict.

Watch \u2018The Story of Hope\u2019 \nSadly, experiences like Amala\u2019s \u2014the girl featured in the film \u2014are becoming more common. There has been an almost 50 per cent increase in the number of girls who have been displaced since 2013, based on figures published by the United Nations. Girls trapped in humanitarian emergencies are at a higher risk of being out of school, putting them at risk of child marriage and sexual exploitation. \nThis is why Anna Maxwell-Martin supports ActionAid UK \u2019s No Girl Afraid Christmas appeal. \n\u201cEvery day it seems that we hear the stories of more and more people fleeing conflicts, or emergencies not of their making.

It too had directed the NCERT to respond but to no avail. Goyal had filed the petition in the high court on November 21. Goyal said his correspondence with the NCERT regarding the errors in the Biology Exemplars and textbooks started in 2012. \n\n\"More than 100 corrections had been carried out in biology books on my suggestion. But earlier as well, all this was done only after the PMO intervened and a petition was filed later. \n\nThe high court had directed the NCERT to carry out the exercise through an order dated March 13, 2014. Thereafter, a representation was made for 25 new errors and a petition was again filed. The NCERT was then also directed to rectify the existing and new errors,\" Goyal said. \n\nAlthough the NCERT had rectified many errors, some were not. Around 11 errors were pointed out to the NCERT last year, to which it had not responded till date. \n\n\"We had sent a representation on March 12 to the PMO for instructing the NCERT to rectify the errors, which were forwarded to secretary, department of education in science and mathematics (DESM), NCERT. We received a reply from him on April 28 that they have rectified many mistakes. \n\nIn view of the reply, we made a representation on May 11 along with a list of errors to the NCERT for rectification of the pending 11 errors, but to no effect. Thereafter, we made another representation on November 4 to professor and head, DESM, NCERT, New Delhi for rectification, but got no response,\" Goyal said. \n\nHe suggested a need for online service for rectifying errors. \"Considering the fact that there are so many errors in NCERT books and that these books are important for all the exams, the NCERT should develop a portal where teachers and students can load the erroneous facts. The NCERT expert group should examine these errors at the earliest and corrections should be loaded on the portal without any delay,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arvind goyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goyal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xii", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "haryana high court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national council of education", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pmo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncert", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "punjab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ncert", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:24.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c5684c48cea05139e12520555f98c0371c55fe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2Gfvk8fzO8XHUfxkhd2H_aERj51lu9H5YFy1cBRB9ouSRXZvzL61zrrBQGIBe0GGfe1zbKbXUMPVPEfV67V7fc-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What are the dead professions of the world?", "title_full": "What are the dead professions of the world? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-07T06:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 81, "participants_count": 119, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4853baf2a547f3cf955c2e79f3ca04b05e24943d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2Gfvk8fzO8XHUfxkhd2H_aERj51lu9H5YFy1cBRB9ouSRXZvzL61zrrBQGIBe0GGfe1zbKbXUMPuYAXYNmEsTUhoVntjSa5BmGyRd3XOrwsabvKYjkIW9A-", "ord_in_thread": 77, "author": "RabidZoo", "published": "2017-12-07T10:48:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "You would think anything involving asbestos but it is still a thriving industry across the world.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:24.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d77e5cb72f23916511c9de6383a1d8d714296725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQs.IECCVEmrophGvdLanIW6mWTG5uKo4raJv_86pfMeMiUbqwf7ezjvZPGUW5eU0j", "site_full": "forums.att.com", "site": "att.com", "site_section": "https://forums.att.com:443/t5/AT-T-PREPAID/bd-p/prepaid", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment", "non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "AT&amp;T PREPAID - AT&amp;T Community", "title": "Pending order", "title_full": "Pending order - AT&T Community", "published": "2017-12-06T15:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "https://forums.att.com/html/assets/att_globe_rgb_pos2.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 335, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d77e5cb72f23916511c9de6383a1d8d714296725", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRWdzjE8MP1_UI0PlzfyPHQs.IECCVEmrophGvdLanIW6mWTG5uKo4raJv_86pfMeMiUbqwf7ezjvZPGUW5eU0j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Constructive", "published": "2017-12-06T15:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "Pending order", "text": "This forum is comprised of regular customers to communicate with other customers to offer advice and share experiences same as any other user.

Once again 128 players from over 40 countries will clash to see who will be crowned the king of 9-ball pool. \n\nAs usual the tournament will be run in two brutally difficult parts. The Group stages will run from Dec. 9-11. The players will be broken up into 16 groups of 8 playing a race-to-9, alternate break, double elimination format.  Four players from each group will make up the final 64, which marks the start of the always tense and dramatic single elimination phase of the tournament.  Matches will then become race to 11, alternate break. The final, which takes place on December 14, will be a race to 13. \n\nIn 25 previous editions dating back to 1990, the World 9-ball Championship has always provided the kind of nerve rattling drama that has captured the imagination of pool fans around the globe. It\u2019s that kind of pressure cooker atmosphere that has always weeded out the pretenders to pool\u2019s ultimate crown, and produced a veritable pantheon of pool greats. \n\nThese greats make up a who\u2019s who of the sport of pool. Multiple winners of the World 9-ball Championship include the legendary Earl Strickland(1990, \u201991, \u201902), Johnny Archer(\u201992, \u201997), Taiwan\u2019s Fong Pang Chao(\u201993, 2000),  and Thorsten Hohmann(2003, \u201913). \n\nGermany\u2019s Ralf Souquet(\u201996) and Oliver Ortmann(\u201995), Finland\u2019s Mika Immonen(\u201901), the Netherlands Niels Feijen(\u201914), the Philippines Efren Reyes(\u201999)  Alex Pagulayan(\u201904), Ronnie Alcano(\u201906), Francisco Bustamante(\u201910), England\u2019s Darren Appleton(\u201912) and Daryl Peach(\u201907), Taiwan\u2019s Ko Pin Yi(\u201915) all cemented their status as giants of the game by winning the World 9-ball Championship. \n\nIn 2016 Austria\u2019s Albin Ouschan added his name to the illustrious list of champions with a 13-6 drubbing of American Shane Van Boening. It was the second straight year that the talented American star had lost in the finals. In 2015 Van Boening lost out to Taiwan\u2019s Ko. \n\nWho will reign supreme in 2017? Look for players from the Philippines, Taiwan, China, and several European countries to make the biggest impact and likely make a run at the crown. Of course it\u2019s always a crap shoot trying to determine who will rule a field filled with pool giants, newcomers and possible contenders. And as always in pool, the tense and dramatic nature of the format and the event itself generally means that the cream always rises to the top. \n\n\n\n**The 2017 WPA World 9-ball Championship takes place at the  Al Arabi Sports Club  Sports Club in Doha, Qatar from December 5-15,2017 The qualifying stages run from Dec. 5-7, while the main draw of 128 players runs from Dec 9-15. \n\nThe winner of the 2017 World 9-ball Championship will receive $30,000. The runner up will receive $15,000. The total prize fund is $200,000. \n\nFans around the world will be able to view many of the matches via the QBSF\u2019s free live streaming platform. Multiple tables will be available to view online at no charge to the public. The WPA will provide more information regarding the live stream in the coming days. \n\nThe players will compete on   Wiraka DYNASTY    Tables with Simonis 860 Cloth, Electric Blue Color and using Aramith  Tournament   Pro cup TV Pool Balls featuring the new Duramith Technology. \n\nThe 2017 World 9-ball Championship is hosted by The Qatar Billiard and Snooker Federation(QBSF), and was sanctioned by the The World Pool Billiard Association, the governing body of the sport of pool. \n\nFans can interact with us through the WPA\u2019s official Facebook Page for the event at this link; https://www.facebook.com/worldpoolbilliardassociation/ \n\nThe WPA is also on Twitter; @poolwpa \n\nVisit the official website of the WPA at  www.wpapool.com \n\n\nALL SYSTEMS GO FOR WORLD 9-BALL CHAMPIONSHIP \n\nWorld Pool Billiard -", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ted lerner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simonis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francisco bustamante", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earl strickland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fong pang chao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niels feijen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "darren appleton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "van boening", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines efren reyes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daryl peach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny archer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thorsten hohmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shane van boening", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralf souquet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex pagulayan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronnie alcano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oliver ortmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mika immonen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albin ouschan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wpa press offic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "group", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qbsf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electric blue color", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al arabi sports club  sports club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar billiard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duramith technology", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar billiards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world pool billiard association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al arabi sports club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snooker federation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook page", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "doha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qatar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "austria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:24.029+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6c5684c48cea05139e12520555f98c0371c55fe3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2Gfvk8fzO8XHUfxkhd2H_aERj51lu9H5YFy1cBRB9ouSRXZvzL61zrrBQGIBe0GGfe1zbKbXUMPVPEfV67V7fc-", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What are the dead professions of the world?", "title_full": "What are the dead professions of the world? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-07T06:42:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 81, "participants_count": 119, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81d53cad61431a405acd3357284aef372bbef14e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W2Gfvk8fzO8XHUfxkhd2H_aERj51lu9H5YFy1cBRB9ouSRXZvzL61zrrBQGIBe0GGfe1zbKbXUMPuYAXYNmEsTUhoVntjSa5BsN_McFfmC9Kfsb2iP8p7ls-", "ord_in_thread": 79, "author": "hokeyWB", "published": "2017-12-07T11:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Computer.\nThe name came from a person who would do maths for a living...

Author: From laser hair removal to derma-rolling (and everything in between). 1 SHARES \nThis year was one filled with a lot of beauty experimentation\u2014Emily tried her hand at techniques for glowy skin like derma-rolling and derma-planing, and tested out hundreds of products before launching Beauty on the Shop (which is in the processing of growing even more!) and Leslie reprioritized her beauty routine away from quick, cheap buys to investments and healthy decisions that last. Here are our favorite beauty decisions we made in 2017: \nA few months ago, I started doing a less-intrusive version of the derma-rolling practiced by trained aestheticians. The idea is that you poke a ton of tiny needles into your skin to boost the collagen production and diminish fine lines and unevenness. I noticed a difference in the overall glowiness of my skin almost as soon as I started incorporating it into my weekly routine! \nWhen it comes to experimental beauty procedures, I'm usually the first in my group of friends to volunteer as a guinea pig, which is how I ended up with a Groupon heading to a laser hair removal center in Glendale. Since it was early in the spring (hello, swimsuit season), I started with my bikini area and saw results immediately\u2014I'd estimate the first session it removed 60% of my hair growth. When I returned, I purchased a six-session for my underarms in addition to bikini and just finished my final session last week (it takes a time commitment since you have to return every five weeks to get zapped!). If you're sensitive to pain, this may not be for you\u2014the first session felt like a rubber band snapping against my skin, but because the strength of the lasers increases each time, it felt like I was getting shanked by a thousand tiny knives by the sixth session. The good news is that each area only takes about 30 seconds to a minute to complete and the pain goes away instantly, like a quick zap. My favorite part (aside from not having to shave!) is that there are zero of the bumps or irritations you'd get with shaving. I've since convinced my entire group of girlfriends to get laser hair removal and we're all thrilled with the results! \nAround the time Leslie began getting lash extensions (more on that below!), I began to experiment with how to make my own lashes look fuller. After an \"eyelash perm\" that produced less-than-impressive results, despite the hefty price tag, I decided to try out an over-the-counter lash serum, Lash Boost, from Rodan & Fields. After using it for about eight few weeks, I began to notice a major difference and I couldn't be happier with the results. I just swipe on the serum along my upper lashes as part of my nighttime routine and that's it. I got it through my friend, Melisa, who's a rep for the brand here ! \nEach year, it feels like I wear less makeup than the year prior . In middle school, thanks to unsupervised guidance from a friend's older sister, I wore all of the makeup, waking up two hours before school to inexpertly apply foundation, eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, and pretty much MAC's entire line. By college, I'd ditched the eyeliner and shadow, and for the past year, I've only applied the following products, making skincare a priority: Caudal\u00ede serum , Glossier Priming Moisturizer , Glossier Invisible Shield SPF , RMS Un-Coverup , W3ll People Luminzer , Mary Kay Brow Gel , Maybelline brow pencil , and maybe some lipstick and mascara or lash extensions. As a result, my skin has felt glowier and I've learned to embrace how I look, minus all the bells and whistles. \nMy brow routine changes more than any other part of my beauty routine (even since posting this video , I've started filling them in less dramatically). Over the past year, I went through the very unglamorous process of growing them out, then plucking them minimally to look somewhat pulled-together. I'm finally happy with where they are now, which is somewhere between groomed and polished, and naturally featured and full. \nSince writing this post , I haven't been as diligent about getting lash extensions every three weeks, since travel and work got in the way of my regular appointments, but I still love having extensions in my beauty tool belt when I want to feel my best! \nLike I mentioned in the post , dermaplaning\u2014which is essentially shaving your face\u2014isn't something I'd file under \"cute beauty regimen,\" but like derma-rolling, it's made an unquestionable difference when it comes to helping my skin look dewy and moisturized. To do it, I simply shave when I notice hair with a fresh or like-new razor in quick, downward strokes with light pressure. \nEven more than in years past, I prioritized feeling \"healthy\" over feeling \"beautiful,\" and was surprised by how many health-based decisions led me, in turn, to feel more beautiful. This year, I switched up my diet to be more plant-based and joined a gym, which made me feel better physically. I invested in a gum surgery, which allowed me to smile widely without fearing for my hyper-sensitive teeth. And, as a lifelong insomniac, I worked on creating a healthier sleep routine which had a dramatic effect on how my skin looks! \nI'm someone who has her nails (both fingers and toes) painted pretty much at all times. And while choosing new colors to experiment with is always fun, I surprised myself by how much I loved finding my \"signature shade\" this year . I'm now partial to Essie's 'Flashed' since it's a fun, punchy red that doesn't look too serious, but pops in a way that it garners tons of compliments. While I certainly switch it up occasionally, there's something satisfying about finding my shade that always works. \nSince I started working out more this year (awesome!), I also started getting more breakouts (not awesome!). While I wash my face or use face wipes as soon as I can after any workout, it wasn't making a noticeable difference. What did help was double-cleansing. Every evening, I first rub cleansing oil over my face, then use a clean washcloth soaked in warm water to wipe it off. Next, I wash my face as I normally would with a conventional cleanser, then wipe my face off using a cotton pad soaked in micellar water . That's it! Breakouts (almost) gone! \nSunscreen is one part of my routine I often overlook but made a concerted effort to start using regularly this year, thanks to many of you urging me to! Since my biggest complaint was that it often made the rest of my makeup go on less-than-smoothly, I started applying it as a makeup setting spray and haven't looked back since! \nIn years past, I was much more flippant about my skincare routine. I blame having relatively problem-free skin that allowed me to get away with things (ie not washing my face before bed, skipping sunscreen) without seeing negative results. Now that I'm 34, I take a much more disciplined approach to my skin. No matter how tired I am at the end of the day, I remove my makeup, apply serum and lotion, exfoliate regularly, use masks, and get occasional facials. I'm not trying to pull a Benjamin Button here\u2014just hoping to do some maintenance in hopes of aging gracefully.

\n11 . I guarantee that someone on each of those Senators\u2019 staffs reads the local newspaper cover to cover every day. You want the # GradStudentTax to be on their minds. \n12 . I would then caution # GradStudentTax / # GradSchoolTax opponents against hitting the streets - protest style. For some of these Senators protest will only fuel the narrative that grad students are privileged, elite, liberal snowflakes in their ivory tower. \n13 . While that is incredibly unfair, that is how some Senators will see your impassioned speech about the # GradStudentTax . Instead, this is a great time to use the skills you\u2019ve learned in academia. \n14 . By now, you have spent so much time as a grad student learning how to write. Use those skills - write emails, letters, op-eds, etc. There is a place for open protest, but the written word is much stronger than any picket sign or chant when it comes to the # GradStudentTax . \n15 . Most importantly, keep your eye on the prize - finishing your research/dissertation/thesis etc. If this bill will cripple your ability to go to grad school, do all you can to finish before the # GradStudentTax / # GradSchoolTax gets enacted. \n16 . We need citizen-academics to change the world with their research. That is a lot harder to do if the # GradStudentTax forces you to quit before you get \u201cPhD\u201d at the end of your name. Do all you can to finish, and do so ASAP. \n17 . Lastly, I would tell # GradStudentTax opponents stay out of the way of the universities and other organizations that are fighting on your behalf. If you are in graduate school, chances are your university has a lobbyist who is fighting tooth and nail for your future. \n18 . Don\u2019t get in your lobbyist\u2019s way by being mean to Senators or their staff. Your lobbyists need to draw on good relationships they\u2019ve spent years building in order to do their jobs. Don\u2019t tie one hand behind their backs just because you are (understandably) angry. \n19 . That\u2019s how I would tell # gradstudents to oppose the # GradStudentTax if I was still a lobbyist. But I\u2019m not, so I defer to actual university lobbyists who do incredible work. If you hear something different from them, listen to them. Trust me, they know what they are doing. \nFacebook user Amanda Rose posted a photo calculating how much taxes she would have to pay under the new tax bill. \nUnder a $39K take home stipend and $51k tuition, she used to pay $3.7k in taxes, and could potentially pay $13.4k in taxes, leaving her post-rent income decreasing from $21.4k to just $11.7k, a nearly 50% decrease in disposable income. \nI took a hiatus to apply for grad school but the damn GOP just won\u2019t let me live. Back to yell into the Tumblr void about this: \nThe House has passed their new Tax Bill which does many unreasonable things, the chief of which I am unhappy about is that they will no longer consider tuition waviers as untaxable income . \nConsider that most grad school programs cost anywhere between $30k-$50K a year, with stipends in the range of $20 to $30K. Under the new ruling, grad students will be taxed the tuition wavier, money which they never touch. This could raise taxable income from $30k to $80k . Not only do grad students already earn very little to survive on, now they pay a higher real tax rate than any billionaire (adjusted for take home income). It is entirely possible for them to have to pay nearly $12k just in taxes, leaving just $18k to live on . \nI am in the process of applying to grad school and receiving this news I don\u2019t even know if I can afford it now, even with a full ride. I was already not going to accept any school that doesn\u2019t cover my tuition, now I might not even be able to attend at all. \nThe (barely) good news is that the Senate has a Tax Bill of its own that retains the clause that keeps tuition waviers from being taxed. If the Senate passes that Tax Bill, then the House and Senate will have to sit down and reconcile the bills . Meaning, the have to argue over the differences and decide which version to keep in the final cut . \nIt is possible to keep tuition waviers tax free. Following what ex-lobbyist Chris Marsicano said, there are ways to persuade the GOP members that will be on the reconciliation committee to favor the Senate version . Please help spread the word, so that grad students in the USA can afford their education, rather than have to give up their studies.

The presidents of the Thai Seed Trade Association, Dr Chaireg Aagwansupyakorn, the Seed Association of Thailand, Dr Juangjun Duangpatra, the Plant Breeding and Crop Multiple Association of Thailand, Mr Pichet Grudloyma, and the secretary of the Federation of Safe Agriculture, Mr Sukan Sangwanna, held a round-table discussion on the current landscape and implications for Thailand with what is being considered. The signatures of these Thai agricultural leaders, as well as the logos for the organizations they represent. The International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV), based in Geneva, Switzerland, has a mission to provide and promote an effective system of plant variety and protection with the aim of encouraging the development of new varieties of plants for the benefit of society. It focuses on patents for plant varieties in a way that many farmers in developing countries perceive they are prevented from using saved seed or that of protected varieties, presenting disadvantages to them. Others argue plant variety protection allows them more access to new and improved varieties with bigger and more disease and pest resistant yields. Debate on the issues is considered vital, especially for countries such as Thailand, which exports many foods and also has many subsistence farmers. Thailand's government recognizes UPOV's position with specific exceptions. Research and development in the field of sustainable food, feed, fiber and fuel needs is intensive and competitive, making intellectual protection an important issue for growers and developers. The purpose of the November discussion concerned plant breeders' rights in Thailand and UPOV's mission. Under a 1991 UPOV Act, developing countries have specific allowances. These include exemptions for breeders producing plants for non-commercial purposes, such as subsistence farmers. The current Thailand draft amended Plant Variety Protection Act incorporates an exemption in circumstances in which the relevant minister decides this is warranted.

Customers seeking to use these services to pay for their goods and services can end up being disappointed which ought to be avoided.\n\nCustomer support is another aspect that must be considered. Sometimes a machine can malfunction in the middle of a busy day and it should be fixed immediately. The company offering terminal services should have an established customer call center where one can be able to raise issues. Plus, these support services ought to be available on a daily basis and should include night hours as well.\n\nAfter identifying a list of items that one is looking for in a service provider. The next agenda is finding a company with a good repute to work with. The internet is a good place to start the search. Second, a business mogul may opt to ask for referrals from other business owners, friends and relatives. Checking with the banks to find out if there are any complaints regarding various providers is important.\n\nWhen choosing a provider, choose one that addresses the needs of the business and that of the customers in the best way possible. This should also guide a mogul in choosing the kind of equipment that befits the business. One may choose to utilize mobile or fixed devices depending on the nature of the business. If a customer will be moving from one point to the other when doing their shopping, then a mobile device can be ideal in this setting.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get a detailed overview of the advantages of using Credit Card Terminal Companies and information about reliable Credit Card Terminal Companies today. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "trent christiano   once", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:27.008+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bd8e7aea2bc66b8119c28f0aefe95af352e2fccd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaUuykzeLb6_.7x6yAu5i4LT7iBtfY92ZB_b_Lj43.j0Pju8CAwH7xm3oBnS.pbS484jKEtFfCWYMHgGb_wUc24zfM3KteKTWPZ5yWrW.OG8s-", "site_full": "www.expedia.com.br", "site": "expedia.com.br", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.com.br/Nassau-Hoteis.d601784.Guia-de-Hoteis", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel", "hotels"], "section_title": "Hot\u00e9is em Nassau: Pague em parcelas em at\u00e9 12x sem IOF | Expedia.com.br", "title": "Holiday Inn Express & Suites Nassau:", "title_full": "Holiday Inn Express & Suites Nassau: Pre\u00e7os, promo\u00e7\u00f5es e coment\u00e1rios | Expedia.com.br", "published": "2016-11-08T22:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 9, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46532, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e9e27e4180996e8b5cbace2a6ce12eb1cdfe3ada", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbZ_AJz2wmspaUuykzeLb6_.7x6yAu5i4LT7iBtfY92ZB_b_Lj43.j0Pju8CAwH7xm3oBnS.pbS484jKEtFfCWYMHgGb_wUc24zfM3KteKTWPgYGZvVVJeacQkMSvWgzuGSIKmrchpnunJeytjsVubAc-", "ord_in_thread": 9, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-06T13:04:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Camera un po\u2019 rumorosa per vicinanza strada principale molto trafficata", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 4.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:27.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d1de2e123e900549115f13f47e61c6602ce87117", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKx7VpXJsX9eKxVE846xa8wzznOc.W7jNZ61Hi2ZcMNeZcquIhAFf5kJu4Ifgq2gu72.dVn731zBsw--", "site_full": "photomihalis.blogspot.com", "site": "blogspot.com", "site_section": "http://photomihalis.blogspot.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Photo Mihalis.Thalassis Athens Greece", "title": "\u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u03a0\u03b1\u0390\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 \u0391\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 -

In four months, police have shown her the photographs of more than 200 suspects, but none matches the culprit. Her statements offer little clue and there is no CCTV image of the crime. Talk about a difficult case to crack. Police are looking for who appears to be around 40 and who can be placed on the scene of the crime at Children's Traffic Park in Sector 23. \"The girl had taken her usual shortcut to the school via this park,\" an official close to the investigation said. \"This path joins the school's back gate and is the regular course of children. That day, the gate was shut on account of national holiday but a few students were called for a short assembly and flag hoisting. The girl was part of the choir.\" The haunting \"The teenaged girl took the same route to school that day and was unaware that the back gate would be closed. Upon reaching, she realized and turned around,\" the official said. According to the girl's statement, a man sitting on a bench near the back gate called her and tried talking to her. \"He said, 'I am your dad's friend... Do you know Chandni of your school?',\" the cop said, adding that the girl said the man was unknown to her. \"The girl claimed that she ignored him and changed her direction. This was when the man covered her face and dragged her to a 'nalla', where, the girl alleged, she was raped,\" the official said. The rape survivor told her parents about the incident as soon as she reached home, said the police official. Cops say they were informed at 8.35am. Soon after, top police officials, including the SSP , left the flag-hoisting event at Parade Ground, Sector 17, and reached the spot and cordoned off the park.Some officials took the girl for a medical test to Government Multi-Specialty Hospital (GMSH), Sector 16, and, on the basis of her statement, registered a case under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and POCSO Act. \"According to the medical report, there were no marks of resistance or strangling. The medical report, however, also states that 'the possibility of the crime cannot be ruled out',\" said the official. Ironically, the incident took place a few days after a stalking case that involved Vikas Barala , son of Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala , and his friend Ashish Kumar, a time when police were on alert and women had taken out a candle-light march to demand that the administration provide them access to public spaces, so that they do not have to worry about their safety.

I suggest we don\u2019t agree.\u201d\nDespite the Central Election Commission ruling him ineligible to stand, Navalny has organized mass protests and set up campaign headquarters across the country, hoping he can pressure the authorities into allowing him to stand.\nNo obvious successor\nThe challenge for Putin though is not other candidates \u2013 nobody, including Navalny, looks capable of unseating him.\nInstead, his toughest task will be to mobilize an electorate showing signs of apathy to ensure a high turnout which in the tightly-controlled limits of the Russian political system is seen as conferring legitimacy.\nWhilst next year\u2019s election in March is devoid of real suspense about who will win, what follows is more unpredictable as attention will turn to what happens after Putin\u2019s final term \u2013 under the current constitution \u2013 ends.\nThere is no obvious successor. Many investors say the lack of a clear succession plan, and likely jockeying for position among Russian elites for dominance in the post-Putin era, is becoming the biggest political risk.\nPutin, once re-elected, will have to choose whether to leave Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister, or to appoint someone else. That decision will trigger a round of intrigue over the succession, as whoever holds the prime minister\u2019s post is often viewed as the president\u2019s heir apparent.\nIn the meantime, perhaps the Kremlin\u2019s biggest task will be to make it look as if Putin faces real electoral competition.\nIn a move critics suspect is a Kremlin ploy to split the liberal opposition vote while injecting a patina of interest, TV celebrity Ksenia Sobchak, the daughter of Putin\u2019s political mentor, is standing against him, offering voters unhappy with his rule someone to back.\nA political ing\u00e9nue, Sobchak has scant chance of winning. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied her candidacy is a Kremlin ploy. Sobchak said on Wednesday that Putin would probably win \u201cas always,\u201d but that she still planned to run to represent people who wanted change.\nOtherwise, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, 73, and nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 71, \u2013 both political retreads \u2013 are likely to run.\nThey are broadly supportive of the Kremlin\u2019s policies and have repeatedly run for president, behavior critics say is a ruse to create the illusion of genuine political choice.\nPutin draws much of his support from outside the two biggest cities \u2013 Moscow and St Petersburg \u2013 where many credit him with raising their living standards despite an economic crisis Russia is only now recovering from.\nState TV, where many Russians still get their news, affords Putin blanket and uncritical coverage while ignoring or denigrating his opponents.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

The countries were classified according to the Gini coefficient, a number that measures the inequality in a given country, evaluating the distribution of income of the family.

I've finally started but I still have so many things to buy. If you're stuck for ideas for people then keep checking back to my blog as i'll be publishing lots of gift guides.  \n\nFirst up are my stocking fillers for women: \n\n\n\n1) Candle - Yankee Candle* I always burn candles at home and my brand of choice are  Yankee Candle . They have some fab festive scents out at the moment. I can't get enough of 'Christmas Magic'. It smells incredible. Others include crackling wood fire, holiday sage and the perfect tree to name a few. I actually have a really big stocking (of course) so mine would hold a full sized candle. For those that have a smaller stocking you could think about getting the tea lights or smaller sized candles.  \n\n\n\n\n\n2) Book Books are a great thing to pop in a stocking (plus they take up quite a bit of room). There are two books I am hoping for this Christmas (or hopefully before so I can read them on our long haul flight) and they are  Some Kind of Wonderful by Giovanna Fletcher  and  The Book of Dust by Philip Pullman . \n\n\n3) A Diary - Busy B* Everyone needs a diary and December is the perfect time of year to get one. The Busy B range is always lovely. They have fantastic prints. The Day a Page Diary has plenty of space to fill in meetings, appointments etc. It's soft and not too heavy which is ideal for a handbag. \n\n\n\n\n4) A Phone Case I adore phone cases. There are so many to choose from these days that you could have a different one every week. I am obsessed with the range at  Skinny Dip . They have the cutest festive Starbucks ones and also some amazing bright vibrant cases.They are the ideal size for a Christmas stocking. \n\n\nImages taken from Skinny Dip \n\n5) Satin Hair 7 - Braun* The Braun Satin Hair 7 is the perfect sized stocking filler. The unique hairbrush has active ions which help to reduce frizz and leave hair shiny. This also comes with batteries so it's good to go from the minute it is opened.  \n\n\n6) Make up Brushes - Spectrum You can get individual brushes or a set of brushes. If you are around the same age as me (32) then you will remember an iconic film from your teen hood...Mean Girls. Well the awesome people over at Spectrum  have created a Mean Girls brush collection. I have had my eye on them for ages so I am really hoping Santa leaves them in my stocking. They have a fetch collection and even a burn book!! \n\n  Images from Spectrum  Collections.com \n\n7) Instant Facelift - Skin Doctors You'll have to be careful with this one as it may offend some people but at my age and my paranoia every time I watch my youtube or instagram stories, I would love to receive this gift. The instant facelift by Skin Doctors  is designed to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. It immediately tightens and smooths the skin within 5 minutes of application. It can also be used as a make up primer. It comes in 30ml so is a great size for stuffing into the bottom of a stocking. \n\n\n\n\n8) Tea - T2 \nI drink tea far too much so I always love receiving speciality tea's. I was first introduced to T2 many years ago when visiting my family in Australia. It's a fantastic shop. To my amazement I then spotted a store in London years later. You can also shop online. They do so many different tea's and they have a gorgeous range of teapots. The boxes or tins are small enough for stocking gifts. \n\n\n\n\n\nImage from T2 website  \n\n9) Perfume - Charlotte Tilbury* Perfume is always a great gift and the perfect size for a stocking filler. There are so many to choose from these days but I was recently gifted with the  Charlotte Tilbury - Scent of A Dream  perfume which is incredibly unique. Perfume can attract others and is known to change the energy frequency of the people around you which is the key to attraction. This was put to place when they created the perfume adding various notes such as saffron, mandarin, orange flower, magnolia, amber etc to attract love, light, power, positivity, and sex to the wearer.  The scent is very strong and powerful but I find the scent changes after different time periods when on my skin, which is a good thing. I also love the shape of the bottle. \n\n10) Make Up - Too Faced Hangover 3 in 1 Make up fits very neatly into a stocking and you're spoiled for choice with what is on offer. If you read my October Beauty Faves post then you'll know I am obsessed with  Too Faced - Hangover 3 in 1 . This is a great addition to anyone's make up collection. It is a primer and finishing spray which works really well. It's been one of my favourite buys this year. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage from TooFaced.com \n\n11) Hairbrush - Tangle Angel* If you know someone who suffers with tangles in their hair then this brush is perfect for them. My daughter's both have one of their own and I regularly use them especially after swimming or coming our of the shower. The  Tangle Angel  can be used on all hair types and is heat resistant, anti static, water resistant and antibacterial.  \n\n12) Bottle Opener - Zap Cap* This gift is suitable for both men and women. I always struggle to get the tops of bottles of beer and lager etc and this clever, little device by CellarDine  does it for you in one push.

There is hardly any difference between the items sold on the streets and that sold in proper snack houses or sweet shops or even restaurants. That said, some tips on accessing street food.\nFirst of all, street food is best had in the region of its origin. So no point in trying out idlis and dosas in Delhi . Look out for the chaat items (veg options) and kababs (non-veg options) in Delhi.\nNext, remember that most of these items come with garnishes and condiments which are uncooked. Avoid these garnishes and chutneys.\nDo not hesitate to step into any of the renowned national chains like Haldiram and Bikanerwala to check out the the snacks. Head to Bengali Market near Connaught Place or Nizams on Connaught Place for these snack items. You could also go into the food court at any of the prominent malls and try out any of the items.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:28.010+02:00"}], "totalResults": 15142816, "moreResultsAvailable": 15142716, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=a64af0cc-bb64-44dd-a56d-d1d1e06b287e&format=json&ts=1512637648010&q=language%3Aenglish&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 942}
