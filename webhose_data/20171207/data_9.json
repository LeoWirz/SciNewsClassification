Head coaches are getting fired, leaving one job for another and the carousel continues. \nIt\u2019s also the time of year when assistant coaches began to move around, as head coaches change and make new hires to fill out their staffs. \nThis includes the Football Championship Subdivision level at which North Dakota State competes. \nHead coach Chris Klieman\u2019s staff has been fairly stable since he took over for Craig Bohl in 2014. Given Klieman\u2019s remarkable success with the Bison, there is chatter among fans and media of him possibly moving up to an Football Championship Subdivision job either as a head coach or top assistant. \nThat chatter should also involve his assistant coaches. After last year, the Bison lost offensive coordinator Tim Polasek to Iowa and defensive line coach Jamar Cain went to Fresno State. Could there be more movement this year among the assistants? Very possibly, especially if you look at the money being paid to assistant coaches in FBS. \nYes, there are other reasons why assistants might move on from NDSU, including new challenges, professional advancement or going to work for a close friend or mentor. But money factors into decisons, too, of course. \nUSA Today released its list of FBS college football assistant coaches salaries today and you can check out the numbers for yourself. There is money to be made as an assistant coach. \nPolasek was paid $335,000 for being the offensive line coach at Iowa. Cain made $185,000 to be the defensive line coach at Fresno State. \nThat\u2019s not head coach money, or even coordinator money \u2014 Kirk Ferentz, Iowa\u2019s head coach, made $4.55 million this season and Brian Ferentz, Iowa\u2019s offensive coordinator, made $625,000 \u2014 but it\u2019s not bad. Polasek\u2019s first job at NDSU under then-head coach Craig Bohl in 2006 paid $7,500 a year as a graduate assistant. \nSpeaking of Bohl, USA Today has his salary listed at $1.412 million to be the head coach at Wyoming. That\u2019s up from $909,000 last year. That\u2019s only the money the University of Wyoming pays and doesn\u2019t include other income. \nThe assistants Bohl took with him to Laramie from Fargo are doing well, too. \nAssociate head/offensive coordinator coach Brent Vigen is making $300,000. Defensive coordinator Scottie Hazelton is being paid $230,004, offensive line coach Scott Fuchs is making $180,000 and defensive ends coach/special teams coordinator A.J. Cooper is making $150,000. \nRemember Beau Baldwin, the former head coach at FCS Eastern Washington who left after last season to become offensive coordinator at California of the Pac-12 Conference? He\u2019s making $675,000. That\u2019s why many Bison fans are watching what Klieman and his assistants do this offseason. There is nice money to be made even as assistant coaches in FBS.

Easy \u2013 stay in the single market", "text": "Watching the negotiations has been like observing a slightly confused walrus bargaining with a pod of 27 orcas.\nIt may shock you, but I have come to the conclusion that an assertion from David Davis might not be worth that much. He \u201cdid not accept\u201d the UK was losing the two EU Agencies. The UK government encouraged five UK cities to bid for a European Capital of Culture Programme they clearly weren't eligible for.\nAs we'd say in Scotland, they ken noo. The events of the last few days have begun to feel like the end of the beginning. The Brexiteers have charged into the Article 50 process without a plan or, it seems, clue of what they want. The \u201chave your cake and eat it\u201d sloganeering is now crashing into hard reality. Nowhere has this been more apparent than Ireland. At the stroke of 23:00 on Brexit Day (note that Brexit happens at midnight, Brussels time) the border crashes into existence, unless a fix is found now.\nThe Good Friday Agreement cannot be respected and there cannot be an open border in Ireland unless Northern Ireland is in the single market and customs union. A fudge will fall apart in days once it is tested. Various politicians in London have asserted that the EU is the bad guy here. So let me be clear: the UK cannot leave an open border across the island of Ireland unless it decides to create a level playing field and have an open border with the entire world. The rules of the World Trade Organisation prevent it (if you didn't like Brussels, just wait till you meet Geneva).\nThe EU and UK will obey international law (hopefully) which means we need a solution that works, not Trumpesque slogans about the Irish paying for it. Norway and Sweden have a light touch border, so solutions can be found, but the solution is based on both being in the single market. \nThe view from here in Brussels is binary. Ireland is one of us and deserves solidarity, the UK has decided to throw that solidarity away (and a lot of British leaders have been gratuitously offensive to boot). Tellingly, when the European Commission published its guiding principles on Ireland and Northern Ireland, the web link for more information took you directly to the Irish government's homepage. The Irish understand how Brussels works. They have diplomatically outmanoeuvred the UK at every turn. The latter is now being treated as a third party, not a member state of the EU. \nThe understanding and sympathy for Ireland amongst Commission officials, member states and my fellow MEPs has been entirely underestimated by London. The UK press has all but ignored the issue until a week or so ago and then appeared surprised that it has become so prominent.\nThere was no surprise on this side of the North Sea. When the Council and Parliament organised a collective mandate for the lead negotiator, Michel Barnier, Ireland was there, front and centre. As EU Commissioner, Barnier himself was intimately involved in the EU support for the PEACE Programmes in Northern Ireland. He knows the island and its politics well, arguably far better than any of the UK ministers. That is why the Irish border was included in the first phase and why right now the EU27 position is identical to that of Ireland.\nWatching the negotiations has been like observing a slightly confused walrus bargaining with a pod of 27 orcas. So where do we go from here? If the UK can come up with a compromise that works, it will be looked at. If not, then Northern Ireland should in all but name remain within the single market and customs union. This is the obvious solution.\nMEPs have been talking about these issues for months, and they have real expertise. Colleagues of mine from across the Parliament and Commission understand this because on a daily basis we deal with these issues. This is why the proposal put forward is simple, deliverable and in line with international law. The integrity of the single market is not up for negotiation because the UK is leaving, just as it is not up for negotiation in the EU\u2019s ongoing negotiations with the Mercosur trading bloc in South America: MEPs and member states will defend it.\nThis is the reality. After months of negotiations, it seems that it is slowly starting to become apparent that the empty rhetoric of the various Leave campaigns will not see us through. What we need now is leadership and solutions. The UK must start by showing real flexibility within itself and with the EU to allow the various democratic mandates and legal realities that exist within these isles to be respected. Differentiated solutions can work. The Scottish government has proposed one for Scotland. The obvious solution is that if the entirety of the UK stayed in the single market and the customs union we could solve the Irish border issue in a stroke and go some way towards respecting the Remain votes of Scotland, London and Gibraltar. It will create other problems but at least give us time to honestly try to solve them.\nAlyn Smith is a Scottish National Party MEP for Scotland. \nGetty", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barnier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alyn smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michel barnier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european capital of culture programme", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament and commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu agencies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world trade organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gibraltar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geneva", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:40.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b0f0dcb53a73f3d6eb172750504999b248cc2369", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlbAaY7lMiAin6J2GXkMTpsXIIAh7hVO37gL16sheZ6hLT1nJ_7oacVjL_0lmrmeDWwkXskLUcCrnf1dI2IRzEbghCCUqm3qE-", "site_full": "www.blendernation.com", "site": "blendernation.com", "site_section": "https://www.blendernation.com", "site_categories": ["3d_graphics", "tech"], "section_title": "BlenderNation", "title": "Real time 3D Movie: Pirate's Nest", "title_full": "Real time 3D Movie: Pirate's Nest", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 46233, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b0f0dcb53a73f3d6eb172750504999b248cc2369", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlbAaY7lMiAin6J2GXkMTpsXIIAh7hVO37gL16sheZ6hLT1nJ_7oacVjL_0lmrmeDWwkXskLUcCrnf1dI2IRzEbghCCUqm3qE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bart", "published": "2017-12-07T11:05:00.000+02:00", "title": "Real time 3D Movie: Pirate's Nest", "text": "pirate_s_nest", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:40.023+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bae3791aef177d15df4391c29f8fbf89a5a11256", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.xt113eWKACHFtQV6bQj8UkM3_kkPTsFhUJ8uiNdpm2DOuuJ7LzeNjIYMNaz4ydbjbEDOut88BE5yNBN6DpYNsHm2CXmHPKU8tSajE5xhc0w--", "site_full": "www.actuarialoutpost.com", "site": "actuarialoutpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.actuarialoutpost.com/actuarial_discussion_forum/forumdisplay.php?f=4", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Exams - Please Limit Discussion to Exam-Related Topics - Actuarial Outpost", "title": "Module Assignment?", "title_full": "Module Assignment?

Vincent Kennedy of the 523rd Eng. Co. puts the finishing touches on the newly repainted Engineer Castle on Ralston Field. (U.S. Army photo by Karen A. Iwamoto, Oahu Publications) \nKaren A. Iwamoto Staff Writer \nSCHOFIELD BARRACKS \u2014 The Engineer Castle on Ralston Field, here, received a facelift recently thanks to a partnership between the 523rd Engineer Company, 84th Engineer Battalion, 130th Eng. Brigade, 8th Theater Sustainment Command, and U.S. Army Garrison-Hawaii\u2019s Directorate of Public Works. \nAbout 25 Soldiers from the 523rd Eng. Co. pressure-washed, primed and repainted the castle during their off-duty and weekend hours over an approximately two-month period. They also completed some landscaping in the surrounding area. DPW provided the supplies, including pressure washers, primer, paint and ladders, as well as some guidance on how to complete the work successfully. \n\u201cIt was a point of pride,\u201d said Sgt. 1st Class Shayne Payne. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want it to (remain in a state of disrepair). Even though it wasn\u2019t our unit that originally built the castle, it was something built by engineers, and restoring it brings a sense of pride to all engineers.\u201d SCHOFIELD BARRACKS \u2014 Warrant Officer Eric Ross, a construction engineering technician with 523rd Engineer Company, 84th Engineer Battalion, 130th Engineer Brigade, applies primer to the Ralston Field Engineer Castle at Watts Field, Oct. 20, 2017. (U.S. Army photo by Kristen Wong, Oahu Publications) \nCapt. Thomas Weber agreed, adding that the renovations also serve to lift the morale of Soldiers and family members stationed at Schofield Barracks. \n\u201cThe 130 Eng. Bde. uses the castle as a destination point to run to during Monday Ability Group Runs,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully, it will give the Soldiers some pride seeing the only castle on Schofield Barracks looks professional. Also, the community living on Schofield Barracks (will) not have to look at an eyesore.\u201d \nKevin Rost, facilities manager and construction estimator for DPW\u2019s Operation and Maintenance Division praised their work. \n\u201cI think they did an exceptional job in doing this, in addition to the training rotation they had going on,\u201d he said. \u201cFor them to donate their time to this is what made it happen. We (at DPW) would never have been able to get to this project with our current staffing levels.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cI really like working with Soldiers because I feel like they get a lot out of pride from sustaining something that their predecessors built, and that comes through in the work.\u201d SCHOFIELD BARRACKS \u2014 Spc.

(U.S. Army photo by Kristen Wong, Oahu Publications) \nThis venture is not the first time the 523rd Eng. Co. has teamed up with DPW on an improvement project. They recently poured a sidewalk along Beaver Road to connect two residential neighborhoods on Schofield Barracks. In addition to giving back to the community, they earned valuable military occupation specialty training through that project. \nHistory of the Engineer Castle \nAccording to a sign at the site of the castle on Ralston Field, it was constructed by elements of the 3rd Eng. Combat Regiment between 1938-1941, and B Company of the 65th Eng. Bn. repainted and restored it in 2001. \nThe castle overlooks a softball diamond and has concrete benches that serve as seating during games. The rest of the field is used by Soldiers and family members for exercise and recreation. \nThe castle is the logo of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The USACE castle logo is typically a white three-towered castle set on a red background, and it was formally adopted by the Army as insignia in the early 1900s. \n\u2018Self-help\u2019 projects \nThe castle improvement project is what is known as a command \u201cself-help\u201d project, said Rost, who served as the liaison between the engineers and DPW. Any unit interested in taking on a large-scale improvement project may contact a DPW facilities manager who will then help the unit through the process, which includes filling out the proper paperwork, getting the correct supplies and ensuring that the work is done correctly and in compliance with regulations. Rost said these steps are necessary when dealing with projects on government property. SCHOFIELD BARRACKS \u2014 Spc. Elijah Keel of the 523rd Eng.

Messi, who has faced Nigeria several times at youth and senior level, is wary of the Super Eagles, saying that they can score plenty of goals if they find their rhythm. The Barcelona number ten was excused from November\u2019s friendly between La Albiceleste and the Super Eagles, in his absence, the South Americans lost 4-2 despite leading by 2-0 at a point during the match. Messi told TyC Sports on Wednesday: \u201dNigeria are like that, they have two faces. If they have their day, they score four goals,\u201dThey have very good players it was clear in the second half; but they also allow you to play, they leave gaps and many spaces are generated. Nigeria captain John Obi Mikel voted for Messi in the Best FIFA Football Awards Men\u2019s Player of the Year.\u201dWe played many times against each other, but never talked. Simply a greeting and respect forever,\u201d added Lionel Messi. Including the youth teams, Messi has been directly involved in 6 goals (4 goals, 2 assists) Argentina has scored against the Nigerian teams in five appearances.

shortly after meeting the WA-based leader of a doomsday cult who disappeared a decade ago, an inquest has heard.\nThe revelations were made at the coronial inquest into one of Australia's most baffling missing person's cases, the disappearance of 45-year-old Gary Felton, who went by the stolen identity Simon Kadwell, his partner Chantelle McDougall, 27, their daughter Leela, 5, and friend Tony Popic.\nThe Canadian couple, Kirk Helgason and Alixander Fominoff, were in their 20s, and while holidaying went to Nannup in southwest WA to meet \"Mr Kadwell\" because they were devoted to his philosophical teachings.\nWarren Sunkar ran a backpacker hostel where the pair stayed, and became friends with them.\nHe also knew the self-styled new age spiritual leader Mr Kadwell and told the inquest he liked him but wrote his own books about philosophy.\n\"Kirk and Alixander had similar beliefs to Simon,\" Mr Sunkar said.\nAdvertisement \"They were good, young kids that enjoyed discussing philosophy and ended up becoming really good friends.\"\nHowever, Ms Fominoff took her own life back in Canada on July 24, 2007, a week after the four went missing.\nA month later on August 26 Mr Helgason and another woman, Christina Arnott, also died of a drug overdose in Massachusetts in the US.\nMr Sunkar rejected the suggestion Mr Kadwell was running a \"death cult\", saying he liked his beliefs in a \"catharsis\" on earth, people \"waking up to what was going on in society\", that there was something greater and the system was crashing.\nHowever, the inquest also heard Mr Kadwell did not believe suicide existed, instead writing that people could move between the physical and spiritual realm.\nHe appeared to be depressed and despondent in his online writing leading up to his disappearance, with the inquest earlier hearing he was planning a suicide pact involving Ms McDougall, Leela and Mr Popic.\nMr Sunkar also described a strange phone conversation with Ms McDougall several weeks before she disappeared when he rang her because he heard a rumour Mr Kadwell had died.\nShe would not confirm it, saying \"is that what they said?\"\nMs McDougall's Nannup friend Eleanor McKie told the inquest Mr Kadwell was controlling and she believed he had brainwashed her, as the previously bubbly Ms McDougall talked about \"not belonging or wanting to be here\".\nThe police investigation failed to find any evidence of the four, who left a note and told people saying they were going to a commune in Brazil.\nThe last known movements were known from phone calls made about the time of their disappearance from the Nannup house and Mr Popic's mobile in which trains and buses to Kalgoorlie and Northcliffe were booked under the name Jay Roberts, along with a Perth hostel, taxi and pizza delivery.\nTheir bank accounts were never accessed and credit cards, furniture and computers and electronic items were left in the house, although clothes were taken and the house had been cleaned.\nReaders seeking support and information about suicide prevention can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14.

More disturbingly, he was one of the only SS doctors who enjoyed selecting which Jews would die in the gas chambers, and would often do this task even when he wasn't asked to, just so he could get subjects for his experiments. He also had a \"Kindergarten\" for children at the camps, and would actually act kindly to them, giving them sweets and having a playground for them, but he would eventually have them sadistically tortured in experiments or simply send them to the gas chambers. One of the prison doctors at Auschwitz reportedly said this about him: \"He was capable of being so kind to the children, to have them become fond of him, to bring them sugar, to think of small details in their daily lives, and to do things we would genuinely admire ... And then, next to that, ... the crematoria smoke, and these children, tomorrow or in a half-hour, he is going to send them there.

This company was founded in 1947. It produces all terrain, rough terrain, industrial and truck mounted cranes. Grove also manufactures customized cranes for the armed forces all over the world. The company has earned a reputation for providing reliable and strong lifting equipment. You will therefore not go wrong by looking for Grove Cranes For Sale .\n\nGrove is an innovative company since it introduced the slewing rough terrain cranes and the trapezoidal booms. It has many types of mobile lifting equipment. This company sells small lifting equipment for use in areas with minimal space and larger lifting equipment that is capable of lifting loads weighing 550 tons.\n\nThere is economic uncertainty in the crane market. Therefore, crane manufacturers are cautious about producing more lifting equipment to build up their inventory. Limiting the production of lifting equipment allows the manufacturers to maintain prices. Another effect of this decision is increasing the demand for used cranes. You can choose to purchase a used crane if you find the cost of a new one to be prohibitive. As you search for pre owned cranes for sale, you should put several factors into consideration.\n\nOne of the factors to consider is your budget. You may be looking to buy a crane if you have just been awarded a large contract and the current equipment you own cannot complete the work well. As you search for a used Grove crane, planning the amount you want to spend will enable you to narrow down your search, quicken the process and offer a benchmark for making the decision.\n\nConsidering the history of the lifting equipment and the work it was used to carry out is also important. Make sure that you ask about the work environment that the crane was used in because this can have an impact on its quality. Some parts of a crane may not work well if they are corroded. As you ask about the history of a crane, find out also if it has undergone major repairs. It is important for repairs to be documented and comply with the regulations of OSHA.\n\nInspecting a pre owned crane before buying it is essential. A certified crane inspector should perform this task. Inspecting the equipment will help you save time and money. You will avoid purchasing lifting equipment that requires extensive repairs in the future. Consulting a crane appraiser before you buy the equipment is also important.\n\nYou should also think about how old the crane is. Purchasing a crane that is five to ten years old is not a problem. However, older lifting equipment has its challenges such as limited technology. Consider if you can easily find spare parts and technical support for the crane.\n\nAfter buying a used Grove crane, you may need to perform some reconditioning or repairs on it. Thankfully, if you choose the right crane, it will remain in use for many years. You should consider taking the crane to a firm that restores and repairs heavy machinery. It can restore the crane to the condition it was in when it was new to increase its service life.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nYou can get an overview of the advantages of using Grove Cranes For Sale and more info about well-respected Grove Cranes For Sale right now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hoyt iverson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "osha", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "the grove", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:43.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bae54e5f020fb88d193658b6db0a3ae8bb40df8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_pLT30BQX98PW71BCr29Sik_PA6qUdTlYJ15jnmKLQBvQod301J1RqXITZlSFpU5PlFiwOUSwM1T_Dky1VVD16m1GC3n4cYZ_fW0fRE6AHaA--", "site_full": "www.muensterschezeitung.de", "site": "muensterschezeitung.de", "site_section": "http://www.muensterschezeitung.de/rss/feed/mz_sport_fussball", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Fu\u00dfball", "title": "Fu\u00dfball: FC St. Pauli", "title_full": "Fu\u00dfball: FC St. Pauli", "published": "2017-12-07T10:43:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.muensterschezeitung.de/var/storage/images/wn/startseite/sport/weltsport/fussball/zweite-bundesliga/2923698-2.-bundesliga-fc-st.-pauli/85754995-4-ger-DE/2.-Bundesliga-FC-St.-Pauli_opengraph.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bae54e5f020fb88d193658b6db0a3ae8bb40df8b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_pLT30BQX98PW71BCr29Sik_PA6qUdTlYJ15jnmKLQBvQod301J1RqXITZlSFpU5PlFiwOUSwM1T_Dky1VVD16m1GC3n4cYZ_fW0fRE6AHaA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:43:00.000+02:00", "title": "Fu\u00dfball: FC St. Pauli", "text": "2.

There are some things that are big stumbling blocks for us, especially around the terms and the length of temporary endorsement.\n\"We're looking to go back to them and talk through our thoughts and hopefully we can change this to a permanent endorsement. That's probably a non negotiable for us.\"\nRA has copped widespread criticism for axing Western Force from Super Rugby.\nA subsequent Senate inquiry questioned some dealings by RA in helping Melbourne Rebels find a way to avoid the chop.\nWA Liberal Linda Reynolds has called on corporate watchdog ASIC to investigate the scenario.\nEarlier this week, Hodgson wrote a Facebook post criticising RA for its demands regarding the IPRC.\n\"It remains obvious to us after three months of continuous negotiations that Rugby Australia doesn't have the best interest of the Western Australian rugby community at heart,\" he said.\n\"Rugby Australia's demands include money to support East coast based programs rather than supporting the WA community, even as they are crippling our local rugby infrastructure.\n\"We will not be sending any more money over east, our money will remain for our people and to grow our game in Western Australia.\n\"The current Rugby Australia position is so uncommercial and unreasonable that it ensures the failure of the IPRC before it even starts.\"\nAAP", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "twiggy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "andrew forrest", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "linda reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "forrest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hodgson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt hodgson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "western force", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world rugby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wallabies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iprc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ra", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east coast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ra", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:44.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e7a2688640434c69e401b4a02f0a17f1ece83f9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3WxFVTxjshjq1E6nQ9bMNYy1cBxMRT.ujMQxptzasGj3MW1P3dHZQU09CbRsKb86Eyl.qstWvEw5WG9b63G9XYDYwfxPxrFoHBA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "What\u2019s an occupation that\u2019s a lot more difficult than people think it is?", "title_full": "What\u2019s an occupation that\u2019s a lot more difficult than people think it is? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T18:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 195, "participants_count": 186, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d5a37238ea8ba276c3a7eef6aa37790445a9fb5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3WxFVTxjshjq1E6nQ9bMNYy1cBxMRT.ujMQxptzasGj3MW1P3dHZQU09CbRsKb86Eyl.qstWvEw5WG9b63G9XYDbb0jJq1IMJL3phEx1dLUV90BEtpl2pQbQ-", "ord_in_thread": 191, "author": "123WhoGivesAShit", "published": "2017-12-07T10:56:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "I've had many jobs, so I'll list some of them out.\nVolunteer EMS: You all think that my job is to perform CPR on old people, or help a guy with a broken arm, or treat gsw's?
