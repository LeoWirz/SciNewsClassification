07 December 2017 08:22am Sport England's 'This Girl Can' campaign, which has been widely praised for rubbishing stereotypes, returned this year \n57% of UK marketers have admitted that the Advertising Standards Authority's (ASA) plan to clampdown on gender stereotyping in ads has impacted the imagery they use in their own campaigns. \nAccording to a survey from photography platform Shutterstock, over half of marketers claim to have already been impacted by the fresh ASA guidelines which are due to come into force in early 2018. \nWhile the advice has yet to be finalised, 51% of the 500 UK respondents questioned agreed it was important to represent modern day society when choosing marketing imagery. This showed progress on 2016 when the figure sat at just 30%. \nShutterstock's findings come amid a push from Disney to better represent dads in its own marketing , ditching stereotypes in which dads are shown playing the joker or being absent from family life in order to better unlock the market's potential. \nProblematic stereotypes \nInterestingly, marketers aged 45-years-old and over are named as the least likely to have used a high number of images featuring diversity over the past 12 months, when compared to their younger counterparts. \nThe older demographic was also found to be less inclined to use more images feature same-sex couples, with just 17% having done so in 2017 against 43% of 25 to 34-year-olds. \nEarlier this year, the ASA revealed that following consultations with advertisers and consumers that it was poised to take a \"tougher line\" on ads that feature stereotypical gender roles or characteristics which could potentially cause harm. \nThis doesn't mean that there will be a blanket ban on all gender stereotypes, so for instance brands can still show a man doing DIY or a woman cleaning, but the regulator has said that depictions which are \"problematic\" will come under scrutiny. \nFor the ASA, examples include an ad which depicts family members creating a mess while a woman has sole responsibility for cleaning it up, or a spot that features a man trying and failing to undertake simple parental or household tasks. \nOver a third (35%) of the 500 UK marketers questioned as part of the most recent study said they had used more images featuring women in the past year. \nChampioning representation \nThe research was part of a wider global survey which found that while Australian marketers are leading the way in using increasing numbers of images featuring women, UK marketers are succeeding in using more images of same-sex couples. \n35% of British marketers featured more images of same sex couples in the past 12 months compared to 21% of Australian marketers, where same-sex marriage has only just been legalised. \nFor marketers in the UK, the US and Australia, the primary aim of using images of same-sex couples and photos featuring racial diversity was to represent modern day society, rather than to fit in with brand messaging. \nOver the past few years, there several UK initiatives have launched to ensure that the media and marketing industry's strong visual impact on public life is inclusive. \nThese include Christmas So White and Easter So White which look to normalise diverse imagery through real life photography. The industry figureheads behind the projects recently teamed up with Getty to make available a series of royalty free images for brands to use in their own ads.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rebe", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "getty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shutterstock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stewart", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "disney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "advertising standards authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sport england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:30.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8c3d8a4261980da34f20292bded5b09777b1f2f2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxvZh7dyy1T1gb.2wjL2IFUhshEdCyCLR58gzp3Y4MxXco11NgoAYLdCJuY17a2PbH2kzB1VJkuHWabgBMiTcqkf1PEIb.OIZzuZ9IdUcB02BJ.8Jb_Bb27AUce0HiFGYDP9TVpqi5GIsknjrmmM6ZH", "site_full": "plymouth.wickedlocal.com", "site": "wickedlocal.com", "site_section": "http://plymouth.wickedlocal.com/sports?template=rss&mime=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Sports - Wicked Local Plymouth", "title": "H.S.

South junior kicker Emma Sampson, who began the season as the junior varsity kicker, booted a winning field goal as time expired. The kick capped off a drive that was led by quarterback Alex Cohen with 1:12 remaining. The Panthers played in six games that were decided by one score or less this season, finishing 3-3 in those contests. \nSouth also defeated Plymouth North, 22-21, on Thanksgiving in one of the best Turkey Day rivalries in the state. Cohen completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to Connor Holbrook with 1:01 remaining in the fourth quarter. Down 21-20, the Panthers opted for the 2-point conversion, which Stanley Profete converted, to nab the Panthers a win in the 22nd edition of the rivalry. North\u2019s Robbie Gomes was a tough-luck loser in the game, rushing for 132 yards and all three of the Blue Eagles scores. South battled back from deficits of 14-0 and 21-7. \nHonorable mention: Silver Lake 20, Dighton-Rehoboth 18 (Oct. 27) \nThe first round of the MIAA playoffs is usually riddled with blowouts. That was not the case in this Division 4 South Sectional quarterfinal. With 52 seconds remaining, Silver Lake\u2019s Tanner Boyd scored the winning touchdown. The Lakers stuffed a D-R fourth-and-short with 3:05 remaining while trailing by four (18-14) when Matt Powell made a stop in the backfield. Jake Waters sealed the win with an interception.

Stock Update on Heartland Banccorp (HLAN) \nIn the latest session, Heartland Banccorp (HLAN) moved -0.749%,   85.2510.   \nOne   \n  benefit of trendlines is they help distinguish emotional decisions (\u201cI think it\u2019s time to sell\u2026\u201d) from analytical decisions (\u201cI will hold until the current rising trendline is broken\u201d). Another benefit of trendlines is that they almost always keep you on the \u201cright\u201d side of the market. When using trendlines, it\u2019s difficult to hold a security for very long when prices are falling just as it\u2019s hard to be short when prices are rising\u2013either way the trendline will be broken. \nSharp investors may be looking to examine the   %R. Developed by Larry Williams, this indicator helps spot overbought and oversold market conditions. The Williams %R shows how the current closing price compares to previous highs/lows over a specified period. Heartland Banccorp (HLAN)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is sitting at -8.32. Typically, if the value heads above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. On the flip side, if the indicator goes under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. \nAnother technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Heartland Banccorp (HLAN) is noted at 38.48. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nInvestors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Heartland Banccorp (HLAN)   63.63. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions. \nTaking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 53.31, the 7-day sits at 77.57 and the 14-day (most common) is at 75.18. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nKeeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 77.75, the 200-day is at 63.67, and the 7-day is 85.31 for Heartland Banccorp (HLAN). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time. \nBy Journal Contributor", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald lambert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "banccorp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "stock update on heartland banccorp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams percent range", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heartland banccorp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:30.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "57652bc740fa14057d83d1964eaf508790c562ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BfYtXdcIUvRvMKDAl4_VLp0jeXpqPv7aLVcKf9RiA4j0qd._yghhnVEtqke0ov9JLUPGKHOCuPbQ36ebJgu3pwe2tyedpemjzvoscqEHzpQ6ZeIek7XtNw2ptUE_w6.9IFsMVUEpsRh6kg4e5F74eP89gnWgyKFHoayZ5ch1Od8qNTCD.l_pr6RorSxZT5aJZGs7y9ZBkaw--", "site_full": "www.pantagraph.com", "site": "pantagraph.com", "site_section": "http://www.pantagraph.com/search/?f=rss&amp;t=article&amp;c=template&amp;l=50&amp;s=start_time&amp;sd=desc", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.pantagraph.com - RSS Results", "title": "Here's Why Titanium Stocks Were Crushed Today", "title_full": "Here's Why Titanium Stocks Were Crushed Today", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/pantagraph.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/34/d34cd774-c757-5cb3-b22b-346332cae06b/5a0ca236d1bf0.image.jpg?crop=580%2C326%2C0%2C30&amp;resize=580%2C326&amp;order=crop%2Cresize", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 44692, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "57652bc740fa14057d83d1964eaf508790c562ff", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.BfYtXdcIUvRvMKDAl4_VLp0jeXpqPv7aLVcKf9RiA4j0qd._yghhnVEtqke0ov9JLUPGKHOCuPbQ36ebJgu3pwe2tyedpemjzvoscqEHzpQ6ZeIek7XtNw2ptUE_w6.9IFsMVUEpsRh6kg4e5F74eP89gnWgyKFHoayZ5ch1Od8qNTCD.l_pr6RorSxZT5aJZGs7y9ZBkaw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Here's Why Titanium Stocks Were Crushed Today", "text": "Here's Why Titanium Stocks Were Crushed Today Dec 7, 2017 3 Stocks Set to Drop \nThe stock market continues to march higher, but not all investors necessarily consider that a good thing.

Amid deafness, isolation, and intense anxiety at the end of his life, Francisco Goya covered the walls of his home with harrowing images of death, dogs, and devastation. Before his suicide, Mark Rothko abandoned bright colors for blacks, burgundy, deep green, and other melancholy shades. And in 1888, the year Vincent van Gogh cut off his ear, he produced dozens of extraordinary paintings, including his famous Arles work. Sometimes, it seems, despair nourishes art. But a new study released this week in the journal Management Science begs to differ. Researchers Kathryn Graddy and Carl Lieberman compared the sale prices of some 15,000 paintings, using the Blouin Art Sales Index and the online collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Gallery of Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay. Some of the works coincided with happy periods in artists\u2019 lives, and others with times of misery or grief, such as following the death of a friend, lover, or relative. A hue of angst and despair might make work more interesting\u2014the jury\u2019s out on that\u2014but it doesn\u2019t make it more valuable.

The report, which has a focus on the benefits of such solutions in Europe, uses qualitative evidence, and describes quantitative cost-benefit analysis that the consultants have undertaken, relating to deployment of C-V2X.\n          \n\n          The publication of the report coincides with policy development on V2X, and use of the 5.9GHz band, in the European Union, where the European Commission is currently undertaking a public consultation on deployment of cooperative intelligent transport systems (C-ITS).\n\n          The study concludes that the deployment of C-ITS systems is beneficial at the European Union level. Net benefits that could be accrued in Europe are estimated to be in the range of EUR20 billion to EUR43 billion in 2035 (with the highest benefits coming from increased road safety, and traffic efficiency), across the four scenarios modelled.\n\n          The most favourable scenario of those modelled in the study (amounting to EUR 43 billion net benefits) is where the potential for rapid penetration and economies of scale for C-V2X is maximised and both C-V2X and the Wi-Fi Standard IEEE 802.11p are able to co-exist in the 5.9GHz spectrum band. Such benefits do not arise in a scenario where the use of IEEE 802.11p is mandated for C-ITS services, which would result in less than half these expected net benefits (EUR 20 billion).\n\n          The study also indicates benefits of C-V2X for the European market lie in its deployment flexibility, with the ability to provide coverage for both short range and wide area applications, and certainty of future evolution to 5G, potentially facilitating earlier deployment as well as after-market deployment (e.g. V2X services provided in vehicles via a smartphone or other after-market device with C-V2X connectivity).\n\n          Reduced infrastructure deployment costs are a further key benefit of C-V2X, from the potential to re-use existing mobile infrastructure, and thus leveraging cellular technology integration and economies of scale, rather than building independently operated roadside infrastructure.\n\n          Christoph Voigt, 5GAA Chairman comments: \"C-V2X will be fundamental to the deployment of cooperative intelligent transport systems. The benefits highlighted is this report indisputably demonstrate that this technology will lead to major improvements in driving and road safety. It further highlights that the European Commission should take a technology neutral approach and not limit these benefits by mandating the use of the Wi-Fi standard IEEE 802.11p\"\n\n          The socio-economic benefits study on C-V2X can be found via http://5gaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Final-report-for-5GAA-on-cellular-V2X-socio-economic-benefits-051217_FINAL.pdf .\n\n          Separately, the 5GAA has also today published a study which carries out a quantitative analysis of LTE-V2X (PC-5) and IEEE 802.11p technologies for short-range ad hoc/direct communications in reducing fatalities and serious injuries caused by motoring accidents in the EU. The modelling underlying this report was peer-reviewed and validated by the technology and policy consultancy, Ricardo. The study find that LTE-V2X (PC5) outperforms 802.11p in reducing fatalities and serious injuries on the EU's roads. The 5GAA's study on an assessment of LTE-V2X (PC5) and 802.11p direct communications technologies for improved road safety in the EU can be found via http://5gaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/5GAA-Road-safety-FINAL2017-12-05.pdf .\n\n          About C-V2X \n\n          V2X allows vehicles to communicate with each other and the wider transport ecosystem. It will potentially complement on-board sensors by providing enhanced information (such as data from other vehicles) over a longer range.\n\n          C-V2X is a technology developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) to deliver V2X services, using two modes of communication:\n\n          a direct vehicle-to-vehicle mode (called 'PC5' in 3GPP specifications) and\n\n          a network communications interface (called 'Uu' in 3GPP specifications) for vehicle-to-network (V2N) communication via existing mobile networks.\n\n          About the 5GAA \n\n          The 5G Automotive Association (5GAA) is a global cross-industry organisation of companies from the automotive, technology and telecommunications industries (ICT), working together to develop end-to-end solutions for future mobility and transportation services. Created in 2016, the Association is comprised of over 67 members which mission is to develop, test and promote communications solutions, initiate their standardization and accelerate their commercial availability and global market penetration to address societal needs.\n\n          Contact:\n          Nafi Niang\n           Marcom@secretariat.org \n          +49-895-490-9680\n\n          Source: 5GAA - 5G Automotive Association e.V.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ricardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christoph voigt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nafi niang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "analysys mason", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "5g automotive association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "5gaa - 5g automotive association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:31.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ac830179e52f861b2d929b44f7bf0e0f62e24a5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.HaRUwhGmuklu.X8IQRo8fOCGlrz6CTg7gcEYKHkv3qG188B5M9CuR9zXAMT6_wJWp9Q9B0FGsZEJwU2RtU_mh", "site_full": "www.djmtes.com", "site": "djmtes.com", "site_section": "http://www.djmtes.com/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "DJ Mtes Music", "title": "Audio| Freezykid X Farao X Swax - I'm the one(prod by Badru & KidKid) |Download Fast", "title_full": "Audio| Freezykid X Farao X Swax - I'm the one(prod by Badru & KidKid) |Download Fast", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ac830179e52f861b2d929b44f7bf0e0f62e24a5e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.HaRUwhGmuklu.X8IQRo8fOCGlrz6CTg7gcEYKHkv3qG188B5M9CuR9zXAMT6_wJWp9Q9B0FGsZEJwU2RtU_mh", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "DJ Mtes (noreply@blogger.com)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:06:00.000+02:00", "title": "Audio| Freezykid X Farao X Swax - I'm the one(prod by Badru & KidKid) |Download Fast", "text": "\nDownload Here \nWe Just Continue Keeping Da' Good Music Alive ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "farao x swax", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:31.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eca5fe0b924d63545bffd5ea18ac5c2fa5c387da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg94KALLIDb2_HJMUTMQQ2f85ajQwLotNfNccvcZDARNV_YK3d48tBlde16lB4VeD7A-", "site_full": "wincountry.com", "site": "wincountry.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media", "music", "non_standard_content", "entertainment"], "section_title": "", "title": "Weather Forecast for Thu., Dec. 14 | WIN 98.5", "title_full": "Weather Forecast for Thu., Dec. 14 | WIN 98.5", "published": "2017-12-06T16:34:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.264, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eca5fe0b924d63545bffd5ea18ac5c2fa5c387da", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg94KALLIDb2_HJMUTMQQ2f85ajQwLotNfNccvcZDARNV_YK3d48tBlde16lB4VeD7A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Midwest Communications Inc.", "published": "2017-12-06T16:34:00.000+02:00", "title": "Weather Forecast for Thu., Dec. 14 | WIN 98.5", "text": "Sign Up for Text Alerts Daily Forecast To receive daily forecast alerts, text Weather to 80373 .

Since the advent of glossy print, art magazines have almost entirely been presented as large-format, visually bold publications. But for nearly four decades, there has been one experimental art magazine that has no time for all of that pomp and circumstance. Since 1979, Public Illumination Magazine (PIM), an absurdist art zine with origins in New York\u2019s underground art scene, has been proving that if size matters, they don\u2019t need it. \u201cI call it the smallest magazine of its kind. That defends me against any other rival,\u201d says Prof. Dr. Dr. Zagreus Bowery, the creator, editor, and all around producer of PIM since its inception. And he doesn\u2019t exaggerate about the small size of his publication, which measures in at just 7 x 11 centimeters. A professional artist himself, Bowery has always gone by his absurdist, multi-titled pseudonym in all things concerning the magazine (in fact all contributors must use pseudonyms), which he says is just an extension of the overall goal of creating a consciously tiny publication. \u201cIt\u2019s all about self-demeaning modesty. It\u2019s a tiny little magazine. It\u2019s obscure. It\u2019s niche. And it all fits together. It\u2019s a strange little thing.\u201d\u2026 read more Image: PIM may be the one of the smallest art magazines ever made.

My questions to you is: I make loan repayments fortnightly and we have an offset account (this is something I will have to investigate further after reading your article). My real concern is why doesn't my mortgage debt level reduce every time I make a repayment? Do I need to specifically request that my repayments should be paid as a principal payment to reduce my mortgage? I understand we pay interest and this is why sometimes we may not see the actual principal reduce but I am making fortnightly repayments and also have an offset account linked to my mortgage. Can I request a schedule of payment which shows projections of my debt levels reducing with each repayment I make?\nWarm regards, Alex\nI am sure you're not alone in wondering this Alex.

Assistant General Manager Jojo Garcia jokes that journalists who write unflattering reports about his agency should become targets of Oplan Tokhang Published 3:51 PM,   4:24 PM, December 07, 2017 JOKER JOJO. MMDA Assistant General Manager Jojo Garcia gives a press briefing. File photo by Rambo Talabong/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Assistant General Manager Jojo Garcia is in hot water after joking that journalists who write \"negative\" reports about the MMDA should be shot. \nGarcia was preparing to hold a press briefing at the office of MMDA chairman Danilo Lim on Wednesday, December 6, when he cracked the joke. He mentioned some negative reports on the MMDA, but did not elaborate. \nHe said those behind the negative reports should become targets of the Philippine National Police (PNP)'s controversial Oplan Tokhang , where some suspects end up shot dead by police. \nReporters asked Garcia who these \"negative\" reporters were, but Garcia declined to name names, and just continued with his joke. He said he wanted to bring out his \"45-[calibre]\" gun. \nReporters were not able to record his pronouncements since the briefing had not begun when he made the statements. Reporters from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Philippine Star, Manila Bulletin, Philippine News Agency, TV5, and Rappler were at the briefing. \nThe jokes prompted one journalist to report the incident to Undersecretary Joel Egco, Executive Director of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security. \nEgco wrote about the incident in a Facebook post , and slammed it as a \"horrible joke.\" \n\u201cA reporter I have known for years brought this to my attention. Before I publicly call on the official and lecture him on [Administrative] Order No. 1, or 'red flag' him for such a horrible joke, I'd like to ask other reporters who were there to verify via PM (private message) to me. [M]y informant claimed they felt the chill,\u201d he said in his post. \nWith journalist killings as a perennial problem in the country, Egco pointed out that the joke made by the official was \"worse than a bomb joke.\" \n\"Even President Duterte does not do that, Sir. Just do your job,\" Egco said. \nBefore he assumed the presidency, however, Duterte was criticized for saying that some journalists deserve to be killed because they are supposedly corrupt. Media groups and human rights watchdogs slammed Duterte for justifying media killings in the Philippines. (READ: Duterte on killings: Corrupt journalists asked for it ) \nGarcia has yet to reply to requests for comment on Egco's statement, and criticism of his joke. \u2013 Rappler.com  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "duterte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rambo talabong/rappler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garcia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danilo lim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel egco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jojo garcia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mmda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "metropolitan manila development authority", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippine news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippine national police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippine daily inquirer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "presidential task force on media security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egco", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "philippines mmda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:32.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7bdf5fb51d59cbe8eada2c0b3383d12c4de7612", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIhhQW3YE0cQY82uvELBoTFM-", "site_full": "www.dpreview.com", "site": "dpreview.com", "site_section": "https://www.dpreview.com/forums/1031", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Canon Rebel (EOS 200D-800D) Talk Forum: Digital Photography Review", "title": "Show Your Snaps...December 4, 2017:", "title_full": "Show Your Snaps...December 4, 2017: Canon Rebel (EOS 200D-800D) Talk Forum: Digital Photography Review", "published": "2017-12-05T08:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1469, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8d779bc916538eb5626c42594fa7657d94d82126", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIhhQW3YE0cQYDmHqjNMtl0MjCRkbrHVBrgcWECFijW1AA7WQMtmsEXs-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "mocha123", "published": "2017-12-05T08:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Hi Clive50,\nLove the Kingfishers, I've still got to get close to one.\nI'll not see tufted ducks in my part of the world till early spring when they fly into the Wetlands centre from Scandinavia.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:32.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "10704f8280ffc38acf7f0667f71bf182fe78fdf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QILNJI0lUIrylVpWYg6V5nwlv.2B_OatIJzMgwsTfln4jU5soNtEUx67B3yjDmK8YBvFvpCRT2qw--", "site_full": "arttimes.co.za", "site": "arttimes.co.za", "site_section": "http://arttimes.co.za/feed", "site_categories": ["art_history", "education", "fine_art", "entertainment"], "section_title": "The South African Art Times", "title": "Questions raised about future of Turner Prize", "title_full": "Questions raised about future of Turner Prize", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://arttimes.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/lubaina_himid_c_pa_danny_lawson_1.jpg.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "10704f8280ffc38acf7f0667f71bf182fe78fdf0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21QILNJI0lUIrylVpWYg6V5nwlv.2B_OatIJzMgwsTfln4jU5soNtEUx67B3yjDmK8YBvFvpCRT2qw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sourced", "published": "2017-12-07T10:30:00.000+02:00", "title": "Questions raised about future of Turner Prize", "text": "Questions raised about future of Turner Prize December 7, 2017 THE ART NEWSPAPER | Ben Luke Lubaina Himid\u2019s win is richly deserved but raises questions about the future of the Turner Prize. It may be impossible for juries to give the award to younger artists ahead of long deserving ones. Lubaina Himid\u2019s paintings and painterly sculptural tableaux, teeming with powerful political and social messages and no shortage of absurdity and wry humour, have been a consistent, if too little acknowledged, presence on the British art scene for decades. But her win raises all sorts of questions about the Turner Prize\u2019s past, present and future. The centrepiece of Himid\u2019s presentation in Hull (until 7 January) is her work A Fashionable Marriage (1986), a play on Hogarth\u2019s series Marriage A-la-Mode (around 1743), recast amid the turbulent politics of the 1980s, complete with a satirised Margaret Thatcher figure. Earlier this year, Himid told The Art Newspaper that with this work, she was \u201claying down the gauntlet in every way I possibly could\u2014I was full of hope and looking for a fight\u201d. The piece is a \u201cvery particular way of talking about the history of why black people are here and also about the circumstances in which we found ourselves in the 1980s\u201d, Himid told us. \u201cThere were black political activities going on in the streets, and in the art world we were trying to decide whether calling ourselves black artists was sensible because it drew attention, or alienating because it flagged up the work as political rather than considering it as art.\u201d\u2026 read more Image: Lubaina Himid By Danny Lawson", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben luke lubaina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "himid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret thatcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lubaina himid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogarth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danny lawson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hull", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "turner prize questions", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:32.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7bdf5fb51d59cbe8eada2c0b3383d12c4de7612", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIhhQW3YE0cQY82uvELBoTFM-", "site_full": "www.dpreview.com", "site": "dpreview.com", "site_section": "https://www.dpreview.com/forums/1031", "site_categories": ["photography", "hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Canon Rebel (EOS 200D-800D) Talk Forum: Digital Photography Review", "title": "Show Your Snaps...December 4, 2017:", "title_full": "Show Your Snaps...December 4, 2017: Canon Rebel (EOS 200D-800D) Talk Forum: Digital Photography Review", "published": "2017-12-05T08:57:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 10, "participants_count": 4, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.001, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1469, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9cbb67cc097cc8589f574ad55072e3c60aa29ed", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR8SN9il7cGGTt7g.TSvhBp_rg.gonE.pEcRM2dRaMvIhhQW3YE0cQYDmHqjNMtl0MjCRkbrHVBrgcWECFijW1Ai2GbWL0HKf8-", "ord_in_thread": 7, "author": "Clive50", "published": "2017-12-05T08:57:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Some nice shots.

The 80D is my first DSLR, have a bit of experience with my church's A7SII but other than that don't really have anything to compare it to. For me it's perfect, the body feels great in the hand, perfect size and weight and balances really well against my Sigma 18-35. The things I do miss from the Sony is the 3 dial setup so that I don't need to press a different button for ISO and having the power switch on the shutter button, but other than that no complaints. Not having a joystick is also a pain, and changing the AF point when using the grip in portrait mode is basically impossible but I guess it's their way of forcing you up the food chain.\nSpeaking of AF, I've found it more than adequate for what I need. I mainly do landscapes and architectural photography, but when I'm using the camera in church it usually nails focus in AI Servo and low light with my 50-150mm 2.8, with my 85mm 1.4 it never focuses right but I think that might be down to my copy and the fact it has a few scratches on the front element. I haven't used it for anything moving faster than a person pacing around on stage so can't speak to how it is for wildlife photography and such.\nIQ to me is fantastic. Personally I feel it produces usable images up to ISO 1600 but I realize that's subjective. From what I understand Nikon and Sony cameras have better DR but I rarely find myself wanting and bracket a lot anyways. I don't know how normal this is for cameras but bringing shadows all the way down in LR can often destroy people's faces, if that's just a normal thing in cameras I wouldn't worry about it then. I know that IQ is subjective to glass but you seem to have a great collection so I feel you'd enjoy it as well. I can't speak for the video quality, I did record a project last weekend but haven't had the time yet to go through the footage and I haven't figured out Premiere Pro yet so don't want to speak too soon.\nIf I had to name some gripes, it's that the battery life for me has been nowhere near advertised. I did buy mine second hand but even so, the shutter count was low and even with the extra battery I bought (official Canon E6N) there was maybe one day I got close to the claimed CIPA rating. This might be because I use Live View so much and review a lot of pictures, but for example right now my battery is at 34% with 221 shots. It usually lasts me a whole day and I don't use burst mode much but still worth considering. Sometimes Live View exposure simulation doesn't work, which is very annoying when I'm out at night, still haven't found a fix for that but whether or not that bothers you is something only you know. Haven't tested the \"moisture resistance\" yet but seeing as you live in the Netherlands as well I think you can understand why I'm too scared to take the risk!\nOverall I love it! When I upgrade to FF I'll probably switch brands since all my lenses are APS-C anyways and can't upgrade too, but I definitely think it's the best overall crop DSLR on the market. Apart from the issues listed above nothing else comes to mind that would hesitate making me recommend it to someone.

man charged with murdering his partner took guns from family members, friends and criminals because he didn't want people to hurt themselves or end up in jail, a court has heard.\nSteven Samaras, 49, was last year questioned over the death of his American partner, Tamara Turner, whom he proposed to not long after meeting her on Facebook, and was later charged with one count of murder.\nMs Turner, 49, was found dead outside Mildura Base Hospital one morning in June last year.\nHer adult son has previously told The Age that he had been told by police his mother had been shot in the thigh and the bullet pierced a major artery.\nSamaras and Ms Turner met online in October 2015 and he later bought firearms from her, which she posted to his parents' Preston home from Missouri, the County Court heard on Thursday.\nMs Turner travelled to Australia in December 2015, around the same time the three parcels she sent Samaras \u2013 containing three firearms and a stun gun \u2013 arrived in Australia.\nAdvertisement The pair later claimed they were married.\nThe parcels were intercepted by Australian authorities, prosecutor Elle\u200b Linfoot\u200b said, but police later searched Samaras' Kinglake home and found four rifles, an air rifle and a silencer.\nSamaras told police he had never used a gun and despised them, but took the rifles from friends and family because he \"did not want them to kill themselves or put themselves in jail\", Ms Linfoot said.\nHe also told police he had bought guns off \"crims\" to get them off the streets, after seeing a news report where police seized guns in a raid.\n\"He thought he could do a better job himself,\" the prosecutor said.\nSamaras told police he put the guns away and had thrown \"heaps\" in the river over the years, the court heard.\nPolice found the rifles in his home under the kitchen sink.\nDefence counsel Andrew Jackson said Samaras told police where the guns were when officers arrived to search his home and told them he had the weapons because he wanted them off the streets.\nBut Ms Linfoot said that explanation was inconsistent with his actions in having the other guns imported from the US.\nMs Turner was charged with importing weapons but the counts were withdrawn following her death.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

Developed by Larry Williams, this indicator helps spot overbought and oversold market conditions. The Williams %R shows how the current closing price compares to previous highs/lows over a specified period. Pardee Resources Company Inc (PDER)\u2019s Williams Percent Range or 14 day Williams %R is sitting at -42.35. Typically, if the value heads above -20, the stock may be considered to be overbought. On the flip side, if the indicator goes under -80, this may signal that the stock is oversold. \nAnother technical indicator that might serve as a powerful resource for measuring trend strength is the Average Directional Index or ADX. The ADX was introduced by J. Welles Wilder in the late 1970\u2019s and it has stood the test of time. The ADX is typically used in conjunction with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI) to help spot trend direction as well as trend strength. At the time of writing, the 14-day ADX for Pardee Resources Company Inc (PDER) is noted at 9.83. Many technical analysts believe that an ADX value over 25 would suggest a strong trend. A reading under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. \nInvestors may use various technical indicators to help spot trends and buy/sell signals. Presently, Pardee Resources Company Inc (PDER)   -15.03. The CCI was developed by Donald Lambert. The assumption behind the indicator is that investment instruments move in cycles with highs and lows coming at certain periodic intervals. The original guidelines focused on creating buy/sell signals when the reading moved above +100 or below -100. Traders may also use the reading to identify overbought/oversold conditions. \nTaking a look at other technical levels, the 3-day RSI stands at 44.61, the 7-day sits at 50.87 and the 14-day (most common) is at 51.11. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is an often employed momentum oscillator that is used to measure the speed and change of stock price movements. When charted, the RSI can serve as a visual means to monitor historical and current strength or weakness in a certain market. This measurement is based on closing prices over a specific period of time. As a momentum oscillator, the RSI operates in a set range. This range falls on a scale between 0 and 100. If the RSI is closer to 100, this may indicate a period of stronger momentum. On the flip side, an RSI near 0 may signal weaker momentum. The RSI was originally created by J. Welles Wilder which was introduced in his 1978 book \u201cNew Concepts in Technical Trading Systems\u201d. \nKeeping an eye on Moving Averages, the 50-day is 188.48, the 200-day is at 178.78, and the 7-day is 189.98 for Pardee Resources Company Inc (PDER). Moving averages have the ability to be used as a powerful indicator for technical stock analysis. Following multiple time frames using moving averages can help investors figure out where the stock has been and help determine where it may be possibly going. The simple moving average is a mathematical calculation that takes the average price (mean) for a given amount of time. \nBy Journal Contributor", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pardee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald lambert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "larry williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j. welles wilder", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "pardee resources company inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "resources company inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rsi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:32.080+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b5ca1a71d23124bb35a752f0101ff9b66c9c5a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQox4RZmGChIlt_6Xiewc0Vzs6xsmBthfhaViRijhe2Peq_1SLybf8sc5GHzZ5BPeZ2QIoSvKGUB811K_qcHlpt", "site_full": "1939socal.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://1939socal.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Guest ranch interior, Palm Springs \u2013 1939 Southern California", "title": "Guest ranch interior, Palm Springs", "title_full": "Guest ranch interior, Palm Springs", "published": "2017-12-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b5ca1a71d23124bb35a752f0101ff9b66c9c5a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQox4RZmGChIlt_6Xiewc0Vzs6xsmBthfhaViRijhe2Peq_1SLybf8sc5GHzZ5BPeZ2QIoSvKGUB811K_qcHlpt", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "charley2030", "published": "2017-12-07T10:01:00.000+02:00", "title": "Guest ranch interior, Palm Springs", "text": "\n\nImages: Deep Well Ranch, interior: California State Library, Mott Studios, 1936-1939 via http://www.paulrwilliamsproject.org/gallery/deep-well-ranch-palm-springs-ca/ .\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s fascination with cowboys and the West has been part of our popular culture for more than a century.

REUTERS/Bo \nBy Jennifer Hughes \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC has a three-year head start on its foreign investment banking rivals in China because of the British bank's unique position of having management control of its securities venture there, chief executive Stuart Gulliver said on Thursday. \nGulliver's comments come after Beijing, in a surprise move last month, announced it will allow foreigners to control their onshore operations. Currently non-Chinese groups are limited to 49 per cent stakes in joint ventures in the fast-growing market. \nHSBC's 51 percent control of HSBC Qianhai Securities is unique because it was able to use its long-established Hong Kong unit to take advantage of a rule favoring banks based in the city. \nMany international banks are keen to launch new Chinese ventures with majority control or to boost their stakes in existing partnerships to help integrate those operations with their global networks and to better manage reputational risk, bankers have said. \nBut it will be some years before things fall into place for foreign majority-owned ventures to kick off, according to HSBC's CEO. \n\"The regulations will come in two years time. Then you have to pick your partner and you've got to hire people - we think we've got a three-year head start,\" Gulliver told a media briefing at the launch of its securities joint venture in Shenzhen. \nThe joint venture, with Qianhai Financial Holding Company, an investment unit controlled by local government, is part of the UK-headquartered bank's \"pivot to Asia\" - a strategy launched in 2015 that aimed to capitalize on its strong links in the region and the closeness of China's Cantonese-speaking Pearl River Delta region to HSBC's Hong Kong stronghold. \nThe venture's license allows HSBC to underwrite bond and equity sales in the mainland and to act as a broker for shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. It can also publish research on Chinese companies to local clients. So far, almost 100 staff have been hired, with investment bankers making up the biggest group. \nAsia accounted for 70 percent of HSBC's adjusted pre-tax profit in the first nine months of this year. Gulliver said on Thursday he expected the Pearl River Delta business, which includes retail and commercial banking as well as the new securities business, to produce $1 billion in cumulative pre-tax profit in the next three to five years and add about $500 million a year after that. \nThe bank has about 17,400 staff in the area already, with 15,000 in data processing and software. About 2,400 are in its branches - a number he expects to double by 2020. \nGulliver is due to step down in 2018 as chief executive after seven years at the helm. He will be replaced by John Flint, who currently runs the bank's retail and wealth management division. \nThe CEO welcomed news that Ping An had become HSBC's second-largest shareholder. The Chinese insurer began buying shares in 2016 as part of its insurance investments and on Wednesday passed the 5 per cent threshold after which it had to announce its holding. \n\"We are really very happy about this,\" Gulliver said, adding that he and other senior managers met regularly with Ping An executives as they did with other large shareholders. \n(Reporting by Jennifer Hughes; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) More From Business ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "decembe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john flint", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart gulliver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ping an", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "muralikumar anantharaman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer hughes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hsbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ping an", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qianhai financial holding company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hsbc qianhai securities", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shanghai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pearl river delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shenzhen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:33.011+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b34deff1cb62bfe1876916bd56d30c689a860413", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToWS06x1aR10Fs0em2sHb7N9Mvb.OU..n6scjGC7mCIuj8zsq77xvk3XgniwqI7B9KkkAFHxxCiw--", "site_full": "ca.trustpilot.com", "site": "trustpilot.com", "site_section": "https://ca.trustpilot.com/review/www.proplates.co.uk", "site_categories": ["marketing", "business"], "section_title": "Proplates Reviews | Read Customer Service Reviews of www.proplates.co.uk", "title": "Mr Terence Gibson", "title_full": "Proplates reviewed by Mr Terence Gibson", "published": "2017-12-07T09:09:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.63, "main_image": "https://share.trustpilot.com/images/review?locale=en-CA&reviewId=5a28e939495a4e0d5c889af6&businessUnitId=4d81315400006400050f24e9", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1822, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b34deff1cb62bfe1876916bd56d30c689a860413", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZToWS06x1aR10Fs0em2sHb7N9Mvb.OU..n6scjGC7mCIuj8zsq77xvk3XgniwqI7B9KkkAFHxxCiw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mr Terence Gibson", "published": "2017-12-07T09:09:00.000+02:00", "title": "Excellent design choices", "text": "Excellent design choices, quality materials & prompt response / delivery.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": 5.0, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:33.012+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60013fe1dabc3de7bd1c4d67b8bfb7fa5fdf2f62", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYf9pA8cmVYgIfn4UyoGA5PIrw9fN0cVoQfdlwGaq045oEeLrCUdC02U5PHzYAvzwj2BOxvcdyr008YYIWSZpNKvLy5v6Z3PS5Hbh9912JSVoGxSRgY.os7dr1ebcM58zIVHeckMINds7gYRyIZlYg.w--", "site_full": "www.tripadvisor.com.my", "site": "tripadvisor.com.my", "site_section": "https://www.tripadvisor.com.my/ShowForum-g294232-i525-o80-Japan.html", "site_categories": ["travel", "by_us_locale", "hotels"], "section_title": "Japan Forum, Travel Discussion for Japan - TripAdvisor", "title": "Highway Bus to Lake Kawaguchiko - Tokyo", "title_full": "Highway Bus to Lake Kawaguchiko - Tokyo Message Board - TripAdvisor", "published": "2017-12-06T01:20:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 6, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "MY", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static.tacdn.com/img2/postimg.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 13431, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94bc04e5af5052fd53d5722a0861a76e72efee2e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR1Tg7RVgB.SqYMwHpPDZiYf9pA8cmVYgIfn4UyoGA5PIrw9fN0cVoQfdlwGaq045oEeLrCUdC02U5PHzYAvzwj2BOxvcdyr008YYIWSZpNKvLy5v6Z3PS5Hbh9912JSVoGxSRgY.os7dr1ebcM58zIVHeckMINds51TzGjumVG6ep2rOMo3.EY", "ord_in_thread": 5, "author": "SurfingWild", "published": "2017-12-06T03:32:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yes I agree with the others.

The ship was carrying 648 soldiers \u2014 primarily black soldiers, members of the South African Native Labour Corps. The men all drown. \nThe SS Darro sustained minor damages. Many of these lives would have been saved if Captain Harry Stump of the SS Darro had sent boats to their rescue, instead of reportedly standing and watching the men drown and die of hypothermia. An investigation found Captain Stump wholly responsible for the tragedy, as he was moving too fast; and did not sound the customary whistle in the fog. For his fatal negligence, the captain was punished: his license was suspended for a year. \nChristina Sharpe\u2019s In the Wake: On Blackness and Being (2016) meditates on another ship, carrying other Africans whose deaths preceded the Mendi fatalities: the slave ship, Zorgue. En route to Jamaica in 1781 with twice its legal capacity, Sharpe writes, the Zorgue overshot its destination due to navigational errors. Worried about dwindling supplies, but reassured by the insurance taken out against accidental loss of \u201cthe cargo,\u201d the captain and crew decided to throw about 142 of the captive Africans overboard, to ensure the survival of the rest, and secure the insurance pay-out. It is instructive here that, as Sharpe reminds us, this case \u201cwas committed to historical memory first as the insurance claim in the case of Gregson vs Gilbert , and only later as murders,\u201d because it was the court\u2019s considered opinion that this was \u201cthe throwing overboard of goods [and] the case was a simple one of maritime insurance.\u201d In the face of an impossibly long history of anti-blackness that not only joins the SS Mendi and the Zorgue, but casts its shadow further to contemporary South Africa, the commemoration of the Mendi tragedy is self-explanatory. \nThis year marked the first centennial of the Mendi tragedy; and among the projects commemorating this historic disaster is South African author and journalist, Fred Khumalo\u2019s historical novel, Dancing the Death Drill. \nDiscussing the tensions between literature and history, South African literary critic Michael Green considers the two disciplines to be \u201c antagonists in a civil war all the more bitter for their \u2013 often repressed \u2014 affiliation .\u201d Yet, if as Green suggests, historical fiction in South African literary history closely correlates with the emergence of various nationalisms, then Dancing the Death Drill stretches the horizons of this relationship in fascinating ways that mirror the ever-receding horizons that daily rose to meet the men aboard the SS Mendi in 1917. By weaving a riveting tapestry of the Anglo-Boer War as experienced by Africans, the British and the Afrikaners on the one hand; and World War I as seen through the eyes of the South African troops and the French; the novel excavates narrative\u2019s capacity to imagine a range of identity tensions and possibilities. This tapestry evocatively resonates with contemporary modes of relating in South Africa, capturing what Green might call \u201cthe historicity of the present\u201d (130), at a time when the mythical rainbow nation project is simultaneously leaking and brightening its constituent strips in ambiguous ways. In many respects, the appeal of Khumalo\u2019s novel partly lies in its presentness; in the ways it confronts Frederic Jameson\u2019s challenge of respecting the specificity of the past while activating the resonances of its passions, experiences and struggles with those of the present. \nFred Khumalo shares some of the thinking behind his novel with me. \nWhy did you choose to engage with the Mendi tragedy in the format of a novel ; and why now? \nInitially, I thought I should write the book as a work of non-fiction. Sadly, all the veterans from the South African Native Labour Contingent (the black troops who survived) had already died when I had the wherewithal to interview them and write about their experiences, so, I resorted to fiction. It is pertinent to tell this story now because February 2017 marked the centenary of the sinking of the SS Mendi. It is also important that we start telling stories that have long been reduced to footnotes in our history books. \nThe title Dancing the Death Drill is intriguing. What is the thinking behind it ? \nAccording to oral tradition, as the SS Mendi was going down, having been rammed on the side by the SS Darro, and while some of the men were throwing themselves overboard, while others were writhing in futility trapped in the very dark holds of the ship, which were already water-logged, some members stood on the upper-deck, under the command of Reverend Isaac Wauchope Dyobha, a chaplain on the ship. Oral tradition tells us that Dyobha, in a dramatic display of bravery in the face of calamity, suddenly cried out for the men to stand in formation. They obeyed. Then he proceeded to say, \nBe quiet and calm, my countrymen, for what is taking place now is exactly what you came to do. You are going to die, but that is what you came to do. Brothers, we are drilling the drill of death. I, a Xhosa, say you are all my brothers, Zulus, Swazis, Pondos, Basutos, we die like brothers. We are the sons of Africa. Raise your cries, brothers, for though they made us leave our weapons at our home, our voices are left with our bodies! \nThe men took off their boots and started gyrating, dancing a macabre drill of death, defying death, challenging death, daring death. \nWhy have you turned to historical fiction at this point in your career? \nWhen I set out to write Dancing the Death Drill , I was not driven by this compulsion to write a historical novel. It is just that the story of the Mendi was crying out to be told. However, after writing the novel, I was struck by the sheer range of tantalizing pockets of hidden history in South Africa. Some of these histories have been kept alive through oral traditions, while others have only received passing mention in our history books. I am currently drawn to these pockets of histories. \nTo what extent are you using fiction and the past to respond to contemporary South Africa? Or are you motivated by something else entirely? \nI was trying to address, among other concerns, the issue of land. Many of the men who enlisted to go and serve in Europe did so because they were financially desperate, thanks to the Native Land Act of 1913, which had robbed them of their land and livelihood. In telling the story of the Mendi, I am trying to create a historical context to the current debate on land reform and reported acts of violence over land in some parts of the country. I wanted to remind the reader how the struggle over land started; how the migrant labour system led to the breakdown of Black families, from one generation to the next. Today we are living with the legacy of those broken families. It is what Zimbabwean novelist Shimmer Chinodya would call \u2018a harvest of thorns.\u2019 That is my motivation. But let\u2019s be honest, there is also the commercial imperative; not many local writers have shown an inclination for historical fiction. I thought I should carve myself a niche in this less cluttered genre. Admittedly, historical fiction involves a lot of research, which is a turn-off for many of my writer friends. However, being a repository of \u201cuseless information,\u201d I thought, for once, let me put this useless historical information I have been imbibing over the years to good use. I also think there is a growing interest \u2014 at least from a readers\u2019 perspective \u2014 in historical fiction. You just have to look at the current \u201chot\u201d writers and see that it is their historical fiction that has set the public imagination on fire: Colson Whitehead ( The Underground Railroad ); Marlon James ( A Brief History of Seven Killings ); Hillary Mantel ( Wolf Hall ); Sebastian Barry ( Days without End ); and of course, the historical novelist\u2019s novelist, Toni Morrison ( Beloved ). \nThe novel inter weave s B lack histories of the Mendi tragedy with British and Afrikaner histories of the Anglo-Boer W ar, and subsequently World War I. What did you intend with this tapestry of histories? \nDancing the Death Drill is fiction and should be read as such. As much as I tried my best to be loyal to historical facts, I have exercised poetic license to re-imagine some aspects of the story through the lives of my characters. While many of them are totally fictional, they still interact with real-life, historical figures such as Reverend Isaac Wauchope Dyobha and King George V of England. History is, as someone said, a certainty reached at a point where the unreliability of our memory converges with the inadequacy of documentation. The characters are a manifestation of this discomfort, this restlessness. This story is about conflict, and as a writer I stretch the motif of conflict until it is so unbearably taut and stretched out it can snap any time. And in snapping no one knows who it will hurt, who the victim will be. In an editorial comment on the role of historical fiction in modern society, The Guardian noted : \u201cThe best historical novels do not pretend to provide a faithful record. When you read one, [Hillary] Mantel said, you are not buying a replica, or even a faithful photographic reproduction \u2013 you are buying a painting with the brush strokes left in.\u201d \nThere is a recurrent motif of courage and cowardice and men deserting wars, children or their colleagues . Is this central to your thinking about that historical moment? \nMost of our \u201cformal\u201d published histories tell the narrative of war through the mouths and eyes of the generals and commanders; the ordinary person is given short shrifts. Their humanity is never acknowledged, or celebrated. The idea behind bringing in notions of cowardice and doubt was to imbue history with real human emotions and frailties. Not all of us are courageous. Not all of us are paragons of morality. \nYou seem to have a close relationship to jazz in your writing. Your previous writing references jazz as well; and here, we meet Miles Davis already in the first three pages; and one of the musical soundtracks is Duke Ellington\u2019s \u201cMood Indigo\u201d. What is jazz to you and your writing? \nWhen I write, there\u2019s invariably some music playing in the background. I might not be actively listening, but it will be there; it becomes a creative bubble in which I lose myself as I embark on my own creative process. It buoys me, so to speak, keeps me afloat. It is just the way it is. Fiction, like jazz, is an artistic form that is forever searching, always on a quest. Unlike classical music which has to be scored in order to be played, jazz is more flexible, more challenging. The best recordings of jazz are live improvisations rather than studio pieces \u2013 rehearsed and rehearsed to death. Fiction writing \u2013 at least how I practice it \u2013 is also an act of improvisation. It is breathlessly unpredictable; which is why it is fraught with risks. Danger, disappointment (or surprise) are always around the corner. When you are writing a piece of fiction, as when you are performing a jazz piece, you are carrying a candle, and you\u2019re entering a cave. You don\u2019t know what to expect in there. Sometimes you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re looking for. A monster? A child in distress? A princess running away from a forced marriage? You never know. And, carrying the candle itself is not free of pain. The wax will slide down and burn your hand. Guaranteed. You might also drop the candle by mistake. It might accidentally fall on a piece of kindling, and the whole cave might catch fire, and you\u2019re a goner! That\u2019s jazz. That\u2019s fiction. Risky business. \nW hat was the greatest challenge about writing this novel? \nThe greatest challenge was that even though this is based on and inspired by some chunks of our history, there was virtually no archival material on the sinking of the SS Mendi \u2013 especially about the men who were on board. Who were they? Where had they come from? What had motivated them? It was scary for me not to have an archive as a crutch. But once I got into the groove I realized how liberating it was \u2013 to my imagination. I was not hindered or fettered by too much documentation viewed, undoubtedly, from the perspective of those who were in charge. \nW hat\u2019s the next project? \nI have just finished the first draft of another historical novel. It is based on and inspired by a little-known slice of history of black involvement in the Anglo-Boer War. Just weeks before the war broke it, it suddenly occurred to the authorities that there were tens of thousands of black people stuck in Johannesburg \u2013 with no means of leaving the city. The trains had stopped running. The Brits were on the march from Natal and the rest of the country towards the Transvaal. The Boers had also embarked on a march, to meet the enemy on the Natal border. In the midst of this we had these tens of thousands of black people (mainly men, desperate to leave the city). Then a group of them, 7 000 Zulus, started marching from Johannesburg to Natal. The march took them 10 days of sleeping in the open, exposed to the elements; on occasion being commandeered by Boer troops and forced at gunpoint to perform whatever physical tasks needed manpower (pushing cannons up steep hills, driving ox wagons, etc.).

Why do sucky teams have to suck so much?\nSent from my iPhone using RealGM Forums", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:34.007+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6870564a1e1824c2749ebc0d405fd28832ccd456", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8_DRNYNHvKGwBXjWTOM6I0SfekuFBwLC99dY18CFItp3CtGuy7TNJx", "site_full": "www.55188.com", "site": "55188.com", "site_section": "http://www.55188.com/forum-8-3.html", "site_categories": ["investing", "financial_news", "finance", "stocks"], "section_title": "\u0104\u017e\u0161\u00c9\u0118\u0110\u0118\u013e\u0150\u02dd\u0110\u0139\u010e\u02d8\u02dd\u0165\u00c1\u00f7\u00c7\u0159\u0104\u017c -

July 2013. \nHere's what we think Alzheimer's does to the brain New research is helping us to understand how Alzheimer\u2019s affects the connections in our brain \u2013 and how a personal approach is the only way forwards\nAnna Cranston \nTuesday 7 November 2017 00:00 GMT\n\nClick to follow\nIndy/Life\nAround 50 million people worldwide are thought to have Alzheimer\u2019s disease. And with rapidly ageing populations in many countries, the number of sufferers is steadily rising.\nWe know that Alzheimer\u2019s is caused by problems in the brain. Cells begin to lose their functions and eventually die, leading to memory loss, a decline in thinking abilities and even major personality changes. Specific regions of the brain also shrink, a process known as atrophy, causing a significant loss of brain volume. But what\u2019s actually happening in the brain to cause this?\nThe main way the disease works is to disrupt communication between neurons, the specialised cells that process and transmit electrical and chemical signals between regions of the brain. This is what is responsible for the cell death in the brain \u2013 and we think its due to a build up of two types of protein, called amyloid and tau. The exact interaction between these two proteins is largely unknown, but amyloid accumulates into sticky clusters known as beta-amyloid \u201cplaques\u201d, while tau builds up inside dying cells as \u201cneurofibrillary tangles\u201d.\n\nSimple reading test predicts chance of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease\u2019\nOne of the difficulties of diagnosing Alzheimer\u2019s is that we\u2019ve no reliable and accurate way of measuring this protein build-up during the early stages of the disease. In fact, we can\u2019t definitively diagnose Alzheimer\u2019s until after the patient has died, by examining their actual brain tissue.\nAnother problem we have is that beta-amyloid plaques can also be found in the brains of healthy patients. This suggests the presence of the amyloid and tau proteins may not tell the whole story of the disease.\nMore recent research suggests chronic inflammation may play a role. Inflammation is part of the body\u2019s defence system against disease and occurs when white blood cells release chemicals to protect the body from foreign substances. But, over a long enough period, it can also cause damage.\nIn the brain, tissue-damaging long-term inflammation can also be caused by a build-up of cells known as microglia. In a healthy brain, these cells engulf and destroy waste and toxins. But in Alzheimer\u2019s patients, the microglia fail to clear away this debris, which can include toxic tau tangles or amyloid plaques. The body then activates more microglia to try to clear the waste but this in turn causes inflammation. Long-term or chronic inflammation is particularly damaging to brain cells and ultimately leads to brain cell death.\nTailoring treatment to the individual patient, rather the disease as a whole, is the future (Shutterstock)\nScientists recently identified a gene called TREM2 that could be responsible for this problem. Normally TREM2 acts to guide microglia to clear beta-amyloid plaques from the brain, and to help fight inflammation within the brain. But researchers have found that the brains of patients whose TREM2 gene doesn\u2019t work properly have a build-up of beta-amyloid plaques between neurons.\nMany Alzheimer\u2019s patients also experience problems with their heart and circulatory system. Beta-amyloid deposits in the brain arteries, atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), and mini-strokes may also be at play.\nThese \u201cvascular\u201d problems can reduce blood flow in the brain even more and break down the blood-brain barrier, a structure that is critical for removing toxic waste from the brain. This can also prevent the brain from absorbing as much glucose \u2013 some studies have suggested this may actually occur before the onset of toxic proteins associated within Alzheimer\u2019s disease within the brain.\nPersonalised treatment\nMore recently, researchers have been looking deeper into the brain, specifically at the precise connections between neurons, known as synapses. A recent study published in Nature describes a process in the cells that may contribute to the breakdown of these synaptic communications between neurons. The findings indicate that this may happen when there isn\u2019t enough of a specific synaptic protein (known as RBFOX1).\nRead more\nAlzheimer\u2019s patients could recover \u2018lost\u2019 memories, scientists say\n\u2018Exciting\u2019 gene discovery could lead to drugs to treat Alzheimer\u2019s\nSlowing speech patterns \u2018could be first sign of Alzheimer\u2019s\u2019\nThanks to this kind of research, there are now many new drugs in development and in clinical trials that could target one or more of the many brain-wide changes that occur with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Many researchers now believe that a more personalised approach to Alzheimer\u2019s patients is the future.\nThis would involve a combination of drugs tailored to target several of the problems mentioned above, much like current treatments available for cancer.
