More > \nBy RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVARAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - People on Medicaid are more prone to smoke, struggle with depression and obesity, or rate their own health as fair or poor. But that's not the whole story. \nA new study suggests that low-income Medicaid recipients are also invested in their health, with 4 out of 5 saying they have a personal doctor, 3 out of 5 saying they eat healthy, and nearly half saying they exercise frequently. \nExperts say the analysis for The Associated Press by the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being Index indicates that Medicaid could gain by putting more emphasis on prevention, and stressing better coordination of care. Such strategies are already employed by many workplace health plans and by Medicare. \nCall it Medicaid's health care challenge. \nA federal-state program originally envisioned as a safety net for poor families and severely disabled people, Medicaid has grown to cover about 1 in 5 Americans, at a total cost of about $600 billion annually. In states that expanded Medicaid under former President Barack Obama's health law, it's become the insurer for many low-income working adults. The Trump administration tried to unravel Obama's expansion, but top officials have also said they want to work to better the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, not just pay medical bills. \n\"We now have emerging evidence in Medicare and commercial insurance of how care coordination and prevention can help patients with chronic conditions avoid costly hospitalizations and ER visits,\" said Kavita Patel, a policy expert at the Brookings Institution who's also a practicing physician. \"This really should become the standard across Medicaid programs.\" \nIn small town Stuttgart, Ark., Vickie Rose says Medicaid coverage is helping her try to quit smoking for good, which would entail shutting down a decades-long habit that once reached three packs a day. \n\"I'm not going to be able to stay out of hospitals if I don't take matters into my own hands,\" said Rose, who's in her early 60s and has worked jobs from factory supervisor, to retail, to staffing an animal shelter. Sometimes she travels 20 miles to the Mid-Delta community health center in neighboring Clarendon for smoking cessation meetings. \n\"Instead of waiting on everyone else, this time I'm going to do it for myself,\" said Rose. \nThirty-six percent of Medicaid recipients said they smoked in the Gallup-Sharecare study, compared to 13 percent of those with employer or union health insurance, and 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare survey interviews about 500 people a day on health care issues, yielding a trove of data. The new analysis for AP compared health indicators among people with different types of coverage. \nIn other findings: \n- Twenty-five percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are currently suffering from depression, compared with 7 percent of those with employer coverage. \n- Forty percent of people with Medicaid said they were in fair or poor health, compared with 11 percent of those in employer plans and 31 percent of those on Medicare. \n- Thirty-six percent of Medicaid beneficiaries said they are obese, compared with 28 percent of people in employer plans, and 30 percent of those with Medicare. \nStill, survey director Dan Witters said that's only half the story. \n\"Just because they smoke more, doesn't mean that they don't have an interest in their health,\" Witters said of those with Medicaid. \"Their interest in their health is generally just as high as it is for other groups...although I think they are swimming upstream.\" \nHaving a low income has long been associated with poor health, but Witters said on questions such as exercise frequency, eating healthy, and eating fruits and vegetables, the answers from Medicaid recipients generally tracked those of people with workplace coverage. \nIn one counter-intuitive finding, 81 percent of Medicaid recipients said they had a personal doctor, about the same as 83 percent of those on employer plans. Because Medicaid pays less than private insurance or Medicare, a longstanding criticism is that beneficiaries might not be able to find a doctor who'll see them. But most states now contract with private insurers to administer their programs, and those insurers must provide a physician network. \nIn theory the networks used by Medicaid insurers could also serve to promote prevention and care coordination, but Matt Salo, head of the National Association of Medicaid Directors, cautioned against a cut-and-paste approach that grafts on strategies used by employers. \n\"The Medicaid population is not just an employer population with less income,\" said Salo. \"It is people who have health conditions.\" \nSalo said he was struck by the high rates of depression in the survey. \"Depression is inextricably linked to physical health and the ability to engage effectively in the work force,\" he said. \nSome states are trying to get ahead of the health challenges of their Medicaid beneficiaries. In Michigan, for example, people covered by expanded Medicaid complete an annual health assessment, somewhat similar to workplace wellness programs. \n\"We've got some figuring out to do,\" Salo said. \nThe Gallup-Sharecare results are based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 2-Nov. 5, with a random sample of 147,465 adults, aged 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington. D.C. \nFor the total sample of national adults, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1 percentage point. For Medicaid recipients, the margin of sampling error is plus or minus 1.6 percentage points.

cut the ribbon adding another 20 acres to the association\u2019s inventory.

Photo By Mike Condon Save \nHARDING TWP. \u2013 Sally Rubin spent a lot of time admiring the wooded 20-acre parcel located at 1 Tiger Lily Lane. \n\u201cWe have coveted this property for years,\u201d said Rubin, who is the executive director of the Great Swamp Watershed Association. \nThe coveting period officially ended last Wednesday morning when Rubin, joined by Hazel England, property manager and director of outreach and education, and Matt Krauser, Great Swamp board chairman, cut the ribbon officially adding the 10 acres to the contiguous 53 acres the watershed association already owns. \n\u201cWe have literally driven down this road for 10 years and looked at this piece of property,\u201d Rubin said. \u201cThe owner was looking for a nice charitable opportunity, so the timing was great. \n\u201cOn Nov. 9, right after the deed was signed, we immediately came out here to take down the no trespassing sign and run down the trail,\u201d she said, to about 20 people who gathered for the official dedication of the property. \nFor Harding Township, the new open space parcel may bear yet another silver lining. Township Committeeman Tim Jones, who was present for Wednesday\u2019s morning ceremony, said Harding will likely take joint ownership of the property, which would pave the way for \u201cswapping\u201d it for part of the Glen Alpin diversion process. \nSeeking to make the Glen Alpin mansion and property at the corner of Tempe Wick Road and Route 202 more marketable, rentable and/or usable, Harding is seeking state approval to essentially swap it for other parcels which would in turn be preserved and protected. \nThat swap, England said, is the \u201cpotential next step\u201d in the plan. \n\u201cThe Great Swamp is the owner now. That would be a secondary negotiation,\u201d she said. \nEngland said the 20 acres will augment the contiguous 53 acres. She said the rectangular parcel is heavily wooded, although there are trails running through it. The goal, she said, is to eventually connect trail to trail throughout the entire property. \n\u201cThere already exists three miles of trails that we built,\u201d England said. \u201cWe will access this property to build new trails.\u201d \nShe said a temporary connector was created but the plan is to access the entire property from one entrance at the cul de sac on Tiger Lily Lane. \nIn total, the property is called the \u201cConservation Management Area.\u201d \nThe private land owner who previously owned the property, who was not named during the ceremony, wanted a buildable lot, England said. The property, however, is a wetland a forest and a swamp habitat. \n\u201cThe timing was just right. We reached out in the fall of 2016 to the land owner, we started the negotiations process and the sale was closed on Nov. 9,\u201d she said. \nEngland, who has managed the Great Swamp properties since 2004, said the land purchase is a dream come true. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve had our eye on this piece of property for years. It was the missing piece to the jigsaw puzzle,\u201d she said. \u201cSilver Brook flows through all three of these parcels, which feeds the Great Swamp.\u201d \nAlthough there is a major trail, visible from the roadway, on the newly acquired property, England said that will likely not stay. \n\u201cWe want everyone to access the property by the main entrance, at the cul de sac at the end of the road. There is parking there, and maps and a kiosk,\u201d she said. \nThe \u201cno trespassing\u201d sign is down, and England said hikers are free to access the parcel. \nIn addition to the nearly 75 acres owned by the Great Swamp Watershed Association, the non-profit Harding Land Trust owns another 25 adjacent acres, bringing the total to nearly 100 contiguous acres of open, preserved space. \nDogs on a leash are permitted on the parcels, but no bikes are permitted. Hunting is permitted, but with the written permission from the association. \n\u201cWe are so excited about this,\u201d England said. \u201cSilver Brook runs through this whole property. This gives us a lot of potential for habitat restoration and improving access for recreation. We use this property a lot for teaching. We have had 700 kids this year so far, and this will add to our educational opportunities.\u201d \nRubin said this year marks the end of her 10th year as executive director. \n\u201cWe have always wanted to add this property to our inventory,\u201d she said. \u201cThe owner was very generous. It was the right time and the right place for both of us.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "township committeeman tim jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sally rubin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hazel england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt krauser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiger lily lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike condon save  harding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glen alpin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike condon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rubin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "great swamp watershed association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faceboo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harding land trust", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silver brook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "harding township", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hazel england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silver brook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tempe wick road", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiger lily lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harding", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ce2df7cf8f625286dff795cdec66637921d2e02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8081ES3bebblkU_cZMoi643CMFZ_fF8HHyQiZIoAuZIDavVY4.wXU7mCJBDuqUsA2Pb_BPavBiMod3CzRc.XWI_PheK9Fuxs2D8cwdWWrOAUdxhqgXCziKCN5IDdAaF4ycBota1YDWQTfMwDlX_ankObAabLSilt246XRgPBF24uNd0wfO4IE3feYSfG1Abv_ufdpH8vKRBg--", "site_full": "www.newjerseyhills.com", "site": "newjerseyhills.com", "site_section": "http://newjerseyhills.com/search/?q=&t=article&l=25&d=&d1=&d2=&s=start_time&sd=desc&c[]=observer-tribune*&f=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "www.newjerseyhills.com - RSS Results in observer-tribune* of type article", "title": "Harding family gives back, looks to form non-profit for medical service dogs", "title_full": "Harding family gives back, looks to form non-profit for medical service dogs", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/newjerseyhills.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/62/c62f23e7-9039-5141-947e-50add1b4a6b4/5a1d9128e2783.image.jpg?resize=945%2C630", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ce2df7cf8f625286dff795cdec66637921d2e02", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8081ES3bebblkU_cZMoi643CMFZ_fF8HHyQiZIoAuZIDavVY4.wXU7mCJBDuqUsA2Pb_BPavBiMod3CzRc.XWI_PheK9Fuxs2D8cwdWWrOAUdxhqgXCziKCN5IDdAaF4ycBota1YDWQTfMwDlX_ankObAabLSilt246XRgPBF24uNd0wfO4IE3feYSfG1Abv_ufdpH8vKRBg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MIKE CONDON Staff Writer", "published": "2017-12-07T10:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Harding family gives back, looks to form non-profit for medical service dogs", "text": "Harding family gives back, looks to form non-profit for medical service dogs By MIKE CONDON   Save \nHARDING TWP. \u2013 A New Vernon family\u2019s successful effort to get a medical service dog for their special needs son has prompted them to advocate for the same service for other families. \n\u201cWe have decided to form a foundation to help get more autism medical service dogs to the kids and families that need them,\u201d said Margaret Ng, whose son, Ethan Ng, 4, is on the autism spectrum. \u201cI am taking all I learned over the past 16 months plus my momentum and connections, and putting them to good use. But, I do need a few things.\u201d \nYazzie, a 15-month-old autism medical service dog, arrived at the Ng home on Friday, Nov. 17. \n\u201cEthan has already learned to stay with us and not run away through tether walking and our daughter, Emma, who is 11, has been out of her room the majority of the time,\u201d Ng said. \nPreviously, Emma had suffered from depression and would stay in her room alone all day, Ng said. \nShe explained the long ordeal on her website, HopeforEthan.org. \nThe dogs, which have to be purchased out of pocket, cost between $47,000 and $60,000. \nNow, with Yazzie already making his mark on the family, Ng said she wants to afford other families the same benefit. \n\u201cI have never formed a not-for-profit organization before and am looking for volunteers or folks willing to work pro bono to help me get this off the ground quickly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to apply for 501c3 status which means writing a formal mission and plan and we need to raise $2,000 to cover filing fees. We understand it is a very documentation heavy process. Pro bono accounting and legal services would also be great for the foundation just now.\u201d \nNg will host the first fundraising event for the foundation at 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 14, 2018, at her Harding home. \nThe planned fundraiser is called \u201cSip and Shop with Yazzie\u201d and involves champagne and shopping for Swarovski Crystal jewelry, she said. \nFor more information and to register, visit http:/ /bit.ly/sipshopyazzie or call 862-22-ETHAN (38426).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "harding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ethan ng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margaret ng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ng", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yazzie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7a625e47fefdc96a5772cc175ed786782f76c571", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSZ1qmFPbdIF5whejUkU9Q0y2O5Tndfi53NpXKnbnDqggIAXTxSMaevaJ.FZmJsnjT_mNBL_TxzO5eCgc3H0pT.FvKHy75hxlL3ifmE4xyXRplx8NoNusxwA--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Europe", "title": "Czechia announces it recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel's capital; considers moving embassy [second source in comments]", "title_full": "Czechia announces it recognizes West Jerusalem as Israel's capital; considers moving embassy [second source in comments] : europe", "published": "2017-12-07T00:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 76, "participants_count": 43, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d7511c156d4076d87cdc7c69235d4917e1d7f15", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSZ1qmFPbdIF5whejUkU9Q0y2O5Tndfi53NpXKnbnDqggIAXTxSMaevaJ.FZmJsnjT_mNBL_TxzO5eCgc3H0pT.FvKHy75hxlL3ifmE4xyXRp1f_Z4PYNMbb9uicAXs5B1Pxby7NiX.AU-", "ord_in_thread": 76, "author": "IngrownPubez", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "and 0% of the surrounding arab countries are Jewish", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:09:10.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c3748c9c7ac35f1ea48a95b807f1e027858eda0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyt8VVlPAeg_BMDlfucy2ME_S7DUjZ3dW6UPtWFR1y7ZpEkmrFP6gjwU_19WcI7ckyQGwnIS.PnYPEbJjUOi_o9nf6nRGApA1HwU.0XGIvvYiEV3kTKnR4jMJuEHFs0_NEYg_cFqPC.c98y.qUPcsE", "site_full": "www.platts.com", "site": "platts.com", "site_section": "http://platts.com//RSSFeedDetail/Agriculture", "site_categories": ["metals", "business"], "section_title": "Platts News: Latest agriculture News from Platts.com", "title": "Chicago ethanol paper tumbles on weekly EIA production data", "title_full": "Chicago ethanol paper tumbles on weekly EIA production data", "published": "2017-12-07T05:24:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 79056, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c3748c9c7ac35f1ea48a95b807f1e027858eda0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSyt8VVlPAeg_BMDlfucy2ME_S7DUjZ3dW6UPtWFR1y7ZpEkmrFP6gjwU_19WcI7ckyQGwnIS.PnYPEbJjUOi_o9nf6nRGApA1HwU.0XGIvvYiEV3kTKnR4jMJuEHFs0_NEYg_cFqPC.c98y.qUPcsE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-12-07T05:24:00.000+02:00", "title": "Chicago ethanol paper tumbles on weekly EIA production data", "text": "Chicago ethanol paper tumbles on weekly EIA production data Houston (Platts)--6 Dec 2017 1024 pm EST/324 GMT \nChicago Argo ethanol swap prices dropped sharply Wednesday after a government report showed ethanol production in the US at a record high.The report from the US Energy Information Administration also included a 500,000-barrel build in ethanol inventories.Prices for the January ethanol swap traded as low as $1.31/gal shortly after the EIA released the report.

Now those working in Jira Cloud can sync data with other Cloud partners.\nStuttgart, Germany, The latest release of Backbone Issue Sync for Atlassian Jira, the leading Jira-to-Jira data synchronization app, natively supports Cloud-to-Cloud sync scenarios for the first time. Now organizations working in Jira Cloud will be able to synchronize data with other internal Jira Cloud projects, or with external partners who are also on Jira Cloud systems. Backbone maker K15t Software reports that with this release Backbone now has complete coverage of all major Jira environments.\nOne of the most common use cases for Backbone includes situations where a company managing projects in Jira is working with an external subcontractor. The use of a single shared Jira instance to manage such a collaboration opens up data exposure risks and can necessitate complex permissions schemes, while at the same time preventing each partner from using the full strength of the Jira tool. Backbone Issue Sync solves this by allowing the contractor and subcontractor to each work within their own Jira system, configured in the way that works best for them. They can selectively synchronize only the issue data that helps them manage the project, while keeping all other information private and secure in their own system.\nHundreds of organizations worldwide currently use Backbone to synchronize issue data from their Jira Server, Jira Data Center, and Jira Cloud systems to other on-premises instances. With this latest release organizations that wish to sync from Cloud environments to Cloud environments can take full advantage of the power of Backbone Issue Sync. https://www.k15t.com/backbone\nAbout K15t Software\nOver 5000 organizations around the world use K15t Software\u2019s solutions to enhance and expand the collaboration and content management capabilities of their Atlassian products. The Scroll Apps for Confluence help teams modernize how they author and manage content and documentation, while Backbone Issue Sync for Jira enables project collaboration across departmental and B2B boundaries.

The Ex2 was demonstrated at the Volvo Group Innovation Summit in London and more recently for the Swedish Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven and the French President Emmanuel Macron during the EU top meeting in Gothenburg, Sweden. \n-It's of course, both exciting and a great honour. This proves that we have succeeded in realizing our target of creating what we believe is the world's first fully electric excavator. \n- I have always believed that we would succeed - you have to believe - but there are no guarantees. So the first time we saw the excavator actually move was fantastic. It was a bit like having a baby! \n- We began the project in 2012 in collaboration with six French companies and with the support of French authorities. Keeping a project together with so many different players isn't always easy, but it's really enjoyable and rewarding. \n- Testing new technology is another challenge. Among other things, we wanted to use batteries with a lower voltage than before. This requires fewer safety measures and makes it easier to collaborate with other players, from the world of passenger cars, for example. \n- To industrialise the product we have to demonstrate the durability of the technology and make the product at the right price for our customers. We have good signs, since the cost of batteries is steadily decreasing along with other technology, so that's starting to make electromobility more attractive financially. One way of reducing the cost is through creating economies of scale. It will only be possible when the market fully accepts this technology and we start to see major breakthroughs in terms of volume. \nAhc\u00e9ne has been working for the Volvo Group since 2002 and have had a number of roles within electromobility and electronics. \n- It's fantastic being an electromobility engineer at a time like this when such major breakthroughs are being made. It will be something for me to tell my grandchildren about! \nIf you too want to join the Volvo Group you find open positions here . \nDo you want to read more about Ex2?

Realizing that visible bodies are only symbols of invisible forces, the ancients worshiped the Divine Power through the lower kingdoms of Nature, because those less evolved and more simply constituted creatures responded most readily to the creative impulses of the gods. The sages of old studied living things to a point of realization that God is most perfectly understood through a knowledge of His supreme handiwork--animate and inanimate Nature. Every existing creature manifests some aspect of the intelligence or power of the Eternal One, who can never be known save through a study and appreciation of His numbered but inconceivable parts. When a creature is chosen, therefore, to symbolize to the concrete human mind some concealed abstract principle it is because its characteristics demonstrate this invisible principle in visible action. Fishes, insects, animals, reptiles, and birds appear in the religious symbolism of nearly all nations, because the forms and habits of these creatures and the media in which they exist closely relate them to the various generative and germinative powers of Nature, which were considered as prima-facie evidence of divine omnipresence. The early philosophers and scientists, realizing that all life has its origin in water, chose the fish as the symbol of the life germ. The fact that fishes are most prolific makes the simile still more apt. While the early priests may not have possessed the instruments necessary to analyze the spermatozoon, they concluded by deduction that it resembled a fish. Fishes were sacred to the Greeks and Romans, being connected with the worship of Aphrodite (Venus). An interesting survival of pagan ritualism is found in the custom of eating fish on Friday.  Freya , in whose honor the day was named, was the Scandinavian Venus, and this day was sacred among many nations to the goddess of beauty and fecundity. This analogy further links the fish with the procreative mystery. Friday is also sacred to the followers of the Prophet Mohammed. The word  nun  means both fish and growth, and as Inman says: \"The Jews were led to victory by the Son of the Fish whose other names were Joshua and Jesus (the Savior).  Nun  is still the name of a female devotee\" of the Christian faith. Among early Christians three fishes were used to symbolize the Trinity, and the fish is also one of the eight sacred symbols of the great Buddha. It is also significant that the dolphin should be sacred to both Apollo (the Solar Savior) and Neptune. It was believed that this fish carried shipwrecked sailors to heaven on its back. The dolphin was accepted by the early Christians as an emblem of Christ, because the pagans had viewed this beautiful creature as a friend and benefactor of man. The heir to the throne of France,  the Dauphin , may have secured his title from this ancient pagan symbol of the divine preservative power. The first advocates of Christianity likened converts to fishes, who at the time of baptism \"returned again into the sea of Christ.\" Primitive peoples believed the sea and land were inhabited by strange creatures, and early books on zoology contain curious illustrations of composite beasts, reptiles, and fishes, which did not exist at the time the medi\u0107val authors compiled these voluminous books. In the ancient initiatory rituals of the Persian, Greek, and Egyptian Mysteries the priests disguised themselves as composite creatures, thereby symbolizing different aspects of human consciousness. They used birds and reptiles as emblems of their various deities, often creating forms of grotesque appearance and assigning to them imaginary traits, habits, and places of domicile, all of which were symbolic of certain spiritual and transcendental truths thus concealed from the profane. The  ph\u015bnix  made its nest of incense and flames. The  unicorn  had the body of a horse, the feet of an elephant, and the tail of a wild boar. The upper half of the  centaur's  body was human and the lower half equine. The  pelican  of the Hermetists fed its young from its own breast, and to this bird were assigned other mysterious attributes which could have been true only allegorically. Though regarded by many writers of the Middle Ages as actual living creatures, none of these--the pelican excepted--ever existed outside the symbolism of the Mysteries. Possibly they originated in rumors of animals then little known. In the temple, however, they became a reality, for there they signified the manifold characteristics of man's nature. The  mantichora  had certain points in common with the hyena; the  unicorn  may have been the single-horned rhinoceros. To the student of the secret wisdom these composite animals. and birds simply represent various forces working in the invisible worlds. This is a point which nearly all writers on the subject of medi\u0107val monsters seem to have overlooked. (See Vlyssis Aldrovandi's  Monstrorum Historia , 1642, and  Physica Curiosa , by P. Gaspare Schotto, 1697.) There are also legends to the effect that long before the appearance of human beings there existed a race or species of composite creatures which was destroyed by the gods. The temples of antiquity preserved their own historical records and possessed information concerning the prehistoric world that has never been revealed to the uninitiated. According to these records, the human race evolved from a species of creature that partook somewhat of the nature of an amphibian, for at that time primitive man had the gills of a fish and was partly covered with scales. To a limited degree, the human embryo demonstrates the possibility of such a condition. As a result of the theory of man's origin in water, the fish was looked upon as the progenitor of the human family. This gave rise to the ichthyolatry of the Chaldeans, Ph\u015bnicians, and Brahmins. The American Indians believe that the waters of lakes, rivers, and oceans are inhabited by a mysterious people, the \"Water Indians.\" The fish has been used as an emblem of damnation; but among the Chinese it typified contentment and good fortune, and fishes appear on many of their coins. When Typhon, or Set, the Egyptian evil genius, had divided the body of the god Osiris into fourteen parts, he cast one part into the river Nile, where, according to Plutarch, it was devoured by three fishes--the  lepidotus  (probably the  lepidosiren ), the  phagrus , and the  oxyrynchus (a form of pike). For this reason the Egyptians would not eat the flesh of these fishes, believing that to do so would be to devour the body of their god. When used as a symbol of evil, the fish represented the earth (man's lower nature) and the tomb (the sepulcher of the Mysteries). Thus was Jonah three days in the belly of the \"great fish,\" as Christ was three days in the tomb. Several early church fathers believed that the \"whale\" which swallowed Jonah was the symbol of God the Father, who, when the hapless prophet was thrown overboard, accepted Jonah into His own nature until a place of safety was reached. The story of Jonah is really a legend of initiation into the Mysteries, and the \"great fish\" represents the darkness of ignorance which engulfs man when he is thrown over the side of the ship (is born) into the sea (life). The custom of building ships in the form of fishes or birds, common in ancient times, could give rise to the story, and mayhap Jonah was merely picked up by \nTHE FIRST INCARNATION, OR MATSYA AVATAR, OF VISHNU.\n  From Picart's  Religious Ceremonials . The fish has often been associated with the World Saviors. Vishnu, the Hindu Redeemer, who takes upon himself ten forms for the redemption of the universe, was expelled from the mouth of a fish in his first incarnation. Isis, while nursing the infant Horus, is often shown with a fish on her headdress. Oannes, the Chaldean Savior (borrowed from the Brahmins), is depicted with the head and body of a fish, from which his human form protrudes at various points. Jesus was often symbolized by a fish. He told His disciples that they should became \"fishers of men.\" The sign of the fish was also the first monogram of the Christians. The mysterious Greek name of Jesus, \u0399\u03a7\u0398\u03a5\u03a3, means \"a fish.\" The fish was accepted as a symbol of the Christ by a number of early canonized church fathers. St. Augustine likened the Christ to a fish that had been broiled, and it was also pointed out that the flesh of that Fish was the food of righteous and holy men. p. 86 another vessel and carried into port, the pattern of the ship causing it to be called a \"great fish.\" (\" Veritatis simplex oratio est! \") More probably the \"whale\" of Jonah is based upon the pagan mythological creature,  hippocampus , part horse and part dolphin, for the early Christian statues and carvings show the composite creature and not a true whale. It is reasonable to suppose that the mysterious sea serpents, which, according to the Mayan and Toltec legends, brought the gods to Mexico were Viking or Chaldean ships, built in the shape of composite sea monsters or dragons. H. P. Blavatsky advances the theory that the word  cetus , the great whale, is derived from  keto , a name for the fish god, Dagon, and that Jonah was actually confined in a cell hollowed out in the body of a gigantic statue of Dagon after he had been captured by Ph\u015bnician sailors and carried to one of their cities. There is no doubt a great mystery in the gigantic form of  cetus , which is still preserved as a constellation. According to many scattered fragments extant, man's lower nature was symbolized by a tremendous, awkward creature resembling a great sea serpent, or dragon, called  leviathan . All symbols having serpentine form or motion signify the solar energy in one of its many forms. This great creature of the sea therefore represents the solar life force imprisoned in water and also the divine energy coursing through the body of man, where, until transmuted, it manifests itself as a writhing, twisting monster---man's greeds, passions, and lusts. Among the symbols of Christ as the Savior of men are a number relating to the mystery of His divine nature concealed within the personality of the lowly Jesus. The Gnostics divided the nature of the Christian Redeemer into two parts--the one Jesus, a mortal man; the other, Christos, a personification of  Nous , the principle of Cosmic Mind.  Nous , the greater, was for the period of three years (from baptism to crucifixion) using the fleshly garment of the mortal man (Jesus). In order to illustrate this point and still conceal it from the ignorant, many strange, and often repulsive, creatures were used whose rough exteriors concealed magnificent organisms. Kenealy, in his notes on the  Book of Enoch , observes: \"Why the caterpillar was a symbol of the Messiah is evident; because, under a lowly, creeping, and wholly terrestrial aspect, he conceals the beautiful butterfly-form, with its radiant wings, emulating in its varied colors the Rainbow, the Serpent, the Salmon, the Scarab, the Peacock, and the dying Dolphin * * *. INSECTS In 1609 Henry Khunrath's  Amphitheatrum Sapienti\u0107 \u0106tern\u0107  was published. Eliphas Levi declared that within its pages are concealed all the great secrets of magical philosophy. A remarkable plate in this work shows the Hermetic sciences being attacked by the bigoted and ignorant pedagogues of the seventeenth century. In order to express his complete contempt for his slanderers, Khunrath made out of each a composite beast, adding donkey ears to one and a false tail to another. He reserved the upper part of the picture for certain petty backbiters whom he gave appropriate forms. The air was filled with strange creatures--great dragon flies, winged frogs, birds with human heads, and other weird forms which defy description--heaping venom, gossip, spite, slander, and other forms of persecution upon the secret arcanum of the wise. The drawing indicated that their attacks were ineffectual. Poisonous insects were often used to symbolize the deadly power of the human tongue. Insects of all kinds were also considered emblematic of the Nature spirits and d\u0107mons, for both were believed to inhabit the atmosphere. Medi\u0107val drawings showing magicians in the act of invoking spirits, often portray the mysterious powers of the other world, which the conjurer has exorcised, as appearing to him in composite part-insect forms. The early philosophers apparently held the opinion that the disease which swept through communities in the form of plagues were actually living creatures, but instead of considering a number of tiny germs they viewed the entire plague as one individuality and gave it a hideous shape to symbolize its destructiveness. The fact that plagues came in the air caused an insect or a bird to be used as their symbol. Beautiful symmetrical forms were assigned to all natural benevolent conditions or powers, but to unnatural or malevolent powers were assigned contorted and abnormal figures. The Evil One was either hideously deformed or else of the nature of certain despised animals. A popular superstition during the Middle Ages held that the Devil had the feet of a rooster, while the Egyptians assigned to Typhon (Devil) the body of a hog. The habits of the insects were carefully studied. Therefore the ant was looked upon as emblematic of industry and foresight, as it stored up supplies for the winter and also had strength to move objects many times its own weight. The locusts which swept down in clouds, and in some parts of Africa and Asia obscured the sun and destroyed every green thing, were considered fit emblems of passion, disease, hate, and strife; for these emotions destroy all that is good in the soul of man and leave a barren desert behind them. In the folklore of various nations, certain insects are given special significance, but the ones which have received world-wide veneration and consideration ate the scarab, the king of the insect kingdom; the scorpion, the great betrayer; the butterfly, the emblem of metamorphosis; and the bee, the symbol of industry. The Egyptian scarab is one of the most remarkable symbolic figures ever conceived by the mind of man. It was evolved by the erudition of the priestcraft from a simple insect which, because of its peculiar habits and appearance, properly symbolized the strength of the body, the resurrection of the soul, and the Eternal and Incomprehensible Creator in His aspect as Lord of the Sun. E. A. Wallis Budge says, in effect, of the worship of the scarab by the Egyptians: \"Yet another view held in primitive times was that the sky was a vast meadow over which a huge beetle crawled, pushing the disk of the sun before him. This beetle was the Sky-god, and, arguing from the example of the beetle ( Scarab\u0107us sacer ), which was observed to roll along with its hind legs a ball that was believed to contain its eggs, the early Egyptians thought that the ball of the Sky-god contained his egg and that the sun was his offspring. Thanks, however, to the investigations of the eminent entomologist, Monsieur J. H. Fabre, we now know that the ball which the  Scarab\u0107us sacer  rolls along contains not its eggs, but dung that is to serve as food for its egg, which it lays in a carefully prepared place.\" Initiates of the Egyptian Mysteries were sometimes called scarabs; again, lions and panthers. The scarab was the emissary of the sun, symbolizing light, truth, and regeneration. Stone scarabs, called heart scarabs, about three inches long, were placed in the heart cavity of the dead when that organ was removed to be embalmed separately as part of the process of mummifying. Some maintain that the stone beetles were merely wrapped in the winding cloths at the time of preparing the body for eternal preservation. The following passage concerning this appears in the great Egyptian book of initiation,  The Book of the Dead : \"And behold, thou shalt make a scarab of green stone, which shalt be placed in the breast of a man, and it shall perform for him, 'the opening of the mouth.'\" The funeral rites of many nations bear a striking resemblance to the initiatory ceremonies of their Mysteries. Ra , the god of the sun, had three important aspects. As the Creator of the universe he was symbolized by the head of a scarab and was called  Khepera , which signified the resurrection of the soul and a new life at the end of the mortal span. The mummy cases of the Egyptian dead were nearly always ornamented with scarabs. Usually one of these beetles, with outspread wings, was painted on the mummy case directly over the breast of the dead. The finding of such great numbers of small stone scarabs indicates that they were a favorite article of adornment among the Egyptians. Because of its relationship to the sun, the scarab symbolized the divine part of man's nature. The fact that its beautiful wings were concealed under its glossy shell typified the winged soul of man hidden within its earthly sheath. The Egyptian soldiers were given the scarab as their special symbol because the ancients believed that these creatures were all of the male sex and consequently appropriate emblems of virility, strength, and courage. Plutarch noted the fact that the scarab rolled its peculiar ball of dung backwards, while the insect itself faced the opposite direction. This made it an especially fitting symbol for the sun, because this orb (according to Egyptian astronomy) was rolling from west to east, although apparently moving in the opposite direction. An Egyptian allegory states that the sunrise is caused by the scarab unfolding \n\nTHE MANTICHORA.\n  From Redgrove's  Bygone Beliefs . The most remarkable of allegorical creatures was the  mantichora , which Ctesias describes as having aflame-colored body, lionlike in shape, three rows of teeth, a human head and ears, blue eyes, a tail ending in a series of spikes and stings, thorny and scorpionlike, and a voice which sounded like the blare of trumpets. This synthetic quadruped ambled into medi\u0107val works on natural history, but, though seriously considered, had never been seen, because it inhabited inaccessible regions and consequently was difficult to locate. \n\nROYAL EGYPTIAN SCARAB.\n  From Hall's  Catalogue of Egyptian Scarabs, Etc., in the British Museum . The flat under side of a scarab usually bears an inscription relating to the dynasty during which it was cut. These scarabs were sometimes used as seals. Some were cut from ordinary or precious stones; others were made of clay, baked and glazed. Occasionally the stone scarabs were also glazed. The majority of the small scarabs are pierced as though originally used as beads. Some are so hard that they will cut glass. In the picture above, A shows top and side views of the scarab, and B and B the under surface with the name of Men-ka-Ra within the central cartouche. p. 87 its wings, which stretch out as glorious colors on each side of its body--the solar globe--and that when it folds its wings under its dark shell at sunset, night follows.  Khepera , the scarab-headed aspect of  Ra , is often symbolized riding through the sea of the sky in a wonderful ship called the  Boat of the Sun . The scorpion is the symbol of both wisdom and self-destruction. It was called by the Egyptians the creature accursed; the time of year when the sun entered the sign of Scorpio marked the beginning of the rulership of Typhon. When the twelve signs of the zodiac were used to represent the twelve Apostles (although the reverse is true), the scorpion was assigned to Judas Iscariot--the betrayer. The scorpion stings with its tail, and for this reason it has been called a backbiter, a false and deceitful thing. Calmet, in his  Dictionary of the Bible , declares the scorpion to be a fit emblem of the wicked and the symbol of persecution. The dry winds of Egypt are said to be produced by Typhon, who imparts to the sand the blistering heat of the infernal world and the sting of the scorpion. This insect was also the symbol of the spinal fire which, according to the Egyptian Mysteries, destroyed man when it was permitted to gather at the base of his spine (the tail of the scorpion).The red star  Antares  in the back of the celestial scorpion was considered the worst light in the heavens.  Kalb al Akrab , or the heart of the scorpion, was called by the ancients the lieutenant or deputy of Mars. (See footnote to Ptolemy's  Tetrabiblos .)  Antares  was believed to impair the eyesight, often causing blindness if it rose over the horizon when a child was born. This may refer again to the sand storm, which was capable of blinding unwary travelers. The scorpion was also the symbol of wisdom, for the fire which it controlled was capable of illuminating as well as consuming. Initiation into the Greater Mysteries among the pagans was said to take place only in the sign of the scorpion. In the papyrus of  Ani  ( The Book of the Dead ), the deceased likens his soul to a scorpion, saying: \"I am a swallow, I am that scorpion, the daughter of Ra!\" Elizabeth Goldsmith, in her treatise on  Sex Symbolism , states that the scorpions were a \"symbol of Selk, the Egyptian goddess of writing, and also [were] revered by the Babylonians and Assyrians as guardians of the gateway of the sun. Seven scorpions were said to have accompanied Isis when she searched for the remains of Osiris scattered by Set\" (Typhon). In his  Chaldean Account of the Genesis , George Smith, copying from the cuneiform cylinders, in describing the wanderings of the hero  Izdubar (Nimrod), throws some light on the scorpion god who guards the sun. The tablet which he translated is not perfect, but the meaning is fairly clear: \"* * * who each day guard the rising sun. Their crown was at the lattice of heaven, under hell their feet were placed [the spinal column]. The scorpion man guarded the gate, burning with terribleness, their appearance was like death, the might of his fear shook the forest. At the rising of the sun and the setting of the sun, they guarded the sun; Izdubar saw them and fear and terror came into his face.\" Among the early Latins there was a machine of war called the scorpion. It was used for firing arrows and probably obtained its name from a long beam, resembling a scorpion's tail, which flew up to hurl the arrows. The missiles discharged by this machine were also called scorpions. The butterfly (under the name of  Psyche , a beautiful maiden with wings of opalescent light) symbolizes the human soul because of the stages it passes through in order to unfold its power of flight. The three divisions through which the butterfly passes in its unfoldment resemble closely the three degrees of the Mystery School, which degrees are regarded as consummating the unfoldment of man by giving him emblematic wings by which he may soar to the skies. Unregenerate man, ignorant and helpless, is symbolized by the stage between ovum and larva; the disciple, seeking truth and dwelling in medication, by the second stage, from larva to pupa, at which time the insect enters its chrysalis (the tomb of the Mysteries); the third stage, from pupa to imago (wherein the perfect butterfly comes forth), typifies the unfolded enlightened soul of the initiate rising from the tomb of his baser nature. Night moths typify the secret wisdom, because they are hard to discover and are concealed by the darkness (ignorance). Some are emblems of death, as  Acherontia atropos , the death's-head moth, which has a marking on its body somewhat like a human skull. The death-watch beetle, which was believed to give warning of approaching death by a peculiar ticking sound, is another instance of insects involved in human affairs. Opinions differ concerning the spider. Its shape makes it an appropriate emblem of the nerve plexus and ganglia of the human body. Some Europeans consider it extremely bad luck to kill a spider--possibly because it is looked upon as an emissary of the Evil One, whom no person desires to offend. There is a mystery concerning all poisonous creatures, especially insects. Paracelsus taught that the spider was the medium for a powerful but evil force which the Black Magicians used in their nefarious undertakings. Certain plants, minerals, and animals have been sacred among all the nations of the earth because of their peculiar sensitiveness to the astral fire--a mysterious agency in Nature which the scientific world has contacted through its manifestations as electricity and magnetism. Lodestone and radium in the mineral world and various parasitic growths in the plant kingdom are strangely susceptible to this cosmic electric fire, or universal life force. The magicians of the Middle Ages surrounded themselves with such creatures as bats, spiders, cats, snakes, and monkeys, because they were able to appropriate the life forces of these species and use them to the attainment of their own ends. Some ancient schools of wisdom taught that all poisonous insects and reptiles are germinated out of the evil nature of man, and that when intelligent human beings no longer breed hate in their own souls there will be no more ferocious animals, loathsome diseases, or poisonous plants and insects. Among the American Indians is the legend of a \"Spider Man,\" whose web connected the heaven worlds with the earth. The secret schools of India symbolize certain of the gods who labored with the universe during its making as connecting the realms of light with those of darkness by means of webs. Therefore the builders of the cosmic system who held the embryonic universe together with threads of invisible force were sometimes referred to as the Spider Gods and their ruler was designated The Great Spider. The beehive is found in Masonry as a reminder that in diligence and labor for a common good true happiness and prosperity are found. The bee is a symbol of wisdom, for as this tiny insect collects pollen from the flowers, so men may extract wisdom from the experiences of daily life. The bee is sacred to the goddess Venus and, according to mystics, it is one of several forms of life which came to the earth from the planet Venus millions of years ago. Wheat and bananas are said to be of similar origin. This is the reason why the origin of these three forms of life cannot be traced. The fact that bees are ruled by queens is one reason why this insect is considered a sacred feminine symbol. In India the god Prana--the personification of the universal life force--is sometimes shown surrounded by a circle of bees. Because of its importance in pollenizing flowers, the bee is the accepted symbol of the generative power. At one time the bee was the emblem of the French kings. The rulers of France wore robes embroidered with bees, and the canopies of their thrones were decorated with gigantic figures of these insects. The fly symbolizes the tormentor, because of the annoyance it causes to animals. The Chaldean god Baal was often called Baal-Zebul, or the god of the dwelling place. The word  zebub , or  zabab , means a fly, and Baal-Zebul became Baalzebub, or Beelzebub, a word which was loosely translated to mean Jupiter's fly. The fly was looked upon as a form of the divine power, because of its ability to destroy decaying substances and thus promote health. The fly may have obtained its name Zebub from its peculiar buzzing or humming. Inman believes that Baalzebub, which the Jews ridiculed as My Lord of Flies, really means My Lord Who Hums or Murmurs. Inman recalls the singing Memnon on the Egyptian desert, a tremendous figure with an \u0106olian harp on the top of its head. When the wind blows strongly this great Statue sighs, or hums. The Jews changed Baalzebub into Beelzebub, and made him their prince of devils by interpreting  d\u0107mon as \"demon.\" Naud\u0107us, in defending Virgil from accusations of sorcery, attempted a wholesale denial of the miracles supposedly performed by Virgil and produced enough evidence to convict the poet on all counts. Among other strange fears, Virgil fashioned a fly out of brass, and after certain mysterious ceremonies, placed it over one of the gates of Naples. As a result, no flies entered the city for more than eight years. REPTILES The serpent was chosen as the head of the reptilian family. Serpent worship in some form has permeated nearly all parts of the \n\nTHE FLEUR-DE-LIS.\n  The bee was used as, a symbol of royalty by the immortal Charlemagne, and it is probable that the fleur-de-lis, or lily of France, is merely a conventionalized bee and not a flower. There is an ancient Greek legend to the effect that the nine Muses occasionally assumed the form of bees. \nTHE SCORPION TALISMAN.\n  From Paracelsus'  Archidoxes Magica . The scorpion often appears upon the talismans and charms of the Middle Ages. This hieroglyphic  Arachnida  was supposed to have the power of curing disease. The scorpion shown above was composed of several metals, and was made under certain planetary configurations. Paracelsus advised that it be worn by those suffering from any derangement of the reproductive system. p. 88 earth. The serpent mounds of the American Indian; the carved-stone snakes of Central and South America; the hooded cobras of India; Python, the great snake o the Greeks; the sacred serpents of the Druids; the Midgard snake of Scandinavia; the Nagas of Burma, Siam, and Cambodia; the brazen serpent of the Jews; the mystic serpent of Orpheus; the snakes at the oracle; of Delphi twining themselves around the tripod upon which the Pythian priestess sat, the tripod itself being in the form of twisted serpents; the sacred serpents preserved in the Egyptian temples; the Ur\u0107us coiled upon the foreheads of the Pharaohs and priests;--all these bear witness to the universal veneration in which the snake was held. In the ancient Mysteries the serpent entwining a staff was the symbol of the physician. The serpent-wound staff of Hermes remains the emblem of the medical profession. Among nearly all these ancient peoples the serpent was accepted as the symbol of wisdom or salvation. The antipathy which Christendom feels towards the snake is based upon the little-understood allegory of the Garden of Eden. The serpent is true to the principle of wisdom, for it tempts man to the knowledge of himself. Therefore the knowledge of self resulted from man's disobedience to the  Demiurgus , Jehovah. How the serpent came to be in the garden of the Lord after God had declared that all creatures which He had made during the six days of creation were good has not been satisfactorily answered by the interpreters of Scripture. The tree that grows in the midst of the garden is the spinal fire; the knowledge of the use of that spinal fire is the gift of the great serpent. Notwithstanding statements to the contrary, the serpent is the symbol and prototype of the Universal Savior, who redeems the worlds by giving creation the knowledge of itself and the realization of good and evil. If this be not so, why did Moses raise a brazen serpent upon a cross in the wilderness that all who looked upon it might be saved from the sting of the lesser snakes? Was not the brazen serpent a prophecy of the crucified Man to come? If the serpent be only a thing of evil, why did Christ instruct His disciples to be as wise as serpents? The accepted theory that the serpent is evil cannot be substantiated. It has long been viewed as the emblem of immortality. It is the symbol of reincarnation, or metempsychosis, because it annually sheds its skin, reappearing, as it were, in a new body. There is an ancient superstition to the effect that snakes never die except by violence and that, if uninjured, they would live forever. It was also believed that snakes swallowed themselves, and this resulted in their being considered emblematic of the Supreme Creator, who periodically reabsorbed His universe back into Himself. In  Isis Unveiled , H. P. Blavatsky makes this significant statement concerning the origin of serpent worship: \"Before our globe had become egg-shaped or round it was a long trail of cosmic dust or fire-mist, moving and writhing like a serpent. This, say the explanations, was the Spirit of God moving on the chaos until its breath had incubated cosmic matter and made it assume the annular shape of a serpent with its tail in its month--emblem of eternity in its spiritual and of our world in its physical sense.\" The seven-headed snake represents the Supreme Deity manifesting through His Elohim, or Seven Spirits, by whose aid He established His universe. The coils of the snake have been used by the pagans to symbolize the motion and also the orbits of the celestial bodies, and it is probable that the symbol of the serpent twisted around the egg--which was common to many of the ancient Mystery schools--represented both the apparent motion of the sun around the earth, and the bands of astral light, or the great magical agent, which move about the planet incessantly. Electricity was commonly symbolized by the serpent because of its motion. Electricity passing between the poles of a spark gap is serpentine in its motion. Force projected through atmosphere was called The Great Snake. Being symbolic of universal force, the serpent was emblematic of both good and evil. Force can tear down as rapidly as it can build up. The serpent with its tail in its mouth is the symbol of eternity, for in this position the body of the reptile has neither beginning nor end. The head and tail represent the positive and negative poles of the cosmic life circuit. The initiates of the Mysteries were often referred to as serpents, and their wisdom was considered analogous to the divinely inspired power of the snake. There is no doubt that the title \"Winged Serpents\" (the Seraphim?) was given to one of the invisible hierarchies that labored with the earth during its early formation. There is a legend that in the beginning of the world winged serpents reigned upon the earth. These were probably the demigods which antedate the historical civilization of every nation. The symbolic relationship between the sun and the serpent found literal witness in the fact that life remains in the snake until sunset, even though it be cut into a dozen parts. The Hopi Indians consider the serpent to be in close communication with the Earth Spirit. Therefore, at the time of their annual snake dance they send their prayers to the Earth Spirit by first specially sanctifying large numbers of these reptiles and then liberating them to return to the earth with the prayers of the tribe. The great rapidity of motion manifested by lizards has caused them to be associated with Mercury, the Messenger of the Gods, whose winged feet traveled infinite distances almost instantaneously. A point which must not be overlooked in connection with reptiles in symbolism is clearly brought out by the eminent scholar, Dr. H. E. Santee, in his  Anatomy of the Brain and Spinal Cord : \"In reptiles there are two pineal bodies, an anterior and a posterior, of which the posterior remains undeveloped but the anterior forms a rudimentary, cyclopean eye. In the Hatteria, a New Zealand lizard, it projects through the parietal foramen and presents an imperfect lens and retina and, in its long stalk, nerve fibers.\" Crocodiles were regarded by the Egyptians both as symbols of Typhon and emblems of the Supreme Deity, of the latter because while under water the crocodile is capable of seeing--Plutarch asserts--though its eyes are covered by a thin membrane. The Egyptians declared that no matter how far away the crocodile laid its eggs, the Nile would reach up to them in its next inundation, this reptile being endowed with a mysterious sense capable of making known the extent of the flood months before it took place. There were two kinds of crocodiles. The larger and more ferocious was hated by the Egyptians, for they likened it to the nature of Typhon, their destroying demon. Typhon waited to devour all who failed to pass the judgment of the Dead, which rite took place in the Hall of Justice between the earth and the Elysian Fields. Anthony Todd Thomson thus describes the good treatment accorded the smaller and tamer crocodiles, which the Egyptians accepted as personifications of good: \"They were fed daily and occasionally had mulled wine poured down their throats. Their ears were ornamented with rings of gold and precious stones, and their forefeet adorned with bracelets.\" To the Chinese the turtle was a symbol of longevity. At a temple in Singapore a number of sacred turtles are kept, their age recorded by carvings on their shells. The American Indians use the ridge down the back of the turtle shell as a symbol of the Great Divide between life and death. The turtle is a symbol of wisdom because it retires into itself and is its own protection. It is also a phallic symbol, as its relation to long life would signify. The Hindus symbolized the universe as being supported on the backs of four great elephants who, in turn, are standing upon an immense turtle which is crawling continually through chaos. The Egyptian sphinx, the Greek centaur, and the Assyrian man-bull have much in common. All are composite creatures combining human and animal members; in the Mysteries all signify the composite nature of man and subtly refer to the hierarchies of celestial beings that have charge of the destiny of mankind. These hierarchies are the  twelve holy animals  now known as constellations--star groups which are merely symbols of impersonal spiritual impulses. Chiron, the centaur, teaching the sons of men, symbolizes the intelligences of the constellation of Sagittarius, who were the custodians of the secret doctrine while (geocentrically) the sun was passing through the sign of Gemini. The five-footed Assyrian man-bull with the wings of an eagle and the head of a man is a reminder that the invisible nature of man has the wings of a god, the head of a man, and the body of a beast. The same concept was expressed through the sphinx--that armed guardian of the Mysteries who, crouching at the gate of the temple, denied entrance to the profane. Thus placed between man and his divine possibilities, the sphinx also represented the secret doctrine itself. Children's fairy stories abound with descriptions of symbolic monsters, for nearly all such tales are based upon the ancient mystic folklore. \n\nTHE UR\u0106US.\n  From Kircher's  \u015adipus \u0106gyptiacus . The spinal cord was symbolized by a snake, and the serpent coiled upon the foreheads of the Egyptian initiates represented the Divine Fire which had crawled serpentlike up the Tree of Life. \n\nGOOD AND EVIL CONTENDING FOR THE UNIVERSAL EGG.\n  From Maurice's  Indian Antiquities . Both Mithras, the Persian Redeemer, and Serapis, the Egyptian God of the Earth, are symbolized by serpents coiled about their bodies. This remarkable drawing shows the good and evil principles of Persia--Ahura-Mazda and Ahriman--contending for the Egg of the Earth, which each trying to wrench from the teeth of the other.

The greenback had slipped against the safe-haven Japanese currency on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he would recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel -- a move that imperiled Middle East peace efforts and provoked widespread condemnation.\nBut as global stock prices rebounded on Thursday, investors bought back into the U.S. currency, which was trading up 0.3 percent on the day at 112.60 yen <JPY=>. \nAgainst a basket of six major currencies, the dollar hit a two-week high <.DXY>.\nU.S. Senate Republicans agreed to talks with the House of Representatives on sweeping tax legislation on Wednesday, amid early signs that lawmakers could bridge their differences and agree on a final bill ahead of a self-imposed Dec. 22 deadline. \n\"The dollar is fighting back a little bit but there\u2019s still some caution, as it could still be a few weeks until we know the outcome of the tax reform bill,\" said Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley, in London. \n\"The yen will be sensitive if geopolitical tensions rise again, and I think there\u2019s an inevitability to that, so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be too much upside for dollar/yen in this environment,\" she added. \nUpbeat U.S. private-sector employment data released on Wednesday also provided some support to the dollar.

Today we learn more about this mysterious new iPhone. \n6.1-inch iPhone gets metal back' September 2018 is still far away, but Apple has been busy with the successors of the iPhone 8and iPhone X . Besides a premium iPhone 2018 and an iPhone X Plus, a third model appears on the market in the same period. \nThis should be the 'budget device' that targets the consumer who does not want to pay 1100 euros for an iPhone. 'Budget' is here deliberately in quotation marks, because as it looks now, Apple is aiming at the same price as the iPhone 8 with this device. KGI analyst Ming Chi-Kuo recently gave the first info about this device price: although the device at first glance looks like an iPhone X, there are some concessions here and there to keep the price lower. For example, the device does not use an OLED display but an LCD screen, and there would be a metal instead of a glass back. Especially the latter is striking, because Apple this year from aluminum stepped down to make wireless charging possible. Does the return to aluminum mean that this 6.1-inch iPhone can only be refilled with a Lightning cable? More colors, less premium Nikkei writes that the aluminum back has a plus: Apple is therefore able to release the device in many more different types of colors. A difference with the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, which only came in three and two different colors on the market. \nIf the two rumors (of the usually well-informed parties) are correct, then next autumn you have the choice of three iPhones: an iPhone X successor with a 5.8-inch display, an iPhone X Plus with a 6.5-inch screen and a budget version with 6.1-inch LCD screen and metal back. But before this happens, the iPhone SE 2 will first appear in early 2018 . Also in 2018 there seems to be more than enough to choose if you are looking for a new iPhone.
