Leading players such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Novartis are expected to make bold moves during the forecast period of 2017 and 2025. Increasing investments in research and development and growing number of medical trials are expected to have to intensify the competition in the global market. Mergers and acquisitions are also anticipated to be a key strategy of the players to show their dominance in the global market. For instance, AstraZeneca and Recordati have agreed to work together to gain commercial rights to retail Seloken along with related Logimax fixed-dose combination treatments all across Europe.Read Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/cardiovascular-drugs-m... According to the research report, the global cardiovascular drugs market was valued at US$ 142.56 bn in 2016. Between the forecast period of 2017 and 2025, the global market is expected to register a CAGR of 1.5% to reach a valuation of US$162.96 bn by the end of 2025. Out of the various distribution channels in the global market, the retail pharmacies segment is estimated to soar ahead of others. This segment is projected to exhibit a CAGR of 1.5% between 2017 and 2025. Geographically, North America is projected to stay ahead of others in the overall market in the forecast period.The World Health Organization stated that about 31% of the deaths across the world in 2015 were due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Analysts anticipate that CVD related to the heart and blood are expected to remain on the rise in the coming years. Changing lifestyles, poor dietary intake, and genetic predisposition are expected to increase the demand for cardiovascular drugs in the near future. Poor lifestyle choices such as excessive drinking, smoking, and eating junk food have deteriorated heart health of a vast population base across the globe. Furthermore, conditions such as diabetes, high cholesterol, depression, and obesity have also played a significant role in spiking the demand for cardiovascular drugs all over the world.Statistics presented by America Heart Foundation state that the number of people suffering from CVD are likely to reach 23.6 mn by the end of 2030. The alarming rise in the number is expected to increase the sale of cardiovascular drugs in the near future. Analysts predict that majority of the CVD patients have to be administered medicines for a long-term basis, which requires close monitoring. Growing number of drugs in the pipeline, improving approval rates, and better awareness about CVDs, especially in developing economies, has also had a major impact on the overall market. The surge in geriatric population and soaring number of diabetics around the world have also been identified as the key factors that will be responsible for the rise of this global market.Patent Expiries to Challenge Cardiovascular Drugs Market GrowthDespite the strong market drivers, the global cardiovascular drugs market faces some tough restraints. Currently, patent expiries is likely to hamper market\u2019s growth. This will not only open up the market for generics but also bring down prices as competition intensifies. Furthermore, the poor rate of healthcare sector\u2019s growth in the developing economies of Asia Pacific is anticipated to challenge the global market.Request Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag...

'How could any of these accounts of the Franciscan pontificate be true!? Look! He's so cuddly and fluffy!'\n\nQuite honestly, I don't know what I find more distressing - the picture of the character of Jorge Mario Bergoglio that emerges from within the pages that I have read of 'The Dictator Pope', or the race by the Vatican's PR men to close ranks and protect the image of \"Juan Per\u00f3n in ecclesiastical translation\u201d.\n\nWhat is more distressing and destructive? A Pope who runs the Vatican like a mafia boss or a Vatican inner court that has no interest in allegations of corruption and manipulation and that continues saying that everything in the garden is rosy when it knows that everything in the garden has been ravaged by beasts?\n\n\nThe above picture shows that the communication organs of the Vatican are now behaving like Soviet propaganda arms and little more, but then we have been used to this for five years.

Picture: Brian Lawless/PA Wire 07 December, 2017 09:05 John Manley: Border-shy Brexit secretary needs to redeem himself fast \nTHERESA MAY is preparing to make a fresh Brexit offer on the border by tomorrow to try and break the logjam in negotiations. \nThe move comes amid warnings by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that she may have to wait until the new year for trade talks. With the clock ticking to the December 14 summit of the European Council which must decide whether sufficient progress has been made on the UK\u2019s divorce deal to clear the way for talks on the future relationship, there was no sign of a breakthrough on the crucial issue of the border. \nMr Varadkar\u2019s office characterised a phone-call yesterday with Mrs May as a \u201cstock-taking\u201d exercise . Later he made clear he would not back down on his position that Dublin\u2019s approval for the opening of the second phase of talks is dependent on agreement on the border. But he said he discussed with the British prime minister the idea of Britain amending its offer to win over the DUP which scuppered a proposed deal on Monday. \nWith Mrs May under intense pressure from business for certainty by Christmas over the transition to a new UK/EU relationship, Mr Varadkar said she is hoping to return with a new formal written offer \u201ctonight and tomorrow\u201d. \nThe taoiseach said he would consider any new proposal, but added: \u201cUltimately it is up to them to come back to us, given the events that happened on Monday. \u201cAnd having consulted with people in London, she wants to come back to us with some text tonight and tomorrow.\u201d \nEarlier DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds warned Mr Varadkar that any delays increase the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Dodds hit out at Mr Varadkar\u2019s comments that phase-two talks might not happen until January claiming the taoiseach was \u201cplaying a dangerous game\u201d with the Republic\u2019s own economy. \nDowning Street said Mrs May, left, told Mr Varadkar she was \u201cworking hard to find a specific solution to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland\u201d and was committed to \u201cmoving together to achieve a positive result on this\u201d. \nThe prime minister also spoke by phone with DUP leader Arlene Foster , whose rejection of plans for \u201cregulatory alignment\u201d between Northern Ireland and the Republic led to the collapse of a proposed deal on Monday. It is understood Mrs Foster has no immediate plans to fly to London for talks with Mrs May and any such move would depend on progress in talks. \nA DUP spokesman said: \u201cThere is still plenty of work to be done. \u201cThe [government and DUP] teams in London are continuing to work through the detail.\u201d Enjoy reading the Irish News? \nBecome a subscriber and get full access ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "an taoiseach leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel dodds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john manley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian lawless/pa wire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mr varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arlene foster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taoiseach leo varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dodds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varadkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs foster", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european council", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:22.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "84ef4d10643e11211514837e221e94023bbdcf9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPmZ4nUtBCmaxh8yWm9DZMje7H4.kFq4Y_193UrinRZZdDLKSFW0J2Oy4w8j6FW3e7FC0BwspTL8OQ78f4rCa1", "site_full": "scmaigle.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://scmaigle.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Mise \u00e0 jour d\u00e9cembre 2017 \u2013 SCM de L'Aigle \u2013 blog des anesth\u00e9sistes du GHM", "title": "Mise \u00e0 jour d\u00e9cembre 2017", "title_full": "Mise \u00e0 jour d\u00e9cembre 2017", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "84ef4d10643e11211514837e221e94023bbdcf9b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQPmZ4nUtBCmaxh8yWm9DZMje7H4.kFq4Y_193UrinRZZdDLKSFW0J2Oy4w8j6FW3e7FC0BwspTL8OQ78f4rCa1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "scmaigle", "published": "2017-12-07T11:08:00.000+02:00", "title": "Mise \u00e0 jour d\u00e9cembre 2017", "text": "MAJ DEC 2017 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:22.010+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d28cf005cfcc6dcff68d8f6787f6858f184e1dfd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS6cSLCWZnourULcYQZ613g3vBkQs8_CTy28SHaVBeW4qaMhE6fmYzob59h9GoBr6g-", "site_full": "www.masaladesi.com", "site": "masaladesi.com", "site_section": "https://www.masaladesi.com/forumdisplay.php?f=1", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult", "illegal_content"], "section_title": "Main -

Almost each leading player is based outside the region and functions in the region with the help of distribution arrangements. A latest report by Transparency Market Research titled, \u201cDefibrillators Market - Middle East and Africa Industry Analysis, Size, Volume, Share, Growth, Trends and Forecast 2014 \u2013 2020,\u201dtalks about the dynamic and fast-growing structure of the Middle East and Africa defibrillators market and offers a statistically driven market forecasts. Most of the leading companies in the global defibrillators market are eager to take advantage of the untapped market space in the Middle East and Africa by forming distribution agreements in the region, setting up local subsidiary, or establishing their own distribution network. The key players in the market mentioned are Welch Allyn Inc., Nihon Kohden Corporation, Schiller AG, HeastSine Technologies Inc., Physio-Control Inc., Zoll Medical Corporation, and Phillips Healthcare.The MEA defibrillator is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.60% between the aforementioned forecast period. The overall valuation of the defibrillator market in the Middle East and Africa is estimated to reach the valuation of US$547.8 mn by the fall of 2020 according to the report.Read Report overview @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/middle-east-africa-def... Voice Assistance in Regional Language and Other Features to Keep MEA Defibrillator Growth on TrackThe report mentions that the Middle East and Africa defibrillators market is mainly driven by the increasing number of patients with chronic heart issues, especially the elderly population. The market of defibrillator in the MEA pertains to the sudden occurrence of cardiac arrest, the scenario in which the defibrillator is used. It functions by sending electric shocks \u2013 anywhere between 40 Joules to 400 Joules \u2013 across its surface, which checks cardiac arrhythmia and reinstates normal heartbeat. According to report, growing number of cases of sudden cardiac attacks in the Middle East and Africa are contributing significantly to the defibrillator market.The defibrillator market in the Middle East and Africa is segmented further by major nations in the region such as United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Egypt, Algeria, and South Africa. In the recent past, the Middle East region was dominated by Saudi Arabia and UAE while the African market was led by South Africa. Overall improvements in the infrastructure of healthcare in these nations combined with rising awareness about the use of defibrillators at the time of cardiac arrests have boosted the demand for defibrillators. Qatar and Saudi Arabia are the fastest developing markets for defibrillators in the Middle East. Request Sample Report@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... The growth of the MEA defibrillator market is hampered mainly due to lack of significant customer base that is fluent in English. Due to majority of non-English speaking residents in the MEA region, the international companies in the global defibrillator market have found it hard to enter the MEA defibrillator market. However, these barriers are being presently mitigated with the help of voice assistance in regional languages, guidance for CPR, and other default features. These features in the modern instruments are expected to help the MEA defibrillator market to maintain its growth at a current rate.Increasing Awareness about Treating Cardiac Arrests with AED to Proper Growth of SegmentThe report mentions that the defibrillator market in the Middle East and Africa was dominated by advanced life support in the product type segmentation. However, it is expected that the automated external defibrillator (AED) segment will showcase the fastest growth rate in the mentioned forecast period.

like that is possible right now. They just want to come to an agreement with Turkey and unify the island.That's their priority. But with Erdogan and his absurd demands during the last negotiations I don't think that unification will be achieved in the near future. As for the \"cypriot identity\" I'm seeing it mostly on the internet being promoted by: some far-left greek-cypriots (no borders, turkish-cypriots are our brothers, we are not greeks,our cultures are different etc), some turkish-cypriots that are saying the same thing only in this case they're saying that they're not Turks, some cypriots from UK(that were born and raised there), some british, that for unknown reasons, think it's up to them to decide how cypriots should identify themselves.\n\"If for example Crete was kept outside the Greek state by Britain, they'd probably also not wish for enosis anymore 100 years later.\"\nNot really.When it comes to cretans, it took them 81 years and they fought really hard for it...While other regions, had to wait even more.

So the system used your local time zone to convert components to a date.\nThe playground system used your local time zone to convert newDate to the string \u201cJan 1, 1 at 7:00 AM\u201d. (The playground system has special-case code for displaying Date objects. The special-case code uses your local time zone.)\nThe print function used the UTC time zone to convert newDate to the string \u201c0001-01-01 11:56:02 +0000\u201d. (The print function uses the CustomStringConvertible protocol. Date 's CustomStringConvertible implementation uses the UTC time zone.)\nI deduce that your local time zone is US/Eastern time, also known as America/New_York :\nimport Foundation var calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian) let components = NSDateComponents() components.hour = 7 components.minute = 0 for timeZoneIdentifier in TimeZone.knownTimeZoneIdentifiers { calendar.timeZone = TimeZone(identifier: timeZoneIdentifier)! let date = calendar.date(from: components as DateComponents)! let dateString = \"\\(date)\" if dateString == \"0001-01-01 11:56:02 +0000\" { print(\"\\(timeZoneIdentifier) \\(date)\") } } // Only one line of output: America/New_York 0001-01-01 11:56:02 +0000\nSo why the weird minutes and seconds in UTC? Because at noon on November 18, 1883, the US and Canada railway companies began using a new, standard time system , which is the time system we still use today. Observe:\nimport Foundation let formatter = ISO8601DateFormatter() var calendar = Calendar(identifier: .gregorian) calendar.timeZone = TimeZone(identifier: \"America/New_York\")! let components = NSDateComponents() components.year = 1883 components.month = 11 components.day = 18 components.hour = 11 print(formatter.string(from: calendar.date(from: components as DateComponents)!)) // prints 1883-11-18T15:56:02Z components.hour = 12 print(formatter.string(from: calendar.date(from: components as DateComponents)!)) // prints 1883-11-18T17:00:00Z\nPrior to noon, the difference from UTC time is 4:56:02.\nBefore the advent of standard railway time, we typically defined local time based on local apparent noon (the moment when the sun is highest in the sky and shadows point exactly north or south or disappear entirely if the sun is directly overhead).\nIf we look at the definition of America/New_York in the tz Time Zone Database , we find this:\n# From Paul Eggert (2014-09-06): # Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society 44, 4 (1884-02-08), 208 # says that New York City Hall time was 3 minutes 58.4 seconds fast of # Eastern time (i.e., -4:56:01.6) just before the 1883 switch. Round to the # nearest second.\nand a bit further down:\nZone America/New_York -4:56:02 - LMT 1883 Nov 18 12:03:58\nThis explains the difference we see above prior to noon on November 18, 1883.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:24.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "0a3ea21070134bb16dc19058a110238a9ee34224", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.jKREfozTM_hRB8gBzdL8gKWA.P92Y1N6iyiplzamunu25ljUR3869qs.p_cYvRbXmW8T1ONy9BlJ0pmbp3w2OdFJOXicnCsY-", "site_full": "www.aruwaab9ja.com", "site": "aruwaab9ja.com", "site_section": "http://www.aruwaab9ja.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Aruwa_Ab 9ja", "title": "Another One from Aruwaab9ja: Hot latest Ankara short gowns Styles for 2018.", "title_full": "Another One from Aruwaab9ja: Hot latest Ankara short gowns Styles for 2018.", "published": "2017-12-07T10:27:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZJLtNIdbmkzKJyLyYV4cBUhi3QNpcTVuOuyG-hXYFLGYl6D1Df0eSOz-Fq684EPogtO-7wRbeH2X2rUkt0_TOAahko-5n0Ybi2uVfs_qPKYPl77zWa51I2O572Wax8eCmCVAPo99RHJeAJt-m4ElDAIczWkFDCGTF7Yhxxl2ttVYV9BuLRRBgA=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0a3ea21070134bb16dc19058a110238a9ee34224", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.jKREfozTM_hRB8gBzdL8gKWA.P92Y1N6iyiplzamunu25ljUR3869qs.p_cYvRbXmW8T1ONy9BlJ0pmbp3w2OdFJOXicnCsY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "noreply@blogger.com (Aruwa Abubakar)", "published": "2017-12-07T10:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "Another One from Aruwaab9ja: Hot latest Ankara short gowns Styles for 2018.", "text": "Another One from Aruwaab9ja: Hot latest Ankara short gowns Styles for 2018.

Anders \n\nEDMS better known as Electronic Document Management System software assist in storing and organizing documents. The system can be used when handling both digital and paper documents which in some instances have to be scanned. Businesses are therefore able to centrally store huge volumes of documents and retrieve them with ease. Here are a few concrete benefits of using EDMS software.\n\nMost companies will have a problem with controlling document versions. Fortunately, the EDMS program comes with an installed version control feature. This makes it easy for one to access the history of a document and reduce the chances of creating unneeded duplicates. You will also dodge the laborious task of analyzing document versioning manually.\n\nEDMS systems also enable easy collaboration. In the present business world, it is common for organizations to have multiple partnerships and even outsource their work from time to time. The platforms within your software would make a common area that can enhance both internal and external collaborations. Users can quickly comprehend different processes such as authoring, approvals and even reviews.\n\nDocument management processes are better off when handled automatically. This improves timelines, especially when dealing with operations that are time sensitive. Instead of doing things manually, your systems would push documents in an automated manner through their lifecycles. This eliminates bottlenecks by facilitating improved inspections as well as submission readiness.\n\nIrrespective of your kind of operations, there is a good chance that data control and security is not a subject you can afford to gamble with. This will be more so the case if you happen to handle sensitive data. Shared systems pose challenges, but the EDMS platforms have matters of security covered. It contains special features that make it possible for sensitive data to be traced and trailed. You will also be in the know of who has custody of your delicate data.\n\nIn case your operations commonly involve retrieving of data from time back, then the importance of having strong backup solutions cannot be underestimated. Unfortunately, traditional practices that revolve around document management only encourage saving of files in shared areas and computers. With your system, your documents will all be centralized. It will therefore not be a hassle for you to properly backup your files in a manner that you can retrieve them with ease in the future.\n\nCost is a major aspect that has to be considered when running various business operations. Using automated systems lowers the costs of archiving and managing documents. You will not have to hire an in-house employee to assist with manual management and it will be easier for you to ensure reliable record retention. It also goes without saying that physical space for storing paper records will not be needed.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nLoris F. Anders is an office management specialist focused on optimizing workflow processes in document management.
