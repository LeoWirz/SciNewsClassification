The challenging situation we are faced with calls upon us to make a fundamental shift and start doing differently this year,\u201d said Minister Maswanganyi. \nREAD MORE: WATCH: Traffic officers eat money \u2013 literally \nThis radical shift will be achieved by ensuring that traffic officers come out of the bushes and crack down on drunken driving as a leading contributor to traffic violations that cause unnecessary crashes and fatalities. \nOn Tuesday, Minister Maswanganyi unveiled this plan at the launch of festive season campaign in Bela-Bela township, in Limpopo. The minister was flanked by his Deputy Minister Sindidiwe Chikunga, transport acting director-general Mathabatha Mokonyama and Limpopo transport MEC Makoma Makhurupetje. \nAccording to MEC Makhurupetje, Bela-Bela was strategically chosen for the launch as it serves as the gateway to Limpopo tourism and offers access to the borders of neighbouring African countries. \nThis results in extreme traffic volumes in the province. \nThe department said its plan to deviate from the outdated hide and seek method will see it nab more people who violate the rules of the road. Motorists can expect to see uniformed officers patrol freeways, streets and public places in clearly marked vehicles which is deemed as the best means available for the prevention of road traffic violations. \n\u201cIn a few days, many employed citizens of our country will receive their pay bonuses and this will undoubtedly set off a chain reaction of alcohol drinking spree that will lead to the loss of lives on our roads. \n\u201cThis includes the voluminous scheduled travel for leisure and attendance of religious pilgrimages which as well have the capacity to increase road carnages,\u201d said the minister. \nThe department anticipates that the weekend leading to December 16 and the extended Christmas long weekend, as well as the New Year\u2019s Day long week will be particularly challenging and taxing on traffic law enforcement officers. \nHowever, the transport department says it is equal to the task and will implement the 24-hour shift for traffic officers this year. \n\u201cI call on all road users to not drink and drive, text and drive, reduce your speed, buckle up and beware of pedestrians,\u201d said the minister. \nHe said these are human factors that can easily be avoided. \nIf adhered to and implemented, they will lead to a decline of deaths and injuries on South African roads. \n\u201cLet there be no tolerance for drunken driving, speeding, reckless and negligent driving and all forms of lawlessness on the roads,\u201d said the Minister.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mathabatha mokonyama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bela-bela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "makoma makhurupetje", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sindidiwe chikunga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maswanganyi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "transport department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid south coast rising sun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mec makhurupetje", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bela-bela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "limpopo", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:43.005+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8a8b558b081d3b7ae31239a5f490bcd390281631", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/7aBdisT0NOpWuDDK9UX9VSE.Bjxy0l_6fEuilafWk1MJRHOuwYEb9j_f62I45Rjm12S.JA1ieq0-", "site_full": "sagamer.co.za", "site": "sagamer.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.4x4community.co.za/forum/forumdisplay.php/243-PS3ZA-South-African-Gaming-Community", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "SA Gamer -

How many times over the last few years have we heard claims that Johan Ackermann might be the head coach of the Lions, but that his loyal assistant Swys de Bruin is the real brains behind the dizzy heights Joburg\u2019s Pride have grown accustomed to? \nWell, there was really only one way of ever finding out and that was if the two went their merry ways, which was the case after Super Rugby. \nAckermann took over the reins at English Premiership outfit Gloucester and De Bruin was given the Lions\u2019 reins with the Currie Cup his first assignment. \nFast forward three months and the duo\u2019s individual paths make quite interesting analysis. \nApart from a very short stint at Northampton during his playing days, Ackers embarked on a journey into the unknown when he set sail for England. \nHis son Ruan was the only familiar face he was surrounded by, as he had no coaching track record with the club\u2019s squad members and had to accept the assistants given to him. \nAfter a mere 10 matches, Ackermann\u2019s charges are up to second on the log and only trail Exeter. \nA mammoth effort from a team that has been very mediocre in recent years, finishing no higher than 8th over the previous three seasons. \nBack in Joburg, De Bruin had a much smoother ride continuing his time at Ellis Park without his long-time confidant. \nHe did have the tough task of juggling between the Super Rugby play-offs and the start of the Currie Cup campaign and then had to keep the players motivated after failing the capture the Super Rugby title. \nTo his credit, his side did gain some momentum in the latter stages of the Currie Cup, but the tactical mess in which they subdued to eventual champions Western Province in the semifinals at Newlands is a serious blotch behind his name. \nWe might never know exactly whose call it was to try and play cat and mouse with their front row selection \u2013 with forwards coach Victor Matfield the other possible culprit \u2013 but it happened under De Bruin\u2019s watch nonetheless and that has got to be worrying for any Lions fan. \nIf you have Malcolm Marx, who has without a doubt staked his claim as the world\u2019s best hooker this year, at your disposal flanked by the two props who made up one of the best Super Rugby front rows in 2017, why do you have to play silly little tricks? \nPicking them in the original starting team, only to leave them on the bench at kickoff and then send them on after 30 minutes backfired badly. \nA team boasting a host of Super Rugby final starters doesn\u2019t need little sideshows to show their class, especially in a lesser competition. \nLook, it is harsh to judge De Bruin by one horrendous tactical mishap and unfair on Ackermann to make him out as a messiah purely on Gloucester\u2019s current form. \nThe reality is that De Bruin could still win the Super Rugby title and Ackermann\u2019s charges might not even reach the Premiership play-offs. \nBut during their time together, could it be that Ackermann was underrated and De Bruin overrated?

You\u2019re there pretty much every day, presumably. You don\u2019t have think about finding the right floor, finding your office, or finding the restrooms. But your customers and clients may not know these things. They need signs to point them in the right direction . \nThink of all the times that you entered a new and unfamiliar building. Maybe the first time you went to a DMV, or a doctor\u2019s office. It can be intimidating. Especially for shy or inexperienced people. And this especially true of people coming to your business for the first time. Do you really want to lose potential customers because they can\u2019t find their way around your business? Because there was nobody to ask or because they didn\u2019t feel comfortable asking? Of course not. That\u2019s why you need to do the best job you can with wayfinding signage to ensure you don\u2019t lose any shy or confused customers. Wayfinding signage \nThe purpose of wayfinding signage is to get a visitor from where they are to where they need to be (to help them find their way) with the least amount of stress possible. Wayfinding signs do not need to attract attention in the same way that safety signs do. And they don\u2019t need to be pieces of art the way murals or lobby signage can or should be. It is perfectly acceptable for wayfinding signs to blend with the d\u00e9cor, to be unobtrusive, and to be a part of the whole. Wayfinding systems \nAn effective wayfinding system is based on human behavior and should consist of the following characteristics: Do not make people think too much. Create a comprehensive, clear, and consistent visual communication system with concise messaging. Show only what is needed. Show information that relevant is to the space, location, and/or navigation path. Remove any excessive information. Remove unnecessary elements to create a clear visual environment ahead. Use landmarks \nAnother important idea to factor into wayfinding signage is how to use landmarks to enhance your message. You can use landmarks to help your potential customers and clients to more easily remember or notice the path which they are on and the destination to which they are going. Try to use elements that become more visible in human memory. We\u2019re talking art objects, buildings, any striking elements in a landscape that will stand out along a visitor\u2019s way. Orientation \nUltimately, you are trying to avoid visitors getting disoriented. If they get disoriented they might not be able to find where they need to go, become frustrated, and leave. So what\u2019s the best way to get people oriented? Well, maps, of course. But not everybody is a cartographer; maps can be really tricky to read for some people who just have trouble finding where they are on a map, let alone where they want to go. That is why it is best when utilizing a map to orient a visitor to display the map heads-up in the direction you are facing. Don\u2019t make them guess at where they are or the floorplan of your business.

Using a longer focal length lens like the 135mm will also create beautiful snow bokeh. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nThe holiday season is a magical time of year. Seeing the wonder and excitement in my children\u2019s eyes has made me realize that more than ever. They have helped me slow down and appreciate the little things. Growing up we had many family holiday traditions. Now with my own children, we have created our own. Here\u2019s a list of fun activities to consider doing with your children during the holiday season. Sigma Art 24mm \u2013 Using a wide angle lens like the 24mm is great for tight spaces, especially when shooting from above. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 One way to capture bokeh during the holidays within your own home is to pull your subject away from your tree and set a wide aperture like in this image at 1.6. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 To capture sun flare, place the sun at the very edge of your frame. It helps to have something partially blocking the sun like in this image with the treeline. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nChristmas Tree Farms \nHead to your local tree farm to find the perfect tree to put up in your home. This is my family\u2019s absolute favorite tradition. My children have so much fun trying to find the perfect tree. The local farm we go to every year has a bonfire to roast marshmallows, hot cocoa to sip on and children are even able to meet Santa. Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 Zoo lights are a great way to capture gorgeous bokeh during the holiday season. Place your subject close to the lights to allow for better light to shine on your subject. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nZoos and Nature Parks \nConsider checking out your local zoo to see if they have an evening lights display during the holiday season. It\u2019s a great way to get outside and see some magical lights on display, and of course maybe some animals too. Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 If you are working with low light within your home, have your subject stand near a window for better light. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nThe Elf on the Shelf \nYou have probably heard of the Elf on the Shelf. This is a fun tradition my family started doing last year. I think my husband and I have more fun trying to come up with creative places to hide our Elf more than anything. Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 One of the benefits of shooting with a longer focal length lens during the Santa parade is the beautiful compression it creates. This helps to separate your subject from the background and make them stand out. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nHoliday Parades \nThe Santa Parade is another favorite for my family. Many towns big and small have one, and the excitement of the crowd is captivating. Not to mention all the incredible floats and Santa himself. My children always come home sticky from eating too much candy, but I can honestly say it\u2019s always worth it. Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 A wide angle lens like the 35mm allows you to easily work in tight spaces and is a great storytelling lens. It might not have gorgeous compression like the 135mm but it does allow for greater depth of field because it is a wide angle lens. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nIf you have a historical village near you, chances are they put on some sort of holiday event. It\u2019s a wonderful way to step back in time and experience some old-timey holiday activities from candle making to playing with old train sets. Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 The 85mm is a wonderful everyday lens because you don\u2019t have to stand too far back when photographing your subject, yet still have beautiful compression. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nVintage Trains \nCheck to see if you have some sort of Polar Express or Santa train near you. We love this tradition so much that we go on two different trains near us. My boys are able to sip on hot cocoa and even sit with Santa. Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 Placing your subject close to the light source will allow for the light to dramatically fall off and hide a lot of the distractions in the background, like in this image. There were a lot of people behind my son, but they don\u2019t distract from the focal. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nBotanical Gardens \nIf you have any botanical gardens near you, then you might want to look into whether they have a holiday display. Our local conservatory has the most incredible wooden train set on display. It\u2019s also a great way to escape the cold. Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 One creative way of capturing bokeh during the holidays is doing an in-camera multiple exposure. In this image the outdoor capture with my boys was taken first. Then I went inside, selected multiple exposure on my DSLR, and switched to manual to intentionally blur a string of lights. The blurred light capture was then layered on my outdoor image. Make sure to check your camera\u2019s manual on how to do an in-camera double exposure. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nYour own \u201cbackyard\u201d \nDon\u2019t forget some of the most fun can be had right at home. If you live in a colder climate where you have snow, consider making snowmen or sledding. These are two things you will often find us doing during the holidays and the great thing is it is fun for free. Sigma Art 85mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 135mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 If your kitchen doesn\u2019t have great light consider setting up your cookie decorating in good light like in this image taken in my dining room. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nBaking and making \nWe spend a lot of the holiday season baking. It\u2019s always a little bit of a mess getting my children involved with cooking, but some of my fondest childhood memories were baking with my grandmother. Sigma Art 35mm \u2013 To make your subject pop while shooting through a window, make sure your background is nice and dark like the pine trees directly behind me. A dark background will make your subject pop while looking out the window. \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 Sigma Art 135mm \u2013 \u00a9 Meg Loeks | 2017 \nThe holiday season is obviously a busy time, but in between the hustle and bustle I hope you are able to enjoy some holiday fun with your children. I\u2019m reminded often that this time goes quick. More than anything, I hope these activities bring you as much joy as they do my family. And I hope these photos help you find your own inspiration for capturing your own holiday memories.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meg loeks", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dslr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nature parks  consider", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "santa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa parade", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:44.015+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "edc2ee08ac70edb63a4cc708f494caafbd39a647", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRr0AzPTtaDOscoWYJJS2D6cv_LI7cp4Q5ga4kQKV.P.llJBzvdfFtJdQD7sdMVHbWq_wjJ6uywlPxSirqXueAWccOzXZhyecizSSi8ub2P_K9rCze0bM8jrB2bq5YE63f_cPHDqVGdyNcyfZsaZn6j", "site_full": "www.all4women.co.za", "site": "all4women.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.citizen.co.za/feed/", "site_categories": ["fashion", "entertainment", "media", "womens_health", "style_and_fashion", "health", "celebrity_fan_gossip"], "section_title": "The Citizen", "title": "Trevor Noah sets troll straight with stinging clap back", "title_full": "Trevor Noah sets troll straight with stinging clap back", "published": "2017-12-07T10:23:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2015/04/01b506ac7b258dd480c8a80fe87c28cd8ffa58f2-579x400.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29282, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "edc2ee08ac70edb63a4cc708f494caafbd39a647", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRr0AzPTtaDOscoWYJJS2D6cv_LI7cp4Q5ga4kQKV.P.llJBzvdfFtJdQD7sdMVHbWq_wjJ6uywlPxSirqXueAWccOzXZhyecizSSi8ub2P_K9rCze0bM8jrB2bq5YE63f_cPHDqVGdyNcyfZsaZn6j", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yasmeen Osman", "published": "2017-12-07T10:23:00.000+02:00", "title": "Trevor Noah sets troll straight with stinging clap back", "text": "Trevor Noah sets troll straight with stinging clap back Hope Winters AFP/File / Trevor Noah (pictured), a 31-year-old South African comedian, largely unknown in the United States, was named by Comedy Central television as the successor to long-serving \"Daily Show\" star Jon Stewart Trevor may be living the high-life in New York, but that does not mean he\u2019s forgotten his roots. \nBeing the host of The Daily Show and rubbing shoulders with the famous, people often forget that Trevor Noah is from South Africa and not Hollywood. \nBut that\u2019s okay, because Trevor wastes no time in reminding them. \nThis is what happened when a follower questioned Trevor\u2019s satirical views and comments on American politics, labelling him \u201cbiased\u201d like a \u201cHollywood elitist\u201d. @Trevornoah are you gonna criticize @alfranken & @johnconyersjr like you are @MooreSenate & @realDonaldTrump or are you just gonna be another biased, progressive Hollywood elitist \ud83e\udd14 \n\u2014 Francis J.

Nah.\nThe govt wanted it done in 4 months when they ordered it in August, the next census in 2021 is potentially two elections away.\nAlso the survey thing used the Electoral Roll as it's frame (list of ppl to send forms). That's a known but slightly incomplete register of adults and addresses. The census necessarily starts blind to actual people and instead has houses as its frame for obtaining responses. It is interested in tabulating non-voters as well (eg resident non-citizens and the 5% who are unenrolled) so the reference population is actually different.\nLinking the Roll to a census collection would also have been... tricky from a secrecy and legality perspective.

Broadly speaking, of course, it means to \u201cseize the opportunity right now,\u201d or maybe in my case, to avoid procrastinating. From a psychological perspective, this makes a lot of sense. As humans we experience time \u201cpassing,\u201d and there is a special quality to the present moment. Hypnosis and dreams aside, there is no way to directly experience either the past or the future in the same way we experience the present. But is the aphorism true? Does modern physics actually tell us that there\u2019s no time like the present?\nOur best current physical theory of space and time is general relativity. Prior to Einstein\u2019s revolution over a century ago, physics considered time to be an \u201cexternal parameter\u201d\u2014an independent, fundamental feature of reality not influenced by any other factor in the universe. Whether or not the passage of time is real or illusory (this is an age-old philosophical debate that predates Einstein and is indeed not settled by his theory), we now know that time intervals are not external or universally determined. Time is an internal component of a physical system, a dimension intertwined with three spatial dimensions. Taken together, this is \u201cspacetime,\u201d and is influenced by varying factors and is influenced by varying factors, including speed (relative to other observers or systems) and gravitational forces. Because the theory of relativity posits the constancy of the speed of light for all observers (even if they are moving relative to each other), spacetime itself must dilate and the concept of a time interval becomes elastic.\nAs a result, there is no universal notion of the present that applies equally to all observers. What looks present to me could just as easily be in someone else\u2019s future, and in a third person\u2019s past. Simultaneity is relative\u2026\nThink there\u2019s no time like the present? As Mark Shumelda suggests, modern physics begs to differ: \u201c Actually, There Is a Time Like the Present .\u201d\n* Kurt Vonnegut Jr.\n###\nAs we cogitate on carpe diem , we might send playful birthday greetings to Johan Huizinga; he was born on this date in 1872.

The opponents surprised, they planned for us and put on the pressure in the first half. We made too many turnovers and struggled against a team that has good competitive mileage from continental competition,\u201d Micho spoke of United\u2019s run in the Caf Confederation Cup where they lost the final 2-1 to TP Mazembe last month. \n\u201cIn the second half we managed to put our foot on the ball, we played a bit more direct and looked more confident in our approach.\u201d \nREAD: It\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to core goals \u2013 Micho \nComing into this game, Micho adds they needed to prove they are a competitive side this season, especially after Bucs were hammered 6-1 and 4-1 by Matsatsantsa in league and cup games respectively last season. \n\u201cWe have been motivated to prove we are competitive this year so I commend the players. This game last year we conceded six goals in 45 minutes and 10 goals in two games against them. I want to give credit to the players, they worked really hard.\u201d \nThe draw was Bucs seventh this season after 13 league matches with 19 points in the bag for the Soweto giants. For SuperSport, meanwhile, the result saw Eric Tinkler\u2019s charges take their points tally to 14 after playing only seven league games, having registered four wins, two draws and one loss in the process. \nThe Buccaneers and Matsatsantsa will both be in action on Saturday, with Micho\u2019s team hosting promoted side AmaZulu FC, while Tinkler\u2019s men will welcome Cape Town City to the Mbombela Stadium.

Click to expand... How were your TV, Yamaha AVR and sources configured?\nHow did you measure and counteract the TV's inherent video delay for sources routed through the AVR? Did you set them manually or use your Amp's 'Auto Lipsync' etc. feature (which lets a TV signal over HDMI how much delay its video processing is currently introducing)?\nI try and use an A/V test disc or file for my Blu-ray players, Media players etc. to check this (and manually alter it if not right).\nI certainly wouldn't be changing my TV because of it.\nAnd the HDR on Netflix was quite dark.\nAnyone know if this one should eliminate my two main issues?\nThanks for any advice in advance... Click to expand... Don't know how well your old TV tracked SMPTE 2084 - the standard for HDR10 video gamma - which precisely defines the brightness each pixel should be based on the source video level. In theory you shouldn't really be able to control the brightness or contrast of HDR10 content other than to calibrate your screen. (That's the entire point of Perceptive Quantisation - which is what HDR10 and Dolby Vision are based on)\nIf your old TV was tracking SMPTE 2084 properly then the chances are you don't like the way shows are being graded in HDR (though in my experience the SDR and HDR grades on Netflix are very similar - with just additional highlight detail appearing in HDR).

(Photo by Philip Brown/Getty Images) Of dodgy calls at the toss and even dodgier DRS calls\u2026 \nAustralia claimed a 120-run victory over England in the second Test in Adelaide to take a 2-0 lead in the five-Test Ashes series. \nThe home side finished strongly on Wednesday\u2019s final day to snuff out the tourists bid to run down a record run chase at Adelaide Oval. \nHere are five things we learned from the first-ever Ashes day-night Test match: \nRoot\u2019s brave toss call backfires \nJoe Root raised eyebrows when he became the first England captain to bowl after winning the toss in Adelaide since Bob Willis in 1982-83. Australia went on to declare their first innings at 442 for eight and from there England were always behind the game. Although England battled back on the fourth day to have an outside winning chance, the damage had been done from Root\u2019s call at the toss. \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to say in hindsight,\u201d Root said answering the criticism. \u201cIf you look at the conditions and the way the ball moved around we were massively in the game. We couldn\u2019t quite take the wickets earlier.\u201d \nMarsh justifies his place \nShaun Marsh answered his critics with the only century in the pink ball Test. The experienced left-hander, in his eighth recall to the Australian team, put together his fifth century batting at number six in his 25th Test, an unconquered 126 off 231 balls in his side\u2019s big first innings. He was fittingly named man-of-the-match and now has 196 runs in the series averaging 98 to anchor his place in the Australian batting order. \nSmith sleeps on a tough 24 hours \nSkipper Steve Smith came in for plenty of criticism for not enforcing the follow-on and sending England back into bat a second time armed with a 215-run innings lead. It almost backfired with Australia bundled out for just 138, presenting England with an unexpected winning chance to chase down a record fourth innings of 345 at Adelaide Oval. They made a good fist of it and needed 178 runs with six wickets heading into the final day before Australia closed it out. Smith was adamant he had made the right call to give his fast bowlers a rest, although he did admit to popping a sleeping pill after a \u201cpretty tough 24 hours\u201d preceding the final day. \nAnderson not finished yet \nEngland\u2019s all-time leading Test wicket-taker Jimmy Anderson showed he still has what it takes after claiming his first five-wicket haul in Australia to give England a winning chance. He bowled beautifully in his five for 43 in the second innings to knock over the home side for 138 and switch the momentum. The 35-year-old paceman has now taken 514 wickets in 131 Tests and says he\u2019s bowling as well as ever. \u201cPeople keep telling me that I am about to finish and retire, so I want to show them that I can keep going,\u201d he declared. \nDRS: Decision Reviews \u2018Strange\u2019? \nBoth teams had their issues with the decision review system (DRS) in the Adelaide Test. Steve Smith burned both of Australia\u2019s reviews in the space of three balls in England\u2019s second innings after having earlier missed a chance to overturn a call. Counterpart Joe Root reasoned there was no point complaining about a series of \u201cstrange\u201d decision reviews in his side\u2019s loss. \u201cA few where we were out in the middle in the field and we thought that it\u2019s just regulation \u2026 out,\u201d Root said. \u201cWe are where we are with it and we have to get on with it because it\u2019s there for this series.\u201d \nALSO READ:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jimmy anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob willis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "root", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe root", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip brown/getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaun marsh", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "adelaide oval", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adelaide", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:48.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d553376066fa2b485916066805945fe074f465d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRr0AzPTtaDOscoWYJJS2D6cv_LI7cp4Q6k.pYXykPE7iKQXXQiJ24drJ8XMWQ66ZCzwHgstiUukJR31qZ1qacFGOk3izVfHeOXSqXrUfk8n._8P6bR7lZ4kw93I6n4ugJ9FJwV35L_xe6na1A_EtYa7rvgGIV4K5s-", "site_full": "www.all4women.co.za", "site": "all4women.co.za", "site_section": "http://www.citizen.co.za/feed/", "site_categories": ["fashion", "entertainment", "media", "womens_health", "style_and_fashion", "health", "celebrity_fan_gossip"], "section_title": "The Citizen", "title": "EFF lashes out at British Airways over racism involving Black Motion, says it will be suspended from SA", "title_full": "EFF lashes out at British Airways over racism involving Black Motion, says it will be suspended from SA", "published": "2017-12-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "ZA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/02/black-motion-389x259.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29282, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d553376066fa2b485916066805945fe074f465d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRr0AzPTtaDOscoWYJJS2D6cv_LI7cp4Q6k.pYXykPE7iKQXXQiJ24drJ8XMWQ66ZCzwHgstiUukJR31qZ1qacFGOk3izVfHeOXSqXrUfk8n._8P6bR7lZ4kw93I6n4ugJ9FJwV35L_xe6na1A_EtYa7rvgGIV4K5s-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yasmeen Osman", "published": "2017-12-07T09:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "EFF lashes out at British Airways over racism involving Black Motion, says it will be suspended from SA", "text": "South Africa 7.12.2017 09:55 am EFF lashes out at British Airways over racism involving Black Motion, says it will be suspended from SA Hope Winters Black Motion.

Eighty percent of the sample \u2013 which is representative of 37 million adult South Africans \u2013 focused on poorer communities. The study also assessed satisfaction with political performance. \nSpeaking at a workshop called The Nation\u2019s Voice on State Capture and Corruption where the results of the study were released, Ask Afrika\u2019s CEO, Andrea Gevers, said where respondents felt South Africa was going in a negative direction, with corrupt government officials, unemployment and high levels of crime cited as reasons. \nNearly 40% said government was responsible while 29% identified President Jacob Zuma as the accountable party. Source: Centre for Communication and Reputation Management at the University of Pretoria, Ask Afrika and Infusion Knowledge Hub \nOnly 4.9% felt that citizens were to blame. \nThose individuals who believed that South Africa was moving in the right direction (17%), mentioned improved education and RDP housing as reasons. A small percentage (6%) didn\u2019t know or care about the country\u2019s direction. \nThe study highlighted high levels of distrust and dissatisfaction with the current government. The majority of respondents believed that their basic needs were not being met as a result of state capture and high levels of corruption, but also showed a culture of blind following and apathy, which allowed leadership to get away with underperformance. \nWhen respondents were asked how important it was to follow the lead of political leaders in their own culture, 11% said it was very important and 30% felt it was important. \nThese were worrying statistics, as it suggested that a large chunk of citizens would still follow their leaders, even if they had the wrong leader, Gevers said. \nPresident Jacob Zuma fared the worst among leaders in government, with 64% of people rating his efficiency as \u201cvery badly\u201d. Source: Centre for Communication and Reputation Management at the University of Pretoria, Ask Afrika and Infusion Knowledge Hub \nWith regards to a leadership rating, one would ideally want to see more satisfaction, with at least a third to half of the rating classified as \u201cwell\u201d and \u201cvery well\u201d. However, leaders were rated poorly in the \u201cvery well\u201d category across the board, and mainly single-digit percentages of respondents rated their performance as \u201cvery well\u201d. \n\u201cThat is exceedingly low. It is the lowest we\u2019ve ever seen in a study,\u201d Gevers said. \nMost South Africans were aware of the concept of corruption, with 89% saying they have heard the term and 99% indicating it was unacceptable. Half the respondents personally knew someone who was corrupt. \nYet, very few respondents were aware of the phrase \u201cstate capture\u201d or understood it, but they were alarmed and terrified when it was explained to them, Infusion\u2019s Shamima Vawda said. They saw it as a loss of sovereignty. \nSeventy-seven percent of respondents said they had not heard of \u201cstate capture\u201d before, but upon hearing the definition, 68% said it happened in South Africa. Ninety-one percent thought it was unacceptable and said it would change the way people vote. \nWhen asked about the perceived involvement of stakeholders in corruption and state capture, the president and the police were at the top of the list, followed by political parties. Source: Centre for Communication and Reputation Management at the University of Pretoria, Ask Afrika and Infusion Knowledge Hub \n\u201cThis tells me that we are ripe for an overhaul,\u201d Gevers said. \nAsked what they wanted government to address as soon as possible, respondents said corruption, unemployment and illegal entries into the country. \nSixty-three percent of respondents felt that living conditions had improved after the end of apartheid, 84% classified themselves as proudly South African and 46% chose to be identified as South Africans before any other demographic descriptors such as race, gender, religion or culture. \nThe study was conducted during the latter part of 2017 in two parts \u2013 firstly through ten focus groups in Gauteng, the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal and later followed up with a computer-aided questionnaire answered by 2 600 adult South Africans. \nBrought to you by Moneyweb \nFor more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .
