His only opponent, Hamdeen Sabahi, received less votes than spoiled ballots. \nThe president is popular among many Egyptians who say the country needs a firm hand following years up tumult that battered the economy. \nBut he has faced mounting criticism over a crackdown on Islamist and secular opponents and what rights groups say are increasingly repressive measures to stifle dissent. \nSo far only one opponent, lawyer and dissident Khaled Ali, has announced his candidacy for the 2018 election. \nAli, who challenged an unpopular government deal to hand over two Red Sea islands to Saudi Arabia, had run in the 2012 election that brought Islamist president Mohamed Morsi to power. \nHe received less than one percent of the vote then.

It was no longer weather tight, but had housed several traditional families. Mir gathered some traditional garb. Then she headed to one of her stashes, and shuffled through a drawer full of ID cards. There was one of a woman of approximately the right height in traditional garb. If they ran into a patrol with male members, Mir could talk them out of closely examining the woman. If they ran into a patrol with female members\u2026 well. Then Mir would hope to run faster than the woman. That\u2019s all. \nMir took these back to the woman under the tarp in the corner of the bombed-out building, and pointed to the clothes and said \u201cDress.\u201d Mir watched the woman strip out of her boots and flying clothes and compared her own stick arms and legs with the well muscled arms and legs of the young woman, Jeannie, she recalled. Jeannie did not like Mir\u2019s clinical gaze upon her naked body. She turned her back to Mir as if embarrassed. The woman finally got the clothes on, and Mir pointed to the sandals and Jeannie slipped them on.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to take me to the Resistance?\u201d the woman asked.\nMir was puzzled. The Resistance? \u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked, wondering if she had misunderstood the word.\n\u201cPeople against the government. People fighting the government.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yes,\u201d Mir lied. There was no Resistance that she knew of. Nobody fought the government. People who did, disappeared and were never seen again. Mir knew of nobody who could be this \u201cResistance\u201d that the young woman was talking about. \u201cWhat do you need the Resistance to do for you?\u201d\nThe air raid sirens had shut off while Mir was gathering clothes, but now they were blaring again. Bombs crunched in the distance. \n\u201cThey need to take me to an open area a few miles from the city so a rescue team can pick me up,\u201d Jeanie said. \u201cWhen do we leave?\u201d\n\u201cLater. I have to find some people,\u201d Mir said. The hollow feeling in her stomach was annoying her and she felt light-headed. \u201cDo you have food?\u201d \nThe woman dug in her pack, that had been the bottom of her seat, and brought out food bars. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have water?\u201d\nMir pointed at where bottles of water were set against the wall. Of course she had water. You died if you did not have water. All of Mir\u2019s hiding places had water.\n\u201cDo you have money?\u201d Mir asked. \u201cI may need to pay off a policeman to get you past.\u201d\nThe woman pulled out some gold colored coins from the pack and handed them to Mir. Mir gazed at one of them, puzzled. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\n\u201cGold coins from South Suderstan. They\u2019re worth a lot of money.\u201d \nMir had no idea what that meant. \u201cWorth a lot of money\u201d, though, she understood. There was a pawn shop where she could maybe sell them. The shop-owner would rip her off, of course, give her much less than the coins were worth. But that was life. She had no idea where else she could take these strange golden disks that were like nothing she had ever encountered.\n\u201cWhat is South Suderstan?\u201d Mir asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s at the far southern tip of Suderstan.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is Suderstan?\u201d Mir asked.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a continent.\u201d\n\u201cA\u2026 continent?\u201d \nThe woman was staring at Mir. \u201cDidn\u2019t you ever go to school?\u201d\nMir shrugged. \u201cI learned to read and do numbers a little, but then my mom and dad died and\u2026\u201d she shrugged, and pointed around. \u201cThe foster home was worse. They rented me out to customers. I was nine years old.\u201d \n\u201cWhere did you learn my language?\u201d\n\u201cMy father grew up speaking it at home. His mother, my grandmother, was from your country. She died a little after I was born, and his father died when I was six years old. But he still spoke it to me when I was small.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any relatives? Anywhere you could go?\u201d\n\u201cMy mother and father were both only children. My grandmother on my mother\u2019s side is still alive but she is very old now and can\u2019t take care of anybody. I don\u2019t know any other family.\u201d \nThe young woman\u2019s eyes glistened wetly, and Mir could see what was going through her mind. \u201cNo!\u201d Mir said. \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me! I\u2019m fine.\u201d She shoved on the young woman\u2019s chest, forcing the young woman to take a step back. \u201cI just need to get out of this place, we\u2019re starving to death because of your bombs, I need to go somewhere there\u2019s peace, far away!\u201d\nThe young woman looked sad, then. \u201cI don\u2019t know of such a place. We\u2019re bombing everywhere in your country, everywhere there\u2019s a city. Unless you went back home with me?\nMir stopped, recalculating then. But there was no Resistance. No way to get this young woman out of the city and back to her country. Mir would not even know how to try. Maybe the bodega man, but no, she could not trust him. The pawn shop owner? No, he would turn them over to the mice for money, he was always money. Jack\u2026 but Jack knew as little as Mir did. Jack had been on the streets even longer, and there was nothing Jack knew that Mir didn\u2019t know. Besides, she did not want to bring Jack in on this. Jack would want to come with them. Jack would want to share. \nThe fence, the man to whom they took stolen things. He would not turn them over to the mice because Mir knew too much and could finger him. Though he undoubtedly was paying off the police to look the other way. Still, no one would bring things to him if he broke the code of honor amongst thieves. He was safe. \nHe would not be available until morning. Mir munched on the food bar, feeling it descend into her stomach. She could only eat a few bites, then she walked over and picked up a bottle of water and drank half of it. Still, already she felt less light-headed. \nYes. She would talk it over with Dismas. Dismas was old. He knew things. If there was a way to get the young woman home, he would know. If there was not, he would also know the best way to get money from selling the young woman to the mice. \n\u201cStay here,\u201d Mir said. \u201cI\u2019ll be back tomorrow evening, I need to talk to a man.\u201d\n\u201cResistance?\u201d\n\u201cNo, but he will know how to contact them,\u201d Mir lied.

It is bordered by Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the R\u00edo de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people,[7] of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometres (68,000 sq mi), Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America after Suriname. Uruguay was inhabited by the Charr\u00faa people for approximately 4000 years before the Portuguese established Colonia del Sacramento, one of the oldest European settlements in the country, in 1680. Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century, signifying the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics until the late 20th century. Modern Uruguay is a democratic constitutional republic, with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government. Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy, peace, lack of corruption,[8] e-government,[9] and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom, size of the middle class and prosperity.[8] On a per-capita basis, Uruguay contributes more troops to United Nations peace-keeping missions than any other country.[8] It ranks second in the region on economic freedom, income equality, per-capita income and inflows of FDI.[8] Uruguay is the third-best country on the continent in terms of HDI, GDP growth,[10] innovation and infrastructure.[8] It is regarded as a high-income country (top group) by the UN.[9] Uruguay is also the third-best ranked in the world in e-Participation.[9] Uruguay is an important global exporter of combed wool, rice, soybeans, frozen beef, malt and milk.[8] The Economist named Uruguay \"country of the year\" in 2013,[11] acknowledging the innovative policy of legalizing the production, sale and consumption of cannabis. Same-sex marriage and abortion are also legal, leading Uruguay to be regarded as one of the most liberal nations in the world, and one of the most socially developed, outstanding regionally,[12] and ranking highly on global measures of personal rights, tolerance, and inclusion issues.[13] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early colonisation 2.2 Independence struggle (1811\u20131830) 2.3 Blancos\u2013Colorados conflicts 2.3.1 Mass immigration and development 2.4 20th century 2.4.1 Return to democracy (1984\u2013present) 3 Geography 4 Flora 5 Environment 5.1 Climate 5.2 Green Energy Supply 6 Government 6.1 Administrative divisions 6.2 Foreign relations 6.3 Military 7 Economy 7.1 Agriculture 7.2 Transportation 7.3 Telecommunications 7.4 Water supply and sanitation 8 Demographics 8.1 Largest cities 8.2 Health 8.3 Religion 8.4 Language 9 Culture 9.1 Visual arts 9.2 Music 9.3 Literature 9.4 Media 9.5 Cuisine 9.6 Sport 10 Education 11 See also 12 Notes 13 References 14 Further reading 15 External links Etymology The name of the namesake river comes from the Spanish pronunciation of the regional Guarani word for it. There are several interpretations, including \"bird-river\" (\"the river of the ur\u00fa\", via Charruan, ur\u00fa being a common noun of any wild fowl).[14][15] The name could also refer a river snail called urugu\u00e1 (Pomella megastoma) that was plentiful in the water.[16] In Spanish colonial times, and for some time thereafter, Uruguay and some neighbouring territories were called the Cisplatina and Banda Oriental [del Uruguay] (\"East Bank [of the river Uruguay]\"), then for a few years the \"Eastern Province\", and after independence ultimately became la Rep\u00fablica Oriental del Uruguay, translated either as the \"Oriental Republic of Uruguay\"[17][18] or the \"Eastern Republic of Uruguay\".[19] History Main article: History of Uruguay The only documented inhabitants of Uruguay before European colonization of the area were the Charr\u00faa, a small tribe driven south by the Guarani of Paraguay.[20] Early colonisation The Portuguese discovered the region of present-day Uruguay in 1512.[21][22] The Spanish arrived in present-day Uruguay in 1516.[20] The indigenous peoples' fierce resistance to conquest, combined with the absence of gold and silver, limited their settlement in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries.[20] Uruguay then became a zone of contention between the Spanish and Portuguese empires. In 1603, the Spanish began to introduce cattle, which became a source of wealth in the region. The first permanent Spanish settlement was founded in 1624 at Soriano on the R\u00edo Negro. In 1669\u201371, the Portuguese built a fort at Colonia del Sacramento. Spanish colonization increased as Spain sought to limit Portugal's expansion of Brazil's frontiers.[citation needed] Montevideo was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold in the country. Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with R\u00edo de la Plata's capital, Buenos Aires.[20] Uruguay's early 19th century history was shaped by ongoing fights for dominance in the Platine region,[20] between British, Spanish, Portuguese and other colonial forces. In 1806 and 1807, the British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires and Montevideo as part of the Napoleonic Wars. Montevideo was occupied by a British force from February to September 1807. Independence struggle (1811\u20131830) The oath of the Thirty-Three Orientals by Uruguayan painter Juan Manuel Blanes Further information: Banda Oriental, Liga Federal, and Cisplatina In 1811, Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, who became Uruguay's national hero, launched a successful revolution against the Spanish authorities, defeating them on 18 May at the Battle of Las Piedras.[20] In 1813, the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism, demanding political and economic autonomy for each area, and for the Banda Oriental in particular.[23] The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental, however, and Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism.[23] As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815.[23] Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn, the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government.[23] Artigas organized the Federal League under his protection, consisting of six provinces, four of which later became part of Argentina.[23] In 1816, a force of 10,000 Portuguese troops invaded the Banda Oriental from Brazil; they took Montevideo in January 1817.[23] After nearly four more years of struggle, Portuguese Brazil annexed the Banda Oriental as a province under the name of \"Cisplatina\".[23] The Brazilian Empire became independent from Portugal in 1822. In response to the annexation, the Thirty-Three Orientals, led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja, declared independence on 25 August 1825 supported by the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata (present-day Argentina).[20] This led to the 500-day-long Cisplatine War. Neither side gained the upper hand and in 1828 the Treaty of Montevideo, fostered by the United Kingdom, gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state. The nation's first constitution was adopted on 18 July 1830.[20] Blancos\u2013Colorados conflicts Manuel Oribe, leader of Blancos Further information: Uruguayan Civil War The Battle of Caseros, 1852 At the time of independence, Uruguay had an estimated population of just under 75,000.[24] Era from independence until 1904 was marked by regular military conflicts and civil wars between the Blanco and Colorado Parties. The political scene in Uruguay became split between two parties: the conservative Blancos (Whites) headed by the second President Manuel Oribe, representing the agricultural interests of the countryside; and the liberal Colorados (Reds) led by the first President Fructuoso Rivera, representing the business interests of Montevideo. The Uruguayan parties received support from warring political factions in neighboring Argentina, which became involved in Uruguayan affairs. The Colorados favored the exiled Argentine liberal Unitarios, many of whom had taken refuge in Montevideo while the Blanco president Manuel Oribe was a close friend of the Argentine ruler Manuel de Rosas. On 15 June 1838, an army led by the Colorado leader Rivera overthrew President Oribe, who fled to Argentina.[24] Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839. The conflict would last 13 years and become known as the Guerra Grande (the Great War).[24] In 1843, an Argentine army overran Uruguay on Oribe's behalf, but failed to take the capital. The siege of Montevideo, which began in February 1843, would last nine years.[25] The besieged Uruguayans called on resident foreigners for help, which led to a French and an Italian legion being formed, the latter led by the exiled Giuseppe Garibaldi.[25] In 1845, Britain and France intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region. Their efforts proved ineffective and, by 1849, tired of the war, both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas.[25] It appeared that Montevideo would finally fall when an uprising against Rosas, led by Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza governor of Argentina's Entre R\u00edos Province began. The Brazilian intervention in May 1851 on behalf of the Colorados, combined with the uprising, changed the situation and Oribe was defeated. The siege of Montevideo was lifted and the Guerra Grande finally came to an end.[25] Montevideo rewarded Brazil's support by signing treaties that confirmed Brazil's right to intervene in Uruguay's internal affairs.[25] In accordance with the 1851 treaties, Brazil intervened militarily in Uruguay as often as it deemed necessary.[26] In 1865, the Triple Alliance was formed by the emperor of Brazil, the president of Argentina, and the Colorado general Venancio Flores, the Uruguayan head of government whom they both had helped to gain power. The Triple Alliance declared war on the Paraguayan leader Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez[26] and the resulting Paraguayan War ended with the invasion of Paraguay and its defeat by the armies of the three countries. Montevideo, which was used as a supply station by the Brazilian navy, experienced a period of prosperity and relative calm during the war.[26] The constitutional government of General Lorenzo Batlle y Grau (1868\u201372) suppressed Revolution of the Lances by the Blancos.[27] After two years of struggle, a peace agreement was signed in 1872 that gave the Blancos a share in the emoluments and functions of government, through control of four of the departments of Uruguay.[27] This establishment of the policy of co-participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise, based on the coexistence of the party in power and the party in opposition.[27] Despite this agreement, Colorado rule was threatened by the failed Tricolor Revolution in 1875 and Revolution of the Quebracho in 1886. The Colorado effort to reduce Blancos to only three departments caused a Blanco uprising of 1897, that ended with creation of 16 departments out of which Blancos now had control over six. Blancos were given 1/3 of seats in Congress.[28] This division of power lasted until the President Jose Batlle y Ordonez instituted his political reforms which caused the last uprising by Blancos in 1904 that ended with the Battle of Masoller and death of Blanco leader Aparicio Saravia. Between 1875 and 1890, the military became the center of power.[29] During this authoritarian period, the government took steps toward the organization of the country as a modern state, encouraging its economic and social transformation. Pressure groups (consisting mainly of businessmen, hacendados, and industrialists) were organized and had a strong influence on government.[29] A transition period (1886\u201390) followed, during which politicians began recovering lost ground and some civilian participation in government occurred.[29] Mass immigration and development Main article: Immigration to Uruguay Juan Idiarte Borda (1844\u20131897), 17th President of Uruguay and the only one assassinated. After the Guerra Grande, there was a sharp rise in the number of immigrants, primarily from Italy and Spain. By 1879, the total population of the country was over 438,500.[30] The economy saw a steep upswing, above all in livestock raising and exports.[30] Montevideo became a major economic centre of the region and an entrep\u00f4t for goods from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.[30] 20th century The Colorado leader Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez was elected president in 1903.[31] The following year, the Blancos led a rural revolt and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader, Aparicio Saravia, was killed in battle. Government forces emerged victorious, leading to the end of the co-participation politics that had begun in 1872.[31] Batlle had two terms (1903\u201307 and 1911\u201315) during which, taking advantage of the nation's stability and growing economic prosperity, he instituted major reforms, such as a welfare program, government participation in many facets of the economy, and a plural executive.[20] Gabriel Terra became president in March 1931. His inauguration coincided with the effects of the Great Depression,[32] and the social climate became tense as a result of the lack of jobs. There were confrontations in which police and leftists died.[32] In 1933, Terra organized a coup d'\u00e9tat, dissolving the General Assembly and governing by decree.[32] A new constitution was promulgated in 1934, transferring powers to the president.[32] In general, the Terra government weakened or neutralized economic nationalism and social reform.[32] In 1938, general elections were held and Terra's brother-in-law, General Alfredo Baldomir, was elected president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections, freedom of the press, and a new constitution.[33] Although Baldomir declared Uruguay neutral in 1939, British warships and the German ship Admiral Graf Spee fought a battle not far off Uruguay's coast.[33] The Admiral Graf Spee took refuge in Montevideo, claiming sanctuary in a neutral port, but was later ordered out.[33] In the late 1950s, partly because of a world-wide decrease in demand for agricultural products, Uruguayans suffered from a steep drop in their standard of living, which led to student militancy and labor unrest. An armed group known as the Tupamaros emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank robbery, kidnapping and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government. President Jorge Pacheco declared a state of emergency in 1968, followed by a further suspension of civil liberties in 1972. In 1973, amid increasing economic and political turmoil, the armed forces, asked by the President Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry, closed the Congress and established a civilian-military regime.[20] Around 200 Uruguayans are known to have been killed and disappeared, with hundreds more illegally detained and tortured during the 12-year civil-military rule of 1973 to 1985.[34] Most were killed in Argentina and other neighbouring countries, with 36 of them having been killed in Uruguay.[35] Return to democracy (1984\u2013present) The then-Uruguayan president Jorge Batlle with former U.S. president George H. W. Bush in 2003. A new constitution, drafted by the military, was rejected in a November 1980 referendum.[20] Following the referendum, the armed forces announced a plan for the return to civilian rule, and national elections were held in 1984.[20] Colorado Party leader Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti won the presidency and served from 1985 to 1990. The first Sanguinetti administration implemented economic reforms and consolidated democracy following the country's years under military rule.[20] The National Party's Luis Alberto Lacalle won the 1989 presidential election and amnesty for human rights abusers was endorsed by referendum. Sanguinetti was then re-elected in 1994.[36] Both presidents continued the economic structural reforms initiated after the reinstatement of democracy, and other important reforms were aimed at improving the electoral system, social security, education, and public safety. The 1999 national elections were held under a new electoral system established by a 1996 constitutional amendment. Colorado Party candidate Jorge Batlle, aided by the support of the National Party, defeated Broad Front candidate Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez. The formal coalition ended in November 2002, when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet,[20] although the Blancos continued to support the Colorados on most issues. Low commodity prices and economic difficulties in Uruguay's main export markets (starting in Brazil with the devaluation of the real, then in Argentina in 2002), caused a severe recession; the economy contracted by 11%, unemployment climbed to 21%, and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty rose to over 30%.[37] Bicentennial celebrations in 2011. The image shows 500 school children from 19 schools across the country gathered at the Palacio Legislativo. In 2004, Uruguayans elected Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez as president, while giving the Broad Front a majority in both houses of Parliament. V\u00e1zquez stuck to economic orthodoxy. As commodity prices soared and the economy recovered from recession, he tripled foreign investment, cut poverty and unemployment, cut public debt from 79% of GDP to 60%, and kept inflation steady.[38] In 2009, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a former left-wing militant who spent almost 15 years in prison during the country's military rule, emerged as the new President as the Broad Front won the election for a second time.[39] Abortion was legalized in 2012, followed by same-sex marriage and cannabis in the following year. Geography A satellite image of Uruguay. Main article: Geography of Uruguay See also: Geology of Uruguay With 176,214 km2 (68,037 sq mi) of continental land and 142,199 km2 (54,903 sq mi) of jurisdictional water and small river islands,[40] Uruguay is the second smallest sovereign nation in South America (after Suriname) and the third smallest territory (French Guiana is the smallest).[17] The landscape features mostly rolling plains and low hill ranges (cuchillas) with a fertile coastal lowland.[17] Uruguay has 660 km (410 mi) of coastline.[17] A dense fluvial network covers the country, consisting of four river basins, or deltas: the R\u00edo de la Plata Basin, the Uruguay River, the Laguna Mer\u00edn and the R\u00edo Negro. The major internal river is the R\u00edo Negro ('Black River'). Several lagoons are found along the Atlantic coast. The highest point in the country is the Cerro Catedral, whose peak reaches 514 metres (1,686 ft) AMSL in the Sierra Carap\u00e9 hill range. To the southwest is the R\u00edo de la Plata, the estuary of the Uruguay River (which river forms the country's western border). Montevideo is the southernmost capital city in the Americas, and the third most southerly in the world (only Canberra and Wellington are further south). There are ten national parks in Uruguay: Five in the wetland areas of the east, three in the central hill country, and one in the west along the Rio Uruguay. Flora Main article: Flora of Uruguay Ceibo (Erythrina crista-galli), the national flower in Uruguay Uruguay has about 2500 species distributed in 150 biological families, both native and foreign.[41] \"Ceibo\" or Erythrina crista is the national flower in Uruguay. Environment Climate Maldonado bay. Main article: Climate of Uruguay Located entirely within a temperate zone, Uruguay has a climate that is relatively mild and fairly uniform nationwide.[42] Seasonal variations are pronounced, but extremes in temperature are rare.[42] As would be expected with its abundance of water, high humidity and fog are common.[42] The absence of mountains, which act as weather barriers, makes all locations vulnerable to high winds and rapid changes in weather as fronts or storms sweep across the country.[42] Both summer and winter weather may vary from day to day with the passing of storm fronts, where a hot northerly wind may occasionally be followed by a cold wind (pampero) from the Argentine Pampas.[18] Uruguay has a largely uniform temperature throughout the year, with summers being tempered by winds off the Atlantic; severe cold in winter is unknown.[42][43] The heaviest precipitation occurs during the autumn months, although more frequent rainy spells occur in winter.[18] The mean annual precipitation is generally greater than 40 inches (1,000 mm), decreasing with distance from the sea coast, and is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.[18] The average temperature for the midwinter month of July varies from 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) at Salto in the northern interior to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at Montevideo in the south.[18] The midsummer month of January varies from a warm average of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) at Salto to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) at Montevideo.[18] National extreme temperatures at sea level are, Paysand\u00fa city 44 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) (20 January 1943) and Melo city \u221211.0 \u00b0C (12.2 \u00b0F) (14 June 1967).[44] Punta del Este Green Energy Supply Nearly 95%[45] of Uruguay's electricity comes from renewable energy. The dramatic shift, taking less than ten years and without government funding, lowered electricity costs and slashed the country's carbon footprint. [46][47] Most of the electricity comes from hydroelectric facilities and wind parks. Uruguay no longer imports electricity.[48] Government Palacio Legislativo, Montevideo, Uruguay Main article: Politics of Uruguay Uruguay is a representative democratic republic with a presidential system.[49] The members of government are elected for a five-year term by a universal suffrage system.[49] Uruguay is a unitary state: justice, education, health, security, foreign policy and defense are all administered nationwide.[49] The Executive Power is exercised by the president and a cabinet of 13 ministers.[49] The legislative power is constituted by the General Assembly, composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Representatives, consisting of 99 members representing the 19 departments, elected based on proportional representation; and the Chamber of Senators, consisting of 31 members, 30 of whom are elected for a five-year term by proportional representation and the Vice-President, who presides over the chamber.[49] The judicial arm is exercised by the Supreme Court, the Bench and Judges nationwide. The members of the Supreme Court are elected by the General Assembly; the members of the Bench are selected by the Supreme Court with the consent of the Senate; and the judges are directly assigned by the Supreme Court.[49] Uruguay adopted its current constitution in 1967.[citation needed] Many of its provisions were suspended in 1973, but re-established in 1985. Drawing on Switzerland and its use of the initiative, the Uruguayan Constitution also allows citizens to repeal laws or to change the constitution by popular initiative, which culminates in a nationwide referendum. This method has been used several times over the past 15 years: to confirm a law renouncing prosecution of members of the military who violated human rights during the military regime (1973\u20131985); to stop privatization of public utilities companies; to defend pensioners' incomes; and to protect water resources.[50] For most of Uruguay's history, the Partido Colorado has been in government.[citation needed] However, in the Uruguayan general election, 2009, the Broad Front won an absolute majority in Parliamentary elections, and Jos\u00e9 Mujica of the Broad Front defeated Luis Alberto Lacalle of the Blancos to win the presidency. A 2010 Latinobar\u00f3metro poll found that, within Latin America, Uruguayans are among the most supportive of democracy and by far the most satisfied with the way democracy works in their country.[51] Uruguay ranked 27th in the Freedom House \"Freedom in the World\" index. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2012, Uruguay scored an 8.17 in the Democracy Index and ranked equal 18th amongst the 25 countries considered to be full democracies in the world.[52] Uruguay ranks 18th in the World Corruption Perceptions Index composed by Transparency International. Administrative divisions A map of the departments of Uruguay. Main article: Administrative divisions of Uruguay Uruguay is divided into 19 departments whose local administrations replicate the division of the executive and legislative powers.[49] Each department elects its own authorities through a universal suffrage system.[49] The departmental executive authority resides in a superintendent and the legislative authority in a departmental board.[49] Department Capital Area Population (2011 census)[53] km2 sq mi Artigas Artigas 11,928 4,605 73,378 Canelones Canelones 4,536 1,751 520,187 Cerro Largo Melo 13,648 5,270 84,698 Colonia Colonia del Sacramento 6,106 2,358 123,203 Durazno Durazno 11,643 4,495 57,088 Flores Trinidad 5,144 1,986 25,050 Florida Florida 10,417 4,022 67,048 Lavalleja Minas 10,016 3,867 58,815 Maldonado Maldonado 4,793 1,851 164,300 Montevideo Montevideo 530 200 1,319,108 Paysand\u00fa Paysand\u00fa 13,922 5,375 113,124 R\u00edo Negro Fray Bentos 9,282 3,584 54,765 Rivera Rivera 9,370 3,620 103,493 Rocha Rocha 10,551 4,074 68,088 Salto Salto 14,163 5,468 124,878 San Jos\u00e9 San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo 4,992 1,927 108,309 Soriano Mercedes 9,008 3,478 82,595 Tacuaremb\u00f3 Tacuaremb\u00f3 15,438 5,961 90,053 Treinta y Tres Treinta y Tres 9,529 3,679 48,134 Total[note 1] \u2014 175,016 67,574 3,286,314 Note: \"Doesn't include the 1,199 km2 (463 sq mi) artificial lakes on the Rio Negro.\".

In November 2010, Uruguay ratified the UNASUR Constitutive Treaty, becoming the ninth nation out of twelve to do so. The treaty was written in 2008 and was to come into force 30 days after the date of receipt of the ninth instrument of ratification.[54] Argentina and Brazil are Uruguay's most important trading partners: Argentina accounted for 20% of total imports in 2009.[17] Since bilateral relations with Argentina are considered a priority, Uruguay denies clearance to British naval vessels bound for the Falkland Islands, and prevents them from calling in at Uruguayan territories and ports for supplies and fuel.[55] A rivalry between the port of Montevideo and the port of Buenos Aires, dating back to the times of the Spanish Empire, has been described as a \"port war\". Officials of both countries emphasized the need to end this rivalry in the name of regional integration in 2010.[56] Construction of a controversial pulp paper mill in 2007, on the Uruguayan side of the Uruguay River, caused protests in Argentina over fears that it would pollute the environment and lead to diplomatic tensions between the two countries.[57] The ensuing dispute remained a subject of controversy into 2010, particularly after ongoing reports of increased water contamination in the area were later proven to be from sewage discharge from the town of Gualeguaych\u00fa in Argentina.[58][59] In November 2010, Uruguay and Argentina announced they had reached a final agreement for joint environmental monitoring of the pulp mill.[60] Brazil and Uruguay have signed cooperation agreements on defence, science, technology, energy, river transportation and fishing, with the hope of accelerating political and economic integration between these two neighbouring countries.[61] Uruguay has two uncontested boundary disputes with Brazil, over Isla Brasilera and the 235 km2 (91 sq mi) Invernada River region near Masoller. The two countries disagree on which tributary represents the legitimate source of the Quara\u00ed/Cuareim River, which would define the border in the latter disputed section, according to the 1851 border treaty between the two countries.[17] However, these border disputes have not prevented both countries from having friendly diplomatic relations and strong economic ties. So far, the disputed areas remain de facto under Brazilian control, with little to no actual effort by Uruguay to assert its claims. Uruguay has enjoyed friendly relations with the United States since its transition back to democracy.[37] Commercial ties between the two countries have expanded substantially in recent years, with the signing of a bilateral investment treaty in 2004 and a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in January 2007.[37] The United States and Uruguay have also cooperated on military matters, with both countries playing significant roles in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.[37] President Mujica backed Venezuela's bid to join Mercosur, and supported Venezuelan Economy Minister Ali Rodriguez to become general secretary of UNASUR, a position previously held by N\u00e9stor Kirchner. Venezuela has a deal to sell Uruguay up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day under preferential terms.[62] On 15 March 2011, Uruguay became the seventh South American nation to officially recognize a Palestinian state,[63] although there was no specification for the Palestinian state's borders as part of the recognition. In statements, the Uruguayan government indicated its firm commitment to the Middle East peace process, but refused to specify borders \"to avoid interfering in an issue that would require a bilateral agreement\".[63] Military Main article: Military of Uruguay The Uruguayan armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the president, through the minister of defense.[20] Armed forces personnel number about 14,000 for the Army, 6,000 for the Navy, and 3,000 for the Air Force.[20] Enlistment is voluntary in peacetime, but the government has the authority to conscript in emergencies.[17] Since May 2009, homosexuals have been allowed to serve openly in the military after the defence minister signed a decree stating that military recruitment policy would no longer discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.[64] In the fiscal year 2010, the United States provided Uruguay with $1.7 million in military assistance, including $1 million in Foreign Military Financing and $480,000 in International Military Education and Training.[37] Uruguay ranks first in the world on a per capita basis for its contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping forces, with 2,513 soldiers and officers in 10 UN peacekeeping missions.[20] As of February 2010, Uruguay had 1,136 military personnel deployed to Haiti in support of MINUSTAH and 1,360 deployed in support of MONUC in the Congo.[20] In December 2010, Uruguayan Major General Gloodtdofsky, was appointed Chief Military Observer and head of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.[65] Economy Graphical depiction of the country's exports in 28 colour-coded categories. Main article: Economy of Uruguay Uruguay experienced a major economic and financial crisis between 1999 and 2002, principally a spillover effect from the economic problems of Argentina.[37] The economy contracted by 11%, and unemployment climbed to 21%.[37] Despite the severity of the trade shocks, Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its investment-grade sovereign bond rating, one of only two in South America.[66][dated info] In 2004, the Batlle government signed a three-year $1.1 billion stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), committing the country to a substantial primary fiscal surplus, low inflation, considerable reductions in external debt, and several structural reforms designed to improve competitiveness and attract foreign investment.[37] Uruguay terminated the agreement in 2006 following the early repayment of its debt but maintained a number of the policy commitments.[37] V\u00e1zquez, who assumed the government in March 2005, created the \"Ministry of Social Development\" and sought to reduce the country's poverty rate with a $240 million National Plan to Address the Social Emergency (PANES), which provided a monthly conditional cash transfer of approximately $75 to over 100,000 households in extreme poverty. In exchange, those receiving the benefits were required to participate in community work, ensure that their children attended school daily, and had regular health check-ups.[37] In 2005, Uruguay was the first exporter of software in South America.[67] The Frente Amplio government, while continuing payments on Uruguay's external debt,[68] also undertook an emergency plan to attack the widespread problems of poverty and unemployment.[69] The economy grew at an annual rate of 6.7% during the 2004\u20132008 period.[70] Uruguay's exports markets have been diversified in order to reduce dependency on Argentina and Brazil.[70] Poverty was reduced from 33% in 2002 to 21.7% in July 2008, while extreme poverty dropped from 3.3% to 1.7%.[70] Between the years 2007 and 2009, Uruguay was the only country in the Americas that did not technically experience a recession (two consecutive downward quarters).[71] Unemployment reached a record low of 5.4% in December 2010 before rising to 6.1% in January 2011.[72] While unemployment is still at a low level, the IMF observed a rise in inflationary pressures,[73] and Uruguay's GDP expanded by 10.4% for the first half of 2010.[74] According to IMF estimates, Uruguay was likely to achieve growth in real GDP of between 8% and 8.5% in 2010, followed by 5% growth in 2011 and 4% in subsequent years.[73] Gross public sector debt contracted in the second quarter of 2010, after five consecutive periods of sustained increase, reaching $21.885 billion US dollars, equivalent to 59.5% of the GDP.[75] The growing, use, and sale of cannabis was legalized on 11 December 2013,[76] making Uruguay the first country in the world to fully legalize marijuana. The law was voted at the Uruguayan senate on the same date with 16 votes to approve it and 13 against. Agriculture Main article: Agriculture in Uruguay In 2010, Uruguay's export-oriented agricultural sector contributed to 9.3% of the GDP and employed 13% of the workforce.[17] Official statistics from Uruguay's Agriculture and Livestock Ministry indicate that meat and sheep farming in Uruguay occupies 59.6% of the land. The percentage further increases to 82.4% when cattle breeding is linked to other farm activities such as dairy, forage, and rotation with crops such as rice.[77] According to FAOSTAT, Uruguay is one of the world's largest producers of soybeans (9th), greasy wool (12th), horse meat (14th), beeswax (14th), and quinces (17th). Most farms (25,500 out of 39,120) are family-managed; beef and wool represent the main activities and main source of income for 65% of them, followed by vegetable farming at 12%, dairy farming at 11%, hogs at 2%, and poultry also at 2%.[77] Beef is the main export commodity of the country, totaling over $1 billion US dollars in 2006.[77] In 2007, Uruguay had cattle herds totalling 12 million head, making it the country with the highest number of cattle per capita at 3.8.[77] However, 54% is in the hands of 11% of farmers, who have a minimum of 500 head. At the other extreme, 38% of farmers exploit small lots and have herds averaging below one hundred head.[77] Transportation The Port of Montevideo. Main article: Transport in Uruguay The Port of Montevideo, handling over 1.1 million containers annually, is the most advanced container terminal in South America.[78] Its quay can handle 14-metre draught (46 ft) vessels. Nine straddle cranes allow for 80 to 100 movements per hour.[78] The port of Nueva Palmira is a major regional merchandise transfer point and houses both private and government-run terminals.[79] Carrasco Airport was initially inaugurated in 1947 and in 2009, Puerta del Sur, the airport owner and operator, with an investment of $165 million, commissioned Rafael Vi\u00f1oly Architects to expand and modernize the existing facilities with a spacious new passenger terminal to increase capacity and spur commercial growth and tourism in the region.[80][81] The London-based magazine Frontier chose the Carrasco International Airport, serving Montevideo, as one of the best four airports in the world in its 27th edition. The airport can handle up to 4.5 million users per year.[80] PLUNA was the flag carrier of Uruguay, and was headquartered in Carrasco.[82][83] The Laguna del Sauce Airport, located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Punta del Este, was remodeled in 1997, and runways have been renovated through a private investment concession.[79] The Administraci\u00f3n de Ferrocarriles del Estado is the autonomous agency in charge of rail transport and the maintenance of the railroad network. Uruguay has about 1,200 km (750 mi) of operational railroad track.[17] Until 1947, about 90% of the railroad system was British-owned.[84] In 1949, the government nationalized the railways, along with the electric trams and the Montevideo Waterworks Company.[84] However, in 1985 the \"National Transport Plan\" suggested passenger trains were too costly to repair and maintain.[84] Cargo trains would continue for loads more than 120 tons, but bus transportation became the \"economic\" alternative for travellers.[84] The last passenger train rolled into Montevideo on 2 January 1988.[84] Surfaced roads connect Montevideo to the other urban centers in the country, the main highways leading to the border and neighboring cities. Numerous unpaved roads connect farms and small towns. Overland trade has increased markedly since Mercosur (Southern Common Market) was formed in the 1990s. Most of the country's domestic freight and passenger service is by road rather than rail. Telecommunications Main article: Communications in Uruguay Telecommunications in Uruguay are more developed than in most other Latin American countries, being the first country in the Americas to achieve complete digital telephony coverage in 1997. The telephone system is completely digitized and has very good coverage over all the country. The system is government-owned, and there have been controversial proposals to partially privatize since the 1990s.[citation needed] The mobile phone market is shared by the state-owned ANTEL and two private companies, Movistar and Claro. Water supply and sanitation Main article: Water supply and sanitation in Uruguay Uruguay is the only country in Latin America that has achieved quasi-universal coverage of access to safe drinking Water supply[85] and adequate sanitation.[86] Water service quality is considered good, with practically all localities in Uruguay receiving disinfected water on a continuous basis. 70% of wastewater collected by the national utility was treated. Given these achievements, the government's priority is to improve the efficiency of services and to expand access to sewerage, where appropriate, in areas where on-site sanitation is used. Demographics Racial and Ethnic Composition in Uruguay (2011 census)[1] Race/Colour White \u2009 87.7% Black \u2009 4.6% Indigenous \u2009 2.4% Other/none \u2009 5.1% Asian \u2009 0.2% Further information: Uruguayan people, Demographics of Uruguay, and Italian Uruguayan Montevideo is the capital and largest city of Uruguay Uruguayans are of predominantly European origin, with over 87.7% of the population claiming European descent in the 2011 census.[1] Most Uruguayans of European ancestry are descendants of 19th and 20th century immigrants from Spain and Italy (about one-quarter of the population is of Italian origin),[20] and to a lesser degree France, Germany and Britain.[18] Earlier settlers had migrated from Argentina.[18] People of African descent make up an even smaller proportion of the total.[18] From 1963 to 1985, an estimated 320,000 Uruguayans emigrated.[87] The most popular destinations for Uruguayan emigrants are Argentina, followed by the United States, Australia, Canada, Spain, Italy and France.[87] In 2009, for the first time in 44 years, the country saw an overall positive influx when comparing immigration to emigration. 3,825 residence permits were awarded in 2009, compared with 1,216 in 2005.[88] 50% of new legal residents come from Argentina and Brazil. A migration law passed in 2008 gives immigrants the same rights and opportunities that nationals have, with the requisite of proving a monthly income of $650.[88] Uruguay's rate of population growth is much lower than in other Latin American countries.[18] Its median age is higher than the global average[20] due to its low birth rate, high life expectancy, and relatively high rate of emigration among younger people. A quarter of the population is less than 15 years old and about a sixth are aged 60 and older.[18] Metropolitan Montevideo is the only large city, with around 1.9 million inhabitants, or more than half the country's total population. The rest of the urban population lives in about 30 towns.[20] Largest cities v t e Largest cities or towns in Uruguay http://ift.tt/2a64V1u Rank Name Department Pop. Rank Name Department Pop.

A 2008 survey by the INE of Uruguay showed Catholicism as the main religion, with 45.7% of the population; 9.0% are non-Catholic Christians, 0.6% are Animists or Umbandists (an Afro-Brazilian religion), and 0.4% Jewish. 30.1% reported believing in a god, but not belonging to any religion, while 14% were Atheist or Agnostic.[90] Among the sizeable Armenian community in Montevideo, the dominant religion is Christianity, specifically Armenian Apostolic.[91] Political observers consider Uruguay the most secular country in the Americas.[92] Uruguay's secularization began with the relatively minor role of the church in the colonial era, compared with other parts of the Spanish Empire. The small numbers of Uruguay's Indians and their fierce resistance to proselytism reduced the influence of the ecclesiastical authorities.[93] After independence, anti-clerical ideas spread to Uruguay, particularly from France, further eroding the influence of the church.[94] In 1837, civil marriage was recognized and in 1861 the state took over the running of public cemeteries. In 1907, divorce was legalized and in 1909, all religious instruction was banned from state schools.[93] Under the influence of the innovative Colorado reformer Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (1903\u20131911), complete separation of church and state was introduced with the new constitution of 1917.[93] Language Main article: Rioplatense Spanish Uruguayan Spanish has some modifications due to the considerable number of Italian immigrants. Immigrants used to speak a mixture of Spanish and Italian known as 'cocoliche' and some of the words are still commonly used by the population. As is the case with neighboring Argentina, Uruguay employs both voseo and ye\u00edsmo (with [\u0283] or [\u0292]). English is common in the business world and its study has risen significantly in recent years, especially among the young. Other languages include Portuguese and Portu\u00f1ol (a mixture of Spanish and Portuguese). Both are spoken in the northern regions near the Brazilian border.[95][96] As few native people exist in the population, no indigenous languages are thought to remain in Uruguay.[97] Culture Main article: Culture of Uruguay Uruguayan culture is strongly European and its influences from southern Europe are particularly important.[18] The tradition of the gaucho has been an important element in the art and folklore of both Uruguay and Argentina.[18] Visual arts A \"livable sculpture\", Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3's Casapueblo was his home, hotel and museum. A prominent exponent of Uruguayan art was abstract painter and sculptor Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3. He drew from both Timbuktu and Mykonos to create his best-known work: his home, hotel and atelier Casapueblo near Punta del Este. Casapueblo is a \"livable sculpture\" and draws thousands of visitors from around the world. The 19th-century painter Juan Manuel Blanes, whose works depict historical events, was the first Uruguayan artist to gain widespread recognition.[18] The Post-Impressionist painter Pedro Figari achieved international renown for his pastel studies of subjects in Montevideo and the countryside. Blending elements of art and nature the work of the landscape architect Leandro Silva Delgado (es) has also earned international prominence.[18] Uruguay has a small but growing film industry, and movies such as Whisky by Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll (2004), Marcelo Bertalm\u00edo's Los d\u00edas con Ana (2000; \"Days with Ana\") and Ana D\u00edez's Paisito (2008), about the 1973 military coup, have earned international honours.[18] Music La cumparsita Menu 0:00 It is among the most famous and recognizable tangos of all time. Problems playing this file? See media help. Main article: Music of Uruguay The folk and popular music of Uruguay shares not only its gaucho roots with Argentina, but also those of the tango.[18] One of the most famous tangos, \"La cumparsita\" (1917), was written by the Uruguayan composer Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez.[18] The candombe is a folk dance performed at Carnival, especially Uruguayan Carnival, mainly by Uruguayans of African ancestry.[18] The guitar is the preferred musical instrument, and in a popular traditional contest called the payada two singers, each with a guitar, take turns improvising verses to the same tune.[18] Folk music is called canto popular and includes some guitar players and singers such as Alfredo Zitarrosa, Jos\u00e9 Carbajal \"El Sabalero\", Daniel Viglietti, Los Olimare\u00f1os, and Numa Moraes. Numerous radio stations and musical events reflect the popularity of rock music and the Caribbean genres, known as m\u00fasica tropical (\"tropical music\").[18] Early classical music in Uruguay showed heavy Spanish and Italian influence, but since the 20th century a number of composers of classical music, including Eduardo Fabini, Vicente Ascone (es), and H\u00e9ctor Tosar, have made use of Latin American musical idioms.[18] Tango has also had an impact on Uruguayan culture, especially during the 20th century, especially the \u00b430s and \u00b440s with Uruguayan singers such as Julio Sosa from Las Piedras.[98] When the famous tango singer Carlos Gardel was 29 years old he changed his nationality to be Uruguayan, saying he was born in Tacuaremb\u00f3, but this subterfuge was probably done to keep French authorities from arresting him for failing to register in the French Army for World War I. Gardel was born in France and was raised in Buenos Aires. He never lived in Uruguay.[99] Nevertheless, a Carlos Gardel museum was established in 1999 in Valle Ed\u00e9n, near Tacuaremb\u00f3.[100] Rock and roll first broke into Uruguayan audiences with the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands in the early 1960s. A wave of bands appeared in Montevideo, including Los Shakers, Los Mockers, Los Iracundos, Los Moonlights, and Los Malditos, who became major figures in the so-called Uruguayan Invasion of Argentina.[101] Popular bands of the Uruguayan Invasion sang in English. Popular Uruguayan rock bands include La Vela Puerca, No Te Va Gustar, El Cuarteto de Nos, Once Tiros, La Trampa, Chalamadre, Snake, Buitres, and Cursi. In 2004, the Uruguayan musician and actor Jorge Drexler won an Academy Award for composing the song \"Al otro lado del r\u00edo\" from the movie The Motorcycle Diaries, which narrated the life of Che Guevara. Literature Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 Main article: Uruguayan literature Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 (1871\u20131917), a modernist, is considered Uruguay's most significant literary figure.[18] His book Ariel (1900) deals with the need to maintain spiritual values while pursuing material and technical progress.[18] Besides stressing the importance of upholding spiritual over materialistic values, it also stresses resisting cultural dominance by Europe and the United States.[18] The book continues to influence young writers.[18] Notable amongst Latin American playwrights is Florencio S\u00e1nchez (1875\u20131910), who wrote plays about contemporary social problems that are still performed today.[18] From about the same period came the romantic poetry of Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1855\u20131931), who wrote epic poems about Uruguayan history. Also notable are Juana de Ibarbourou (1895\u20131979), Delmira Agustini (1866\u20131914), Idea Vilari\u00f1o (1920\u20132009), and the short stories of Horacio Quiroga and Juan Jos\u00e9 Morosoli (1899\u20131959).[18] The psychological stories of Juan Carlos Onetti (such as \"No Man's Land\" and \"The Shipyard\") have earned widespread critical praise, as have the writings of Mario Benedetti.[18] Uruguay's best-known contemporary writer is Eduardo Galeano, author of Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (1971; \"Open Veins of Latin America\") and the trilogy Memoria del fuego (1982\u201387; \"Memory of Fire\").[18] Other modern Uruguayan writers include Mario Levrero, Sylvia Lago, Jorge Majfud, and Jes\u00fas Moraes.[18] Uruguayans of many classes and backgrounds enjoy reading historietas, comic books that often blend humour and fantasy with thinly veiled social criticism.[18] Media The Reporters Without Borders worldwide press freedom index has ranked Uruguay as 37th of 178 reported countries in 2010.[102] Freedom of speech and media are guaranteed by the constitution, with qualifications for inciting violence or \"insulting the nation\".[69] Uruguayans have access to more than 100 private daily and weekly newspapers, more than 100 radio stations, and some 20 terrestrial television channels, and cable TV is widely available.[69] Uruguay's long tradition of freedom of the press was severely curtailed during the years of military dictatorship. On his first day in office in March 1985, Sanguinetti re-established complete freedom of the press.[103] Consequently, Montevideo's newspapers, which account for all of Uruguay's principal daily newspapers, greatly expanded their circulations.[103] State-run radio and TV are operated by the official broadcasting service SODRE.[69] Some newspapers are owned by, or linked to, the main political parties.[69] El D\u00eda was the nation's most prestigious paper until its demise in the early 1990s, founded in 1886 by the Colorado party leader and (later) president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. El Pa\u00eds, the paper of the rival Blanco Party, has the largest circulation.[18] B\u00fasqueda is Uruguay's most important weekly news magazine and serves as an important forum for political and economic analysis.[103] Although it sells only about 16,000 copies a week, its estimated readership exceeds 50,000.[103] MercoPress is an independent news agency focusing on news related to Mercosur and is based in Montevideo.[104] Cuisine Main article: Uruguayan cuisine The local hot drink mate being consumed in transit Beef is fundamental to Uruguayan cuisine, and the country is one of the world's top consumers of red meat per capita. Asado, a kind of barbecued beef, is the national dish in Uruguay, and other popular foods include beef platters, chivito (steak sandwiches), pasta, barbecued kidneys, and sausages. Locally produced soft drinks, beer, and wine are commonly served, as is cleric\u00f3, a mixture of fruit juice and wine. Uruguay and Argentina share a national drink called mate. Grappamiel, made with alcohol and honey, is served in the cold mornings of autumn and winter to warm up the body. Often locals can be seen carrying leather cases containing a thermos of hot water, the traditional hollowed gourd called a mate or guampa, a metal straw called a bombilla, and the dried yerba mate leaves. Sweet treats, including cr\u00e8me caramel with dulce de leche and alfajores (shortbread cookies), are favorites for desserts or afternoon snacks. Other Uruguayan dishes include morcilla dulce (a type of blood sausage cooked with ground orange fruit, orange peel, and walnuts), chorizo, milanesa (a breaded veal cutlet similar to the Austrian Wiener Schnitzel), snacks such as ol\u00edmpicos (club sandwiches), h\u00fangaras (spicy sausage in a hot dog roll), \"tortas fritas\" (similar to elephant ears, and traditionally eaten when it rains), \"martin fierro\" (a bread-less sandwich of cheese and quince paste), postre chaja (a cake made mostly from meringue and peaches in syrup), \"pascualina\" (kale and egg pie), \"pastafrola\" (a quince pie) and masas surtidas (bite-sized pastries), many of which are of Spanish and Italian origin, like the \"massini\". Sport Centenario Stadium Main article: Sport in Uruguay Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Uruguay. The first international match outside the British Isles was played between Uruguay and Argentina in Montevideo in July 1902.[105] Uruguay won gold at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games[106] and again in 1928 in Amsterdam.[107] The Uruguay national football team has won the FIFA World Cup on two occasions. Uruguay won the inaugural tournament on home soil in 1930 and again in 1950, famously defeating home favourites Brazil in the final match.[108] Uruguay has won the Copa Am\u00e9rica (an international tournament for South American nations and guests) more than any other country, their victory in 2011 making a total of 15 Copa Am\u00e9ricas won. Uruguay has by far the smallest population of any country that has won a World Cup.[108] Despite their early success, they have only qualified for three of the last six World Cups.[108] Uruguay performed very credibly in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having reached the semi-final for the first time in 40 years. Diego Forl\u00e1n was presented with the Golden Ball award as the best player of the 2010 tournament.[109] In the rankings for June 2012, Uruguay were ranked the second best team in the world, according to the FIFA world rankings, their highest ever point in football history, falling short of the first spot to the Spain national football team.[110] Uruguay exported 1,414 football players during the 2000s, almost as many players as Brazil and Argentina.[111] In 2010, the Uruguayan government enacted measures intended to retain players in the country.[111] Football was taken to Uruguay by English sailors and labourers in the late 19th century. Less successfully, they introduced rugby and cricket. There are two Montevideo-based football clubs, Nacional and Pe\u00f1arol, who are successful in domestic and South American tournaments and have won three Intercontinental Cups each. Education Main article: Education in Uruguay Education in Uruguay is secular, free,[112] and compulsory for 14 years, starting at the age of 4.[113] The system is divided into six levels of education: early childhood (3\u20135 years); primary (6\u201311 years); basic secondary (12\u201314 years); upper secondary (15\u201317 years); higher education (18 and up); and post-graduate education.[113] Public education is the primary responsibility of three institutions: the Ministry of Education and Culture, which coordinates education policies, the National Public Education Administration, which formulates and implements policies on early to secondary education, and the University of the Republic, responsible for higher education.[113] In 2009, the government planned to invest 4.5% of GDP in education.[112] Uruguay ranks high on standardised tests such as PISA at a regional level, but compares unfavourably to the OECD average, and is also below some countries with similar levels of income.[112] In the 2006 PISA test, Uruguay had one of the greatest standard deviations among schools, suggesting significant variability by socio-economic level.[112] Uruguay is part of the One Laptop per Child project, and in 2009 became the first country in the world to provide a laptop for every primary school student,[114] as part of the Plan Ceibal.[115] Over the 2007\u20132009 period, 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers were involved in the scheme; around 70% of the laptops were given to children who did not have computers at home.[115] The OLPC programme represents less than 5% of the country's education budget.

In \"Hooligans \u2013 Eine Welt zwischen Fu\u00dfball, Gewalt und Politik\" geht es um die Professionalisierung der Szene im Kampfsportbereich, \"Ackermatches\" und einen Rechtsruck in deutschen Fankurven. Neuer Abschnitt sportschau.de: Herr Claus, fangen wir ganz am Anfang an: Was ist ein Hooligan? Robert Claus: Hooligans sind eine in den 60er Jahren in Gro\u00dfbritannien aus der Arbeiterschicht entstandene gewaltt\u00e4tige und sehr m\u00e4nnlich gepr\u00e4gte Jugendkultur. Sie versucht, durch ihre Gewalt gesellschaftliche Teilhabe und Protest auszu\u00fcben. Das war zun\u00e4chst bei Tanz- und Discoveranstaltungen, dann schnell beim Fu\u00dfball. Vor allem in den 80er und 90er Jahren waren Hooligans dann sehr pr\u00e4sent in deutschen Stadien, Gruppen wie die \"Borussenfront\" aus Dortmund oder die \"Gelsenszene\" auf Schalke. Um die Jahrtausendwende schienen Hooligans in Deutschland dann urpl\u00f6tzlich verschwunden. Warum? Robert Claus: Da gibt es mehrere Faktoren. Bei der WM 1998 haben deutsche Hooligans den franz\u00f6sischen Polizisten Daniel Nivel fast zu Tode gepr\u00fcgelt. Infolgedessen stiegen polizeiliche Repression und das Vorgehen der Verb\u00e4nde massiv an. Hinzu kam die Ultrabewegung, die Ultras haben in vielen Stadien das Heft in die Hand genommen. Diese Entwicklungen f\u00fchrten dazu, dass die Szene den Fu\u00dfball ein St\u00fcck weit verlie\u00df. Man traf sich auf Ackern oder Feldern, um sich dort eine Pr\u00fcgelei nach klaren Regeln zu liefern, ein sogenanntes \"Ackermatch\". Parallel war eine Professionalisierung zu beobachten. Dar\u00fcber hinaus wird durch die Sozialen Medien heute viel mehr sichtbar als vor 20 Jahren. Ganz verschwunden waren sie also nie. Wie sieht diese Professionalisierung aus? Robert Claus: Die erste Generation \"Hooligans\" hat kaum professionellen Kampfsport betrieben, war nicht international vernetzt, hatte nicht die Organisationsm\u00f6glichkeiten sozialer Medien und keine verschl\u00fcsselte Kommunikation. Das ist bei der neuen Generation alles der Fall. Sie betreiben Mixed Martial Arts und Kickboxen, teilweise professionell wie das \"Imperium Fight Team\" aus Leipzig, das von einem Hooligan aus dem Umfeld von Lok Leipzig gegr\u00fcndet wurde. Und die \"Ackermatches\" werden verschl\u00fcsselt im Netz organisiert. Ist die Gefahr durch diese Professionalisierung gr\u00f6\u00dfer geworden? Robert Claus: Die Gefahr im Umfeld von Fu\u00dfballspielen ist deutlich geringer als in den 80er oder 90er Jahren. Die \"Ackermatches\" finden nur unter Hooligans statt, das bekommt der normale Stadiong\u00e4nger nicht mit. Sie schreiben in ihrem Buch aber auch dar\u00fcber, dass Hooligangewalt nach au\u00dfen getragen wird. Wie sieht das aus? Robert Claus: Ein Beispiel ist Leipzig. Als der Pegida-Ableger Legida im Januar 2016 Geburtstag feierte, zogen rund 250 Neonazis randalierend durch den alternativen Stadtteil Connewitz. Da waren auch viele Hooligans aus Leipzig und dem Umland dabei. Nicht der einzige Fall von nach au\u00dfen getragener Gewalt: Man erinnere sich an den Hooligans-gegen-Salafisten-Bewegung (HoGeSa) 2014. Hooligans bei der HoGeSa-Demonstration in K\u00f6ln Robert Claus: Bei HoGeSa trafen sich Alt-Hools jenseits der 40, von denen einige im Rocker- oder Security-Milieu abgetaucht waren. Im Zuge der Debatte um Gefl\u00fcchtete gab es dann diese Protestbewegung. Das war zum einen eine Machtprobe der alten K\u00e4mpfer. Zum anderen darf man auch nicht vergessen: Viele Hooligans haben prekarisierte Jobs, Altersarmut ist quasi programmiert. Der rechte Sozialprotest wurde vom gemeinsamen Feindbild der Einwanderung geeint. Ein einendes Element scheinen rechte Lebenswelten zu sein. Das passt zum Rechtsruck in den Stadien, von dem in den vergangenen Jahren h\u00e4ufig die Rede war. Sehen Sie da einen Zusammenhang mit dem Wiedererstarken der Hooliganszene? Claus: Man muss vorsichtig sein: Viele Hooligans sind Neonazis, aber eben nicht alle. Die bewegen sich eher in einer m\u00e4nnerb\u00fcndischen Szene. Dieser angesprochene Rechtsruck findet gesamtgesellschaftlich statt, das geht auch am Fu\u00dfball nicht spurlos vorbei. Es gab in den vergangenen Jahren Abspaltungen von eher rechten, gewaltt\u00e4tigen Gruppen, die andere Fans mit Gewaltdrohungen unter Druck setzen. Das haben wir z.B. in Aachen gesehen, in Dortmund oder in Berlin. Teile von ihnen stehen der Partei \"Die Rechte\" oder auch der AfD nahe. Welche Standorte sind aktuell besonders umk\u00e4mpft? Protest gegen die AfD von Ultra-Fans in K\u00f6ln Claus: Jenseits der Orte mit klassischen linken Fanszenen wie St. Pauli oder Babelsberg sind fast alle umk\u00e4mpft. An manchen ist das deutlicher, an manchen weniger. Daf\u00fcr sind die Fanszenen schlicht zu ausdifferenziert. Ein Beispiel ist K\u00f6ln. Es gibt eine Ultraszene, die sich seit vielen Jahren gegen Rassismus engagiert. Gleichzeitig ist ein Teil der gewaltt\u00e4tigen Ultra- und Hooliganszene mit rechtsextremen russischen Kampfsportlern vernetzt. Gewaltt\u00e4tige Ultras mit Verbindungen ins rechtsextreme Milieu? Die Szene selbst zeichnete in den vergangenen Jahren eher ein Bild der Gewaltlosigkeit und politisch aufgekl\u00e4rten Geisteshaltung. Claus: Die Geschichtsschreibung vereinfacht da manchmal zu stark: Erst gab es die rechten, gewaltt\u00e4tigen Hools, dann die linken, an Choreos interessierten Ultras. Doch das ist zu grob. Es gibt Ultras, die sich gegen Rechtsextremismus und Gewalt positionieren, andere stehen Gewalt bzw. Rechtsextremen nah. In dieser Bandbreite und dazwischen finden wir alles. In den aktuellen Fanprotesten spielen Hooligans jedoch keine tragende Rolle. Wem geh\u00f6rt die Kurve heute \u2013 Ultras oder Hooligans? Claus: Auch das ist nicht pauschal zu beantworten. An manchen Standorten haben Ultras und Hooligans sich arg bekriegt um die Macht in der Kurve, in Bremen zum Beispiel, wo eine junge Ultraszene gegen die alten rechten Hooligans vorging. An anderen Standorten wie Kaiserslautern h\u00e4ngt die Fahne der alten Hooligans immer noch neben der Fahne der Ultras. Und zu guter Letzt sind auch Gruppen entstanden, die die Gewalt der Hooligans und die hohe Selbstorganisation der Ultras verbinden, sie lassen sich kaum noch eindeutig zuordnen. Letzten Endes werden Politik und Gewalt in Fankurven st\u00e4ndig verhandelt. Ein Polizist und russische Fu\u00dfballfans stehen sich bei der EM in Frankreich gegen\u00fcber. Dar\u00fcber hinaus d\u00fcrfen wir nicht vergessen, dass wir bei deutschen Fanszenen \u00fcber gro\u00dfe Menschenmengen reden, in Dortmund stehen fast 25.000 Menschen auf der S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne. Wenn wir \u00fcber Hooligans reden oder gewaltt\u00e4tige Ultras, dann reden wir meist \u00fcber nicht mehr als 200 Leute. Das ist in der Promillezahl im gesamten Stadion. Beim Thema Hooligans kommen wir abschlie\u00dfend auch nicht um die WM 2018 herum. Nach den Krawallen russischer Hooligans bei der EM 2016 blicken viele sorgenvoll nach Russland. Was ist da zu erwarten? Claus: Russische Hooligans trainieren Kampfsport, sind teilweise milit\u00e4risch organisiert und vor allem durchweg neonazistisch eingestellt. Aber der russische Staat hat keinerlei Interesse, sich die WM kaputt machen zu lassen. Vor gut einem Jahr wurde der Chef der russischen Fanf\u00f6deration, ein rechter Alt-Hooligan, auf einer Tagung medienwirksam festgenommen. Das war auch inszeniert, um ein Zeichen zu setzen. Es k\u00f6nnte also einen unausgesprochenen Deal geben, dass die russischen Hooligans in den Innenst\u00e4dten bei der WM nicht viel unternehmen. Vorsicht bleibt aber weiter geboten. Fanforscher Robert Claus Zur Person: Robert Claus arbeitet f\u00fcr die Kompetenzgruppe Fankulturen & Sportbezogene Soziale Arbeit (Kofas). Seine Schwerpunkte sind Rechtsextremismus und Hooliganismus. In seinem neuen Buch \"Hooligans \u2013 Eine Welt zwischen Fu\u00dfball, Gewalt und Politik\" beschreibt er die Entwicklung der Szene in Deutschland.

Como presidente da Frente Parlamentar das Pessoas com Defici\u00eancia, a deputada elogiou a decis\u00e3o do Minist\u00e9rio da Educa\u00e7\u00e3o de ampliar o debate sobre a inclus\u00e3o social do segmento:  \u201cPara al\u00e9m do tema da reda\u00e7\u00e3o do ENEM, o MEC tamb\u00e9m nos brindou com o uso de tecnologia assistiva, oferecendo por meio de v\u00eddeo, a prova traduzida em Libras para que os estudantes surdos pudessem responder as quest\u00f5es de forma mais inclusiva\u201d. Socorro Pimentel , do PSL, registrou a campanha Novembro Azul, que tem por objetivo conscientizar os homens a respeito do c\u00e2ncer de pr\u00f3stata. Dados apresentados pela deputada afirmam que a doen\u00e7a \u00e9 o segundo tipo de c\u00e2ncer com maior incid\u00eancia no pa\u00eds e no mundo. Henrique Queiroz , do PR, lamentou a morte do ex-deputado estadual Roosevelt Gon\u00e7alves. O parlamentar apontou qualidades do pol\u00edtico, a exemplo da maneira cordial com que tratava a todos. Os deputados fizeram um minuto de sil\u00eancio em homenagem ao ex-parlamentar. A divulga\u00e7\u00e3o do recadastramento do Benef\u00edcio de Presta\u00e7\u00e3o Continuada, por parte do Governo Federal, foi criticada pela deputada  Teresa Leit\u00e3o , do PT. Segundo a parlamentar, o processo n\u00e3o atingiu 10% dos credenciados:  \u201cQue haja esse alerta. Sen\u00e3o as pessoas ser\u00e3o prejudicadas, porque n\u00e3o haver\u00e1 novo prazo. Segundo o decreto, que \u00e9 bastante claro, n\u00e3o se cadastrou, automaticamente perde o benef\u00edcio\u201d. Delibera\u00e7\u00f5es da audi\u00eancia p\u00fablica realizada em Limoeiro, Agreste Setentrional, para debater a situa\u00e7\u00e3o da Barragem de Jucazinho, foram apresentadas pelo presidente da Comiss\u00e3o de Meio Ambiente,  Z\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio , do PP. Segundo o parlamentar, o encontro, promovido no fim de outubro, discutiu o risco de rompimento da barragem e a pereniza\u00e7\u00e3o do Rio Capibaribe.  \u201cBem como a necessidade de novos investimentos do Governo Federal junto com  apoio t\u00e9cnico do DNOCs, Compesa e APAC, e as alternativas de abastecimento da regi\u00e3o\u201d.     Os 55 anos do Ceasa, comemorados no \u00faltimo m\u00eas de outubro, foram enaltecidos pela deputada  Laura Gomes , do PSB.

O parlamentar comentou que, no \u00faltimo fim de semana, moradores da regi\u00e3o do Agreste Meridional realizaram mutir\u00e3o para tapar buracos da PE-160. O deputado ainda solicitou ao Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem e \u00e0 Secretaria Estadual de Transporte, a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da PE-177. Presidente da  Comiss\u00e3o de Cidadania  da Alepe, o deputado  Edilson Silva , do PSOL, anunciou que vai participar do Encontro Nacional de Direitos Humanos, promovido pela C\u00e2mara Federal nos pr\u00f3ximos dias 8 e 9 de novembro. Os constantes aumentos no pre\u00e7o do g\u00e1s de cozinha foram registrados no pronunciamento do deputado  Rodrigo Novaes , do PSD. O parlamentar salientou que seis reajustes foram anunciados pelo Governo Federal entre junho e novembro desse ano.  \u201c\u00c9 de se imaginar por exemplo, que um sujeito que recebe 900 reais, aproximadamente, separa 10% do seu or\u00e7amento para poder pagar o g\u00e1s de cozinha. Isso significa dizer que, daqui a pouco, as pessoas mais pobres est\u00e3o voltando a utilizar o fog\u00e3o \u00e0 lenha, porque o g\u00e1s de cozinha est\u00e1 virando um artigo de luxo.\u201d O lan\u00e7amento da campanha Vidas Negras, promovido pela ONU, foi elogiado pelo deputado  Isaltino Nascimento , do PSB.

Weitere Informationen Nordamerika: Teslagrad erscheint vermutlich im Dezember im Nintendo eShop Nintendo Switch Nintendo eShop 10:00 - 07.11.2017 | Software Mit Teslagrad haben Rain Games einen interessanten Genremix erschaffen. Das Videospiel bedient sich sowohl an Plattformer-Elementen als auch kniffeligen Puzzleeinlagen, die eure grauen Zellen m\u00e4chtig ins Schwitzen bringen sollen. Eine weitere Besonderheit ist, dass das Spiel komplett von Hand gezeichnet ist. Jeder Charakter, Gegner und Hintergrund, den man zu sehen bekommen, verbreitet dabei ein ganz eigenes Flair und hat eine sehr pers\u00f6nliche Note. Bereits vor einiger Zeit wurde angek\u00fcndigt, dass der Titel auch f\u00fcr die Nintendo Switch erscheinen soll. In Japan gibt es sogar schon ein festes Datum: Am 16. November wird es so weit sein. Wann wir in Europa in den Genuss des Videospiel-Kleinods kommen, ist noch nicht bekannt. F\u00fcr unsere Kollegen in Nordamerika wird es indes jedoch spannend. Deren Nintendo eShop listet den Titel n\u00e4mlich derzeit f\u00fcr den 7. Dezember.

It is bordered by Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the R\u00edo de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people,[7] of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately 176,000 square kilometres (68,000 sq mi), Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America after Suriname. Uruguay was inhabited by the Charr\u00faa people for approximately 4000 years before the Portuguese established Colonia del Sacramento, one of the oldest European settlements in the country, in 1680. Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the Spanish in the early 18th century, signifying the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Spain, Portugal, Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics until the late 20th century. Modern Uruguay is a democratic constitutional republic, with a president who serves as both head of state and head of government. Uruguay is ranked first in Latin America in democracy, peace, lack of corruption,[8] e-government,[9] and is first in South America when it comes to press freedom, size of the middle class and prosperity.[8] On a per-capita basis, Uruguay contributes more troops to United Nations peace-keeping missions than any other country.[8] It ranks second in the region on economic freedom, income equality, per-capita income and inflows of FDI.[8] Uruguay is the third-best country on the continent in terms of HDI, GDP growth,[10] innovation and infrastructure.[8] It is regarded as a high-income country (top group) by the UN.[9] Uruguay is also the third-best ranked in the world in e-Participation.[9] Uruguay is an important global exporter of combed wool, rice, soybeans, frozen beef, malt and milk.[8] The Economist named Uruguay \"country of the year\" in 2013,[11] acknowledging the innovative policy of legalizing the production, sale and consumption of cannabis. Same-sex marriage and abortion are also legal, leading Uruguay to be regarded as one of the most liberal nations in the world, and one of the most socially developed, outstanding regionally,[12] and ranking highly on global measures of personal rights, tolerance, and inclusion issues.[13] Contents 1 Etymology 2 History 2.1 Early colonisation 2.2 Independence struggle (1811\u20131830) 2.3 Blancos\u2013Colorados conflicts 2.3.1 Mass immigration and development 2.4 20th century 2.4.1 Return to democracy (1984\u2013present) 3 Geography 4 Flora 5 Environment 5.1 Climate 5.2 Green Energy Supply 6 Government 6.1 Administrative divisions 6.2 Foreign relations 6.3 Military 7 Economy 7.1 Agriculture 7.2 Transportation 7.3 Telecommunications 7.4 Water supply and sanitation 8 Demographics 8.1 Largest cities 8.2 Health 8.3 Religion 8.4 Language 9 Culture 9.1 Visual arts 9.2 Music 9.3 Literature 9.4 Media 9.5 Cuisine 9.6 Sport 10 Education 11 See also 12 Notes 13 References 14 Further reading 15 External links Etymology The name of the namesake river comes from the Spanish pronunciation of the regional Guarani word for it. There are several interpretations, including \"bird-river\" (\"the river of the ur\u00fa\", via Charruan, ur\u00fa being a common noun of any wild fowl).[14][15] The name could also refer a river snail called urugu\u00e1 (Pomella megastoma) that was plentiful in the water.[16] In Spanish colonial times, and for some time thereafter, Uruguay and some neighbouring territories were called the Cisplatina and Banda Oriental [del Uruguay] (\"East Bank [of the river Uruguay]\"), then for a few years the \"Eastern Province\", and after independence ultimately became la Rep\u00fablica Oriental del Uruguay, translated either as the \"Oriental Republic of Uruguay\"[17][18] or the \"Eastern Republic of Uruguay\".[19] History Main article: History of Uruguay The only documented inhabitants of Uruguay before European colonization of the area were the Charr\u00faa, a small tribe driven south by the Guarani of Paraguay.[20] Early colonisation The Portuguese discovered the region of present-day Uruguay in 1512.[21][22] The Spanish arrived in present-day Uruguay in 1516.[20] The indigenous peoples' fierce resistance to conquest, combined with the absence of gold and silver, limited their settlement in the region during the 16th and 17th centuries.[20] Uruguay then became a zone of contention between the Spanish and Portuguese empires. In 1603, the Spanish began to introduce cattle, which became a source of wealth in the region. The first permanent Spanish settlement was founded in 1624 at Soriano on the R\u00edo Negro. In 1669\u201371, the Portuguese built a fort at Colonia del Sacramento. Spanish colonization increased as Spain sought to limit Portugal's expansion of Brazil's frontiers.[citation needed] Montevideo was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold in the country. Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with R\u00edo de la Plata's capital, Buenos Aires.[20] Uruguay's early 19th century history was shaped by ongoing fights for dominance in the Platine region,[20] between British, Spanish, Portuguese and other colonial forces. In 1806 and 1807, the British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires and Montevideo as part of the Napoleonic Wars. Montevideo was occupied by a British force from February to September 1807. Independence struggle (1811\u20131830) The oath of the Thirty-Three Orientals by Uruguayan painter Juan Manuel Blanes Further information: Banda Oriental, Liga Federal, and Cisplatina In 1811, Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas, who became Uruguay's national hero, launched a successful revolution against the Spanish authorities, defeating them on 18 May at the Battle of Las Piedras.[20] In 1813, the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism, demanding political and economic autonomy for each area, and for the Banda Oriental in particular.[23] The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental, however, and Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism.[23] As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815.[23] Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn, the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government.[23] Artigas organized the Federal League under his protection, consisting of six provinces, four of which later became part of Argentina.[23] In 1816, a force of 10,000 Portuguese troops invaded the Banda Oriental from Brazil; they took Montevideo in January 1817.[23] After nearly four more years of struggle, Portuguese Brazil annexed the Banda Oriental as a province under the name of \"Cisplatina\".[23] The Brazilian Empire became independent from Portugal in 1822. In response to the annexation, the Thirty-Three Orientals, led by Juan Antonio Lavalleja, declared independence on 25 August 1825 supported by the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata (present-day Argentina).[20] This led to the 500-day-long Cisplatine War. Neither side gained the upper hand and in 1828 the Treaty of Montevideo, fostered by the United Kingdom, gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state. The nation's first constitution was adopted on 18 July 1830.[20] Blancos\u2013Colorados conflicts Manuel Oribe, leader of Blancos Further information: Uruguayan Civil War The Battle of Caseros, 1852 At the time of independence, Uruguay had an estimated population of just under 75,000.[24] Era from independence until 1904 was marked by regular military conflicts and civil wars between the Blanco and Colorado Parties. The political scene in Uruguay became split between two parties: the conservative Blancos (Whites) headed by the second President Manuel Oribe, representing the agricultural interests of the countryside; and the liberal Colorados (Reds) led by the first President Fructuoso Rivera, representing the business interests of Montevideo. The Uruguayan parties received support from warring political factions in neighboring Argentina, which became involved in Uruguayan affairs. The Colorados favored the exiled Argentine liberal Unitarios, many of whom had taken refuge in Montevideo while the Blanco president Manuel Oribe was a close friend of the Argentine ruler Manuel de Rosas. On 15 June 1838, an army led by the Colorado leader Rivera overthrew President Oribe, who fled to Argentina.[24] Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839. The conflict would last 13 years and become known as the Guerra Grande (the Great War).[24] In 1843, an Argentine army overran Uruguay on Oribe's behalf, but failed to take the capital. The siege of Montevideo, which began in February 1843, would last nine years.[25] The besieged Uruguayans called on resident foreigners for help, which led to a French and an Italian legion being formed, the latter led by the exiled Giuseppe Garibaldi.[25] In 1845, Britain and France intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region. Their efforts proved ineffective and, by 1849, tired of the war, both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas.[25] It appeared that Montevideo would finally fall when an uprising against Rosas, led by Justo Jos\u00e9 de Urquiza governor of Argentina's Entre R\u00edos Province began. The Brazilian intervention in May 1851 on behalf of the Colorados, combined with the uprising, changed the situation and Oribe was defeated. The siege of Montevideo was lifted and the Guerra Grande finally came to an end.[25] Montevideo rewarded Brazil's support by signing treaties that confirmed Brazil's right to intervene in Uruguay's internal affairs.[25] In accordance with the 1851 treaties, Brazil intervened militarily in Uruguay as often as it deemed necessary.[26] In 1865, the Triple Alliance was formed by the emperor of Brazil, the president of Argentina, and the Colorado general Venancio Flores, the Uruguayan head of government whom they both had helped to gain power. The Triple Alliance declared war on the Paraguayan leader Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez[26] and the resulting Paraguayan War ended with the invasion of Paraguay and its defeat by the armies of the three countries. Montevideo, which was used as a supply station by the Brazilian navy, experienced a period of prosperity and relative calm during the war.[26] The constitutional government of General Lorenzo Batlle y Grau (1868\u201372) suppressed Revolution of the Lances by the Blancos.[27] After two years of struggle, a peace agreement was signed in 1872 that gave the Blancos a share in the emoluments and functions of government, through control of four of the departments of Uruguay.[27] This establishment of the policy of co-participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise, based on the coexistence of the party in power and the party in opposition.[27] Despite this agreement, Colorado rule was threatened by the failed Tricolor Revolution in 1875 and Revolution of the Quebracho in 1886. The Colorado effort to reduce Blancos to only three departments caused a Blanco uprising of 1897, that ended with creation of 16 departments out of which Blancos now had control over six. Blancos were given 1/3 of seats in Congress.[28] This division of power lasted until the President Jose Batlle y Ordonez instituted his political reforms which caused the last uprising by Blancos in 1904 that ended with the Battle of Masoller and death of Blanco leader Aparicio Saravia. Between 1875 and 1890, the military became the center of power.[29] During this authoritarian period, the government took steps toward the organization of the country as a modern state, encouraging its economic and social transformation. Pressure groups (consisting mainly of businessmen, hacendados, and industrialists) were organized and had a strong influence on government.[29] A transition period (1886\u201390) followed, during which politicians began recovering lost ground and some civilian participation in government occurred.[29] Mass immigration and development Main article: Immigration to Uruguay Juan Idiarte Borda (1844\u20131897), 17th President of Uruguay and the only one assassinated. After the Guerra Grande, there was a sharp rise in the number of immigrants, primarily from Italy and Spain. By 1879, the total population of the country was over 438,500.[30] The economy saw a steep upswing, above all in livestock raising and exports.[30] Montevideo became a major economic centre of the region and an entrep\u00f4t for goods from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.[30] 20th century The Colorado leader Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez was elected president in 1903.[31] The following year, the Blancos led a rural revolt and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader, Aparicio Saravia, was killed in battle. Government forces emerged victorious, leading to the end of the co-participation politics that had begun in 1872.[31] Batlle had two terms (1903\u201307 and 1911\u201315) during which, taking advantage of the nation's stability and growing economic prosperity, he instituted major reforms, such as a welfare program, government participation in many facets of the economy, and a plural executive.[20] Gabriel Terra became president in March 1931. His inauguration coincided with the effects of the Great Depression,[32] and the social climate became tense as a result of the lack of jobs. There were confrontations in which police and leftists died.[32] In 1933, Terra organized a coup d'\u00e9tat, dissolving the General Assembly and governing by decree.[32] A new constitution was promulgated in 1934, transferring powers to the president.[32] In general, the Terra government weakened or neutralized economic nationalism and social reform.[32] In 1938, general elections were held and Terra's brother-in-law, General Alfredo Baldomir, was elected president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections, freedom of the press, and a new constitution.[33] Although Baldomir declared Uruguay neutral in 1939, British warships and the German ship Admiral Graf Spee fought a battle not far off Uruguay's coast.[33] The Admiral Graf Spee took refuge in Montevideo, claiming sanctuary in a neutral port, but was later ordered out.[33] In the late 1950s, partly because of a world-wide decrease in demand for agricultural products, Uruguayans suffered from a steep drop in their standard of living, which led to student militancy and labor unrest. An armed group known as the Tupamaros emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank robbery, kidnapping and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government. President Jorge Pacheco declared a state of emergency in 1968, followed by a further suspension of civil liberties in 1972. In 1973, amid increasing economic and political turmoil, the armed forces, asked by the President Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry, closed the Congress and established a civilian-military regime.[20] Around 200 Uruguayans are known to have been killed and disappeared, with hundreds more illegally detained and tortured during the 12-year civil-military rule of 1973 to 1985.[34] Most were killed in Argentina and other neighbouring countries, with 36 of them having been killed in Uruguay.[35] Return to democracy (1984\u2013present) The then-Uruguayan president Jorge Batlle with former U.S. president George H. W. Bush in 2003. A new constitution, drafted by the military, was rejected in a November 1980 referendum.[20] Following the referendum, the armed forces announced a plan for the return to civilian rule, and national elections were held in 1984.[20] Colorado Party leader Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti won the presidency and served from 1985 to 1990. The first Sanguinetti administration implemented economic reforms and consolidated democracy following the country's years under military rule.[20] The National Party's Luis Alberto Lacalle won the 1989 presidential election and amnesty for human rights abusers was endorsed by referendum. Sanguinetti was then re-elected in 1994.[36] Both presidents continued the economic structural reforms initiated after the reinstatement of democracy, and other important reforms were aimed at improving the electoral system, social security, education, and public safety. The 1999 national elections were held under a new electoral system established by a 1996 constitutional amendment. Colorado Party candidate Jorge Batlle, aided by the support of the National Party, defeated Broad Front candidate Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez. The formal coalition ended in November 2002, when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet,[20] although the Blancos continued to support the Colorados on most issues. Low commodity prices and economic difficulties in Uruguay's main export markets (starting in Brazil with the devaluation of the real, then in Argentina in 2002), caused a severe recession; the economy contracted by 11%, unemployment climbed to 21%, and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty rose to over 30%.[37] Bicentennial celebrations in 2011. The image shows 500 school children from 19 schools across the country gathered at the Palacio Legislativo. In 2004, Uruguayans elected Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez as president, while giving the Broad Front a majority in both houses of Parliament. V\u00e1zquez stuck to economic orthodoxy. As commodity prices soared and the economy recovered from recession, he tripled foreign investment, cut poverty and unemployment, cut public debt from 79% of GDP to 60%, and kept inflation steady.[38] In 2009, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, a former left-wing militant who spent almost 15 years in prison during the country's military rule, emerged as the new President as the Broad Front won the election for a second time.[39] Abortion was legalized in 2012, followed by same-sex marriage and cannabis in the following year. Geography A satellite image of Uruguay. Main article: Geography of Uruguay See also: Geology of Uruguay With 176,214 km2 (68,037 sq mi) of continental land and 142,199 km2 (54,903 sq mi) of jurisdictional water and small river islands,[40] Uruguay is the second smallest sovereign nation in South America (after Suriname) and the third smallest territory (French Guiana is the smallest).[17] The landscape features mostly rolling plains and low hill ranges (cuchillas) with a fertile coastal lowland.[17] Uruguay has 660 km (410 mi) of coastline.[17] A dense fluvial network covers the country, consisting of four river basins, or deltas: the R\u00edo de la Plata Basin, the Uruguay River, the Laguna Mer\u00edn and the R\u00edo Negro. The major internal river is the R\u00edo Negro ('Black River'). Several lagoons are found along the Atlantic coast. The highest point in the country is the Cerro Catedral, whose peak reaches 514 metres (1,686 ft) AMSL in the Sierra Carap\u00e9 hill range. To the southwest is the R\u00edo de la Plata, the estuary of the Uruguay River (which river forms the country's western border). Montevideo is the southernmost capital city in the Americas, and the third most southerly in the world (only Canberra and Wellington are further south). There are ten national parks in Uruguay: Five in the wetland areas of the east, three in the central hill country, and one in the west along the Rio Uruguay. Flora Main article: Flora of Uruguay Ceibo (Erythrina crista-galli), the national flower in Uruguay Uruguay has about 2500 species distributed in 150 biological families, both native and foreign.[41] \"Ceibo\" or Erythrina crista is the national flower in Uruguay. Environment Climate Maldonado bay. Main article: Climate of Uruguay Located entirely within a temperate zone, Uruguay has a climate that is relatively mild and fairly uniform nationwide.[42] Seasonal variations are pronounced, but extremes in temperature are rare.[42] As would be expected with its abundance of water, high humidity and fog are common.[42] The absence of mountains, which act as weather barriers, makes all locations vulnerable to high winds and rapid changes in weather as fronts or storms sweep across the country.[42] Both summer and winter weather may vary from day to day with the passing of storm fronts, where a hot northerly wind may occasionally be followed by a cold wind (pampero) from the Argentine Pampas.[18] Uruguay has a largely uniform temperature throughout the year, with summers being tempered by winds off the Atlantic; severe cold in winter is unknown.[42][43] The heaviest precipitation occurs during the autumn months, although more frequent rainy spells occur in winter.[18] The mean annual precipitation is generally greater than 40 inches (1,000 mm), decreasing with distance from the sea coast, and is relatively evenly distributed throughout the year.[18] The average temperature for the midwinter month of July varies from 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F) at Salto in the northern interior to 9 \u00b0C (48 \u00b0F) at Montevideo in the south.[18] The midsummer month of January varies from a warm average of 26 \u00b0C (79 \u00b0F) at Salto to 22 \u00b0C (72 \u00b0F) at Montevideo.[18] National extreme temperatures at sea level are, Paysand\u00fa city 44 \u00b0C (111 \u00b0F) (20 January 1943) and Melo city \u221211.0 \u00b0C (12.2 \u00b0F) (14 June 1967).[44] Punta del Este Green Energy Supply Nearly 95%[45] of Uruguay's electricity comes from renewable energy. The dramatic shift, taking less than ten years and without government funding, lowered electricity costs and slashed the country's carbon footprint. [46][47] Most of the electricity comes from hydroelectric facilities and wind parks. Uruguay no longer imports electricity.[48] Government Palacio Legislativo, Montevideo, Uruguay Main article: Politics of Uruguay Uruguay is a representative democratic republic with a presidential system.[49] The members of government are elected for a five-year term by a universal suffrage system.[49] Uruguay is a unitary state: justice, education, health, security, foreign policy and defense are all administered nationwide.[49] The Executive Power is exercised by the president and a cabinet of 13 ministers.[49] The legislative power is constituted by the General Assembly, composed of two chambers: the Chamber of Representatives, consisting of 99 members representing the 19 departments, elected based on proportional representation; and the Chamber of Senators, consisting of 31 members, 30 of whom are elected for a five-year term by proportional representation and the Vice-President, who presides over the chamber.[49] The judicial arm is exercised by the Supreme Court, the Bench and Judges nationwide. The members of the Supreme Court are elected by the General Assembly; the members of the Bench are selected by the Supreme Court with the consent of the Senate; and the judges are directly assigned by the Supreme Court.[49] Uruguay adopted its current constitution in 1967.[citation needed] Many of its provisions were suspended in 1973, but re-established in 1985. Drawing on Switzerland and its use of the initiative, the Uruguayan Constitution also allows citizens to repeal laws or to change the constitution by popular initiative, which culminates in a nationwide referendum. This method has been used several times over the past 15 years: to confirm a law renouncing prosecution of members of the military who violated human rights during the military regime (1973\u20131985); to stop privatization of public utilities companies; to defend pensioners' incomes; and to protect water resources.[50] For most of Uruguay's history, the Partido Colorado has been in government.[citation needed] However, in the Uruguayan general election, 2009, the Broad Front won an absolute majority in Parliamentary elections, and Jos\u00e9 Mujica of the Broad Front defeated Luis Alberto Lacalle of the Blancos to win the presidency. A 2010 Latinobar\u00f3metro poll found that, within Latin America, Uruguayans are among the most supportive of democracy and by far the most satisfied with the way democracy works in their country.[51] Uruguay ranked 27th in the Freedom House \"Freedom in the World\" index. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2012, Uruguay scored an 8.17 in the Democracy Index and ranked equal 18th amongst the 25 countries considered to be full democracies in the world.[52] Uruguay ranks 18th in the World Corruption Perceptions Index composed by Transparency International. Administrative divisions A map of the departments of Uruguay. Main article: Administrative divisions of Uruguay Uruguay is divided into 19 departments whose local administrations replicate the division of the executive and legislative powers.[49] Each department elects its own authorities through a universal suffrage system.[49] The departmental executive authority resides in a superintendent and the legislative authority in a departmental board.[49] Department Capital Area Population (2011 census)[53] km2 sq mi Artigas Artigas 11,928 4,605 73,378 Canelones Canelones 4,536 1,751 520,187 Cerro Largo Melo 13,648 5,270 84,698 Colonia Colonia del Sacramento 6,106 2,358 123,203 Durazno Durazno 11,643 4,495 57,088 Flores Trinidad 5,144 1,986 25,050 Florida Florida 10,417 4,022 67,048 Lavalleja Minas 10,016 3,867 58,815 Maldonado Maldonado 4,793 1,851 164,300 Montevideo Montevideo 530 200 1,319,108 Paysand\u00fa Paysand\u00fa 13,922 5,375 113,124 R\u00edo Negro Fray Bentos 9,282 3,584 54,765 Rivera Rivera 9,370 3,620 103,493 Rocha Rocha 10,551 4,074 68,088 Salto Salto 14,163 5,468 124,878 San Jos\u00e9 San Jos\u00e9 de Mayo 4,992 1,927 108,309 Soriano Mercedes 9,008 3,478 82,595 Tacuaremb\u00f3 Tacuaremb\u00f3 15,438 5,961 90,053 Treinta y Tres Treinta y Tres 9,529 3,679 48,134 Total[note 1] \u2014 175,016 67,574 3,286,314 Note: \"Doesn't include the 1,199 km2 (463 sq mi) artificial lakes on the Rio Negro.\".

Foreign relations Main article: Foreign relations of Uruguay Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez (President from 2005\u20132010, 2015\u2013present) with then-President of Brazil Lula da Silva in 2007. Jos\u00e9 Mujica (President from 2010\u20132015) with then-President of Brazil Lula da Silva in 2010. Jos\u00e9 Mujica with President of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff in 2011. In November 2010, Uruguay ratified the UNASUR Constitutive Treaty, becoming the ninth nation out of twelve to do so. The treaty was written in 2008 and was to come into force 30 days after the date of receipt of the ninth instrument of ratification.[54] Argentina and Brazil are Uruguay's most important trading partners: Argentina accounted for 20% of total imports in 2009.[17] Since bilateral relations with Argentina are considered a priority, Uruguay denies clearance to British naval vessels bound for the Falkland Islands, and prevents them from calling in at Uruguayan territories and ports for supplies and fuel.[55] A rivalry between the port of Montevideo and the port of Buenos Aires, dating back to the times of the Spanish Empire, has been described as a \"port war\". Officials of both countries emphasized the need to end this rivalry in the name of regional integration in 2010.[56] Construction of a controversial pulp paper mill in 2007, on the Uruguayan side of the Uruguay River, caused protests in Argentina over fears that it would pollute the environment and lead to diplomatic tensions between the two countries.[57] The ensuing dispute remained a subject of controversy into 2010, particularly after ongoing reports of increased water contamination in the area were later proven to be from sewage discharge from the town of Gualeguaych\u00fa in Argentina.[58][59] In November 2010, Uruguay and Argentina announced they had reached a final agreement for joint environmental monitoring of the pulp mill.[60] Brazil and Uruguay have signed cooperation agreements on defence, science, technology, energy, river transportation and fishing, with the hope of accelerating political and economic integration between these two neighbouring countries.[61] Uruguay has two uncontested boundary disputes with Brazil, over Isla Brasilera and the 235 km2 (91 sq mi) Invernada River region near Masoller. The two countries disagree on which tributary represents the legitimate source of the Quara\u00ed/Cuareim River, which would define the border in the latter disputed section, according to the 1851 border treaty between the two countries.[17] However, these border disputes have not prevented both countries from having friendly diplomatic relations and strong economic ties. So far, the disputed areas remain de facto under Brazilian control, with little to no actual effort by Uruguay to assert its claims. Uruguay has enjoyed friendly relations with the United States since its transition back to democracy.[37] Commercial ties between the two countries have expanded substantially in recent years, with the signing of a bilateral investment treaty in 2004 and a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement in January 2007.[37] The United States and Uruguay have also cooperated on military matters, with both countries playing significant roles in the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti.[37] President Mujica backed Venezuela's bid to join Mercosur, and supported Venezuelan Economy Minister Ali Rodriguez to become general secretary of UNASUR, a position previously held by N\u00e9stor Kirchner. Venezuela has a deal to sell Uruguay up to 40,000 barrels of oil a day under preferential terms.[62] On 15 March 2011, Uruguay became the seventh South American nation to officially recognize a Palestinian state,[63] although there was no specification for the Palestinian state's borders as part of the recognition. In statements, the Uruguayan government indicated its firm commitment to the Middle East peace process, but refused to specify borders \"to avoid interfering in an issue that would require a bilateral agreement\".[63] Military Main article: Military of Uruguay The Uruguayan armed forces are constitutionally subordinate to the president, through the minister of defense.[20] Armed forces personnel number about 14,000 for the Army, 6,000 for the Navy, and 3,000 for the Air Force.[20] Enlistment is voluntary in peacetime, but the government has the authority to conscript in emergencies.[17] Since May 2009, homosexuals have been allowed to serve openly in the military after the defence minister signed a decree stating that military recruitment policy would no longer discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.[64] In the fiscal year 2010, the United States provided Uruguay with $1.7 million in military assistance, including $1 million in Foreign Military Financing and $480,000 in International Military Education and Training.[37] Uruguay ranks first in the world on a per capita basis for its contributions to the United Nations peacekeeping forces, with 2,513 soldiers and officers in 10 UN peacekeeping missions.[20] As of February 2010, Uruguay had 1,136 military personnel deployed to Haiti in support of MINUSTAH and 1,360 deployed in support of MONUC in the Congo.[20] In December 2010, Uruguayan Major General Gloodtdofsky, was appointed Chief Military Observer and head of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan.[65] Economy Graphical depiction of the country's exports in 28 colour-coded categories. Main article: Economy of Uruguay Uruguay experienced a major economic and financial crisis between 1999 and 2002, principally a spillover effect from the economic problems of Argentina.[37] The economy contracted by 11%, and unemployment climbed to 21%.[37] Despite the severity of the trade shocks, Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its investment-grade sovereign bond rating, one of only two in South America.[66][dated info] In 2004, the Batlle government signed a three-year $1.1 billion stand-by arrangement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), committing the country to a substantial primary fiscal surplus, low inflation, considerable reductions in external debt, and several structural reforms designed to improve competitiveness and attract foreign investment.[37] Uruguay terminated the agreement in 2006 following the early repayment of its debt but maintained a number of the policy commitments.[37] V\u00e1zquez, who assumed the government in March 2005, created the \"Ministry of Social Development\" and sought to reduce the country's poverty rate with a $240 million National Plan to Address the Social Emergency (PANES), which provided a monthly conditional cash transfer of approximately $75 to over 100,000 households in extreme poverty. In exchange, those receiving the benefits were required to participate in community work, ensure that their children attended school daily, and had regular health check-ups.[37] In 2005, Uruguay was the first exporter of software in South America.[67] The Frente Amplio government, while continuing payments on Uruguay's external debt,[68] also undertook an emergency plan to attack the widespread problems of poverty and unemployment.[69] The economy grew at an annual rate of 6.7% during the 2004\u20132008 period.[70] Uruguay's exports markets have been diversified in order to reduce dependency on Argentina and Brazil.[70] Poverty was reduced from 33% in 2002 to 21.7% in July 2008, while extreme poverty dropped from 3.3% to 1.7%.[70] Between the years 2007 and 2009, Uruguay was the only country in the Americas that did not technically experience a recession (two consecutive downward quarters).[71] Unemployment reached a record low of 5.4% in December 2010 before rising to 6.1% in January 2011.[72] While unemployment is still at a low level, the IMF observed a rise in inflationary pressures,[73] and Uruguay's GDP expanded by 10.4% for the first half of 2010.[74] According to IMF estimates, Uruguay was likely to achieve growth in real GDP of between 8% and 8.5% in 2010, followed by 5% growth in 2011 and 4% in subsequent years.[73] Gross public sector debt contracted in the second quarter of 2010, after five consecutive periods of sustained increase, reaching $21.885 billion US dollars, equivalent to 59.5% of the GDP.[75] The growing, use, and sale of cannabis was legalized on 11 December 2013,[76] making Uruguay the first country in the world to fully legalize marijuana. The law was voted at the Uruguayan senate on the same date with 16 votes to approve it and 13 against. Agriculture Main article: Agriculture in Uruguay In 2010, Uruguay's export-oriented agricultural sector contributed to 9.3% of the GDP and employed 13% of the workforce.[17] Official statistics from Uruguay's Agriculture and Livestock Ministry indicate that meat and sheep farming in Uruguay occupies 59.6% of the land. The percentage further increases to 82.4% when cattle breeding is linked to other farm activities such as dairy, forage, and rotation with crops such as rice.[77] According to FAOSTAT, Uruguay is one of the world's largest producers of soybeans (9th), greasy wool (12th), horse meat (14th), beeswax (14th), and quinces (17th). Most farms (25,500 out of 39,120) are family-managed; beef and wool represent the main activities and main source of income for 65% of them, followed by vegetable farming at 12%, dairy farming at 11%, hogs at 2%, and poultry also at 2%.[77] Beef is the main export commodity of the country, totaling over $1 billion US dollars in 2006.[77] In 2007, Uruguay had cattle herds totalling 12 million head, making it the country with the highest number of cattle per capita at 3.8.[77] However, 54% is in the hands of 11% of farmers, who have a minimum of 500 head. At the other extreme, 38% of farmers exploit small lots and have herds averaging below one hundred head.[77] Transportation The Port of Montevideo. Main article: Transport in Uruguay The Port of Montevideo, handling over 1.1 million containers annually, is the most advanced container terminal in South America.[78] Its quay can handle 14-metre draught (46 ft) vessels. Nine straddle cranes allow for 80 to 100 movements per hour.[78] The port of Nueva Palmira is a major regional merchandise transfer point and houses both private and government-run terminals.[79] Carrasco Airport was initially inaugurated in 1947 and in 2009, Puerta del Sur, the airport owner and operator, with an investment of $165 million, commissioned Rafael Vi\u00f1oly Architects to expand and modernize the existing facilities with a spacious new passenger terminal to increase capacity and spur commercial growth and tourism in the region.[80][81] The London-based magazine Frontier chose the Carrasco International Airport, serving Montevideo, as one of the best four airports in the world in its 27th edition. The airport can handle up to 4.5 million users per year.[80] PLUNA was the flag carrier of Uruguay, and was headquartered in Carrasco.[82][83] The Laguna del Sauce Airport, located 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) from Punta del Este, was remodeled in 1997, and runways have been renovated through a private investment concession.[79] The Administraci\u00f3n de Ferrocarriles del Estado is the autonomous agency in charge of rail transport and the maintenance of the railroad network. Uruguay has about 1,200 km (750 mi) of operational railroad track.[17] Until 1947, about 90% of the railroad system was British-owned.[84] In 1949, the government nationalized the railways, along with the electric trams and the Montevideo Waterworks Company.[84] However, in 1985 the \"National Transport Plan\" suggested passenger trains were too costly to repair and maintain.[84] Cargo trains would continue for loads more than 120 tons, but bus transportation became the \"economic\" alternative for travellers.[84] The last passenger train rolled into Montevideo on 2 January 1988.[84] Surfaced roads connect Montevideo to the other urban centers in the country, the main highways leading to the border and neighboring cities. Numerous unpaved roads connect farms and small towns. Overland trade has increased markedly since Mercosur (Southern Common Market) was formed in the 1990s. Most of the country's domestic freight and passenger service is by road rather than rail. Telecommunications Main article: Communications in Uruguay Telecommunications in Uruguay are more developed than in most other Latin American countries, being the first country in the Americas to achieve complete digital telephony coverage in 1997. The telephone system is completely digitized and has very good coverage over all the country. The system is government-owned, and there have been controversial proposals to partially privatize since the 1990s.[citation needed] The mobile phone market is shared by the state-owned ANTEL and two private companies, Movistar and Claro. Water supply and sanitation Main article: Water supply and sanitation in Uruguay Uruguay is the only country in Latin America that has achieved quasi-universal coverage of access to safe drinking Water supply[85] and adequate sanitation.[86] Water service quality is considered good, with practically all localities in Uruguay receiving disinfected water on a continuous basis. 70% of wastewater collected by the national utility was treated. Given these achievements, the government's priority is to improve the efficiency of services and to expand access to sewerage, where appropriate, in areas where on-site sanitation is used. Demographics Racial and Ethnic Composition in Uruguay (2011 census)[1] Race/Colour White \u2009 87.7% Black \u2009 4.6% Indigenous \u2009 2.4% Other/none \u2009 5.1% Asian \u2009 0.2% Further information: Uruguayan people, Demographics of Uruguay, and Italian Uruguayan Montevideo is the capital and largest city of Uruguay Uruguayans are of predominantly European origin, with over 87.7% of the population claiming European descent in the 2011 census.[1] Most Uruguayans of European ancestry are descendants of 19th and 20th century immigrants from Spain and Italy (about one-quarter of the population is of Italian origin),[20] and to a lesser degree France, Germany and Britain.[18] Earlier settlers had migrated from Argentina.[18] People of African descent make up an even smaller proportion of the total.[18] From 1963 to 1985, an estimated 320,000 Uruguayans emigrated.[87] The most popular destinations for Uruguayan emigrants are Argentina, followed by the United States, Australia, Canada, Spain, Italy and France.[87] In 2009, for the first time in 44 years, the country saw an overall positive influx when comparing immigration to emigration. 3,825 residence permits were awarded in 2009, compared with 1,216 in 2005.[88] 50% of new legal residents come from Argentina and Brazil. A migration law passed in 2008 gives immigrants the same rights and opportunities that nationals have, with the requisite of proving a monthly income of $650.[88] Uruguay's rate of population growth is much lower than in other Latin American countries.[18] Its median age is higher than the global average[20] due to its low birth rate, high life expectancy, and relatively high rate of emigration among younger people. A quarter of the population is less than 15 years old and about a sixth are aged 60 and older.[18] Metropolitan Montevideo is the only large city, with around 1.9 million inhabitants, or more than half the country's total population. The rest of the urban population lives in about 30 towns.[20] Largest cities v t e Largest cities or towns in Uruguay http://ift.tt/2a64V1u Rank Name Department Pop. Rank Name Department Pop.

A 2008 survey by the INE of Uruguay showed Catholicism as the main religion, with 45.7% of the population; 9.0% are non-Catholic Christians, 0.6% are Animists or Umbandists (an Afro-Brazilian religion), and 0.4% Jewish. 30.1% reported believing in a god, but not belonging to any religion, while 14% were Atheist or Agnostic.[90] Among the sizeable Armenian community in Montevideo, the dominant religion is Christianity, specifically Armenian Apostolic.[91] Political observers consider Uruguay the most secular country in the Americas.[92] Uruguay's secularization began with the relatively minor role of the church in the colonial era, compared with other parts of the Spanish Empire. The small numbers of Uruguay's Indians and their fierce resistance to proselytism reduced the influence of the ecclesiastical authorities.[93] After independence, anti-clerical ideas spread to Uruguay, particularly from France, further eroding the influence of the church.[94] In 1837, civil marriage was recognized and in 1861 the state took over the running of public cemeteries. In 1907, divorce was legalized and in 1909, all religious instruction was banned from state schools.[93] Under the influence of the innovative Colorado reformer Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez (1903\u20131911), complete separation of church and state was introduced with the new constitution of 1917.[93] Language Main article: Rioplatense Spanish Uruguayan Spanish has some modifications due to the considerable number of Italian immigrants. Immigrants used to speak a mixture of Spanish and Italian known as 'cocoliche' and some of the words are still commonly used by the population. As is the case with neighboring Argentina, Uruguay employs both voseo and ye\u00edsmo (with [\u0283] or [\u0292]). English is common in the business world and its study has risen significantly in recent years, especially among the young. Other languages include Portuguese and Portu\u00f1ol (a mixture of Spanish and Portuguese). Both are spoken in the northern regions near the Brazilian border.[95][96] As few native people exist in the population, no indigenous languages are thought to remain in Uruguay.[97] Culture Main article: Culture of Uruguay Uruguayan culture is strongly European and its influences from southern Europe are particularly important.[18] The tradition of the gaucho has been an important element in the art and folklore of both Uruguay and Argentina.[18] Visual arts A \"livable sculpture\", Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3's Casapueblo was his home, hotel and museum. A prominent exponent of Uruguayan art was abstract painter and sculptor Carlos P\u00e1ez Vilar\u00f3. He drew from both Timbuktu and Mykonos to create his best-known work: his home, hotel and atelier Casapueblo near Punta del Este. Casapueblo is a \"livable sculpture\" and draws thousands of visitors from around the world. The 19th-century painter Juan Manuel Blanes, whose works depict historical events, was the first Uruguayan artist to gain widespread recognition.[18] The Post-Impressionist painter Pedro Figari achieved international renown for his pastel studies of subjects in Montevideo and the countryside. Blending elements of art and nature the work of the landscape architect Leandro Silva Delgado (es) has also earned international prominence.[18] Uruguay has a small but growing film industry, and movies such as Whisky by Juan Pablo Rebella and Pablo Stoll (2004), Marcelo Bertalm\u00edo's Los d\u00edas con Ana (2000; \"Days with Ana\") and Ana D\u00edez's Paisito (2008), about the 1973 military coup, have earned international honours.[18] Music La cumparsita Menu 0:00 It is among the most famous and recognizable tangos of all time. Problems playing this file? See media help. Main article: Music of Uruguay The folk and popular music of Uruguay shares not only its gaucho roots with Argentina, but also those of the tango.[18] One of the most famous tangos, \"La cumparsita\" (1917), was written by the Uruguayan composer Gerardo Matos Rodr\u00edguez.[18] The candombe is a folk dance performed at Carnival, especially Uruguayan Carnival, mainly by Uruguayans of African ancestry.[18] The guitar is the preferred musical instrument, and in a popular traditional contest called the payada two singers, each with a guitar, take turns improvising verses to the same tune.[18] Folk music is called canto popular and includes some guitar players and singers such as Alfredo Zitarrosa, Jos\u00e9 Carbajal \"El Sabalero\", Daniel Viglietti, Los Olimare\u00f1os, and Numa Moraes. Numerous radio stations and musical events reflect the popularity of rock music and the Caribbean genres, known as m\u00fasica tropical (\"tropical music\").[18] Early classical music in Uruguay showed heavy Spanish and Italian influence, but since the 20th century a number of composers of classical music, including Eduardo Fabini, Vicente Ascone (es), and H\u00e9ctor Tosar, have made use of Latin American musical idioms.[18] Tango has also had an impact on Uruguayan culture, especially during the 20th century, especially the \u00b430s and \u00b440s with Uruguayan singers such as Julio Sosa from Las Piedras.[98] When the famous tango singer Carlos Gardel was 29 years old he changed his nationality to be Uruguayan, saying he was born in Tacuaremb\u00f3, but this subterfuge was probably done to keep French authorities from arresting him for failing to register in the French Army for World War I. Gardel was born in France and was raised in Buenos Aires. He never lived in Uruguay.[99] Nevertheless, a Carlos Gardel museum was established in 1999 in Valle Ed\u00e9n, near Tacuaremb\u00f3.[100] Rock and roll first broke into Uruguayan audiences with the arrival of the Beatles and other British bands in the early 1960s. A wave of bands appeared in Montevideo, including Los Shakers, Los Mockers, Los Iracundos, Los Moonlights, and Los Malditos, who became major figures in the so-called Uruguayan Invasion of Argentina.[101] Popular bands of the Uruguayan Invasion sang in English. Popular Uruguayan rock bands include La Vela Puerca, No Te Va Gustar, El Cuarteto de Nos, Once Tiros, La Trampa, Chalamadre, Snake, Buitres, and Cursi. In 2004, the Uruguayan musician and actor Jorge Drexler won an Academy Award for composing the song \"Al otro lado del r\u00edo\" from the movie The Motorcycle Diaries, which narrated the life of Che Guevara. Literature Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 Main article: Uruguayan literature Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3 (1871\u20131917), a modernist, is considered Uruguay's most significant literary figure.[18] His book Ariel (1900) deals with the need to maintain spiritual values while pursuing material and technical progress.[18] Besides stressing the importance of upholding spiritual over materialistic values, it also stresses resisting cultural dominance by Europe and the United States.[18] The book continues to influence young writers.[18] Notable amongst Latin American playwrights is Florencio S\u00e1nchez (1875\u20131910), who wrote plays about contemporary social problems that are still performed today.[18] From about the same period came the romantic poetry of Juan Zorrilla de San Mart\u00edn (1855\u20131931), who wrote epic poems about Uruguayan history. Also notable are Juana de Ibarbourou (1895\u20131979), Delmira Agustini (1866\u20131914), Idea Vilari\u00f1o (1920\u20132009), and the short stories of Horacio Quiroga and Juan Jos\u00e9 Morosoli (1899\u20131959).[18] The psychological stories of Juan Carlos Onetti (such as \"No Man's Land\" and \"The Shipyard\") have earned widespread critical praise, as have the writings of Mario Benedetti.[18] Uruguay's best-known contemporary writer is Eduardo Galeano, author of Las venas abiertas de Am\u00e9rica Latina (1971; \"Open Veins of Latin America\") and the trilogy Memoria del fuego (1982\u201387; \"Memory of Fire\").[18] Other modern Uruguayan writers include Mario Levrero, Sylvia Lago, Jorge Majfud, and Jes\u00fas Moraes.[18] Uruguayans of many classes and backgrounds enjoy reading historietas, comic books that often blend humour and fantasy with thinly veiled social criticism.[18] Media The Reporters Without Borders worldwide press freedom index has ranked Uruguay as 37th of 178 reported countries in 2010.[102] Freedom of speech and media are guaranteed by the constitution, with qualifications for inciting violence or \"insulting the nation\".[69] Uruguayans have access to more than 100 private daily and weekly newspapers, more than 100 radio stations, and some 20 terrestrial television channels, and cable TV is widely available.[69] Uruguay's long tradition of freedom of the press was severely curtailed during the years of military dictatorship. On his first day in office in March 1985, Sanguinetti re-established complete freedom of the press.[103] Consequently, Montevideo's newspapers, which account for all of Uruguay's principal daily newspapers, greatly expanded their circulations.[103] State-run radio and TV are operated by the official broadcasting service SODRE.[69] Some newspapers are owned by, or linked to, the main political parties.[69] El D\u00eda was the nation's most prestigious paper until its demise in the early 1990s, founded in 1886 by the Colorado party leader and (later) president Jos\u00e9 Batlle y Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. El Pa\u00eds, the paper of the rival Blanco Party, has the largest circulation.[18] B\u00fasqueda is Uruguay's most important weekly news magazine and serves as an important forum for political and economic analysis.[103] Although it sells only about 16,000 copies a week, its estimated readership exceeds 50,000.[103] MercoPress is an independent news agency focusing on news related to Mercosur and is based in Montevideo.[104] Cuisine Main article: Uruguayan cuisine The local hot drink mate being consumed in transit Beef is fundamental to Uruguayan cuisine, and the country is one of the world's top consumers of red meat per capita. Asado, a kind of barbecued beef, is the national dish in Uruguay, and other popular foods include beef platters, chivito (steak sandwiches), pasta, barbecued kidneys, and sausages. Locally produced soft drinks, beer, and wine are commonly served, as is cleric\u00f3, a mixture of fruit juice and wine. Uruguay and Argentina share a national drink called mate. Grappamiel, made with alcohol and honey, is served in the cold mornings of autumn and winter to warm up the body. Often locals can be seen carrying leather cases containing a thermos of hot water, the traditional hollowed gourd called a mate or guampa, a metal straw called a bombilla, and the dried yerba mate leaves. Sweet treats, including cr\u00e8me caramel with dulce de leche and alfajores (shortbread cookies), are favorites for desserts or afternoon snacks. Other Uruguayan dishes include morcilla dulce (a type of blood sausage cooked with ground orange fruit, orange peel, and walnuts), chorizo, milanesa (a breaded veal cutlet similar to the Austrian Wiener Schnitzel), snacks such as ol\u00edmpicos (club sandwiches), h\u00fangaras (spicy sausage in a hot dog roll), \"tortas fritas\" (similar to elephant ears, and traditionally eaten when it rains), \"martin fierro\" (a bread-less sandwich of cheese and quince paste), postre chaja (a cake made mostly from meringue and peaches in syrup), \"pascualina\" (kale and egg pie), \"pastafrola\" (a quince pie) and masas surtidas (bite-sized pastries), many of which are of Spanish and Italian origin, like the \"massini\". Sport Centenario Stadium Main article: Sport in Uruguay Football (soccer) is the most popular sport in Uruguay. The first international match outside the British Isles was played between Uruguay and Argentina in Montevideo in July 1902.[105] Uruguay won gold at the 1924 Paris Olympic Games[106] and again in 1928 in Amsterdam.[107] The Uruguay national football team has won the FIFA World Cup on two occasions. Uruguay won the inaugural tournament on home soil in 1930 and again in 1950, famously defeating home favourites Brazil in the final match.[108] Uruguay has won the Copa Am\u00e9rica (an international tournament for South American nations and guests) more than any other country, their victory in 2011 making a total of 15 Copa Am\u00e9ricas won. Uruguay has by far the smallest population of any country that has won a World Cup.[108] Despite their early success, they have only qualified for three of the last six World Cups.[108] Uruguay performed very credibly in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, having reached the semi-final for the first time in 40 years. Diego Forl\u00e1n was presented with the Golden Ball award as the best player of the 2010 tournament.[109] In the rankings for June 2012, Uruguay were ranked the second best team in the world, according to the FIFA world rankings, their highest ever point in football history, falling short of the first spot to the Spain national football team.[110] Uruguay exported 1,414 football players during the 2000s, almost as many players as Brazil and Argentina.[111] In 2010, the Uruguayan government enacted measures intended to retain players in the country.[111] Football was taken to Uruguay by English sailors and labourers in the late 19th century. Less successfully, they introduced rugby and cricket. There are two Montevideo-based football clubs, Nacional and Pe\u00f1arol, who are successful in domestic and South American tournaments and have won three Intercontinental Cups each. Education Main article: Education in Uruguay Education in Uruguay is secular, free,[112] and compulsory for 14 years, starting at the age of 4.[113] The system is divided into six levels of education: early childhood (3\u20135 years); primary (6\u201311 years); basic secondary (12\u201314 years); upper secondary (15\u201317 years); higher education (18 and up); and post-graduate education.[113] Public education is the primary responsibility of three institutions: the Ministry of Education and Culture, which coordinates education policies, the National Public Education Administration, which formulates and implements policies on early to secondary education, and the University of the Republic, responsible for higher education.[113] In 2009, the government planned to invest 4.5% of GDP in education.[112] Uruguay ranks high on standardised tests such as PISA at a regional level, but compares unfavourably to the OECD average, and is also below some countries with similar levels of income.[112] In the 2006 PISA test, Uruguay had one of the greatest standard deviations among schools, suggesting significant variability by socio-economic level.[112] Uruguay is part of the One Laptop per Child project, and in 2009 became the first country in the world to provide a laptop for every primary school student,[114] as part of the Plan Ceibal.[115] Over the 2007\u20132009 period, 362,000 pupils and 18,000 teachers were involved in the scheme; around 70% of the laptops were given to children who did not have computers at home.[115] The OLPC programme represents less than 5% of the country's education budget.

Out of breath, he speaks to the leader.]\nLENNON : He's alive.\n[The Temple Leader turns his head from Lennon and stares straight ahead grasping his necklace. the chamber with the spring.

I mean one minute he's gone and now he's fine?\nSAWYER : Of course he's fine.\nKATE : What's that mean?\nSAWYER : [sarcastically] He's an Iraqi torturer who shoots kids. He definitely deserves another go around.\n[Jin, Jack and Hurley help Sayid stand up. The conversation is indistinct.]\nHURLEY : All right.\n[Sawyer continues to stare outside.]\nKATE : What are you lookin' at?\nSAWYER : How many guards with guns do you think are outside this place?\nKATE : What?!\nSAWYER : I was out cold when they brought me in here. How many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?\nKATE : What are you thinking?\nSAWYER : Thinkin' about running, Kate.\n LAX. Kate is walking with her hands still cuffed and the marshal's jacket hiding them.]\nMARSHAL : She's got hands in handcuffs but she's probably got them covered, okay?\n[There is an indistinct male voice over the PA system.

I'm not gonna run him over.\n[A man is bending over attempting to pick something up from the ground. It is Leslie Artz. He turns to face the cab and begins to yell.]\nLESLIE ARTZ : Hey! I'm walking here. I'm walking here.\n[Artz has spilled his baggage from a courtesy cart. It is in the path of the cab. Horns are honking. In the offing, Jack is on his cell phone. Kate and Jack make eye contact for a moment. Claire tries to get out of the cab and Kate pulls her back into the cab.]\nKATE : Do not get out of this car!\n[Claire nods yes and says nothing.. She is quite frightened. Kate addresses the cab driver. They are still in the airport parking terminal.]\nKATE : Just go. Go now! I don't care about the guy! Go!\nCAB DRIVER : Okay.\n[The cab drags one of Artz's bags under it as it peels away.]\nLESLIE ARTZ : Hey! Hey! What the hell! Hey, I got your license plate!\n[Traffic light changes from green to amber to red. The cab stops for the red light.]\nKATE : At the light, take a left.\nCLAIRE : [sobbing] Can you, can you please, please just let me go? I promise I won't say anything to anyone.\n[The cab driver takes this opportunity and puts the cab in park, gets out of the cab and runs away leaving Kate and Clair in the back seat.]\nKATE : Hey! Hey! Damn it!\n[Multiple car horns start honking. Kate gets from the back seat to the driver's seat and speeds away, tires screeching. A car at crossing the intersection almost hit the cab broadside.]\nCLAIRE : Please! Please!\nKATE : Give me your purse.\nCLAIRE : What?\nKATE : I said give me your purse!\n[Claire continues to cry. Kat pulls to the curb and stops the cab.]\nKATE : Now get out of the car.\nCLAIRE : Can I please just, just get my suitcase?\nKATE : No you can't! Get out of the car!\n[A pregnant Claire exits the cab and is left without her purse or luggage as she cries on the side walk. Kate speeds away in the cab. Temple. Kate is walking down a corridor. Jack and Jin help Sayid walk out to the courtyard.]\nJACK : Easy.\n[Sayid is led to a stone bench upon which he sits. Jin and Jack release Sayid's arms from over their shoulders. Miles approaches with water.]\nSAYID : Who are these people? What do they want?\n[Sayid accepts the canteen from Miles and drinks from it.]\nHURLEY : It's the Others, dude. They caught us [pause] again. I dunno, I think they are trying to protect us.\nMILES : Uh, as you can see, Hugo here has assumed the leadership position so that's pretty great.\n[Jack is staring at Sayid's abdomen.]\nSAYID : [to Jack] What?\nJACK : The wound [rolls up Sayid's tank shirt] it's almost completely closed.\n[Sayid rolls up the front of his shirt and looks at the gunshot wound. It looks like scar tissue and not a fresh wound. Sayid is confused. He turns to Jack.]\nSAYID : Thank you Jack.\nJACK : For what?\nSAYID : For saving my life.\n[The Temple Leader briskly walks through doors from the Temple, shoving them against the outside walls. Jack stands up.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese]\nLENNON : [translates] Mr. Jarrah, will you come with us, please?\n[Lennon turns and starts to walk.]\nSAYID : Come with you where?\nLENNON : Inside. Nothing to worry about we just ...\nJACK : [interrupts] I'm coming with him.\nLENNON : Oh, I'm sorry. We need to talk to him alone, just a few questions.\nJACK : You have a few questions? Well, so do we. Let's start with who are you? Why are you holding us here? You ...\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese] [interrupts]\nLENNON : [translating] [pause] Once we've spoken to Mr. Jarrah, we'll be more than happy to tell you everything you want to know.\nJACK : Something tells me that you're not going to be happy telling us anything.\n[Jack looks into the eyes of the Temple Leader.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese]\n[Immediately, 2 men with the Temple Leader grab Jack by his arms and start to beat him. Another man goes after Miles. Two gun shots are heard.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese]\n[As turn to see who shot a gun, they see Sawyer who is cocking his gun, loading another bullet into the chamber.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese]\nLENNON : [translates] Don't shoot! Lower your weapons!\n[Lennon walks towards Sawyer then stops. Sawyer is aiming his gun at Lennon.]\nLENNON : Please, you don't have to do this. We won't hurt your friend.\nSAWYER : [looking at Sayid] He ain't my friend. Do what you want with him and anybody else. But me, I'm walking out of here.\n[Kate walks forward. Sawyer is aiming at her.]\nKATE : James.\nSAWYER : I'm gone! You understand?\n[Sawyer maintains aiming the gun as he lifts beams of wood that are barricading the large wooden doors.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : Please. [pause] You have to stay.\nSAWYER : [angered] No, I don't.\n[Sawyer opens the wooden door and exits the courtyard.]\nSAWYER : [to Kate] Don't come after me.\n[Sawyer closes the door behind him.]\nLOST Logo\n[Two men drag Sayid away. The Temple Leader follows as does Lennon.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese]\n[Two men are restraining Jack. He struggles to get out of their grasp, unsuccessfully. Two other men drag Miles away through a different passageway.]\nJACK : Hey! Hey! Where are they taking Sayid.\n[Another man shouts over everyone. He aims a handgun at Jack.]\nALDO : Hey! Calm down! Everybody calm down.\nLENNON : [to Jack] Where'd Ford go?\nJACK : What?\nLENNON : Ford, your friend who just ran outta here. Where did he go?\nJACK : I don't know.\nLENNON : Do you expect me to believe that?\nJACK : He told me he wanted to kill me. You believe that?\nKATE : I can bring him back.\nLENNON : You know where he went?\nKATE : No, but I can track him. Let me go. I will bring him back and I can make him stay.\nJACK : Kate, you sure you want to go out there alone with these people?\nJIN : I'll go with her.\nLENNON : It's very important that he get back here safely. What makes you think he's going to listen to you?\nKATE : I can be very convincing when I wanna be.\n Kate speeding the cab to a repair shop. She stops and quickly gets out. A radio is playing indistinctly in the background. The sound of a man is using a grinding/sanding tool drowns out the music. Sparks are flying about as Kate enters the garage aiming the gun at the repairman. The man stops working and takes off his goggles.]\nKATE : Where's your tire hammer?\nREPAIRMAN : You've got a problem.\nKATE : So do you. Where's your tire hammer?\nREPAIRMAN : Tire hammer will just cut off your wrist. The problem is you need a punch press and you're not gonna be able to use one of them and keep that gun pointed at me.\nKATE : You volunteering?\nREPAIRMAN : I got a steady hand but I kinda feel like we got off on the wrong foot.\nKATE : I'll give you two hundred dollars.\n[The scene changes to a table where Kate has the handcuffs steady and the repairman has the tip of a punch press in the ring that holds the cuff together.]\nREPAIRMAN : Now hold still.\n[The repairman applies pressure and the handcuffs come off. Kate tosses them in the trash.]\nKATE : Thanks.\nREPAIRMAN : So why the bracelets?\nKATE : I'm wanted for murder.\nREPAIRMAN : Murder?\nKATE : You don't happen to have somewhere I can change, do you?\nREPAIRMAN : [laughs and points.] Bathroom's over there. Make it quick.\nKATE : Thank you.\n[Kate turns and walks toward the bathroom and stops in a back room. She takes off her jacket and opens the tote bag that belonged to Claire. As she unzips it she sees a Polaroid picture of Claire, smiling, holding and pointing to her pregnant belly. Kate picks up the picture and stares. Everything she takes out is for a baby, wash cloths, bottle, and a stuffed whale toy which she stares at. She puts it down and runs her hand through her hair as she looks in a mirror. A faint sound, similar to a time skip is heard. Temple. Kate is packing her backpack as Aldo walks up and hands her a canteen.]\nALDO : Better not slow us down.\nKATE : Better not slow me down.\n[Jin looks at Kate as he finishes packing his backpack. Kate zippers her backpack closed. Jack walks over and sits next to Kate.]\nJACK : I'd go with you but..\nKATE : ...but you thought he would kill you?\n[Jack shrugs his shoulders and chuckles.]\nKATE : I'll take care of James. You take care of Sayid.\nJACK : [nods] Deal.\n[They all stand up. Jin exits the chamber first. As Kate walks away Jack grabs her arm. She stops.]\nKATE : Good bye.\nJACK : Be careful.\n[Jacks moves to try to see if Kate will kiss him however she turns and walks out of the chamber. another chamber. Sayid is strapped down on a examination table with his shirt pulled to expose his chest and abdominal area. He has a leather strap buckled to keep his head still. The Temple Leader opens a canister of powder and walks over to Sayid. He blows some of the powder over Sayid's chest and abdomen. He watches for a reaction.]\nSAYID : What is it you want? Please, whatever you are thinking of doing [pause] What is that?\n[Sayid is frightened as he watches the Temple Leader bring three exposed wires and attaches one to each nipple and a third to his abdomen.]\nSAYID : Just tell me what you want.\n[The Temple Leader walks over to an apparatus with a handle and begins to crank it. When he stops cranking, he flips a switch and a red light shines. He looks at Sayid then turns a knob quickly. Sayid is being shocked. His body quivers as he grinds his teeth. The temple leader then turns the knob fully. As Sayid begins to scream, the leader shuts off the apparatus and removes the electrical leads.]\nSAYID : [whimpering] Why? Why are you doing this?\n[The leader does not respond. He rubs the receptacle that is hanging around his neck then walks to a fire pit and twists a metal arrow in the fire then removes it and walks back to Sayid.]\nSAYID : I don't have any secrets. Ask, AHHH!\n[The leader places the hot iron to Sayid's wound. Sayid screams in agony.]\nSAYID : A ! [sobs] Ahhh! [raises he shoulders from the table and cries out. The leader pays close attention to Sayid's reaction. The leader pulls the iron from Sayid who falls back onto the table.]\nSAYID : Ugh! Ugh!! Ugh!\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese, takes a deep breath and again speaks Japanese]\n[Sayid is crying. Lennon motions for two men to come to the table as he unbuckles the restraints holding Sayid.]\nLENNON : We're sorry we had to put you through that. It was a test. We had to be sure.\nSAYID : Test to be sure of what?\nLENNON : Don't worry. You passed.\n[The two men help Sayid from the table and escort him from the chamber.]\nLENNON : I just lied to him, didn't I?\nTEMPLE LEADER : Yes.\n[The leader returns to writing at his desk. Kate pulling the cab to the curb where Claire is sitting on a bench. Kate gets out of the cab and walks over to Claire.]\nKATE : Where were you going?\nCLAIRE : What?\nKATE : Before I got in the cab, where were you going?\nCLAIRE : Why, so you can hijack them too?\n[Kate takes Claire's purse and tote from the trunk of the cab and gives them to Claire.]\nCLAIRE : I was waiting for a bus.\nKATE : I came to bring you your stuff.\n[Claire immediately looks in her purse.]\nKATE : Relax, I didn't take your money.\nCLAIRE : Well, uh, gee, thanks.\nKATE : So where were you going?\n[Claire stands up and starts to walk away.]\nCLAIRE : Don't worry about it.\nKATE : Fine.\n[Kate closes the trunk then walks back around the cab and starts to get in the driver's side. Claire watches as she closes the trunk.]\nCLAIRE : Langdon street. Brentwood.\nKATE : You got family there?\nCLAIRE : Uh, no. It's the couple who's adopting my baby. [pause] They were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport but I guess they got their days mixed up or something. It's not like they abandoned me.\nKATE : Brentwood's not far. Get in.\nCLAIRE : [scoffs] Seriously?\nKATE : Do you want a ride or not?\n[Claire is unsure however she slowly gets in the front seat of the cab. A partial time skip sound is heard and the scene switches to the jungle on the island, Kate, Jin, Justin and Aldo are hiking to get Sawyer back to the Temple.]\nKATE : So why do you people want us to stay at the temple?\nALDO : We're protecting you.\nKATE : From what?\nALDO : You've been on this island for a while, right? Ever see a big pillar of black smoke, makes a ticka ticka sound, looks pissed off?\nKATE : Yes.\nALDO : From that.\nJIN : Do you know anything about another plane coming in? An AJIRA flight.\nALDO : I'm sorry. Is this a press conference?\nJUSTIN : I think he means the one that landed ...\nALDO : Justin! Shut up.\n[Justin stops speaking, looks at Aldo and continues walking. Jin looks at Justin and continues to walk. Kate is crouched down looking at two trails.]\nKATE : No, no, no, that's a decoy trail. He went this way.\nALDO : And you're basing this on what?\nKATE : [firmly] Experience.\nJUSTIN : Aldo.\nALDO : What?\nJUSTIN : I think she's right.\nALDO : [sarcastically] Of course she is.\n[Kate begins walking.]\nALDO : After you, princess. [pause] So what's your strategy for bringing your boyfriend back? I hope you got one because he shot a guy on his way out. If he tries that on me, I'm gonna blow his head off.\n[Kate drinks from her canteen and continues walking. Justin immediately stops her.]\nJUSTIN : Watch it!\n[Kate looks down and sees a trip wire made from a tree branch. She takes a deep breath.]\nKATE : Thank you.\n[They all look up to see a net full of rocks hanging from a tree.]\nJIN : Looks like one of Rousseau's traps.\nJUSTIN : The French woman? She's been dead for years. This, this couldn't be one ...\nALDO : Justin! Shut up!\n[Kate walks up to Aldo and shoves her canteen into his chest.]\nKATE : What was he gonna say?\nALDO : You don't even remember me, do you? You don't recognize me? Well maybe this will jog you memory. Three years ago, you staged yourself a little prison break, [Kate drinks from her canteen] and you did it by knocking the guard out with the butt of your rifle. That would be me.\n[Kate takes a swing at Aldo's head with her canteen and he falls to the ground. Justin takes a step toward Kate. She throws her canteen at the trip wire/branch and hits it. The netting holding the rocks comes down and swings to one side. On the return swing it opens and the rocks come falling down onto Justin. Kate grabs Aldo's gun from the ground, checks to see how many rounds are in the magazine, and puts the magazine back into the gun handle then picks up Justin's rifle.]\nJIN : What are you doing?\nKATE : Escaping.\n[The scene switched back to the Temple chamber with the spring. Two men are dragging Sayid. Hurley rushes to Sayid and they give him Sayid.\nHURLEY : Sayid! You okay, man? Jack! He's back!\n[Sayid grunts as he collapses into Hurley and Miles' arms. They sit him down and lean his back on a stone pillar. Sayid groans in pain.]\nJACK : Sayid, what happened?\nSAYID : They tortured me.\nJACK : Why?\nSAYID : Don't know. They didn't ask me any questions.\n[Jack leaves Sayid with Hurley and Miles. He walks briskly and stops in front of a doorway that is guarded by 2 armed men.]\nJACK : Step aside.\n[The two men allow Jack to pass. a chamber where Temple Leader is using a mortar and pestle. Jack enters the chamber. The Temple leader stops for a moment. Lennon is off to the side near a bookcase. He is standing with an open book in his right hand.]\nLENNON : Hey, Shephard.\n[Lennon closes the book at walks toward the temple leader.]\nLENNON : We were hoping you'd come on your own.\n[Jack points back to the water chamber.]\nJACK : What the hell did you do to Sayid?\nLENNON : We, we didn't do anything to him. Your, your friend is sick.\nJACK : Sick with what?\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese]\nLENNON : He's [pause] yeah, I, [pause] not really [pause] there's not really a literal translation. The closest thing would be [pause] infected.\nJACK : Infected? He's not even running a fever.\n[The Temple Leader chuckles and continues work. Jack walks to the leader.]\nJACK : Did I say something funny?\nLENNON : I doubt it. He doesn't really have a sense of humor.\n[The Temple Leader smiles and wraps a capsule in a piece of paper.\nTEMPLE LEADER : [speaks Japanese]\nLENNON : He says you have to give your friend this pill.\nJACK : [laughs] Are you serious?\n[The paper with the capsule is again offered to Jack.]\nJACK : Why don't you give it to him?\nLENNON : Because it won't work unless he takes it willingly, and he won't take it willingly from us.\nJACK : Well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it before you tortured him.\nLENNON : We didn't torture him. We were diagnosing him.\nJACK : To see if he was infected.\nLENNON : Yes.\nJACK : I'm not gonna give anything to Sayid unless I know what's in it.\n[Jack starts to walk out the chamber. Lennon starts to follow him but is stopped by the leader.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : Tell me, Shephard, your friend, how did he get shot?\nJACK : He was, um, he was helping me.\nTEMPLE LEADER : So it was your fault?\nJACK : Yes.\nTEMPLE LEADER : And there have been others who were hurt or died, helping you?\nJACK : Yes.\nTEMPLE LEADER : [nods] Well, this is your chance to redeem yourself.\n[The leader takes Jack's left hand, places the paper with the capsule in it, then closes Jack's hand.]\nTEMPLE LEADER : It's medicine and your friend needs it.\nJACK : What happens if I don't give it to him?\nTEMPLE LEADER : The infection will spread.\n[ water chamber. Miles and Hurley are sitting with Sayid.]\nMILES : So, nothing? There wasn't anything? No white light? Angels singing? No dead relatives?\nSAYID : I remember being shot.\nHURLEY : You're not a zombie, right?\nSAYID : No. I am not a zombie.\n[Footsteps approach the three men. Miles turns to see Jack.]\nMILES : Hey.\n[Jack reaches for a canteen and takes a drink.]\nJACK : Mind giving me and Sayid a minute?\nHURLEY : Yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out 'cause they lead me to having to do something I don't quite understand.\nJACK : I'm right there with you.\nMILES : Its fine. We'll be in the food court if you need us.\n[Miles and Hurley walk away from Jack and Sayid. Jack sits and takes a drink from a canteen. He offers the canteen to Sayid who motions no.]\nSAYID : So did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?\nJACK : They said they were trying to diagnose you.\nSAYID : Right. They told me it was some sort of test which they said I passed. Clearly, I didn't.\n[Jack unfolds the paper and exposes the capsule.]\nSAYID : What's that?\nJACK : They want you to take it. It's medicine, according to them.\nSAYID : What about according to you?\nJACK : I don't know. And you know, before when you [pause] when you thanked me for saving your life, I, I didn't have anything to do with it Sayid. I didn't fix you. They did.\n[Jack takes the capsule in his right palm.]\nSAYID : I don't care who fixed me. I only care about who I trust. So, if you want me to take that pill, Jack, I'll do it.\n[Jack looks at the capsule, closes his hand and looks at Sayid. jungle.]\nJIN : Wait. Where are you going?\nKATE : Catching up with Sawyer.\nJIN : So you never planned to bring him back to the temple.\nKATE : No. I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?\nJIN : Where did your place land, Kate?\nKATE : What?\n[Kate stops, turns around and walks back to Jin.]\nJIN : The AJIRA plane that you, Jack and Hurley came in on. [pause] Where did it land?\nKATE : I don't know.\nJIN : Sun was on that plane too and I have to find her.\nKATE : [angry] You think they're gonna tell you? You think they care about you or about Sun or about any of us?\nJIN : Who do you care about Kate?\nKATE : Good luck, Jin.\n[Kate turns and walks away from Jin.]\nJIN : Once you catch up with Sawyer, then what?\nKATE : I guess we'll figure that out together.\n[A partial time skip sound is heard then the scene switches to Kate driving Claire in the cab to Brentwood.]\nCLAIRE : So, uh, what happened to your handcuffs?\nKATE : I cut them off.\n[Claire nods and says nothing. There is silence between the two women.]\nCLAIRE : It's a beautiful neighborhood. [pause] I bet they're a really nice couple.\n[Kate looks over at Claire who is smiling then continues to drive.]\nCLAIRE : What?\nKATE : I didn't say anything.\nCLAIRE : What, you, you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?\nKATE : Why would I think that?\nCLAIRE : Good, 'cause they didn't.\n[Claire tries to keep a straight face. Kate looks over to her right.]\nKATE : This is it.\n[The house has a large landscaped front yard. There are various shrubs and trees close to the building. It has a large, double door entryway. Claire unbuckles her seat belt. Kate goes to hand her the paper with the address.]\nCLAIRE : Um, will you come in with me?\n[ KATE : [unsure] Are you kidding me?\nCLAIRE : Please, I just [pause] I really don't want to go up there on my own.\n[Kate looks at Claire. The scene changes to the front door of the house being opened by a blonde woman.]\nCLAIRE : Uh, hi, um, Mrs. Baskum? I, I'm, I'm Claire Little ton.\n[The woman looks at Claire's belly.]\nMRS. BASKUM : [voice cracks] Oh, my God. [sighs and sobs] I'm so sorry. Um, [pause] my husband [looks away then looks back] he left me. [crying] And, believe me, I wanted a baby so much, but I can't do it alone. I'm sorry. Look, I know I should've called you.\nCLAIRE : So uh, wh, what, y, y, you just changed your mind?\nMRS. BASKUM : Um, look, my, my life is just, a little bit complicated right now.\n[Claire is very upset. Kate has been watching Claire and the way Mrs. Baskum has been treating her.]\nKATE : [angry] She came all the way from Australia and you don't call?\nCLAIRE : Oh my God.\n[Claire grabs her belly and begins to groan.]\nKATE : [to Claire] Are you okay?\nCLAIRE : Aah! It's coming!\n[Partial time skip sound is heard as the scene switches to the island jungle. Kate exits the jungle at New Otherton. She readies her gun. The picket fence is broken in places. The swings move in the breeze. Some of the barracks look abandoned and others look intact. Kate walks around then hears noise from one of the barracks. She goes to investigate. The noise continues. She enters the home of Sawyer and Juliet. Carefully she moves about trying to find the source of the noise. She stops at the door to the bedroom. Sawyer has moved a dresser to the side and is prying open the floorboards with a crowbar. He retrieves a shoe box then sits on the foot of the bed. He brushes off the dust and opens the box. He takes out a very small black drawstring bag. He cries as he holds it ever so tightly. Kate watches. As she turns and walks away, the floorboards creak and Sawyer is standing up in a flash, cocking and aiming the gun at the door.]\nSAWYER : Who's there? Better come out now or so help me, I'm just gonna start shootin'.\n[Sawyer is in the hallway, lowering his gun when he sees Kate.\nSAWYER : What the hell are you doin' here?\nKATE : I was worried about you.\n[Kate turns to face Sawyer. Sawyer angrily and quickly walks past her, and doesn't look at her. Kate turns and watches him leave the house. The scene switches back to Brentwood. Kate speeds to the emergency room entrance and gets out of the cab. She secures the gun in the back of her pants. Kate runs around to the other side of the cab and helps Claire out of the back seat. A nurse with a wheelchair stops next to them.]\nNURSE : What's happening here?\nCLAIRE : I, I think I'm having contractions.\nNURSE : When did they start?\nCLAIRE : Um, about three minutes ago.\nNURSE : Try to relax. We're gonna take you to the M.C.U to get it looked at.\n[Kate follows with Claire's purse and tote bag. She sees a police car turning the corner.]\nNURSE : [to Kate] Are you with her?\nKATE : Yeah.\nNURSE : Okay, follow me.\n inside the hospital. Claire is in a hospital bed and a different nurse is attempting to get a blood pressure cuff on her. Claire is quite upset. A monitor is beeping.]\nCLAIRE : What are you doing? What, what's going on?\nNURSE 2 : Hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.\nCLAIRE : I need to know what's going on? Is something wrong?\n[Kate leaves the OB Triage and locates a doctor.]\nKATE : Excuse me. Excuse me.\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : Yes.\nKATE : Are you a doctor?\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : Yes. I'm Dr. Goodspeed.\nKATE : Can I please get your help in here?\n[Kate and Dr. Goodspeed go back into the OB Triage. A monitor is beeping rapidly. Dr. Goodspeed reads Claire's chart.]\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : Miss Littleton? Claire, how are you feeling?\nCLAIRE : Uncomfortable. What, wh, what's happening.\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : What's happening is that Mother Nature's gotten a little ahead of herself. Are you ready to have your baby?\nCLAIRE : I, I'm sorry. What?!\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : You're at thirty six weeks, three centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced, which means, if you want, you can have your baby tonight.\nCLAIRE : If I want? So what, you mean, you mean you can stop it then?\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : Maybe. However, to do that would require a number of drugs.\nCLAIRE : Drugs? I mean. W, will that hurt the baby?\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : No. They're perfectly safe. I just don't want to stick you with needles if I don't have to. So it's up to you.\nCLAIRE : I'm, I'm not ready.\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : Okay. Let's get her started on the Nifedipine drip.\n[The monitor emits a steady tone. Kate stops looking at Dr. Goodspeed and quickly looks at Claire.]\nCLAIRE : Wh, what, what is it?\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : [to nurse 2] Margaret, let's do an ultrasound. I wanna get a picture of what's going on in there. [to Claire] Ah, it, it could just mean the baby's out of position.\nCLAIRE : Wh, wh, what are you, what are you saying?! W, what, what's happening to my baby?! [crying] Is my baby okay? Is Aaron okay?\n[Kate looks at Claire with eyes wide open as Dr. Goodspeed takes the ultrasound detector and puts gel on and moves it along on Claire's baby.]\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : See? [chuckles] There he is. Everything is just fine. [Monitor returns to beeping.] Your boy just likes to move around.\n[Claire and the doctor chuckle as Kate stands confused a bit.]\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : 140 B.P.M, perfectly normal. I have a feeling that Aaron is gonna be a handful.\n[Claire chuckles.]\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : Now let's see if we can slow this down.\n[Claire nods.]\nDOCTOR GOODSPEED : You did great, mommy. Thanks.\n[Claire smiles at Kate, who is holding her hand. A partial time skip sound is heard as the scene switches back to the island. Sawyer is sitting on the end of a pier. He sighs. Kate walks up sits next to him.]\nKATE : A couple days ago, you asked me why I came back to the island. [pause] I need to find Claire. I thought [pause] maybe if I could catch up to you, you could help me, and then [pause] maybe if we could find her and bring her back to Aaron, then maybe all of this wouldn't be for nothing.\n[Sawyer exhales deeply.]\nKATE : I'm sorry. I never should have followed you.\nSAWYER : Which time?\nKATE : [pointing] That was your house, right? With Juliet.\nSAWYER : [holding back tears] Yep.\nKATE : I'm sorry.\nSAWYER : You already said that.\nKATE : No [pause] for Juliet. If I hadn't come after you on the sub, then you two would've left and she would've never died.\nSAWYER : It's not your fault she's dead. It's mine. [eye welling with tears] She was sittin' right there, right where you are now, tryin' to leave this place. And I convinced her to stay. I made her stay on this island [crying] 'cause I didn't want to be alone. [deep breath] You understand that, right?\n[Sawyer and Kate just look at each other.]\nSAWYER : But, uh, [pause] but I think some of use are meant to be alone.\n[Sawyer is rubbing a diamond ring with his fingers.]\nSAWYER : I was gonna ask her to marry me.\n[Kate looks away. She was not expecting this from Sawyer. Still crying, Sawyer stands up on the pier and throws the ring into the water as Kate watches.]\nSAWYER : You can probably make it back to the Temple by nightfall.\n[Sawyer walks back along the pier. Kate begins to cry. Temple Leader's chamber. He is sitting at his desk spinning a baseball on top. Jack enters the chamber.]\nJACK : What's that?\nTEMPLE LEADER : It's a baseball.\n[Jack sits in a chair in front of the desk.]\nJACK : You speak pretty good English for someone who needs a translator.\nTEMPLE LEADER : We both know that I don't need a translator.\nJACK : Then why do you have one?\nTEMPLE LEADER : Because I have to remain separate from the people I'm in charge of. It makes it easier when they don't like the decisions I make for them.\nJACK : Who are you?\nDOGEN : My name is Dogen.\nJACK : Are you from here, the island.\nDOGEN : I was brought here like everyone else.\nJACK : What do you mean, \"Brought here.\"?\nDOGEN : You know exactly what I mean.\n[Jack stands up and walks away from the desk. Dogen gets up also.]\nDOGEN : You didn't give your friend the pill, did you?\nJACK : No.\nDOGEN : Why not?\nJACK : Because I don't know what's in it?\nDOGEN : It will eliminate ...\nJACK : [interrupts] ...the infection, yeah. I got that. But what's in it?\nDOGEN : I cannot explain.\nJACK : Try.\nDOGEN : There isn't any time. He'll die if you don't ...\nJACK : [smugly interrupts] He already died. [hold pill] What is in it?\nDOGEN : [sigh] You just have to trust me.\nJACK : [chuckles] I don't trust myself. How am I supposed to trust you? Let's see where trust gets us.\n[Jack swallows the pill. Dogen quickly rushes Jack and full palm, slaps him in the stomach. With his hand still on Jack's chest, he pounds on his back, twice. He then puts his foot in front of Jack's, puts his other hand around Jack and with both hands pushes up on Jack's stomach. He gets Jack to cough up the pill which is immediately picks up. Gasping, Jack tires to catch his breath.]\nJACK : Now, are you gonna tell me what's in it?\nDOGEN : Poison.\n[ hospital. Claire is looking at a picture from her ultrasound. The date on the picture is 10/22/2004. There is a knock on the door. A faint voice is heard over the PA system.]\nCLAIRE : Come in.\nDETECTIVE RASMUSSEN. : Excuse me. Ms. Littleton?\nCLAIRE : Um, yeah.\nDETECTIVE RASMUSSEN : I'm Detective Rasmussen.\n[A police officer walks in with the detective.]\nDETECTIVE RASMUSSEN : Is Ms. Hart here?\nCLAIRE : Uh, I'm' sorry. Who?\nDETECTIVE RASMUSSEN : John Hart. She signed in with you.\n[The police officer is taking a look around the room. There are indistinct voices from his radio.]\nCLAIRE : Oh. She was just the, um, the cab driver. I needed help and she brought me up here. She left after they treated me, though.\n[The officer looks at a door and walks away. Kate is hiding in the room behind the door.]\nDETECTIVE RASMUSSEN : She, uh, give you any indication where she was headed?\nCLAIRE : Why? Is there something wrong?\nDETECTIVE RASMUSSEN : No. It's nothing for you to worry about. [to officer] Come on. Let's go.\n[They leave the room. As the door closes, Kate exits the small room. The sign on the door reads, NO ADMITTANCE AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.]\nPA VOICE : EKG Tech 3-1-5. EKG Tech 3-1-5.\nKATE : Thanks.\nCLAIRE : Sure. Thank you. Why, why are they after you? What, what did you do?\nKATE : Would you believe me if I said I was innocent?\nCLAIRE : Yeah. Yeah, I would.\nKATE : [smiles] Well, I should go.\nCLAIRE : Oh, wait. Um, here, take my credit card.\nKATE : No.\nCLAIRE : There's not much of a limit on it but it's something.\nKATE : You don't have to do this.\nCLAIRE : You didn't have to do what you did either.\n[Claire and Kate smile as Kate takes the credit card.]\nKATE : Aaron's a great name.\nCLAIRE : I don't know why I said it. It's like, I don't know. I knew it or something.\nKATE : I think you should keep him.\nCLAIRE : Well, um, good luck.\nKATE : Yeah, you too.\nCLAIRE : Thanks.\n[A partial time skip sound is heard and the scene switches back to the island. Kate is filling up her canteen from the outside faucet of one of the barracks. She looks back over her right shoulder and sees Sawyer walking with his head lowered. He walks by Kate as if she wasn't there. Kate watches and he continues to walk back into the house that he once lived in with Juliet and closes the door. Kate takes her backpack and walks out of New Otherton. Dogen's chamber. He is pouring two cups of tea.]\nLENNON : He swallowed it?\nDOGEN : Yes.\n[Dogen takes the cups of tea and places one cup on the table in front of Jack where Jack is holding his stomach.]\nJACK : What's this?\nDOGEN : Tea.\n[Jack chuckles. Dogen takes a sip from his cup then Jack reaches for his cup.]\nJACK : Why would you people want to kill Sayid?\n[Dogen looks at Jack then Lennon and back to Jack.]\nDOGEN : We believe he has been [pause] [speaks Japanese]\nLENNON : Closest translation is \"claimed.\"\nJACK : Claimed [long pause] by what?\nDOGEN : There is a darkness growing in him and once it reaches his heart, everything your friend once was, will be gone.\nJACK : No uh. How can you be sure of that?\nDOGEN : Because it happened to your sister.\n[Jack looks at Dogen, Lennon and back to Dogen. in the jungle. Jin stops by a stream, puts his rifle down and crouches down to get a drink of the water. Before he can take a drink, he is yanked from behind by Aldo and Justin.]\nALDO : Get up!\n[Aldo brings his knee up to Jin's face.]\nALDO : That's for my head.\n[Aldo pushes Jin into a tree, cocks his gun and aims at Jin.]\nALDO : Now , where's that bitch?\nJIN : I don't know. You don't understand. I'm going back to the Temple.\nALDO : Yeah, right.\nJUSTIN : It looks like he's alone. Maybe we should take him back.\nALDO : Or maybe we didn't find him alive.\nJUSTIN : Aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.\nALDO : [turns to Justin] He may be one of them.\n[Jin tries to run away. Aldo and Justin run after him.]\nALDO : Hey! Hey!\n[Jin steps into a bear trap and falls to the ground. It is clamped around his ankle.]\nJIN : Aah! Ugh!\n[Jin groans as he grabs at the trap. Justin sees Jin and stops but has his rifle aimed at Jin. Aldo walks up from behind.]\nALDO : [smugly] Where you goin'?\n[Aldo laughs as he aims his gun at Jin ready to fire. Before he can there are two gunshots and the target is Aldo. He falls to the ground, dead. Jin looks around. Another shot is heard. The target is Justin. He falls to the ground.]\nJUSTIN : Ughh!\n[Frightened, Jin looks to find who is shooting. He is still trapped. He looks up and to see a blonde woman holding a rifle. He tries to get a better look.]\nJIN : Claire?\n[It is Claire. She is wearing a blue plaid shirt, hair disheveled with smudges of dirt on her cheeks. She just looks at Jin.]\nLOST logo\nEND", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:52:41.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1115b15d15ffdfbafc7e03a83ac8db6d73f13c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9jKeQ2b33_mXS2mYr2hP1fSVPbpcifwOPwEzlt2tuDpudCMidjq4ejbqL9qx0eXeNNjshn93L6rEBCVLx60xM5asFKzb2ImTA-", "site_full": "www.klack.de", "site": "klack.de", "site_section": "http://www.klack.de/xml/topRSS.xml", "site_categories": ["television", "entertainment"], "section_title": "Klack - TOP 30 TV-Auswahl", "title": "ZDF neo: Kommissar Beck", "title_full": "ZDF neo: Kommissar Beck", "published": "2017-11-08T00:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "DE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 52317, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1115b15d15ffdfbafc7e03a83ac8db6d73f13c11", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9jKeQ2b33_mXS2mYr2hP1fSVPbpcifwOPwEzlt2tuDpudCMidjq4ejbqL9qx0eXeNNjshn93L6rEBCVLx60xM5asFKzb2ImTA-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-11-08T00:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "ZDF neo: Kommissar Beck", "text": "Mehr Termine Inhalt Kommissar Beck und sein Team m\u00fcssen den Mord an einer jungen Frau aufkl\u00e4ren, die mit ver\u00e4tztem Gesicht in einem Stra\u00dfengraben aufgefunden wurde. Kurze Zeit sp\u00e4ter wird eine zweite Leiche aus einem See gefischt. Auch hier wurde das Gesicht der Frau entstellt. Die Polizei kann nicht mehr ausschlie\u00dfen, dass ein Serient\u00e4ter am Werk ist, als eine dritte Frau aufgefunden wird. Mit Hilfe der Polizei in Riga ermitteln Kommissar Beck und Gunvald Larsson, dass es sich bei den Frauen um lettische Prostituierte handelt, die alle an AIDS erkrankt waren. Kommissar Beck plagen gesundheitliche Sorgen. Er hat Probleme mit dem Herz, und sein Arzt dr\u00e4ngt ihn zu einer baldigen Operation. In einem Restaurant lernt Beck die attraktive Lillemor Fransson kennen. Beide sind sich auf Anhieb sehr sympathisch. Beck und sein Team untersuchen den Schrottplatz, auf dem die jungen Frauen festgehalten wurden. Spuren f\u00fchren zu dem lettischen Frauenh\u00e4ndler Teddy. Gunvald ermittelt verdeckt als Zuh\u00e4lter im Milieu. Er erf\u00e4hrt, dass Teddy auf der fieberhaften Suche nach einem untergetauchten M\u00e4dchen ist. Zusammen mit Teddys Gorillas bekommt Gunvald den Auftrag, das M\u00e4dchen zu finden. In einem Hotel trifft Gunvald auf Sofija, die letzte Zeugin. Bevor die Frau erneut untertaucht, erf\u00e4hrt Gunvald, dass alle Frauen mit einem unerprobten Medikament gegen AIDS behandelt wurden. Als Alice Levander den Sicherheitschef der pharmazeutischen Firma Landexa, Klas Mellgren, aus Teddys Versteck kommen sieht, scheint die L\u00f6sung des Falls in Sicht. Landexa entwickelt unter gro\u00dfem Medienrummel ein solches Medikament. Wurden die Frauen Opfer von Menschenversuchen? Was versucht die Firma zu vertuschen? Und schlagartig wird Martin Beck bewusst, dass auch seine neue private Bekanntschaft bei der Aufl\u00f6sung des Falls eine nicht unerhebliche Rolle spielt.

highest since Buhari took over power \nPublished Chijioke Jannah \nGlobal oil benchmark, Brent crude, hit a 28-month high since President Muhammadu Buhari came to power in mid 2015. \nBrent, on which Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is priced, rose by $2 to $64.07 per barrel as of 8:03pm Nigerian time on Monday, more than $19 higher than the country\u2019s oil price benchmark of $44.5 per barrel for this year\u2019s budget. \nThe Excess Crude Account, into which the country saves the difference between the market price of oil and the budget benchmark to provide a cushion when oil prices fall or extra cash is needed for spending on infrastructure, has suffered declines since oil price slumped in 2014. \nThe account, which stood at about $4.11bn in October 2014, dropped to about $3.11bn in November and $2.45bn in December that year, and declined further into 2015. \nThe balance in the ECA stood at $2.309bn as of September 27, 2017, according to the Ministry of Finance, while the nation\u2019s external reserves rose to $33.93bn as of November 3, 2017, latest data from the Central Bank of Nigeria showed on Monday. \n\u201cThe price rise is a reaction to the uncertainty from Saudi Arabia,\u201d the Chief Executive Officer, Sun Global Investments, Mihir Kapadi, told The Guardian. \nOther factors have edged the oil price upwards. Saudi Arabia, Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan met over the weekend and said they were willing to maintain restrictions on oil production, to address a glut in supply and prop up prices. \nThe United Arab Emirates and Iraq have also said they would back an extension to production curbs, which were due to end in March 2018. \nMeanwhile, Nigeria has expressed support for an extension of a deal between the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-members to cut oil supply until the end of 2018, \u201cas long as the right terms are on the table\u201d regarding its own participation. \nThe Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, said there was growing agreement among other members of OPEC to extend the deal. \n\u201cThere isn\u2019t any reason to change what is a winning formula,\u201d he told reporters, adding, \u201cThere is a consensus to extend. The issue will be the duration.\u201d \nNigeria itself, however, is exempt from the deal. \nOPEC, along with Russia and nine other producers agreed to cut oil output by about 1.8 million barrels per day until March 2018 in an attempt to ease a global excess that weighed on prices.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:52:41.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "066e338818dbea0a6a461b92050611e3adfe5d17", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc63ADW4p4IngKfdC.vAXXVp", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/v/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/v/ - Video Games - 4chan", "title": "Play Warframe", "title_full": "/v/ - Play Warframe - Video Games - 4chan", "published": "2017-11-07T08:15:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 217, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.005, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "0855b3910379d34ebc468282daecdd61d16bf928", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1ptr64PLjVcc63ADW4p4IngFpmQpWKaU_xDfe2ev943ME-", "ord_in_thread": 137, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-11-07T10:39:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>396029774\nMore", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:52:41.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "327abb8bde1631c34816093ceaf46f8da27f11af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFp7QXUy94rCyKSrRWb0ZuTCEHzeRrkk6Cf1EiSzUoEucZGC5pYmZD9GJFqyP50OULgUw2_0jPHt6A--", "site_full": "gadgetsis.com", "site": "gadgetsis.com", "site_section": "http://gadgetsis.com/feed/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Gadgetsis.com RSS", "title": "best type of croshet briad hair", "title_full": "best type of croshet briad hair", "published": "2017-11-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "CA", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "327abb8bde1631c34816093ceaf46f8da27f11af", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFp7QXUy94rCyKSrRWb0ZuTCEHzeRrkk6Cf1EiSzUoEucZGC5pYmZD9GJFqyP50OULgUw2_0jPHt6A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-11-07T10:54:00.000+02:00", "title": "best type of croshet briad hair", "text": "\u00bb Easy Shag Long Hair \nBest Type Of Croshet Briad Hair is match and guidelines that suggested for you, for motivation about you search.

B., pregiudicato di 48anni, sottoposto al regime degli arresti domiciliari, proprio per essere stato arrestato per il reato di stupefacenti, aveva installato presso la sua abitazione un circuito di videosorveglianza, in modo da osservare il perimetro dello stabile, oltre all\u2019area parcheggio. \nI poliziotti, avendo osservato il modus operandi dello spacciatore, abitante al piano rialzato, hanno fatto irruzione nell\u2019abitazione nell\u2019attimo in cui ne stava uscendo uno dei tanti acquirenti. \nLa sorpresa degli agenti, nell\u2019entrare in casa, \u00e8 stata quella di sorprendere, nel salone-soggiorno, tre bambini, di et\u00e0 compresa tra i 10 ed i 13 anni, che guardavano la tv mentre era in atto l\u2019attivit\u00e0 di spaccio, mentre da un\u2019altra smart tv, ubicata nello stesso ambiente, venivano trasmesse le immagini del sistema di videosorveglianza. \nInutile il tentativo del 48enne, alla vista dei poliziotti, di disfarsi di un involucro, contenente droga, cercando di lanciarlo dalla finestra dell\u2019appartamento, prontamente, strappatogli dalle mani da un poliziotto. \nSulla penisola della zona cucina, rinvenuto un bilancino di precisione, numerosissime banconote di vario taglio, per la somma di \u20ac.1.400,00, un rotolo di buste per il confezionamento, un accendino ed un paio di forbici. \nIdentificato e segnalato alla competente Autorit\u00e0 l\u2019acquirente, trovato in possesso di una dose di \u201ccocaina\u201d, acquistata per la somma di \u20ac.20,00. \nLa droga sequestrata allo spacciatore, dalla quale era possibile confezionare almeno 50 dosi, \u00e8 risultata essere identica a quella sequestrata all\u2019acquirente. L\u2019uomo \u00e8 stato arrestato, in quanto responsabile del reato di spaccio e di detenzione ai fini di spaccio di sostanza stupefacente, e condotto dalla Polizia alla Casa Circondariale di Poggioreale.
