I live in the Hills District in NSW and the front yard gets a lot of afternoon/evening sun. Land is on clay soil.\nAttached above is a photo of my front garden and I'm think of planting some gardenias in the region highlighted with the black circle. The red circle is around an existing gardenia. Is this a good idea? I'm hoping they will all grow together into one longish gardenia bush. Important thing for me is the overall height should be lower than the bottom f the window as I don't want to block sunlight into the front room.\nAlso, does anybody know what sort of tree that is (the tall tree between the circles)? Just curious\nRegarding the bottom photo, what should I plant in the areas highlighted by the purple and orange boxes? I was thinking a pomegranate tree? My parents have one and it fruits and is not very big. There used to be a very tall tree where the purple box is but that was removed as the roots kept damaging and blocking the sewer line which runs directly under that area. Also that tree blocked a lot of light from the adjacent Buxus hedge so the back part of the hedge was virtually dead (largely recovered now that the tree is gone).\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated\nThanks,\nClaude\n Like \u22c5 Add a comment \u22c5 Pin to Ideaboard \u22c5 Share", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:12.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8049cecbea54a495063d88added39ceb79c96674", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTnD1wl2UkTKqpvf14YMuu0j3upLi7ipFG7ry55vaFpBt1RIdj1S.eLmVLcKx8DtWSRrfQMN1KAA68YJC8d.rOZThrokF4z2nHA3NRfWQrXrDAqZ5Trug6RQuEuOKYMSKFcfN9vIf.iVu7RehxGv5Lz", "site_full": "brynawelhouse.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://brynawelhouse.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Health24.com | Should you avoid bananas if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re trying to lose weight? \u2013 Brynawel House", "title": "Health24.com | Should you avoid bananas if you\u2019re trying to lose weight?", "title_full": "Health24.com | Should you avoid bananas if you\u2019re trying to lose weight?", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8049cecbea54a495063d88added39ceb79c96674", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTnD1wl2UkTKqpvf14YMuu0j3upLi7ipFG7ry55vaFpBt1RIdj1S.eLmVLcKx8DtWSRrfQMN1KAA68YJC8d.rOZThrokF4z2nHA3NRfWQrXrDAqZ5Trug6RQuEuOKYMSKFcfN9vIf.iVu7RehxGv5Lz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brynawel House", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "Health24.com | Should you avoid bananas if you\u2019re trying to lose weight?", "text": "Bananas are full of sugar, but does it matter?\nfrom Health24 News http://www.health24.com/Diet-and-nutrition/Weight-loss/should-you-avoid-bananas-if-youre-trying-to-lose-weight-20171206 ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:12.003+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f7d28a6d59cbacf8027b892e3afe9bc8d0a7007a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDjyY7oAtSfSSYgXFmV5BGugV2BpueiRD_neKbkIAjKIFNXEfOenerJAQlnDvSbsLlA6fWDjztD6gay81Azsq0Hpccmz5K7YzgFrPdsjLKcww9Cy1eyJw2wNIoNUUaT2lMg--", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "C.H.

drug cocktail doubles chance of holding lung cancer at bay Thursday, December 07, 2017 1:01 a.m. EST \nBy John Miller \nZURICH (Reuters) - Adding Roche's immunotherapy Tecentriq to older drugs doubled the percentage of lung cancer patients who survived a year without their disease advancing, an outcome some experts labelled unprecedented. \nThirty seven percent of patients in a closely watched clinical trial who received Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy reached the one-year mark without their cancer progressing (PFS), according to data released on Thursday. \nFor patients getting only Avastin and chemotherapy, that fell to 18 percent. \nRoche's announcement in November that its Impower 150 trial had broadly succeeded in first-line lung cancer patients helped spur a one-day, $12 billion rally in the Basel-based drugmaker's market capitalisation. \nThursday's release of specific numbers at a European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Geneva could further fan investor optimism that the Swiss drugmaker is gaining on rivals Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb. \nRoche Chief Executive Severin Schwan sees an opportunity to leap-frog ahead as competitors still await their own lung cancer combination trial results. \n\"This is very, very promising,\" Dr Solange Peters, the head of Medical Oncology at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois in Lausanne, Switzerland, said on the latest results. \n\"Doubling PFS (progression-free survival) at one year is something we have not seen with any targeted therapy in unselected patients to date.\" \nIn a second significant trial result, Roche also released positive interim data from its recently approved haemophilia drug Hemlibra dosed every four weeks, saying the results were consistent with previous studies of the medicine dosed once a week or every two weeks. \nRoche said it would submit the results from both studies to regulatory authorities around the world. \nThe Swiss company's shares rose more than 1 percent in Zurich. \nAnalysts said the \"highly significant\" risk reduction from the study will help cement Tecentriq as a strong competitor to Merck's Keytruda. \n\"We see the Impower 150 outcomes sufficient for Roche to submit a robust data package to the health authorities and very likely obtain a marketing authorization in the U.S. by mid-2018,\" wrote Bruno Bulic, a Baader Helvea analyst with a \"buy\" rating on Roche shares. \nRoche is counting on $150,000-per-year Tecentriq to help replace revenue from its $20 billion-per-year trio of Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan whose patents have expired or will shortly, exposing them to cheaper competition. \nAccording to estimates collected by Reuters, Tecentriq annual sales are seen topping $4.6 billion by 2023. \nLung cancer is easily the biggest oncology market, with about 220,000 people in the United States due to be diagnosed this year and 155,000 seen dying from the disease often caused by smoking. \nIn Roche's 1,202-patient study, patients getting Roche's immunotherapy survived an average of 8.3 months without their disease getting worse, only modestly better than the PFS of 6.8 months for those getting chemotherapy and Avastin. \nStill, analysts focused more on the 38 percent reduction in risk of disease progression or death in the Tecentriq group, well within the range they have said would signify a robust result. \nOVERALL SURVIVAL \nFor a set of patients who expressed a specific biomarker called \"Teff\" that Roche is exploring to help identify people who may respond best, the results were more robust, with a 49 percent risk reduction and PFS at 11.3 months for the Tecentriq group versus 6.8 months. \nRoche, which said serious adverse events were seen in 25.4 percent of patients getting the Tecentriq combination compared with 19.3 percent in the Avastin-chemo group, is still awaiting Impower 150's overall survival data in the first half of 2018. \nStill, the trial's head, Dr Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf, said those numbers \"look encouraging\". \nTecentriq is already approved in bladder cancer treatment and for lung cancer patients who have failed chemotherapy. \n(Reporting by John Miller; Editing by Ben Hirschler/Mark Potter/Susan Fenton) More From Health ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Jerusalem as the capital of Israel , UAE state news agency WAM reported. \nSuch unilateral decisions are contrary to the internationally legitimate resolutions and show a bias against the historical and permanent rights of the Palestinian people in Jerusalem, the report quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation as saying. \nThe ministry also expressed its \"deep concern\" about the repercussions of this decision on the stability of the region, noting that it inflamed the feelings of Arabs and Muslims who have great esteem for Jerusalem. \nThe ministry stressed the need \"to abide by all UN resolutions related to the city of Jerusalem, including Security Council resolutions and the principles of international law.\" \nThe UAE does not recognize the state of Israel. However, Israel is one of the 180 member states of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) based in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi. \nTrump announced Wednesday his official recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and instructed moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that triggered wide criticism and concerns around the world. \nTrump said in a televised speech that his decision is based on The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995.

conference in Tokyo, Japan December 7, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Sharp Corp <6753.T> will ask the government to help it form an alliance with rival Japan Display Inc <6740.T> in OLED technology to better compete with South Korean makers, its chief executive said on Thursday. \n\"We should create a Japan alliance\" in organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels, Tai Jeng-wu told reporters at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), after Sharp's shares returned to the bourse's first section after a year's absence. \nOLED screens are gaining in popularity as they are generally thinner, more flexible and offer richer colors than liquid crystal display (LCD) panels. Apple Inc has adopted OLED screens for its new iPhone X. \nSharp and Japan Display, both Apple suppliers, plan to start OLED panel production next year or later. South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd <005930.KS> already supplies OLED panels to global smartphone vendors while LG Display Co Ltd <034220.KS> does likewise for television set makers. \n\"Do we want (OLED) technology in Japan or not? I'd like to speak with the industry ministry and INCJ (the Innovation Network Corp of Japan) on the matter,\" Tai said. \nState-backed INCJ owns 36 percent of Japan Display, which was formed by combining the ailing display units of Sony Corp <6758.T>, Hitachi Ltd <6501.T> and Toshiba Corp <6502.T>. \nTai also said he would contact the government for potential investment in JOLED, a Japan Display affiliate, which sold its inaugural batch of OLED screens to Sony on Tuesday. \nJOLED, which boasts a low-cost printing process for OLED panels, is seeking to raise 100 billion yen ($888 million) in investment from materials, equipment and electronics makers to expand production capacity. \nJapan Display and INCJ declined to comment. JOLED declined to provide immediate comment. \nTai, former vice chairman of Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (Foxconn) < 2317.TW >, became head of Sharp last year after Foxconn took control of a Japanese firm hit by price competition and falling sales in LCD panels. \nTai has said he would step down once Sharp turns profitable at the net level and its shares return to the TSE's first section. \nSharp forecasts net profit of 69 billion yen for the year through March, which would be its first annual profit in four years following cost-cutting under Foxconn. \nIts shares returned to the TSE's first section on Thursday for the first time since August last year, when they fell to the second section after Sharp booked negative net assets. \nWhen asked about his future, Tai on Thursday said he wants Sharp's board to select a co-chief executive next year to whom he could transfer some of his responsibilities. \n($1 = 112.0200 yen) \n(Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki;

The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary. The upgrade follows Fitch's assessment that there has been an improvement in the credit profile of CNS' parent Nomura Holdings, Inc. (A-/Stable/bbb+) relative to other entities on the Thai National Ratings scale, which has enhanced its ability to provide support to its Thai subsidiary (see also Fitch Affirms Nomura and Daiwa; Upgrades VR of Nomura Holdings, published 25 October 2017). KEY RATING DRIVERS CNS's National Long-Term Rating reflects Fitch's view of its strategic importance to Nomura Holdings. This is due to the majority shareholding by the parent, high levels of management control and integration, name- and brand-sharing, and history of financial support from Nomura Holdings. CNS has a well-established franchise and a relatively diverse client base in the Thai securities industry. It has been consistently profitable, posting net income of THB388 million in 9M17, up from THB293 million a year earlier. RATING SENSITIVITIES CNS's ratings could be impacted by any changes in Fitch's view on the parent's propensity to provide extraordinary support. For example, this may be indicated by significant changes in shareholding or in the level of control Nomura Holdings has in CNS. However, Fitch does not expect any of such changes to affect Nomura Holdings' propensity to support CNS in the near term. CNS's ratings would also be affected by further changes in Nomura Holdings' credit profile. The rating actions are as follows: - National Long-Term Rating upgraded to 'AA(tha)' from 'AA-(tha)'; Outlook Stable - National Short-Term Rating affirmed at 'F1+(tha)' - National Short-Term Rating on unsecured unsubordinated debenture programme affirmed at 'F1+(tha)' Published By Thai PR", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "fitch", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fitch upgrades national rating of capital nomura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura securities public company limited", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fitch affirms nomura", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura holdings", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nomura holdings, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daiwa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:13.009+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d171bce20a660234ca04199e5f78add660667988", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mI7G8vPKyke9Z10hl2ZujDH8cN1vAwZVP.Fw1yeGznA--", "site_full": "www.pr.com", "site": "pr.com", "site_section": "http://www.pr.com/press-releases", "site_categories": ["search_engine", "tech"], "section_title": "Free Press Release Distribution | Send Press Releases Online | PR.com", "title": "Jason Spak, Attorney, FisherBroyles, LLP to Speak at the Knowledge Group\u0092s Event", "title_full": "Jason Spak, Attorney, FisherBroyles, LLP to Speak at the Knowledge Group\u0092s Event - PR.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 29360, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d171bce20a660234ca04199e5f78add660667988", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.mI7G8vPKyke9Z10hl2ZujDH8cN1vAwZVP.Fw1yeGznA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "PR.com", "published": "2017-12-07T02:00:00.000+02:00", "title": "Jason Spak, Attorney, FisherBroyles, LLP to Speak at the Knowledge Group\u0092s Event", "text": "Jason Spak, Attorney, FisherBroyles, LLP to Speak at the Knowledge Group\u0092s Event\nThe Knowledge Group/The Knowledge Congress Live Webcast Series, the leading producer of regulatory focused webcasts, has announced today that Jason Spak, Attorney, FisherBroyles, LLP will speak at the Knowledge Group\u0092s webcast.\nNew York, NY, For further details, please visit: https://www.theknowledgegroup.org/webcasts/tax-accounting-finance/finance/the-debt-collection-practices-act\nAbout Jason Spak\nJason Spak defends debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies against claims under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), and related statutes.\nJason has handled FDCPA and FCRA cases since 2004, in more than 25 states.

The store owner was really cheap, like unbelievably cheap. When I was doing a super-deep cleaning for the health inspector, I found a bag of ice cream cups that had some weird black fuzzy things at the very bottom of each cup. I threw away the whole bag, not telling the store owner what I had found. After throwing away the bag, there was a barrage of customers that came in (because it was summer and we sell tons of ice cream like hotcakes)! About a half hour later after soloing, I went to the back room to grab some tubs of ice cream to replace in the front. When I walked into the backroom, I saw the cups on the table. All washed, but they still had a shade in them. It was really disgusting because what was in the cups was mold.

I\u2019m just trying to get back to normal and then I can start building bikes. \n\u201cI was looking to get back on the bike before Christmas but with the weather you can\u2019t tell. Last year I went to France and the Isle of Wight. \n\u201cSo this year I am looking to get in a few trips away before March, which is always handy.\u201d \nThe teenager, who won the British U19 Championship before his injury, is not concerned he could miss out on preparation time as he was injured over the summer last year. \nTwo years ago he broke a finger whilst riding for the Birmingham Brummies after getting his finger caught in one of his bike\u2019s spokes. \nWajtknecht didn\u2019t feel held back by that injury and doesn\u2019t believe his spleen injury will do so either. \n\u201cLast year I broke my finger around about the same time as I did my spleen this year, so when I did get back on the bike, it felt normal,\u201d he added. \n\u201cThe fingers were more of an injury which affected my clutch hand, so hopefully I can just jump back on the bike and make a few changes. \n\u201cI was scoring good points, I was just getting the three and fours, in some meetings I did get some bonus points which is good too. \n\u201cI was gradually getting on. I found a good set-up and the injury was disappointing but I\u2019m happy I could help them when I could.\u201d \nWajtknecht is overjoyed by his return to Robins colours for their SGB Premiership title defence. \n\u201cI was over the moon when they asked me to go back to Swindon,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just getting to grips with racing in the Premiership before I got injured. I was finding some consistency, my scores were improving and I was beating some good riders. \n\u201cSo to be asked to go back gives me a chance to carry on from where I was. The team is looking strong again with as many faces coming back from last season as we can and it would be amazing if we could win the league for a second season running in 2018.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zach wajtknecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alun rossiter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wajtknecht", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wight", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "swindon robins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbey stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "birmingham brummies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swindon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:13.037+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "258b012a1297dc22ddb3b243a7a892c8f21456fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRZDMEtdSB_YqPj9Z7PsLCWpZ3vz6q6kpa14SYy5hu_sURf3kJgaWOGXWl_QclC4iETjFqtFTYmoQglWj2bkdkesukbZvoZGco-", "site_full": "www.24hourcampfire.com", "site": "24hourcampfire.com", "site_section": "https://www.24hourcampfire.com/ubbthreads/ubbthreads.php/forums/39/1/", "site_categories": ["hobbies_and_interests"], "section_title": "Custom Rifles &amp; Wildcats - 24hourcampfire", "title": "What's better than CeraKote?", "title_full": "What's better than CeraKote? - 24hourcampfire", "published": "2017-12-07T17:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.174, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 90814, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "258b012a1297dc22ddb3b243a7a892c8f21456fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRZDMEtdSB_YqPj9Z7PsLCWpZ3vz6q6kpa14SYy5hu_sURf3kJgaWOGXWl_QclC4iETjFqtFTYmoQglWj2bkdkesukbZvoZGco-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "TC1", "published": "2017-12-07T17:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "What's better than CeraKote?", "text": "What else is out there?

Also known as Tenifer, Melonite and probably a couple other proprietary names. It's actually a surface hardening treatment and adds no dimensional change like a coating so even the bore is treated. Extremely corrosion and wear resistant. I had H&M do a muzzleloader barrel for me. Looks like a good bluing and zero rust issues.\nAn explanation from their website:\n\"H&M Blacknitride+\u2122, or Ferritic Nitrocarburizing, is the thermochemical that simultaneously diffuses nitrogen and carbon into the surface of ferrous metals. During the process, a two-part surface layer is formed, an outer iron nitride layer with a nitrogen diffusion layer below it. Nitrogen and carbon are absorbed by and diffused into the surface of the metal. Reproducible and uniform layers with a predetermined thickness will be formed on all areas of the metal. This process results in markedly improved surface properties on ferrous metal parts while maintaining dimensional and shape stability.\"\nLast edited by tmitch; 12/04/17 .

It is a great finish, but the recommended place called me and said they wouldn't do the serial numbered part after I shipped to them. They also wanted a check before sending it back for return postage. I kinda lost my temper in a big way. I had 3 discussions with them before shipping it to them. This was the place that Satterlie recommended and our bud, new guy, used on his Mauser Ti rifle. Work was fantastic, but just be sure and check them closely first. Melonite will treat your bore also and greatly increase your barrel life.\nSome treatments can foul the rifle bore.

Relative to the ASTM D975 and D7467 specifications for diesel and biodiesel blends, the Top Tier Diesel Performance Standard requires detergents to reduce deposits on the fuel injectors, improve lubricity, improve fuel stability, and provide more protection against water and particulates that may be in the fuel before dispensing it into vehicles and equipment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "meghan sapp", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "growmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "growmark, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "astm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:14.006+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "733968febef93776bc49c97b7289cc00e457483e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTPjwXBrB6VWQqFNiGMagQdxJ9upFZP372gBoGQQCfF0mUeZ2bm2Osoy1DMigmDeis-", "site_full": "www.enotalone.com", "site": "enotalone.com", "site_section": "https://www.enotalone.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=5", "site_categories": ["marriage", "social"], "section_title": "Relationships ", "title": "Courtship and Sex Outside of Marriage - Marriage Advice", "title_full": "Courtship and Sex Outside of Marriage - Marriage Advice", "published": "2017-12-06T14:44:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 7, "participants_count": 5, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5e24d7c77ca0cb2f5cf08e5a75530058817ed7f8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTPjwXBrB6VWQqFNiGMagQdxJ9upFZP372gBoGQQCfF0mUeZ2bm2OsoqTbb4z94GrGqiyqZ5.Gh5MIU3Gh7pl10Qji3eru.Utc-", "ord_in_thread": 6, "author": "IAmFCA Platinum Member", "published": "2017-12-07T08:41:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Originally Posted by Andrina [ Register to see the link ] I only know that sexual compatibility is usually one of the important things most people need for a satisfying relationship or marriage. What if you marry someone and then find out that their pleasure derives from painful sex? Would you be comfortable delivering that for your partner's satisfaction? Or if you have a low libido and your partner has a high one, the one with the lower libido will always feel pressured and the one with the higher libido will always feel frustrated.\nThese are important things you can't know until you've had sex.\nThere is no crystal ball to find out if a person will dump you at any point, whether you've had sex or not, even after marriage. It is certainly best to weed out players who won't stick around after the initial first dates if you don't give in to sex with them, but it's a safe bet a person who sticks around after the honeymoon stage of the first 3 to 6 months and is patient about waiting to have sex, that their intent is that they really wanted to get to know you, and not just be a short term sex buddy.

Perhaps you've found a flaw in your belief system that you'd like to explore more deeply in your adherence to your faith, but that is a long process of reflection ahead.\nInstead, I'll focus on what jumps out at me about the reasoning in your post.\nIt seems to me that your concept of marriage itself is somewhat warped, and possibly dangerously.\nMarriage is not about \"sending a message to the guy.\" Or the woman.\nIt's a mutual decision that affirms the desire -- and the hope -- of being able to spend the rest of your lives together.\nAnd, it's also not a \"test\". It's not a test to see how loyal the person you've married is going to be to you, as you suggest here:\nOriginally Posted by xyz27 But, it communicates that you don't trust the person not to leave you, after doing the deed. If you are so unsteady in your commitment to one another that by the time marriage is proposed, you are still thinking in terms of \"How can I make SURE this person doesn't leave me?\", then you have no business getting married. In other words, marriage is not a method or a prop for proving a partner's fidelity, and shouldn't be \"used\" that way. Getting married should entail having long solidified feelings of trust and faith in each other as partners. If that's missing, no one is ready for \"I do's.\"\nFurthermore, marriage is no insurance policy that a partner won't leave you. Look at the 60% divorce rate, and the even higher rate of marital infidelity, and you'll see that just because you've had a wedding and are wearing wedding rings, doesn't mean you can say, \"Whew, now I'm in the clear! My partner will never abandon me after the deed!\" People can and do leave marriages all the time -- maybe not the next day after the deed, but within months or years.\nSo it's totally misguided in my opinion to frame marriage as some kind of strategy about how to win trust and faithfulness.\nYou don't win trust and faithfulness by getting married.\nYou win getting married by building trust and faithfulness.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:14.028+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "797c255a3cf8222ac185e6e0030b9f8454a0a61c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlUw2L_XJ4vCGY.Zt7Gwu0tT23RQvyUUsOe.RjP4rZLDGXwyz1xWGqYyewEDHNYmLQ7LFmmt6umPc_sCc5oxXwFR4xh0.puabyakl4joT3Vqb9TIAw7qZk.RayTzudF_U-", "site_full": "travelhelpguru.wordpress.com", "site": "wordpress.com", "site_section": "https://travelhelpguru.wordpress.com", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "25%* off Le Tada Residence, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed) \u2013 Travel Help Guru", "title": "25%* off Le Tada Residence, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed)", "title_full": "25%* off Le Tada Residence, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed)", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "797c255a3cf8222ac185e6e0030b9f8454a0a61c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSlUw2L_XJ4vCGY.Zt7Gwu0tT23RQvyUUsOe.RjP4rZLDGXwyz1xWGqYyewEDHNYmLQ7LFmmt6umPc_sCc5oxXwFR4xh0.puabyakl4joT3Vqb9TIAw7qZk.RayTzudF_U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "travelhelpguru", "published": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.000+02:00", "title": "25%* off Le Tada Residence, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed)", "text": "25%* off Le Tada Residence, Bangkok (Promo Code Not Needed) can be read on: TravelHelpGuru.com \n\nGet Discount \nPromo code & hotel info Hotel name: Le Tada Residence, Bangkok\nAddress: 440/9 Ratchawithi Soi 3, Pratunam, Ratchathewi, Pathumwan, 10400 Bangkok, Thailand\nCity: Bangkok\nCountry: Thailand\nDescription: Featuring free WiFi, a fitness center and a year-round outdoor pool, Le Tada Residence offers accommodations in Bangkok, just 1.1 miles from Siam Paragon Mall.

REUTERS \nBy Yasmeen Abutaleb \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Josh Brookhart has four health insurers to choose from in Seattle's King County for 2018, more than many Americans like him who buy coverage on the Obamacare individual market. \nYet none of the plans cover all the complex medical care needed for his seven-year-old son, Gabriel. \nBorn with an extreme form of Chiari malformation, Gabriel required surgery to reinsert a part of his brain into his skull. He lives with hydrocephalus, or extra fluid in his brain, and spina bifida, which causes abnormal development of the spinal cord. \nThe Brookharts' insurer, Regence BlueShield of Washington, said in June it would exit the Obamacare markets in 2018, citing unsettled marketplaces across the country, a move common to many insurers uncertain about the program's future under President Donald Trump. \nAll of Gabriel's specialists, who span multiple medical centers and practices and have been coordinating his care for five years, were covered under Regence. \nBased on the limited options for 2018 enrollment, the Brookharts plan to pick an insurer that will cover some of Gabriel's care and expect to pay tens of thousands of dollars for the rest of his needs. \n\"I would pay a high price for a good policy. It's just mind-boggling to me that it doesn't exist no matter how much I would want to pay,\" Brookhart said. \nGabriel's case shows how difficult it can still be to find adequate healthcare for very complex conditions four years after Obamacare took full effect. In many cases, an insurer will cover medical care but not certain prescription drugs. In other cases, an insurer may cover one specialist doctor but not others, or cut expensive academic medical centers out of their networks to lower costs. \nPatients with complex medical cases often take high-cost prescription drugs, rely on specialists who sometimes coordinate their care and may require sophisticated surgeries, among other needs. \nThe challenge of finding adequate healthcare on the Obamacare market is expected to intensify as the Trump administration strips away aspects of the law, healthcare experts say. \n\"Instability is just a very stressful thing for people dependent on a stable connection to the healthcare system,\" said Daniel Polsky, professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. \"Even just a change of doctors could result in some difficult health consequences.\" \nRESTRICTED CHOICE \nU.S. consumers have often complained that subsidized health insurance under former President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act restricted their choice of doctors, or forced them to change providers. In some cases, that may mean switching primary care providers. But for patients with serious medical needs it can prevent them from seeing their specialists. \nThe Obama administration attempted a fix, directing more federal oversight of the plans, requiring transparency from insurers on what they did, and did not, cover and setting guidelines for insurers to cover enough healthcare providers. \nTrump has promised to repeal Obamacare and is using executive powers to undermine it, including a rule finalized in April that allows individual states to determine whether insurers provide enough access to doctors. \nThe administration has also proposed giving states more authority over their insurance markets and allowing them to water down some Obamacare benefits in 2019. That could create wide discrepancies in access to doctors among states, said Sabrina Corlette, an expert on health insurance markets at Georgetown University. \nThere is no national estimate of how many people with complex medical cases may struggle to find a plan that covers their particular doctors. About 2.2 million people on the individual market have some form of a pre-existing chronic condition, according to Avalere Health, a research and consulting firm. \nSeventy-three percent of the Obamacare 2018 individual market is comprised of restrictive plans, or those that cover fewer providers, according to Avalere, up from 68 percent in 2017 and 54 percent in 2015. \nResearch has shown that insurers are more likely to offer limited access to doctor practices in markets where they compete against one or more rivals. This helps keep insurer costs down, and therefore allows them to offer lower prices. \nMatt Slaby of Denver, Colorado, can choose between six Obamacare insurers, but none cover all the care for his genetic blood clotting disorder, called Factor V Leiden. He relies on the bloodthinner Xarelto, which costs about $400 per month without insurance, to prevent life-threatening clots. \nHis insurer from last year, Cigna Corp , dropped his plan from the Denver market for 2018. \n\"There are no plans that cover everything I need,\" Slaby said. \"Finding two or three, the intersection of things that keep me alive, that's the challenge.\" \nIn U.S. counties with a single insurer, there is less incentive to whittle down the provider list because there is no competition. The departure of major insurers including Aetna Inc and Humana Inc from Obamacare markets has left about half of U.S. counties with only one insurer selling plans, up from one-third in 2017. \nBut that does not guarantee that a sole insurer in a market will cover medical care at any specific hospital or physician practice. \nIn Virginia's Chesterfield County, a single insurer, Cigna, is offering Obamacare coverage, presenting a tough choice for Jodi Smith Lemacks, whose son was born with a heart defect. The plan does not cover her son's specialists at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) five hours away, where Joshua Lemacks, 14, has been treated since he was in utero for hypoplastic left heart syndrome. \nThere is no cure for his condition. In three major surgeries, doctors at CHOP have rerouted Joshua's anatomy so that his blood can pump through one heart chamber instead of two. They have also provided medication, some through a clinical trial, to help prolong his heart's ability to function in this way. \nLemacks spends $6,000 to $7,000 a year out-of-pocket for Joshua's medical expenses, and once had medical debt close to $100,000 due to the surgeries. She decided to put him on her employer's plan for 2018, but says if anything were to happen to her job at a nonprofit or she chooses to change jobs, she would need to return to the Obamacare market. \n\"You do everything you can to protect your kids but at the end of the day if you can't get coverage, you can't get coverage,\" she said. \n(Editing by Michele Gershberg and Edward Tobin) More From Health ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "obamacare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jodi smith lemacks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua lemacks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yasmeen abutaleb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookhart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chiari", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward tobin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt slaby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel polsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sabrina corlette", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michele gershberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "slaby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh brookhart", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lemacks", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "leonard davis institute of health economics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avalere", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aetna inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humana inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cigna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regence blueshield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avalere health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cigna corp", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obamacare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chesterfield county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brookharts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "children's hospital of philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leiden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richmond", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:16.002+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "74f802a6c230ced7f61b6cb7df311143f80d15bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWYedrXN0FvT.ne_RCprNnHiZHdVRY_Rrmo69gCuAoCX8dWNvqdBrW0Q6IPUB9kDweRx9AZqZC27bY5Do5hkJuAkJruS61MSq4M71U8xkPDIHtnhMlP.95NqHXUv7kcEleWC0cMYQy9XrtIYgftwk8gnLZ4MuhB48-", "site_full": "www.nationalparkstraveler.org", "site": "nationalparkstraveler.org", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NationalParksTraveler", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "National Parks Traveler", "title": "Virgin Island National Park Reopens Cinnamon Bay Beach Amid Recovery Efforts", "title_full": "Virgin Island National Park Reopens Cinnamon Bay Beach Amid Recovery Efforts", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": null, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "74f802a6c230ced7f61b6cb7df311143f80d15bb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTWYedrXN0FvT.ne_RCprNnHiZHdVRY_Rrmo69gCuAoCX8dWNvqdBrW0Q6IPUB9kDweRx9AZqZC27bY5Do5hkJuAkJruS61MSq4M71U8xkPDIHtnhMlP.95NqHXUv7kcEleWC0cMYQy9XrtIYgftwk8gnLZ4MuhB48-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "NPT Staff", "published": "2017-12-07T10:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "Virgin Island National Park Reopens Cinnamon Bay Beach Amid Recovery Efforts", "text": "Virgin Island National Park Reopens Cinnamon Bay Beach Amid Recovery Efforts By NPT Staff on December 7th, 2017 Cinnamon Bay is the fourth beach to reopen in Virgin Islands National Park after cleanup from hurricane damage/NPS, Murray Shoemaker \nBit by bit, Virgin Islands National Park is reopening its beaches after taking back-to-back punches in September from Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which left people without power, blew the roofs off buildings, and snapped trees in half . \nOn Saturday, Cinnamon Bay Beach opened to visitors, although concession operations there remain closed with no estimated reopening date.

Regions experiencing these soil moisture deficits are deemed \u201chotspots\u201d. Persistent hotspot regions have the potential to develop into drought. \nFacts: Soil Moisture \nAcross the North Island, soil moisture levels have generally continued to decrease during the past week. The most significant decreases were observed from the Coromandel Peninsula to Bay of Plenty as well as Gisborne, northern Hawke\u2019s Bay, northern Auckland and eastern Northland. Meanwhile, minor soil moisture increases occurred in small parts of central Waikato. The driest soils across the North Island compared to normal for this time of the year are found in Kaipara District, northern Auckland, much of Taranaki, and Manawatu District south to the Kapiti Coast and Wellington City, while the wettest soils for this time of the year are located in a small portion of central Waikato. \nNorth Island hotspots are currently in place across Kaipara District, northern and central Auckland, southern Gisborne, much of Hawke\u2019s Bay, Tararua District south to Wairarapa, and coastal Manawatu-Whanganui south to Kapiti Coast and Wellington City. \nAcross the South Island, soil moisture levels have continued to decrease for most locations during the past week. The most significant decreases were observed in the western half of the island across Tasman, West Coast, and Southland, while minor decreases occurred in the eastern South Island. A slight increase in soil moisture levels was observed in a small portion of Mackenzie and Waitaki districts. The driest soils across the South Island compared to normal for this time of the year are found in Tasman, West Coast, Southland, and Stewart Island, while the wettest soils for this time of the year are found in a small portion of Mackenzie and Waitaki districts. \nSouth Island hotspots are currently located in Nelson, northern Tasman, coastal Marlborough, nearly all of northern and central Canterbury, coastal south Canterbury, Clutha District, and eastern and central Southland. \nOutlook and Soil Moisture \nIsolated pop-up showers will be possible across the central and upper North Island from Friday through to Sunday (8-10 December), with rainfall amounts expected to be 10 mm or less. However, some locations will likely see little or no rain during this time. On Monday, a band of heavier showers and even thunderstorms could impact the upper North Island, with isolated amounts of 10-20 mm possible. Generally dry weather is expected on Tuesday (12th December), with scattered showers possible on Wednesday and Thursday that may produce another few millimetres. Total rainfall in the next week across the North Island could range from as much as 25 mm in the Central Plateau to as little as 5 mm along the eastern coast. \nDespite the expected rainfall during the next week, meaningful improvements in soil moisture levels are not expected. While minor improvements will be possible across the central and upper North Island, any hotspots there will remain in place. Meanwhile, low rainfall will lead to strengthening hotspots across the east coast and lower North Island. \nIn the South Island, a front will bring substantial rainfall to Fiordland and West Coast from Friday through the weekend (8-10 December), with amounts of 50-100 mm commonplace, along with isolated higher amounts. Unfortunately, little if any rainfall from this front will occur east of the Alps. Another front will move north across the central and lower South Island on Tuesday and Wednesday, bringing 5-15 mm to many locations from Southland to Canterbury. Isolated showers on Thursday (14th December) could produce a few more millimetres. \nDue to substantial rainfall, soil moisture levels could improve significantly across Fiordland and West Coast during the next week. However, further soil moisture decreases could occur across the upper and eastern South Island. Therefore, hotspots in these areas are expected to remain in place, while increasing in coverage across southern Canterbury and Otago. \nBackground: \nHotspot Watch a weekly advisory service for New Zealand media. It provides soil moisture and precipitation measurements around the country to help assess whether extremely dry conditions are imminent. \nSoil moisture deficit : the amount of water needed to bring the soil moisture content back to field capacity, which is the maximum amount of water the soil can hold. \nSoil moisture anomaly : the difference between the historical normal soil moisture deficit (or surplus) for a given time of year and actual soil moisture deficits. \nDefinitions: \u201cExtremely\u201d and \u201cseverely\u201d dry soils are based on a combination of the current soil moisture status and the difference from normal soil moisture (see soil moisture maps at https://www.niwa.co.nz/climate/nz-drought-monitor/droughtindicatormaps) \nPictured above: Soil Moisture Anomaly Maps, relative to this time of year.

Plugs on tabletop lamps made charging iPhones and tablets easy and convenient. The desk chair was comfy. The bathroom and shower were comfortable and while small, like the room, the bathroom had everything we needed. The only downside was that the heatingf was not particularly quiet. The comfortable bed and otherwise remarkably quiet room made for a welcome and peaceful sleep, though. A complimentary lobby wine bar in the evening, and marvelous staff made for a very special feel. The staff checked our bags for the day after our checkout - a HUGE convenience as we didn't want to drag luggage along to our conference. They were all polite, cheerful and helpful. And Michael at the front desk even mailed some papers back to me that I stupidly left on his desk while we were picking up our checked bags.

The police were on their way to Dowaya village, outside Numan (district), with the intention of disarming Fulani herders, who reports said were carrying arms.\n\u201cNo arrests had been made in connection with the ambush,\u201d Othman Abubakar, the Police Public Relations Officer, had said.\nAdesanya noted that the deployment of the aircraft was \u201ca continuous exercise.\u201d\nThe NAF spokesman added, \u201cWe launched an attack both with our Alpha jet and the EC 135 helicopter. We were able to keep touch with the activities in the area. The deployment is a continuous exercise.\n\u201cWe have an oversight function over the whole area to provide security. Before now, we had actually been doing constant air surveillance.\n\u201cOur intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platforms reported the bombing of villages and the rest. The two helicopters are both involved.\u201d\nWhen asked if the air force could not mistakenly bomb fleeing villagers, the NAF spokesman said, \u201cThe air force exists to protect Nigerians, not to fight fellow Nigerians.

Taumarunui was the hottest place yesterday with a maximum temperature of 31.6\u00b0C. Overnight stayed warm too with minimum temperatures remaining firmly in the teens for many. \nAlthough Milford Sound received 56mm of rain on Tuesday it really was the exception to the rule with the majority of New Zealand remaining rain-free. \nThough the high pressure slowly moves east in the days to come it will not bring a break in the hot, dry conditions for many. \n\u201cA front is expected to move onto the South Island on Friday, breaking the dry streak along the west.\u201d said MetService meteorologist Gerrit Keyser. \u201cRain will fall almost exclusively over the west coast of the South Island, with the east coast only forecast a few spits.\u201d \nThough a southwest wind change on Sunday eventually lowers maximum temperatures below 20\u00b0C in the south and west of the South Island, the rest of the country remains warm during the weekend, especially for eastern regions. Northwesterly winds ahead of the front are expected to increase temperatures over Christchurch on Friday which is forecast to reach 33\u00b0C (still a way off breaking the December record of 36\u00b0C). Over the North Island, it will remain warm and muggy over the next three days. \nOfficial Severe Weather Watches and Warnings are reviewed and re-issued by MetService at least every twelve hours, and more often if necessary.

The situation is set to get worse in 2018, with 624,000 Rohingya people forced to flee their homes in Myanmar, over half of which are women and girls. Girls trapped in emergency settings are often out of school and at risk of being married as children and/or sexually exploited if left without the right support. \nThese numbers have been released to raise awareness of ActionAid\u2019s Christmas appeal, No Girl Afraid, which calls on the public to help protect girls who have been torn away from their homes due to conflicts in their countries. In Gaza, where three wars have been fought since 2008, ActionAid runs a child sponsorship programme to support girls who have grown up in conflict. The charity supports girls to secure an education and provides safe spaces so they are able to channel their stress, distress and trauma and have the chance for a brighter future. \nChief Executive, ActionAid UK Girish Menon said: \u201cIt is shocking to hear that as we look to bring in a new year with hope, millions of girls will be facing 2018 away from their home, and could be separated from loved ones due to the growing number of conflicts and emergencies around the world. \nThe trauma and hardship these girls have had to suffer is an unbearable and devastating thought, and no girl should be afraid or denied the right to a decent childhood. Help ActionAid protect some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable girls this Christmas, and give them a chance for security, to learn and dream of a future they deserve.\u201d \nAs part of the appeal, children\u2019s   story based on the experiences of girls ActionAid   difference. A Story of Hope has also been turned into a short film released today, narrated by Motherland, and Bafta award winning actor Anna Maxwell-Martin \u2014and illustrated by Hannah Asen. \nMotherland actor, Anna Maxwell Martin said: \u2018Everyday it seems that we hear the stories of mre,   whom are girls, that suddenly have everything snatched away and left at risk of the even darker sides that wars can bring. No girl, or child no matter where they\u2019re born should not have the chance to be safe and fulfil their potential. \nI wanted   girl is one that should be told. I hope that it inspires people to listen, and in the spirt of giving help one child this Christmas with ActionAid.\u201d \nVideo for embedding: actionaid.org.uk/story-of-hope \nTo find out more about the No Girl Afraid campaign please visit: www.actionaid.org.uk \nFor stories and photos from Gaza, and more information please contact Charlotte Clarke on 020(3) 122 0503 or charlotte.clarke@actionaid.org and/or Melanie Stern Melanie.Stern@actionaid.org \nNotes to editors: \nStatistics in the press release were calculated using UNHCR \u2019s population statistics for 2016.

All you need to know about Rosyth-built HMS Queen Elizabeth \nIt was assembled at Rosyth, with sections of it also built at Govan and Scotstoun shipyards. \nNow the HMS Queen Elizabeth - Britain's largest and most powerful warship ever built, which had a total of 10,000 people working on its construction - will be officially commissioned into the Royal Navy today. \nSo why the fuss? Here's all you need to know about the Navy's new flagship . Royal Institute of British Architects adds to Government's Brexit woes \nYesterday was another humiliating day for the UK Government on Brexit. \nThe revelations started with more fallout over the Irish border. \nThen it was compounded by David Davis's astonishing announcement to MPs that there had been \"no systematic impact assessment I'm aware of\" carried out on Brexit. \nIf he's looking for an impact assessment on what a hard Brexit would mean for the UK's architecture sector, then he need look no further than research revealed by the Royal Institute of British Architects. \nNeedless to say it does not look rosy, or signalling, as Boris Johnson claimed, that \"outside the job-destroying coils of EU bureaucracy we can survive and thrive as never before. \nRather it might be devastating . Employers admit reluctance to hire women who may have children \nIt seems discrimination is far from a thing in the past in the workplace, according to a survey by the Young Women's Trust. \nThe research found one in seven employers admitted they were reluctant to hire women who may have children. \nAnd one in four organisations considered whether a woman was pregnant or had young children during decisions about career progression or promotion. \nAs the trust points out, that is illegal . The Apprentice is down to the last five \nIt was double trouble on The Apprentice last night as Lord Sugar relieved two more hopefuls of their duties. \nIt means the show that puts the k into entrepreneurship is down to its last five candidates. \nSo we sadly (if you love car crash telly) say goodbye to the glorious tasks for another year. \nSo who were the unlucky duo cast aside in a double firing?
