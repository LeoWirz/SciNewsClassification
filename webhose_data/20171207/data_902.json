La UGT de Catalu\u00f1a no quiere llevar un conflicto pol\u00edtico al \u00e1mbito de la empresa, pero respetar\u00e1 cualquier decisi\u00f3n de com\u00fan acuerdo que sus miembros puedan decidir con relaci\u00f3n a adherirse a cualquier forma de protesta\", se\u00f1ala en un comunicado. \nLas dos centrales sindicales han dado apoyo adem\u00e1s a la manifestaci\u00f3n del pr\u00f3ximo s\u00e1bado convocada por \u00d2mnium Cultural y ANC, conjuntamente con la Taula per la Democr\u00e0cia, en Barcelona, y convocan concentraciones a las 12 horas ante las sedes de ambos sindicatos o ante los ayuntamientos los d\u00edas 15, 22 y 29 de noviembre. \nLos dos sindicatos mayoritarios reclaman con estas iniciativas la libertad de los dos activistas de \u00d2minum Cultural y la ANC y los ex consellers encarcelados, as\u00ed como la retirada de la aplicaci\u00f3n del art\u00edculo 155 de la Constituci\u00f3n. \nEn un comunicado conjunto, CCOO y UGT de Catalu\u00f1a piden tambi\u00e9n a sus afiliaciones que participen en debates en sus \u00e1mbitos de organizaci\u00f3n y que \"tomen personalmente las decisiones pol\u00edticas que crean convenientes\", tras recordar que las dos organizaciones son \"espacios plurales pol\u00edticamente e independientes de cualquier fuerza pol\u00edtica\".

\nEl expresidente de la Generalitat Carles Puigdemont ha asegurado que est \"preparado\" para ser extraditado a Espa\u00f1a por la justicia belga y, aunque espera que esto no suceda, es consciente de que tanto \u00e9l como los cuatro consellers huidos a B\u00e9lgica pueden \"acabar en prisiones espa\u00f1olas\". \nEn una entrevista concedida a Catalunya Radio en B\u00e9lgica, Puigdemont ha indicado que los exmiembros del Govern que se encuentran en ese pa\u00eds \"en ning\u00fan momento hemos eludido ninguna responsabilidad\" y ha resaltado que se presentaron \"voluntariamente ante la justicia belga\" tras la euroorden de detenci\u00f3n dictada por la Audiencia Nacional. \nSeg\u00fan Puigdemont, su exilio en B\u00e9lgica responde a una estrategia de \"internacionalizar al m\u00e1ximo lo que esta pasando\" en Catalu\u00f1a, de una causa que a su juicio es \"de derechos humanos y de democracia\" y que \"abre unos focos que ayudan a los compa\u00f1eros encarcelados en Espa\u00f1a\". \n\"Se trata de poder administrar de la mejor manera posible la defensa de nuestros derechos, no de los individuales, sino del Govern de Catalu\u00f1a\", ha considerado Puigdemont, que entiende que \"si disponemos de unos d\u00edas o unas semanas para poder hacer lo que estamos haciendo, lo debemos aprovechar\". \n\"Todo esto acabar\u00e1 en los tribunales internacionales, acudiremos a ellos, llegaremos hasta el final y el estado espa\u00f1ol pasar\u00e1 verg\u00fcenza\", ha augurado Carles Puigdemont, quien ha resaltado que para ello \"hemos venido al coraz\u00f3n de Europa, nos hemos dirigido al mundo, y el mundo escucha\". \nHa subrayado que en la rueda de prensa que dio en Bruselas \"hubo un despliegue de medios internacionales colosal\" que informaron \"al planeta entero\" de la situaci\u00f3n en Catalu\u00f1a, lo que contrast\u00f3 con \"la total indiferencia en la sede de las instituciones europeas\", que ve \"desconectada de lo que le interesa a la gente\". \nEn este sentido, ha considerado \"una verdadera anomal\u00eda democr\u00e1tica que haya presos pol\u00edticos en Europa\", y ha insistido en que la causa contra \u00e9l y los exconsellers es \"una causa de derechos humanos, de democracia\" pues \"se est\u00e1n violando los derechos humanos de los compa\u00f1eros encarcelados\" y \"somos v\u00edctimas de una persecuci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica\". \nHa criticado la \"indolencia de Europa ante esta persecuci\u00f3n indecente\" y ha pedido a la UE que \"tenga la decencia de preguntarle al Estado espa\u00f1ol si respetar\u00e1 el resultado de las urnas el 21-D\" y si los partidos que ganen \"tendr\u00e1n derecho a aplicar su programa electoral\". \nPor su parte, el exconseller de Sanidad Toni Comin ha explicado que, a la hora de afrontar su situaci\u00f3n judicial, entre los miembros del Govern \"hab\u00eda un pacto de que todo el mundo deb\u00eda poder decidir valorando el componente pol\u00edtico y el personal\" aunque \"todas las opciones eran arriesgadas\". \n\"Todos valoramos los riesgos en funci\u00f3n de sus circunstancias, todo el mundo pudo tomar la decisi\u00f3n que quiso y el resultado ha sido el que ha sido\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "spanish", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled":

to solve the shortage of drugs during the Question and Answer session in Parliament.

Ze kozen voor uitkomstkasten waarin de kuikens direct over voer, water en licht beschikken. \u201eBij kuikens, die direct na uitkomst de beschikking over voer, water en licht, komt de darmflora eerder op gang waardoor hun immuunsysteem beter ontwikkelt en ze meer groeipotentie hebben\u201d, zegt Klaas Knol. Hans Groot Koerkamp (links) en Klaas Knol openden donderdag 2 november hun nieuwe vleeskuikenbroederij in het Duitse Nordhorn. De broederij van Knol en Groot Koerkamp \u2013 die Optibrut heet \u2013 heeft een capaciteit van 850.000 vleeskuikens per week. Maar kan worden opgeschaald naar 1,6 miljoen kuikens per week. \u201eIn eerste instantie zetten we een paar miljoen eendagskuikens af iedere acht weken. We willen eerst alle kinderziektes eruit hebben en langzaam groeien\u201d, zegt Knol. Groot Koerkamp en Knol werken allebei al jarenlang in de pluimveehouderij. Knol werkte 25 jaar voorlichter. Hij startte in 2004 zijn eigen vleeskuikenbedrijf en nam in 2013 zijn vleeskuikenbedrijf Optimum Vita in gebruik waar hij kuikens in de stal uit laat komen. Daarnaast is hij eigenaar van twee Duitse vermeerderingsbedrijven, elk met 40.000 vleeskuikenouderdieren. Groot Koerkamp is mede-eigenaar van Agromix Broederij en Opfokintegratie, dierenartspraktijk Pluimvee Praktijk Lunteren en Pluriton Layers dat broedeieren en legeendagskuikens exporteert. Knol gaat de planning en verkoop doen. Hij gaat de eendagskuikens aan vleeskuikenhouders verkopen voor Optibrut. Groot Koerkamp houdt zich bezig met de financi\u00eble en administratieve zaken. Groot Koerkamp en Knol openden de broederij zelf en lieten gele ballonnen de lucht invliegen. Knol en Groot Koerkamp kozen voor uitkomstkasten van Hatchtech waarin de kuikens direct na uitkomst de beschikking hebben over voer, drinkwater en licht. \u201eBij kuikens, die direct na uitkomst de beschikking over voer, water en licht, komt de darmflora eerder op gang waardoor hun immuunsysteem beter ontwikkelt en ze meer groeipotentie hebben\u201d, zegt Klaas Knol. Op zijn vleeskuikenbedrijf in Emlichheim laat hij kuikens in de stal uitkomen. \u201eIk heb hier sinds de start in 2013 ruim 10 miljoen vleeskuikens afgeleverd maar nog nooit antibiotica ingezet\u201d, beweert Knol. Daarom kozen Knol en Groot Koerkamp voor uitkomstkasten waarin de kuikens direct na uitkomst de beschikking hebben over voer, drinkwater en licht. De kuikens krijgen in de uitkomstbakken aan twee kanten voer en aan \u00e9\u00e9n kant drinkwater. In deze zogeheten Hatchcare uitkomstbakken kunnen de kuikens naar vleeskuikenhouders worden gebracht. De kuikens kunnen ook in blauwe bakken naar vleeskuikenhouders worden gebracht. In de witte Hatchcare bakken passen circa 90 kuikens, in de blauwe ook circa 90. De blauwe bakken zijn handiger met lossen van de kuikens. Knol en Groot Koerkamp kozen voor een schouwmachine van Innovatec. Na 18 dagen worden de broedeieren geschouwd en in de uitkomstbakken gedaan. Optibrut gaat werken met blauwe broedlades. \u201eWe vinden hygi\u00ebne uiterst belangrijk. Onze blauwe broedlades zijn goed te onderscheiden van de veel gebruikte zwarte. Onze broedlades komen alleen op onze vermeerderingsbedrijven en op onze broederij. Nergens anders\u201d, stelt Knol. Vroeger kreeg hij wel eens twee verschillende soorten broedlades op zijn bedrijf waarop nog vuil zat. Daardoor kan er een kruisbesmetting ontstaan. \u201eWe voeren alleen eieren aan van grote vermeerderingsbedrijven van minimaal 20.000 vleeskuikenouderdieren, die volgens ons protocol werken. Wij bepalen welke entingen de dieren krijgen en werken met een standaard entschema. Zo worden onze vleeskuikenouderdieren standaard ge\u00ebnt tegen MS en Gumboro\u201d, zegt Knol. Op die manier willen ze een constante goede kwaliteit waarborgen. Momenteel ontvangt Optibrut broedeieren van drie vermeerderingsbedrijven van ieder 40.000 vleeskuikenouderdieren. Twee daarvan zijn in eigendom van Knol. De broedlades worden na het schouwen automatisch gewassen. In de broederij is zoveel mogelijk geautomatiseerd. Knol en Groot Koerkamp werken straks met een team van 15 medewerkers. Broedmeester Jan Weinhold is afkomstig van een collega broederij. De medewerkers van Knol zouden de kuikens in de broederij ook kunnen sexen. Er is ruimte voor acht personen, die met zijn achten 25.000 kuikens per uur kunnen sexen. De kuikenkisten worden automatisch naar de karren getransporteerd. De complete broederij is voorzien van een sprinklerinstallatie. \u201eDat was verplicht. Anders kregen we geen vergunning\u201d, vertelt Groot Koerkamp. De kranen werken met sensoren omdat dit hygi\u00ebnischer is. Ook alle verlichting werkt via sensoren. \u201eDat is hygi\u00ebnischer. Ook blijven lampen op die manier niet onnodig branden\", zegt Groot Koerkamp. Op de zolder van de broederij bevindt zich veel apparatuur om het klimaat in de voorbroedmachines en uitkomstkasten te sturen. Via warmte uit deze buizen wordt de broederij verwarmd. Knol en Groot Koerkamp willen transparant zijn. \u201eNu is iedereen welkom op de open dag. Straks kunnen bezoekers door de gang lopen en de broederij bekijken\u201d, zegt Groot Koerkamp. \u201eBezoekers laten douchen en meenemen in de broederij doen we dan niet meer.\u201d Een overzichtsfoto van de nieuwe broederij. In de voersilo\u2019s zit het voer voor de kuikens. Knol en Groot Koerkamp \u2013 die beiden bij Agrifirm werkten \u2013 ontwikkelden zelf een samenstelling. Maandag 6 november is de broederij in gebruik genomen. \u201eWe hebben de eerste testen al gedaan\u201d, zegt Groot Koerkamp. \u201eWe willen langzaam groeien. Door betere kwaliteit eendagskuikens te leveren willen we ons onderscheiden\u201d, vult Knol aan. \u201eOnze kuikens zijn 2,5 cent duurder dan gemiddeld. Door betere technische resultaten moet een vleeskuikenhouder deze meerprijs terug kunnen verdienen\u201d, stelt Knol.

The stall owner was trying to cheat her.\n\"Ha'penny for two, miss,\" the stall owner, a stooped man with a fat red nose and strands of greasy hair under a cap, said. \"Best to be had.\"\nHe was goading her to take two shriveled specimens. When she pointed to the firm, ripe fruit near the man's hand, he shook his head. \"Penny apiece for those, love.\"\nI'd just seen him sell two fine peaches to a housewife for half that price, but he probably thought he could fleece a foreigner, especially an inexperienced girl.\nI turned to the peachseller's stall, walking stick in hand. A lady in distress, even over peaches, spoke to my knight-errant instincts.\n\"Prices have changed, have they?\" I asked the peach seller.\nHe shot me an irritated look. \"They do, Cap'n.\"\n\"In a quarter of an hour?\" I leaned to him. \"Sell her the same as you sold the others.\"\nThe peach seller glowered at me, a glint in his eye, but he backed down. I had the reputation for a foul temper, although I believe my acquaintanceship with magistrates and Bow Street Runners decided the matter.\nHe handed the good peaches to the girl. \"Ha'penny,\" he muttered. To me, he said, \"I know why your nose is so long, Cap'n. You use it to poke into business 'tisn't yours.\"\n\"True.\" I touched the offending appendage. \"Several men have broken it for me.\"\n\"Shouldn't wonder.\" He took the girl's coin then, with another bellicose look at me, turned to his next customer. \"Two for ha'penny.\"\nThe girl placed the peaches in the basket on her arm and glanced at me shyly. \"I thank you, sir.\"\nI had not seen the young woman in Covent Garden before. Her dress was well made, high-waisted and plain-skirted, the gown of a young, gently born miss. She seemed more suited to strolling formal gardens with smitten young men than roaming Covent Garden shopping for peaches.\nThough she spoke English well, her voice held definite French overtones. Perhaps she was an Englishman's paramour, brought home with him from Paris. Or the daughter of emigres who had fled France long ago and elected to stay in England, even after Louis Bourbon had been restored to his throne.\nWhoever she was, she smiled at me, grateful for rescue. Her expression was guileless--too innocent to be a man's paramour, I decided. She possessed an unworldly air that spoke of a simple life. She must be a dutiful daughter, gathering breakfast for her mother or father.\nI tipped my hat to her. \"Captain Gabriel Lacey, at your service. May I escort you somewhere?\"\nHer smile was crooked, and her brown eyes sparkled with good humor. \"My father and mother are staying near, sir. I wanted peaches this morning, and so ventured to find them.\"\nThat they'd let her come out alone to the markets in Covent Garden did not speak well for them. But perhaps they were provincial people, used to places where everyone knew everyone, where no one would dream of harming the daughters of respectable gentlefolk.\nThe girl stirred a protective instinct in me. I held out my arm. \"Which house? I will walk you there.\"\nShe blushed and shook her head. \"You are kind, sir, but I must not trouble you.\"\nShe thought me forward. At least she was that wise, but anyone in the market could have told her she had nothing to fear from me.\n\"You can introduce me to your mama and papa,\" I began, but a shrill voice cut across the market, a startled cry in French.\nMy young lady turned, and her smile broadened into one of relief. \"That is my mama now, sir. I thank you again for your kind assistance.\"\nI barely heard her. Hurrying toward me, through the milling housewives and maids, footmen, carters, and cook's assistants making their morning rounds, came a ghost from my past.\nThe last time I'd seen her, she'd been thin and frail, a golden-and-white girl looking at me with timid eyes, her dainty mouth shifting between smiles and puckered worry. Her face was still pale and flowerlike, though lines now feathered about her eyes and mouth, and her skin had coarsened a bit. The curls that wreathed her forehead, under her bonnet's brim, were still golden, perhaps a little darker than they'd been fifteen years ago. Time had thickened her figure, but she retained an air of graceful helplessness, one that urged a gentleman to rush to her side and demand to know how he could assist her.\nThat air had ensnared me as a young man. I had proposed to her within a week of meeting her.\nThe woman stopped a few feet behind the girl, her lips parting in shock. Though I must have changed a great deal from the unruly and impetuous young man I'd been, she knew me, and I knew her.\nHer name was Carlotta Lacey, and she was my wife.\nCarlotta's eyes were blue. When I'd proposed in a country meadow near Cambridge, those eyes had glowed with excitement and delight. She'd let me kiss her, and then, full of confidence in our future, we'd consummated our betrothal there on the somewhat damp ground. I remembered the sweet scent of crushed grass, the tiny star flowers that tickled my nose, the warm taste of her skin.\nWhether she remembered any of it as we stood closer than we'd stood to each other in fifteen years, I could not tell. I only knew that she looked at me with unblinking eyes, and that she'd deserted me for a French officer a decade and a half ago.\nCarlotta recovered first. She closed gloved fingers around the girl's basket, and said in French, \"Come away, Gabriella.\"\nThe word struck me like a boulder thrown with great force. My gaze shot to the girl, the breath leaving my body.\nThe young woman looked back at me, her brown eyes innocent and uncomprehending, and the same shade as my own.\nGabriella Lacey. My daughter.\n\"No.\" The word burst from my tight throat. I stepped around of Carlotta, blocking her way.\nGabriella looked startled. Carlotta moved her grip to the girl's arm. \"Later,\" she said to me. \"Not now. We will come to it later.\"\nShe had not changed in one respect. Anything Carlotta could avoid facing, she would shove away from her with force.\nI had recovered from the grief of her leaving me. I had lived through the anger and loneliness and resignation. I could forgive Carlotta for deserting me, because I had made her miserable. But I had never forgiven her, nor would I ever forgive her, for taking away my daughter. I had not seen Gabriella since she was two years old.\nI said, \"By the laws of England, she belongs to me.\"\nMothers had no legal guardianship over their children unless they were granted it, which I had not done. Carlotta taking Gabriella away had been a crime in truth.\nThe worry in Carlotta's eyes told me she knew very well what she had done, and what I could do to retaliate. She looked at me pleadingly. \"We must speak of it later. Not here. Not now.\"\n\"Maman, what is the matter?\" Gabriella asked in French. \"What is happening?\"\nCarlotta arranged her face in soothing lines. \"Nothing, my dear,\" she answered, her tone too bright. \"We will go home.\"\nI pressed my walking stick against the side of Carlotta's skirt. She could not rush away, her favorite method of solving problems, without pushing past me and making a scene. Gabriella peered at me anxiously. She no doubt thought me a madman, accosting her mother for whatever diabolical reason was in my crazed mind.\nI realized then that when I had said to her, Captain Gabriel Lacey, at your service, Gabriella had given no beat of recognition. She had no idea who I was.\n\"You did not tell her,\" I said to Carlotta.\n\"Not now,\" Carlotta repeated. \"Please, Gabriel, let us speak of this later. For heaven's sake.\"\nThe haze cleared from my mind, and I realized that the denizens of Covent Garden teemed about us, watching with interest. Gabriella looked as though she would shout for help at any moment. The peach seller and the ale seller next to him observed us with blatant curiosity, Londoners always keen for an impromptu drama. A large black carriage with fine gray horses shouldered its way through the crowd, people brushing us as they flowed away from it.\nI moved my walking stick. I could not very well seize my daughter and drag her away with me, much as I wanted to. We could not split her in two, Solomon-like, in the middle of Covent Garden.\n\"Where do you stay?\" I asked.\n\"King Street,\" Carlotta answered. \"I promise you, we will speak of it. We will settle it.\"\n\"We shall indeed. I will send a man round to fetch you.\"\nCarlotta shook her head. \"No, there will be an appointment. He will see to it.\"\n\"Who will?\"\nCarlotta grasped Gabriella's arm again. \"Come,\" she said to her. \"Your father is waiting.\"\nThat statement startled me a moment before I realized that Carlotta must mean the Frenchman she'd eloped with. The officer who'd thought nothing of living with another man's wife for fifteen years.\nGabriella, with one last bewildered glance at me, let her mother lead her away. Carlotta hurried with her to the north and west side of Covent Garden and out to King Street, and the crowd swallowed them.\nI stood in a daze, watching until I could no longer see the two women, the younger one a little taller than the older, walking close, their heads together.\nThe black carriage still making its way through the market halted nearly on top of me. A woman flung open the window and leaned out, her fashionable hat tilted back to reveal a quantity of golden curls and a childlike, pointed face.\n\"Devil take it, Lacey,\" Marianne Simmons cried. \"Have your brains addled?\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Two\n\nThe carriage belonged to Lucius Grenville. Those were his perfectly matched grays pulling it, his liveried coachman on the roof, his family crest on the door, and his footman on the back. The footman, who had been helping me into and out of Grenville's carriage for the last year, gave me a grin of greeting.\n\"I was on my way to see you, Lacey,\" Marianne called down. \"I didn't realize that was you until we'd near run you down.\"\nThe footman on back leapt to the ground, fanned away the beggars who gathered around the conveyance like moths round a lantern, and opened the door for me.\nI obeyed Marianne for two reasons. First, I was dazed by the encounter with Carlotta, and the real world seemed a bit distant and hazy. Easier to obey orders than argue. Second, I knew that Marianne would not come all this way in a carriage if she did not need to speak to me on some matter of importance. She rarely made any effort without hope of reward.\nThe footman assisted me into the coach, careful of my bad left knee, and I settled myself facing Marianne. He shut the door, and the carriage jerked forward to continue through the crowd of Covent Garden to nearby Russel Street. I lived in Grimpen Lane, a tiny cul-de-sac that opened off Russel Street, nestled between the buildings of Covent Garden and the houses of Bow Street.\n\"You are white as plain paper, Lacey,\" Marianne said. \"What is the matter with you?\"\nWhen I sat, unable to speak as we creaked our very slow way through Covent Garden, she persisted. \"Who were those women you were speaking to? Were they blackmailing you?\"\nThe odd question pulled me out of my haze. \"Blackmail? What put that idea in your head?\"\n\"Because it is the sort of thing respectable-looking women turn their hands to. I knew a seamstress that you never would believe was anything but well-spoken and kind, until she demanded payment to keep quiet about one's peccadilloes. I know you. You poke your nose into so many things that I'm certain someone like Mr. Denis would be delighted to find out something about you.\"\n\"You have an interesting imagination, Marianne.\"\n\"Well, something they said overset you. Are you going to tell me what is the matter? Something clearly is.\"\nI wondered why she wanted to pry. Had I had more of my wits about me, I would have put her off. As it was, with my mouth dry and my head pounding, I found myself letting out the truth.\n\"They are my wife and daughter.\"\nMarianne's mouth became a pink O, and she blinked at me. \"Good Lord, Lacey, are you telling me that you are married?\"\n\"I was. I am. I have not seen my wife--or daughter--for fifteen years. Gabriella was two when my wife took her away.\"\n\"Good Lord,\" Marianne repeated. She stared at me some more, reassessing all she knew about Gabriel Lacey. \"No wonder you look pole-axed. Let's have some brandy. Grenville's best.\" She opened a pocket beside the seat and drew out a box I recognized. Grenville's servants always stocked this carriage with the best drink and crystal glasses in case their master grew thirsty traveling the streets of London.\nMarianne lifted the bottle from the box just as the carriage stopped, reaching our destination. The coach was too big to fit into Grimpen Lane, so we descended in Russel Street, the efficient footman opening the door for us. Marianne shoved the brandy at me and snatched two glasses. \"Come along. We'll drink it in your rooms.\"\nThe house that held my flat was narrow and tall. The ground floor was devoted to a bake shop, where my landlady, Mrs. Beltan, sold bread and seed cakes to passersby. She did well out of the shop and rented the rooms in the two floors above it. The first floor held my rooms, reached by a dim staircase from a door to the street.\nThe house had been grand in the time of Charles II, but its elegance had long since faded. My two rooms, bedchamber and sitting room, had once been a bedchamber and grand salon. Now they housed my eclectic mix of furniture--chest-on-frame and huge tester bed from the era in which the house had been built, a writing table and chair from the middle of the last century, a wing chair from 1780, and a low bookcase, carved and gilded in the Egyptian style, a gift from Grenville, which had been made in the last year.\nThe rooms above mine, identical but with lower ceilings, once had been rented by Marianne, before Grenville had taken her away to live in luxury. In the attics above those, my valet-in-training, Bartholomew, kept himself as comfortably as possible.\nSince March, when I'd returned from a brief stay in Berkshire, two different lodgers had taken the rooms above mine, but neither had stayed more than a month. The rooms were currently empty. I'd pondered taking both floors for myself, so that I'd have an extra room and so Bartholomew would not have to sleep in the chilly attics, but Mrs. Beltan and I had not come to an agreement. She was a kindhearted lady but steely hard about money.\nBartholomew was not in evidence when we arrived upstairs. Marianne plopped herself on the wing chair and held out her glass. I filled it with brandy, then I drew up the straight chair from the writing table for myself.\n\"You knocked me over with a feather, you know,\" Marianne said. \"A wife? You?\"\n\"Few people know.\" I drank a swallow of brandy, absently noting its rich texture, in too much shock to appreciate it.\n\"Does he?\"\n\"Grenville?\" I wondered how long it would be before Marianne could bring herself to say Grenville's name in conversation. \"Yes. And the Brandons know. Colonel Brandon was the one who helped me procure a special license so I could marry Carlotta without having the banns read.\"\n\"Thought someone would object, did you?\" Marianne asked.\n\"Plenty of people should have. My father. Hers. Her entire family, in fact. Carlotta was quite ready to board the ship that took us away from England.\" I rolled the goblet in my hands. \"In those days, we thought our lives would be fine if we could only get away from England. Things turned out much differently, to say the least.\"\n\"No one's life becomes what they think it will, Lacey. Not even his.\" She cocked her head. \"What about her ladyship?\"\nShe meant Lady Breckenridge, an aristocratic lady of rather blunt opinions, with whom I had formed an affection. More than an affection.\nAfter the murder in Berkeley Square in April, I'd gone to Lady Breckenridge, told her the truth about my marriage, and revealed that I wanted to court her. Lady Breckenridge, the least shockable lady of my acquaintance, including even Marianne, had taken the news of my estranged wife stoically. I'd confessed everything, and incredibly, Lady Breckenridge had understood. Having gone through a miserable marriage herself, she perhaps had some sympathy for me.\nAfter my declaration, I had taken her hand and led her into her bedchamber. We'd spent the rest of the afternoon learning each other's bodies in her bed and letting the warmth between us grow.\nI'd not had opportunity to see much of her since, her life during the height of the Season being a whirlwind of social gatherings and obligations. Even so, gossip coupled our names, somewhat disapprovingly. Lady Breckenridge, daughter of an earl and widow of a viscount, was worlds above a half-pay captain, son of an untitled nobody, albeit my father had been a landed gentleman of Norfolk.\n\"This is awkward for you,\" Marianne said.\nThe plain statement from anyone but Marianne might imply glee at my plight. From Marianne, it meant compassion.\n\"Divorce is a difficult thing,\" I said. \"I've looked into the matter in some detail. To divorce Carlotta, I must accuse her of adultery and drag her through several courts, then ask for a private Act of Parliament to dissolve the marriage. A long, expensive, embarrassing process.\"\n\"Has she committed adultery?\"\n\"Oh, yes. She left me in France and has lived there ever since with the French officer who stole her away. They dwell idyllically near Lyon, and she's borne him several children.\"\n\"There you are, then, rush her to trial. I imagine he would help you with the expense. He does so like to arrange people's lives for them.\"\nI remembered something Carlotta had said when I'd stood there staring at her: He would make the appointment. Who? Grenville? Her French officer? James Denis, who'd discovered her whereabouts in the first place?\n\"Grenville would likely assist with the cost if asked,\" I conceded. \"But Mrs. Lacey was never a strong woman. Making her face hostile juries who will condemn her as an adulteress might break her. I no longer love her, but I cannot wish such an ordeal on her.\"\n\"You are far too kindhearted, Lacey.\"\n\"Not really. There is my daughter to consider. Though I will fight to get her back, a divorce would hurt Gabriella as well. Any taint on her family will be a taint on her.\" I paused. \"She does not know that I am her father.\"\nMarianne's eyes widened. \"Your wife never told her?\"\n\"It would appear not.\"\nMarianne gave me a look of deep sympathy. \"How awful. Are you going to tell her?\"\nI took a long drink of brandy. \"Yes, but not yet.\" I traced the facets of Grenville's heavy crystal goblet. \"My life, as usual, is a tangle.\"\n\"As is mine.\"\nI looked up, remembering that she had not sought me out to discuss my troubles. \"You wanted to speak to me about something? Grenville, I assume. I thought he had loosened the leash a bit.\"\nMarianne poured herself another helping of brandy. \"I want to go to Berkshire.\"\n\"Ah.\" I had discovered, earlier this spring, that Marianne Simmons had a son, a halfwit boy she'd borne years ago and kept in a cottage in the Berkshire countryside. A kindly woman looked after both cottage and son, and Marianne traveled to see them when she could. She'd spent almost everything she'd earned as an actress plus any money or trinkets she could coerce gentlemen into giving her on the keeping of the boy, David.\nWhen Grenville had first met Marianne, he'd handed her twenty guineas. She'd promptly and secretly sent the money to Berkshire, and Grenville had gone slightly mad trying to decide what had happened to his gift.\nI had learned Marianne's secret by chance when I'd stayed in Berkshire at the Sudbury School in March. She'd made me swear to tell no one, especially not Grenville. I had no desire to interfere between Grenville and Marianne, and so kept my silence.\n\"You have not spoken to him of David, yet,\" I said.\n\"No, and you know why. As I've just declared, he enjoys arranging people's lives for them. He would try to take David away from the home he's always known to lock him away somewhere, however plush, and hire hordes of people to look after him. David would be frightened. I cannot let that happen.\"\nShe spoke determinedly, but her eyes held worry.\nI could not reassure her that Grenville would do no such thing, because though I'd known him a few years now, I could not predict the things that Grenville might do. Lucius Grenville was one of the wealthiest and popular men in England. He was intelligent, generous, gossipy, curious, friendly, and frank--although he could turn his cool, sardonic man-about-town personality on those of whom he disapproved and destroy them socially with one quirk of his eyebrow. Gentlemen in clubs all over London feared the cold scrutiny of his black eyes, trembled when he raised a quizzing glass, and went pale when he dismissed them in his chill voice.\nIt was telling that the two people he claimed to like best, myself and Marianne, were the two people who did not stand in awe of his power. Both of us, coming from very different walks of life, had seen too much and experienced too much to fear Grenville's scorn. He found us baffling, and therefore, fascinating.\nBut that assessment was unjust. Grenville did have a generous heart and truly wished to help, although he could be heavy-handed about it. He did not know how not to be.\n\"You need to tell him,\" I said gently. \"Give him a chance.\"\n\"I came to ask you to tell him, while I am away in Berkshire. And then send me word whether to bother to come home or not.\"\n\"It is no business of mine,\" I said quickly. Ever since Grenville had taken Marianne to live with him, I had strived to stay out of their lives, but in vain. Both of them liked to confide their frustrations about the other to me--at length.\n\"I have considered this well, you know,\" Marianne said. \"If I tell him before I go, he will try to prevent me. If I am in Berkshire when he finds out, and he reacts as I predict, I can simply stay there with David. I do not want his disapprobation to keep me from my son. I have saved enough of the money he's given me, plus the bits of jewelry he's given me, to live on for a good while. Unless he sets the magistrates on me . . . Although I do not think he would. Too embarrassing for him.\"\nWhile I agreed with her assessment of Grenville's character, I could not let her simply run off and try to live on Grenville's gifts. \"Tell him, for God's sake. I can be present when you do, and do my best to stop him disrupting David's life.\"\nShe looked stubborn. \"You have just told me that you were prevented seeing your daughter for fifteen years. I thought you would have more sympathy.\"\n\"Sympathy, yes. But I am not your conspirator against Grenville. You are fond of Grenville; I know you are. Can you not show him that?\"\n\"Heavens, Lacey, I know better than to let on to a gentleman that I like him. They take advantage, you know.\"\nI rose to my feet. \"Your ideas on how ladies and gentlemen behave to one another are your own. I cannot agree with them, but I know I cannot change your mind. You may finish the brandy if you like. I must go to Bow Street.\"\n\"Consulting with the magistrates again, are you?\" Marianne reached for the bottle.\n\"An errand.\"\nShe was too shrewd for me. \"If you hire a Runner to watch that your wife does not slip away, you will be as bad as Grenville. He threatened to do the same to me, remember?\"\nI well recalled the incident. When I had taken the post at the Sudbury School, Marianne had disappeared from Grenville's house, and he'd wanted to take England apart to find her. I had dissuaded him from this action only because I happened to know where Marianne had gone.\n\"I thought Grenville unwise, but I could not blame him. You tease him and plague him, and I am surprised he does not keep you on a tether.\"\nShe made a face at me as I prepared to leave. \"Gentlemen always stand together,\" she said. \"Especially those of your class. Rich and poor, if you went to the same school and came from the same sort of family, you band together against the downtrodden.\"\nI shot her an ironic look. \"I could never think of you as downtrodden, Marianne. You are the least downtrodden woman I know.\"\nHer answer was to put out her tongue, then I shut the door on her as she raised her goblet again.\nI left the house and walked to Bow Street. I made this trip often, strolling out of Grimpen Lane to Russel Street and around the corner to the left to Bow Street. Today I made it under the June sun, which had at last chased away the drear of winter. I preferred warmer climes, having grown used to the stifling heat of India and the warm summers of Spain. Grenville had recently invited me to accompany him to Egypt when next he went.\nI wondered, as I perfunctorily tipped my hat to a passing housewife, whether Grenville had told Marianne he wanted to leave England for several months, and what her reaction would be when he did. He believed Marianne cared not a fig for where he went, but I knew better. I hoped they settled things between them soon, because both were driving me mad.\nI approached the Bow Street magistrate's house, a tall, narrow edifice that comprised numbers 3 and 4. The chief magistrate lived upstairs, and the unfortunates dragged in to appear before him in the large room downstairs spent the night in buildings behind the house as well as the cellar of the tavern opposite. These unfortunates consisted of pickpockets, prostitutes, the drunk and disorderly, thieves, illegal gamers, housebreakers, brawlers, and murderers. Those accused of more serious crimes, like murder or rape, generally saw the magistrate in isolation. The petty criminals tumbled together in a mass of unwashed and surprisingly good-humored humanity.\n\"Mornin,' Cap'n,\" slurred a man who was brought in for drunkenness nearly every night. He did not simply drink himself into a stupor--many a man did that and went home and slept--but Bottle Bill, as he was called, could become quite frenzied when he was drunk.\nIn the light of day, Bill was a quiet creature, ashamed of himself, smiling gently and apologizing to those he might have hurt the night before. He could not help himself, he said. If he did not have drink, he became wretchedly ill, near to death. A few glasses of gin, and he was right as rain. But then he could not stop drinking the gin, and so he went round again to losing his senses, starting fights, breaking furniture, and ending up at Bow Street.\n\"Good morning, Bill,\" I said as I stepped past him.\n\"How are you this fine day?\" Bill asked. He leaned against the wall, his red eyes screwed shut against the bright sunshine without. \"I like it a bit gloomier, meself.\"\n\"I'm well, Bill. What did you do this time?\"\n\"No idea, Cap'n. They say I broke a fellow's arm, but I don't remember. I'm not very big, am I, to be breaking another man's arm?\" He put a shaky, thin hand to his brow. \"Feel like the elephant at the 'Change is a-dancing on my head.\"\n\"You'll likely go home soon,\" I said. \"Is Pomeroy about?\"\n\"Aye, that he is. Hupstairs. With one of those Thames River blokes.\"\n\"Thank you.\" I put a shilling in his hand that was not quite outstretched and made for the stairs.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Three\n\nMr. Thompson of the Thames River Police was a lanky man whose clothes hung on his bony shoulders. He belonged to the body of patrollers who moved up and down the river, protecting the huge cargo ships at the London docks and beyond. The organization of patrollers had been formed years ago by those appalled by the number of thefts they endured while their ships moored in London. Eventually, the Thames River Police, as we now knew it, had come under the same authority as the Bow Street Runners, foot patrollers, and runners from other magistrates' houses.\nI liked Thompson, who had a sharp mind and quick intelligence. Usually, I enjoyed a chat with him, but today I wanted to talk to Pomeroy about my wife, not a conversation I wanted to share with Thompson. Therefore, I was a bit dismayed to not find Pomeroy in his room alone.\nPomeroy had known my wife and about her desertion. I wanted to ask him to find out in what house in King Street Carlotta had taken rooms and to have one of his foot patrollers watch her. I did not trust her not to run away again, taking Gabriella with her.\n\"Good morning, Captain,\" Thompson said. His countenance, as usual, was smooth and bland, but he had a definite spark in his eyes. Something had happened.\n\"Was going to come round to see you later today,\" Pomeroy said. He got up from his writing table and saluted me, just as he'd done when he'd been my sergeant in the army. Milton Pomeroy was thick-bodied, tall, and athletic, had a shock of blond hair that he kept slicked down with pomade, and blue eyes that eyes were twinkling, eager, and good-humored.\n\"Why?\" I asked. I wondered whether he already knew that Carlotta had returned to England.\n\"Crime, of course,\" Pomeroy said cheerfully. \"A missing gel, specifically.\"\n\"Oh?\" I had looked for missing girls before, because unfortunately, girls and young women disappeared in London all the time. Procuresses met country coaches and lured girls to bawdy houses where they were forced to work. Sadly, some parents sold their daughters to these same houses for needed money. Reformers strove to put an end to this trafficking, and they had some success but not enough.\n\"Yes, Captain,\" Pomeroy went on. \"No respectable man's daughter this time, just a game girl. Her young man is worried about her because she hasn't come home. Went out to Covent Garden one night, he says, then vanished.\"\n\"How long ago?\" I asked, growing curious.\n\"Week,\" Pomeroy said. \"I thought at first she'd simply found herself a softer bed and a richer man. But the young man is worried she's been hurt by one of her customers or kept with him against her will. He's been round to all the workhouses and reforming houses, and asked all her pals, but he's not found her.\"\n\"Perhaps she left London altogether,\" I said.\n\"Maybe so, maybe so. But Mr. Thompson, here, he read my report over in Wapping and came to see me. Seems he's heard of one or two game girls a'disappearing from his part of London as well.\"\nThompson broke in. \"Two girls--neither knew each other as far as I can tell. One turned up in the river. She was with child, and so she might have done away with herself. The other was from Wapping. Lived with a sailor there when he was in port. He reported her missing after he'd gone to her usual haunts and heard from her friends that she hadn't been seen. She went to Covent Garden one night, to meet a chap, he claimed, and never returned. Her friends thought that perhaps she'd taken up with this fellow and become his ladybird, but they've not heard from her or seen her, and now they're worried as well.\"\n\"None of these occurrences may mean something wrong,\" I said. On the other hand, Thompson, a careful man and not likely to chase shadows, had thought enough of it to come to Bow Street and speak to Pomeroy. \"The girls could have gone to work in bawdy houses, although if they had protectors concerned enough to report them missing, I think it unlikely they did.\" I looked at Thompson. \"What is your theory?\"\nHe shook his head. \"No theories yet, Captain. Or rather, too many. The girls might be dead, by their hand or another's, they might be held against their will, they might have found new gents to take care of them, they might have returned to their mothers or fathers, they might have reformed and joined a crusade against prostitution. They might have done any number of things.\"\nHe was right--too many possibilities as yet. I looked from Thompson to Pomeroy, both of whom watched me intently. \"What are you asking of me?\"\n\"Well,\" Pomeroy said, \"the girls I arrest and bring in here speak highly of you. Quite the gentleman, they think you. I told Thompson that if anyone could pry secrets from the game girls, it was my captain.\"\nI gave him a sardonic look. \"You are tarnishing my reputation, Sergeant.\"\nPomeroy grinned, loving to tease and pleased that he could. \"You do have a way with them, Captain.\"\nThompson looked slightly amused, betraying himself with no more than a twitch of lips. \"The magistrates are not worried about these missing women, as yet,\" he said. \"They are only street girls, after all.\"\n\"Meaning it's unlikely that a large reward will be offered for their return,\" I finished.\n\"Exactly,\" Pomeroy said. \"But if a gent like you was to take a poke around and make sure no man what should be in Bedlam has decided to start offing game girls, well then, that's a different thing.\"\nI knew how my former sergeant thought--I would investigate, and if a true crime were involved, I would report it to him so that he might find the criminal, get said criminal convicted, and reap the reward money. A gentleman did not accept a reward; this was considered beneath him, so Pomeroy's thoughts went. I'd brought him a few good convictions already, and he'd started to consider me a potential source of income.\nThompson, on the other hand, was more interested in the crime itself, though he'd not turn down any reward money that came his way. He did not often express emotion, but I had seen his passionate anger at the men of the world who perpetrated crimes against the helpless. He would worry about missing game girls where his magistrate would not. Likely he'd come here without his magistrate knowing a thing about it.\nI was at present most distracted by Carlotta's sudden return and the vision of my daughter, grown and so beautiful, but I could not turn my back on a matter that Thompson, a man I respected, believed serious.\n\"I do have a few resources,\" I said.\n\"Knew you'd understand, Captain,\" Pomeroy said. \"You have a gab with the girls and tell us what you discover, eh?\"\nThompson looked less optimistic. \"The sailor might be willing to speak to you, to tell you about his girl and her usual routine. He's leery of magistrates, though. He can meet you at a tavern, and I'm sure he'd be forthcoming to you if you purchased him some ale.\"\n\"The Rearing Pony in Maiden Lane,\" I said. \"It's a congenial house.\"\n\"Then I will send him round there tomorrow, if it is convenient.\"\nPomeroy and Thompson could tell me little more. The young man who had approached Pomeroy was called Tom Marcus and did odd deliveries in and around Covent Garden. I might be able to find him if I looked.\n\"By the bye, Captain,\" Pomeroy said when I started to take my leave. \"Why did you look me up today?\"\nI still did not want to discuss things in front of Thompson, and I'd changed my mind about asking for the exuberant Pomeroy's help. Carlotta's actions--deserting me and taking my daughter, who, by law, belonged to me--could land her in the dock to be tried for abduction and abandonment. While I respected Thompson and stood in awe of Pomeroy's ability to catch even the most slippery thief, I scarcely wanted either of these men to arrest the delicate Carlotta on a point of law. Pomeroy and Thompson had to be sticklers for the rules, while I considered this a purely private matter. I could discover Carlotta's lodgings in King Street if I looked hard enough, and I'd deal with the problem myself.\n\"Passing the time,\" I said. \"The summer days are long.\"\nThompson sent me a sharp glance, sensing my disingenuousness, but Pomeroy took my words at face value.\n\"The long days suit me after a winter's gloom, that's a fact,\" Pomeroy said. \"The robbers, they grow tired of waiting for the dark and attempt crimes in broad daylight. Makes things easier on me.\" He guffawed.\nI smiled and took my leave, but Thompson still watched me closely.\n*** *** ***\nThe mystery of my wife's presence in England was quickly solved. When I reached home, Marianne, the brandy, and Grenville's coach had gone, but I found a letter waiting for me from my uneasy ally, James Denis.\nAs you have discovered, he'd written, The woman who calls herself Colette Auberge--formerly Mrs. Lacey--has arrived in London. I will make arrangements to proceed with a divorce or annulment as you wish. I suggest a meeting in Curzon Street tomorrow at ten o'clock. My carriage will call for you. The letter was signed, simply, Denis.\nColette Auberge was the name Carlotta had taken when she'd moved to France with her French officer. James Denis had given me this information a year ago and had presented me with her exact whereabouts this spring when I'd been employed at the Sudbury School. Now it seemed, he'd taken it upon himself to bring them to London, not waiting for my instructions. I'd been making plans to approach him and ask for his help, but he'd taken the initiative, for whatever reason, in his constant game to maintain the upper hand with me.\nI crumpled the paper. \"Why does the bloody man not stay out of my life?\"\nBartholomew, entering with my freshly laundered shirts, started. \"What bloody man is that, sir?\"\nI tossed the paper in the grate, though there was no fire on this warm summer day. \"Bartholomew, you are quoting from Macbeth, did you know? King Duncan in the first scene, which is ominous. He died rather horribly soon after. I meant James Denis.\"\n\"Oh, right, sir. I brought the letter upstairs from the messenger what left it in Mrs. Beltan's shop. Bad news?\"\n\"No, more interference. Why will he not keep his fingers from my personal business?\"\n\"Well, he's helped now and again,\" Bartholomew said in a reasonable tone as he dove into my bedchamber with the shirts. \"Nabbed that Frog officer and helped get your colonel out of clink.\"\nTrue, Denis had assisted in many of the problems I'd solved in the last year or so--the murder of Josiah Horne in Hanover Square, the murder of Colonel Westin, the affair of the Glass House, the murder of one of Denis's own lackeys in Berkshire, and the mystery of Lady Clifford's missing necklace. He enjoyed helping me then reminding me that someday I'd be asked to pay him for his favors.\nDenis lived in a fine house in Curzon Street, had power and money and servants to do his bidding, and held many a lord, MP, and respectable gentleman in thrall. He owned them outright--paying their debts, gaining them seats in Parliament, or assisting them in other plays for power.\nHe did all these favors for a very high price--the gentlemen were then obligated to make things happen in Commons or the Lords or in the courts, all for the glorious cause of making James Denis more money or bringing him more power.\nHe wanted me to work for him outright. I do not know quite what he wanted me to do, but it could not, in the end, be good. Denis did not help others from kindness--he was a businessman, and he always made a profit. He was simply better at the business than any of the men who paid him.\n\"He helps only for a price,\" I said to Bartholomew. \"Remember that.\"\n\"Right, sir.\"\nBartholomew bustled into my bedchamber, where I could see him placing my shirts into the wardrobe. By the time he emerged, I'd scribbled a note on a half-sheet of saved paper, blew on the ink to dry it, then folded it over once. \"Please take this to Mayfair, to Mrs. Brandon. I need her help in a matter.\"\nIn the letter, I asked Louisa to have a young woman formerly known as Black Nancy to come to speak to me. Louisa had taken Nancy, a game girl, under her wing and found her honest employment in Islington. However, if anyone knew or could find out what went on with the girls in Covent Garden, it would be Nance, and I'd welcome her help.\nMy pen would not write to Louisa the fact that Carlotta had returned. That was something I would have to tell her in person. \"I will give you shillings for the hackney,\" I said to Bartholomew.\n\"No need.\" Bartholomew snatched up the paper. \"Mr. Grenville obliges.\"\nGrenville paid for all Bartholomew's expenses--Bartholomew and his brother had both been footmen in Grenville's house until Bartholomew had begged to train to become a valet. Grenville had lent him to me, implying that I did him a favor. Bartholomew brushed my suits and got my meals, and Grenville paid his upkeep. As Marianne had observed, Grenville did like to run people's lives for them. But unlike Denis, Grenville did it out of a sense of generosity and large-heartedness.\nBartholomew departed, saying he'd get me in a meal before traveling to Mayfair. I quit the house and walked back down Grimpen Lane. The summer day had turned hot, and I was sweating by the time I reached Russel Street and turned again to Covent Garden.\nThe large square that comprised Covent Garden was bounded on one side by the pile of the theatre, two sides by rows of houses and shops, and the fourth by St. Paul's, Covent Garden. Houses ran along the outside of the churchyard, people squeezing themselves in any place they could.\nThe square teemed with life on most days, and this fair afternoon was no exception. Market stalls marched down the center of the square and vendors' carts jammed any open spaces they could find. Shoppers swarmed them, and thieves and pickpockets abounded, I knew, awaiting their chance. Young women bearing baskets of bright, ripe strawberries on their shoulders strolled the crowds, and milkmaids balanced heavy buckets on yokes across their backs, calling out to housewives and maids.\nI passed through the throng without stopping and turned my steps to King Street on the western side. King Street was lined on both sides with tall houses and ended in a tangle of small lanes that meandered to St. Martin's Lane and up to Long Acre.\nThe street contained respectable houses, nothing grand enough for gentry or Mayfair aristocrats, but nice enough for the middle class and those who aspired to be middle class. The easy camaraderie of Grimpen Lane or Bow Street or Covent Garden was here replaced with quiet neighbors and dependable servants who looked after their masters.\nAs I walked along, eyeing the faceless windows, I seethed that Carlotta had never told Gabriella about me. Carlotta had taken my daughter away from me not only in body, but in her mind and heart. To Gabriella, I'd never existed.\nMy friends would no doubt have advised me to wait for the meeting with them and Denis tomorrow morning, but I could not. I wanted to see Gabriella. I needed to see her. I began to ask the dependable servants which houses took paying guests.\nThree of them did, number 37, number 31, and number 19. Nineteen I dismissed because it was above a milliner's shop, and I doubted Carlotta, who had always been rather snobbish about tradesmen, would agree to live above a shop. Inquiring at number 37, I found that the landlord rented only to elderly military gentlemen, which left number 31.\nThe maid who answered my knock replied in the affirmative that Madame Auberge and her daughter and husband were staying here. What name did I want to say?\nI did not think that Carlotta would agree to see me. I paused on the threshold, wondering whether to send up my card or whether it would be wise to give a false name to lure her down, when Gabriella herself crossed the hall on her way to the stairs. She saw me standing in the sunshine and stopped.\nMy daughter. Lord, she was so beautiful.\nGabriella gazed at me with some hesitation, no doubt remembering the odd encounter from this morning and wondering what to make of it. \"May I help you, sir? Captain, was it? My mother is resting.\"\nI drank her in, from her fresh, light brown curls to her pointed chin to her sensible, high-waisted gown now covered with a long apron. \"I would talk with you,\" I said. \"Please.\"\nThis morning, I had spoken rudely to her mother and had tried to block Carlotta's escape from Covent Garden market. Gabriella must have thought me a bit mad. But the way she gazed at me now revealed the trait that made me know more than anything that she was my daughter. Curiosity.\n\"Perhaps, sir,\" Gabriella said, \"we may converse here in the hall.\"\nShe glanced at the maid as though seeking her approval. It was not the thing for a young lady to speak to strange gentlemen, but as I said, she was my daughter. I read in Gabriella that she would bend the rules as far as she could in order to satisfy the same curiosity that ran rampant in me.\nI answered that speaking in the hall would do very well for me. The maid, who looked as though she did not like it but felt it not her place to say so, sent me a warning look, but opened the door wider to admit me.\nI walked into a foyer that was dim and small but scrupulously free of dust and mud. The maid closed the door, shutting us into a narrow rectangle with doors opening off one side into whatever rooms lay behind them. At the back of the hall, the staircase rose then twisted back on itself to the next floor.\nGabriella waited politely as I took off my hat and relinquished it to the maid. With a last disapproving glance, the maid trotted off to the back of the hall and down the stairs to the servants' demesne.\nMy daughter stood calmly near the foot of the stairs, her hands clasped loosely around the newel post, as though waiting for me to explain my errand. Her hair, light brown with a touch of honey blond, was pulled into a simple knot on the crown of her head. She wore no jewelry, nor was her dress cluttered with perfusions of lace and ribbons that seemed to be fashionable these days. In short, she was simple and unadorned, a fresh-faced girl waiting for her life to begin.\nI could not speak. I gazed at Gabriella while she stood poised, likely wondering whether she'd been wise to let me in the house. Her eyes were brown like mine and like my mother's had been.\n\"Are you all right, sir?\" she asked after the silence had stretched.\nI suddenly wondered the real reason I'd come here. Had it been simply to feast my eyes on my daughter? Or had I come to tell her the truth, to burst into her world and explain to her who I was and what she was to me?\nSomething held my tongue. I realized I did not want to spoil her innocence, did not want to wipe the ingenuous expression from her face. I wanted her to know, but I did not want the knowledge to hurt her.\n\"Are you well?\" I asked her at last.\n\"Yes, sir.\" She looked relieved that I had asked a polite question. \"Though I am finding London rather crowded.\"\nMy mouth moved in polite response, although I hardly knew what I said. \"I am sorry that the peach seller tried to cheat you. It was a poor example of English hospitality.\"\nAmusement lit her eyes. \"They did the same in Paris. I believe it is a habit of market sellers to try to take as much coin as they can from the country folk.\"\n\"And you have always lived in the country?\"\n\"Oh, yes, always. My father has a little estate near Lyon. He likes farming,\" she finished with a fond look.\nThe look broke my heart. I cleared my throat. \"Do you like life in the country?\"\n\"It is pleasant,\" she said. \"But I was happy to see Paris, and I am excited to be in London. I had never been farther than Lyon before, you see.\"\nShe spoke politely, making the same sort of small talk a young woman might to an acquaintance of her parents.\nI could barely contain my patience. I wanted to sit her down and have her tell me all about her life, what she had learned and who had taught her and what she knew of Latin and Greek and geography. I wanted to know what was her favorite color and what she liked to read and what were her dreams and her hopes. I wanted to know everything.\nMy anger rose. I should already know everything about her. Carlotta had stolen from me the joy of watching her grow and learn and become the young woman she now was. I should have been at Gabriella's side for every one of her triumphs and every one of her heartaches and everything she'd discovered in her life. I should have had that.\nI had grown used to the fact that Carlotta had left me. The insane rage that had visited me the day I discovered her gone had long since worn down. But seeing Gabriella again brought home the pain that all the years between then and now could never be recovered.\n\"You are not called Gabrielle, in the French way,\" I said.\n\"My mother is English,\" Gabriella said, as though she'd grown used to explaining this. \"But you know that, sir. You know her. You spoke to her familiarly in the square this morning.\"\nI realized, with a jolt, that while I was standing here watching Gabriella and trying to discover everything about her, she was trying to discover everything about me. The pain twisted tighter.\n\"I was a captain in the English army. Cavalry, Thirty-Fifth Light Dragoons. I was posted to India at the end of the nineties, and then Paris during the Peace of Amiens. That was fifteen years ago.\" I stopped.\n\"Did you know my mother and father there? I was born in France.\"\n\"No,\" I answered. \"You were born in India.\"\nGabriella looked perplexed. \"No, sir, in France. My mother has never been to India.\"\nI stilled my tongue. Carlotta must have constructed a world in which I did not exist, cutting out the years she had been married to me. In spite of my hurt and anger, I knew why Carlotta had done so--simple lies were easier than the complicated truth, and Carlotta ever sought the easier path.\n\"She was there,\" I said. \"And so were you. Your cries used to annoy my colonel. I was not very contrite about that.\"\nI remembered how in the middle of the night, I would walk up and down with Gabriella on my shoulder. Carlotta had hysterics when Gabriella cried too much, certain retribution would come upon her. She had not known what to do with a healthy and robust baby like Gabriella.\nI had not known what to do with a baby either, but I had carried her about the tents and the campfires of the men and told her about all the beautiful things I would buy her when she grew up. I remembered her nonsense words and her laughter, and how she'd stared in wonder at everything on the ship as we'd made the long journey back to Europe.\nLouisa Brandon, my colonel's wife, had loved Gabriella. Louisa had no children of her own, and by the time we reached France, she'd realized it was unlikely she ever would. She had doted on Gabriella, happily playing with her on the voyage while Carlotta had been laid low with seasickness. Louisa had been as upset as I when Carlotta had taken Gabriella away, though Louisa had had her hands full bringing me back from madness.\n\"You were there,\" I almost whispered.\nA step on the landing above kept Gabriella from answering. I looked up and beheld a man with graying hair descending toward us. He was not tall, but he was squarely built, with a small head on broad shoulders. Bulky, rather than fat. He wore a plain suit cut in the French style and shoes that would make fashionable Grenville wince. His stance said that he wore his clothes for convenience, not for fashion.\nA pale scar creased his face from ear to cheekbone, probably earned while serving under Napoleon during the first part of the war. He had a military bearing, and I knew at once that I looked upon the man for whom Carlotta had deserted me.\n\"Captain Lacey?\" he said, stopping behind Gabriella.\nI bowed, but made no reply.\n\"I am Major Auberge. I must ask why you have come.\"\nI answered in French, knowing that language and not wanting any faulty understanding to slow what I wanted to say to him. \"There has been an appointment fixed with Mr. Denis for tomorrow.\"\n\"Yes, I received his note. Therefore, we will meet tomorrow. There was no need for you to come today.\"\n\"I suppose I wanted to satisfy myself that you were truly here.\"\nAuberge gave me a nod, eyes guarded. \"Now you have seen.\"\n\"Why did you bring her?\" I looked pointedly at Gabriella. \"Carlotta could have come alone.\"\n\"My wife could not have made such a journey on her own. I had to accompany her.\"\n\"But you have other children, do you not? Did you bring the entire family?\"\nGabriella broke in. \"They stay with my uncle,\" she said in perfect French. \"He has his lands adjacent to ours. We often stay with Uncle.\"\n\"Gabriella.\" His voice held a father's warning tone.\n\"Who is he, Papa?\" Gabriella asked. \"Why do you speak to him so? And why does he say I was in India?\"\n\"Gabriella, please return upstairs and attend your mother.\"\nShe certainly was my daughter. A rebellious look came over Gabriella's young face, and she drew a breath to argue. Then she seemed to think better of it, made a polite curtsy to me and one to her father, and rushed up the stairs. Her swirling skirts revealed slim ankles and slender calves, the legs of a girl who liked to run, probably more than was ladylike.\nGabriella trained her gaze on me again, then turned the corner of the staircase and ascended to the dim recesses above. Not until we'd heard a door slam in the distance did Major Auberge speak again.\n\"You will have what you want,\" he said, still in French. \"This Mr. Denis says he can make things satisfactory for all parties.\"\n\"No doubt he can.\" James Denis had resources, both people and finances, far beyond what I and a small landholder from Lyon could manage. \"Why did you bring her? Gabriella, I mean? Why is she not at home with her uncle and the rest of your brood?\"\nRed crept into the major's face. \"There was a young man. I do not approve of him.\"\nI immediately did not approve of him either. Gabriella was seventeen, too young, in my opinion, for any kind of liaison or engagement. \"So you brought her here to keep her out of harm's way? Is that what you told her?\"\n\"We told her we would visit her mother's brother. Which we will.\"\n\"Gabriella will discover the true reason you are here, no matter how you try to hide it. She is a Lacey--she will ferret it out.\"\n\"She will learn the truth, in time.\" Auberge frowned at me. \"But from me, please.\"\n\"And what truth will you tell her? That I am her rightful father, denied her all this time?\"\nHis expression hardened. \"Carlotta was unhappy with you. She told me.\"\n\"She was. That is true.\" After all these years I could admit that I'd expected Carlotta to live a life she'd been in no way suited for. We'd both been very young and foolish, and I ought to have been more patient. \"But Gabriella was not miserable. And she belongs to me.\"\nAuberge lost his veneer of politeness. \"Do I not know that? Do I not know that every time I have looked at her for these fifteen years, I have been seeing another man's child? And now with this telling, that I will no doubt lose her? Gabriella is very dear to me.\"\nI scarcely cared. I was jealous and angry and craving to be with Gabriella, and having this Frenchman tell me that he would be heartbroken when she learned the truth was more than I could bear.\nI planted my walking stick, which encased a stout sword, in front of me. \"Then you will have a taste of what you have done to me. Pinching a man's wife and daughter is not the thing, Major.\"\nHe only looked at me, anger in his eyes. He knew that I was the wronged party, and yet, he blamed me. My fault that I'd lost them in the first place, my fault that now he'd have to face Gabriella with the truth.\nI knew I could not stay here and converse with him without rage taking over, without demanding that he hand Gabriella to me then and there. I sent him a hard stare, then turned on my heel and marched out the door. He did not try to stop me.\nI was so enraged that I was halfway through Covent Garden, the sun shining heavily on my head, before I realized I'd forgotten my hat.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Four\n\nBartholomew was still gone when I reached home again. He'd left a meal for me on my writing table, but I could not summon any interest in it. Leaving it untouched, I sat down on the wing chair before the cold fireplace and let thoughts whirl.\nNot seeing Gabriella all this time had kept the sorrow of losing her at bay a bit, but now that she had reappeared, all my pain and fury resurfaced. Carlotta had effectively expunged me from the girl's life. She'd had no right to do that. By law, a child was related to her father, not her mother, and I alone had the privilege of deciding who had guardianship of her.\nI did not know what the laws were in France--perhaps a man could steal another man's daughter and live happily. But those were not the laws of England, and I damn well would get Gabriella back.\nI wanted her to know who she was--a Lacey, from a family of long, blue-blooded lineage. My father had been no saint, and he and my grandfather had beggared the estate with their imprudent living, but the family line had existed for centuries, and I was proud of it. That Carlotta would take away the girl's entire heritage disgusted me. As ever, Carlotta was trying to rearrange the world on her own terms.\nAuberge knew the seriousness of it; I'd sensed that in him. He was ashamed of absconding with my daughter, but I do not think he felt any such shame about running off with my wife. He'd stated flatly that I'd made her miserable.\nI could not refute him. Carlotta had been a delicate creature, not meant to bear the heat of India nor the hardship of life in the army. She'd been reared to embroider in a quiet manor house and to sip lemonade in a garden with her equally delicate friends.\nBut Carlotta had married me quickly enough. I hadn't quite believed my luck that day in 1796 when she'd smiled at me and accepted my proposal. I told her I'd met a fellow called Brandon who'd promised he'd help me obtain a career in the army. I would volunteer as an officer and go with Brandon to India without commission or regiment. Many officers started in this way, young gentlemen who had the right birth but lacked funds to purchase a commission.\nAloysius Brandon had been very inspiring in those days, young and energetic and with a charisma that made people long to follow him. It was he who'd obtained a special license for me, laughing at my impetuous decision to marry the beautiful Carlotta, although he'd never warmed to her.\nCarlotta's father had been furious when I announced that I'd married his daughter. I remembered Carlotta trembling and clinging to me, and her father's words: \"Take her, then. I never want to see her again.\" We'd boarded ship for India almost immediately after that.\nI believe Carlotta had begun to doubt her wisdom very quickly. I compounded matters by holding Louisa Brandon, whom Brandon had married the day before we'd started for India, as an example for Carlotta to follow. Where Carlotta was shy, Louisa was frank and friendly; where Carlotta was sickly, Louisa was robust. Louisa had a spirit of adventure that helped her through the long, hot ship journey and the unpleasant conditions in India, whereas Carlotta soon wilted. Carlotta had been almost constantly ill during our years in India and pushed me away whenever I tried to be amorous. I had not been very patient with her.\nGabriella was born in 1800, after several disappointed hopes that Carlotta was increasing. The disappointment had been on my part, because I don't believe that Carlotta ever wanted a baby. I had thought Gabriella's birth would relieve all problems between Carlotta and me, but if anything, having to care for a child only added to Carlotta's distress.\nWhen Gabriella had been a year old, we finally escaped the heat of India for a brief but pleasant stay in Sussex, then we moved to Paris, during the Peace of Amiens. After we had lived there nearly a year, Carlotta fled me. I'd returned to our lodgings one afternoon to find Carlotta out and Louisa waiting for me with a letter in her hand and a distressed look on her face.\nI'd searched for them, of course, but Carlotta and her Frenchman had planned well and had disappeared into the French countryside. Soon afterward, Napoleon had stirred up trouble again, and we'd fled France and returned to England. I was posted to the Netherlands for that disaster, then France moved into Spain, and the Peninsular War commenced.\nSearching for my wife and daughter had become impractical, and after the war it became expensive. I'd had no idea of their whereabouts until James Denis had produced a piece of paper several months ago with their direction written on it.\nI remained despondent in the chair for a time, not knowing quite what to do. I'd see Carlotta tomorrow at James Denis's house. A part of me wanted to wait for that encounter to see what would transpire. Another part of me wanted to rush back to King Street and drag Gabriella home with me now.\nThe thought of hurting Gabriella stilled me. In all of this, no matter how much anger I felt toward Carlotta and Auberge, I did not want Gabriella to suffer for it. None of the madness that her elders had perpetrated was her fault.\nStill despondent, but growing hungry, I rose and went to the meal Bartholomew had left me. A covered plate held beefsteak and potatoes, tepid now. I sat down and ate them, not liking to let food go to waste. The beef was leathery, the potatoes floury, but the Gull was the closest tavern, so we put up with its meals. When I wanted good ale and camaraderie, I took myself to the Rearing Pony, a longer walk, but worth the effort.\nBartholomew dashed in with his usual energy just as I'd taken the last forkful of potatoes.\n\"Afternoon, sir.\" He tossed a cloth-wrapped parcel to the writing table. \"Mrs. Brandon sent some cakes and says she'll look into the matter you asked her about directly. And Mr. Grenville would be pleased for you to attend the theatre with him tonight in Drury Lane.\"\nI laid down my fork and wiped my mouth with a linen napkin. \"I am hardly in the mood for an outing, Bartholomew.\"\n\"He said to come anyway,\" Bartholomew said cheerfully. \"I told him you'd gone off to Bow Street, and he said that if you start investigating anything without him, he'll never forgive you.\"\nI clattered the plates back to the tray. \"He needn't worry. I planned to bring him in at the earliest possible moment.\" Grenville not only had resources, but possessed a clear-eyed intelligence that often cut to the heart of a problem while I grew mired in anger at it.\nI explained to Bartholomew about the missing game girls and asked him to keep an eye out while he went about his errands for me. He promised to be diligent, and then rushed away to fetch bathwater for me, eager to begin preparing me for my outing with Grenville.\nLater, as I walked through the June twilight to Drury Lane, dressed in my best frock coat and filled with the sweetness of Louisa's cakes, I glanced at the shadows to see whether I could spy out any game girls I knew. They liked to tease me, knowing I would neither pay them for a few moments' dubious pleasure, nor turn them over to the Watch or the reformers. If I had spare coin, I gave it to them in hopes that they'd go home and escape a possible beating from their flats--the customers who sought them--or the men they lived with who took what they earned. I saw a few flits of movement here and there, but no one called out to me.\nI entered Drury Lane Theatre and gave my card to a footman at the door, who knew to take me to Grenville's box. I had long ago learned not to try to pay for my own ticket when Grenville invited me to a theatre; it insulted him, and he always squared things with the manager beforehand.\nI gave my best hat to a footman who waited inside the box, thankful I'd worn my second best one to King Street if I were going to leave hats about absentmindedly. I had directed Bartholomew to the boardinghouse to obtain it from one of the servants there. He'd seemed slightly surprised I wanted him to fetch it back; when Grenville mislaid something, he simply bought another.\nThe box was crowded tonight. Grenville stood in the middle of it, a woman in bronze-colored satin on his arm. His cronies from White's stood about, earls and marquises and well-connected gentlemen. No wives, however, which made me wonder about the woman, whose back was to me, while I shook hands all around.\nBy the yellow light of candles in sconces, I saw that the woman wore a diadem of diamonds in her sleek hair and had a handsome figure hugged by the shimmering gown. When I at last worked my way across the box to Grenville, he turned the lovely creature toward me while I shook his hand.\nI stopped and stared in astonishment. \"Marianne?\"\nShe gave me a sardonic smile. \"How flattering you are, Lacey.\"\nGrenville's look was slightly smug but also wary. They made a fine pair, he with his dark hair and lively brown eyes in a face that, if not handsome, was arresting, and Marianne with her golden hair and forget-me-not blue eyes. Whatever modiste Grenville had her frequent had created a gown to enhance Marianne's greatest assets. The decolletage bared her shoulders and part of her bosom, but did not make her appear overly voluptuous, and the long skirt, not too much adorned, made her look willowy but not thin.\nAll in all, the gown was a masterwork, the creation of an artist. Her hair, instead of hanging in the little-girl curls she liked to sport, had been pulled into a coil of burnished gold and adorned with the diamonds. A few gold ringlets fell artfully to the back of her neck. Her only other jewelry besides the diadem were dangling diamond earrings and a narrow circlet of diamonds around her throat.\nI saw Grenville's taste and restraint in the entire ensemble. Left to her own devices, Marianne would no doubt have loaded herself with jewels so that the actresses below, her former colleagues, could see how far she'd risen.\nI realized that this was Marianne's debut. Grenville since April had been squiring her about to Hyde Park and to races, places where mistresses were accepted. Might as well flaunt my folly, he'd told me dryly. But this was the first time he'd brought her to the theatre, openly, as his guest. He'd invited all these aristocrats and highborn gentlemen to meet Marianne, to usher her into his world. That explained the absence of wives; these men could not bring their respectable ladies into a box with a former chorus actress.\n\"Aren't I a fine racehorse?\" Marianne asked me.\nGrenville frowned, but I bowed over Marianne's hand, pretending I hadn't heard. Grenville was treating her no differently than he'd treated his previous mistresses, but I had a feeling that Marianne would not be content with being an ordinary bit of muslin.\nThe other gentlemen in the box, however, seemed happy to accept her. The mistress of the most fashionable gentleman in England would have no small influence. She was quickly drawn into conversation while Grenville looked after her with a cautious eye.\n\"It is a difficult thing,\" he said to me in a low voice. \"If I do not flaunt her as though I care nothing for public opinion, I ruin my reputation. I cannot creep about as though I am ashamed of her. But if anyone learns that I will call out any gentleman who dares make up to her, I will definitely ruin my reputation. I will be as a lovesick actor in a melodrama.\"\n\"The great Grenville cannot fall in love?\" I asked, amused.\nHe gestured me to chairs at the front of the box. \"I must conduct my entire life with cool detachment.\" He shot me a look as we sat. \"And who the devil said anything about falling in love?\"\nI did not answer. Grenville had become fascinated with Marianne from the moment he'd met her, a little more than a year ago. I knew, and Grenville would not admit, that the fascination had blossomed into something deeper.\nHis expression softened, and he pinched the bridge of his nose. \"Lacey, how did this happen to me?\"\n\"These things come upon one when one least expects it,\" I said philosophically.\nHe shook his head. \"I am wallowing, when I know your troubles are greater than mine. Marianne told me.\"\nI had assumed she would, which was just as well. I had no wish to explain it again.\n\"If there is anything I can do, Lacey, you know you have only to ask.\"\nHe looked sincere. Marianne and I had been correct when we agreed that he was a generous man. \"Thank you, but I will wait to see what Denis has to say.\"\n\"James Denis?\" He raised his brows. \"Bartholomew told me you had received a letter. It was about this?\"\n\"Yes.\" While Marianne held court behind us, I rapidly explained the situation.\nGrenville looked thoughtful. \"Hmm. I wonder what his game is.\"\nWe both knew that Denis never did something for nothing. \"I will find out.\"\nMarianne's throaty laughter rippled to us. She knew how to charm when she bothered, and she was busily charming them all. Grenville looked dismayed. \"Hell, it's started.\"\nHe did not mean the play, which had not begun. A few acrobats cavorted on the stage below, but no one was paying them much mind.\n\"I promise to second you in any duels that may arise,\" I said.\n\"You do not amuse me, Lacey. If I drag her to my side, I'll be a laughingstock. But if I do not, some other gentleman might.\"\n\"Marianne is no fool. She knows who you are and what you can give her.\"\n\"Humph. In other words, she will remain with me as long as I pour gold into her hand and wave trinkets before of her eyes.\" He heaved a sigh. \"And do you know, Lacey, I am idiotic enough to do just that.\"\n\"I do not think it is that simple,\" I began, but I could say no more, because the acrobats were leaving to desultory applause, and the gentlemen in the box took their seats. Marianne, I was relieved to see, sat down next to Grenville.\nThe play was tedious. It was a shortened version of Othello, rewritten so that Othello forgave Desdemona, killed Iago in a dramatic duel, and danced and sang with Desdemona and the remaining cast. The audience knew the songs and sang along.\nAt the interval, two more acrobats, more skilled than those of the first group, came out to make jokes, tease the audience, and flip from each other's shoulders. A footman brought me a message, and I stood up and moved to more light to read it.\nThe note ran, When you grow tired of sitting in the most gossiped-about box in the theatre, perhaps you could be persuaded to visit the neglected ladies across from you, those you were at one time pleased to call your friends. D.B.\nI smiled, recognizing the handwriting and the acerbic style, and looked across the theatre to the boxes opposite. Even without a glass, I could see the white-feathered headdress that adorned Lady Breckenridge's head. Stout Lady Aline Carrington was easier still to spot. She spied me looking across at them and gave me an unashamed wave.\nI bowed back, took my leave of the gentlemen in the box, and made my way to the other side of the theatre.\nLady Aline's box was less crowded than Grenville's, containing only Lady Aline, Lady Breckenridge, and three other women of their acquaintance, two of whom were married to gentlemen in Grenville's box.\n\"Lacey, dear boy, I knew you would not forget us,\" Lady Aline boomed. She took my arm in a fierce grip and nearly dragged me to the seat beside her. Lady Aline was a spinster who followed the ideas of Mary Wollstonecraft and had no qualms about her unmarried state. At fifty-two, she declared herself to be well past the age of scandal, rouged her cheeks, dressed in the first stare of fashion, and went about as she liked. She had more friends than any other woman in London, and was godmother to a good number of their children. \"Grenville has a new ladybird, and suddenly the gentlemen of London have no use for the rest of us.\"\nI smiled as I sat between her and Lady Breckenridge. Lady Aline was a great friend of Louisa Brandon's, a fact which she reminded me as soon as I had finished greeting the other ladies.\n\"I invited Louisa tonight, but she begged off, claiming a headache. Quite right of her. I believe she ought to lie low until next Season, when plenty of other scandals will put hers out of mind. After all, her husband never did kill Henry Turner. We all knew that, of course, but magistrates can be so stupid. You were very clever to prove otherwise.\"\n\"Your help in that matter was invaluable,\" I said. Lady Aline's observations and knowledge of people in the haut ton had assisted me when Brandon had been accused of murdering a dandy in a ballroom in Berkeley Square.\n\"You flatter me, Lacey. I only answered questions about who did what at the Gillises' ball. You and Donata put the pieces together.\"\nLady Aline approved of my fondness for Donata Breckenridge, whose mother was another of Lady Aline's great friends. Lady Breckenridge's first husband had been a monster who'd died the summer before. Donata was resilient and bold, but I knew that her marriage to Breckenridge had hurt her deeply. He'd conducted his many affairs in an embarrassingly public manner and was never apologetic about it.\nDonata had rouged her cheeks tonight, adding color to her pale skin. Her deep blue gown covered her modestly, but like Marianne's, it was cut to enhance her pretty plumpness and hide anything not desirable. I'd had the great fortune to have undressed her myself, and knew that nothing about her was not desirable.\nAt this moment, Lady Breckenridge was peering avidly through a lorgnette at Grenville's box, the feathers in her headdress falling loosely down either side of her face. \"Is that your Marianne Simmons?\" she asked me.\nI had told Lady Breckenridge of Grenville's heretofore secret liaison with Marianne, and to her credit, Lady Breckenridge had kept it quiet.\n\"That is certainly Marianne,\" I said.\n\"You know her?\" Lady Aline asked me with fervent interest.\n\"She used to live in the rooms above mine. Grenville met her while she was trying to help me find the young ladies who'd been kidnapped in the Hanover Square affair.\"\nMarianne had helped only for the promise of a reward, and Grenville, astounded by her, had handed her twenty guineas without thought.\nLady Aline tapped my arm with her closed fan. \"You wretched boy. You never told me the most delicious gossip in all of London. I had to learn it from my servants. I shall never forgive you for this.\"\nI knew from her teasing tone that she had already forgiven me. \"It was Grenville's business, not mine.\"\n\"And you are a true and loyal friend to keep it so close to your chest. That is what I admire about you, Lacey.\" Lady Aline flapped her fan, never minding that she'd completely turned around her opinion in a matter of seconds. \"She is a stunning creature, is she not?\"\nI admitted to myself that Marianne had cleaned up nicely. I knew, too, that she was fond of Grenville, and he of her, and I hoped they could tear down the walls of mistrust between them and nurture that fondness.\n\"I prefer the present company,\" I said.\nI was slapped with the fan again. \"You silver-tongued rogue. And people wonder why I invite you everywhere.\"\nI smiled politely, but my heart was not in the banter tonight. I should have been happy sitting between a lady I considered a good friend and one for whom I bore increasing affection, but I was still too dazed from my encounters with Carlotta and Gabriella and preoccupied with the meeting tomorrow to enjoy myself.\nI had contemplated courting Lady Breckenridge when I was free of my marriage, and in fact, had already gained her permission to do so. This summer, I would go with her to her father's estate to meet her family, and I looked forward to the visit. I was at last discovering the peace of being in love without drama.\nYet tonight, I could not be comfortable, and I knew that Lady Breckenridge sensed my distance. She behaved as usual, making acid comments about people she observed and blatantly watching Grenville's box through her lorgnette. She talked of a violinist she'd recently decided to sponsor--one of a string of unknown artists, poets, and musicians she prided herself on introducing to London society. This one was young, French, and difficult, but his playing had already wormed its way into the hearts of the right people.\nI listened and made the correct responses, but Lady Breckenridge knew she did not hold my interest. She watched me from the corners of her eyes but asked no questions.\nLady Aline, on the other hand, leaned toward me, all eagerness. \"I heard from Louisa that Bow Street has asked you to look into another matter for them. Do tell us about it.\"\nLady Breckenridge lowered her lorgnette and tilted her head to listen, letting black curls spill over her shoulders to mingle with the feathers. I glanced behind me, but the three ladies in the chairs in the back of the box had their heads together, nattering madly over something else.\n\"The matter does not seem important to the magistrates,\" I said. \"Pomeroy thought to have me poke around. It is a rather sordid topic for ladies.\"\n\"But we like sordid things, Lacey,\" Lady Aline said. \"It makes us feel morally superior.\"\nLady Breckenridge slanted me a smile, enjoying Lady Aline's joke. \"A corpse in a ballroom is also sordid,\" she said. \"And yet we were quite interested in that.\"\nI protested out of politeness, because a gentleman should, but I knew that these ladies were not wilting misses and more resilient than any generals' wives I'd known. \"It involves street girls,\" I said. \"A few have gone missing.\"\nNeither lady blushed nor grew horrified that I mentioned such a subject.\n\"You are correct,\" Lady Breckenridge said. \"That is sordid, but not in the way you meant. Why should these ladies go missing?\"\n\"Perhaps they've simply run off to seek their fortunes,\" Lady Aline said.\n\"The men with whom they lived reported their absence with concern.\"\n\"Poor things,\" Lady Aline said. \"Their lovers often beat them, I do hear. Perhaps they ran away from them.\"\n\"Or found better accommodation,\" Lady Breckenridge, ever practical, said.\n\"Either may be the case. I will meet with one of the men tomorrow and ascertain what sort of person he is. That will tell me much about why the girl is gone.\"\n\"Louisa said you asked for her help,\" Lady Aline said. \"But she did not specify of what sort.\"\nLady Breckenridge brushed at her skirt as though she'd found a stray speck of dust. \"I cannot imagine what Mrs. Brandon knows about street girls.\"\n\"Oh, she takes them in, my dear,\" Lady Aline said. \"They do not stay, but she's rescued a few urchins in her time, given them employment, and found places for the best of them. A few simply run off with the spoons, of course, but Louisa is not deterred. She has a good heart. Is it one of her strays you are after, Lacey?\"\n\"A young woman I know who was formerly a street girl, yes. Black Nancy is now a most-respectable maid in Islington.\"\nLady Aline nodded as though it all made sense. Lady Breckenridge's bosom rose with a sharp breath, but the only expression she made was to raise her brows the slightest bit. \"You know quite interesting people, Lacey.\"\nI kept my tone light. \"I have had an adventurous life.\"\nShe did not answer but kept her gaze trained on me. Her good opinion mattered to me, and I did not want to sense it drifting away.\n\"I wish to ask this young woman if she knew any of the missing girls,\" I went on.\nLady Aline nodded. \"Go to one of them. That is good logic.\"\nLady Breckenridge said nothing. She raised her lorgnette again and scanned the crowd, slightly turning her body away from me.\nLady Aline pumped me for more information about the missing girls until she was satisfied she'd heard everything, then she moved on to other gossip. Lady Breckenridge made the occasional desultory comment but stayed rather silent, for her.\nNear to midnight, the theatre crowd began drifting away. The ladies with Lady Aline had departed early, as it was Wednesday, and Almack's Assembly Rooms in King Street, St. James's, closed their doors at eleven, no exceptions.\nI prepared to take my leave and return to Grenville's box, but Lady Aline stopped me. \"I am off home to host a card party for about a dozen friends. You will of course escort us, dear boy. You cannot let a helpless widow and spinster travel across London alone in the middle of the night.\"\nI wanted to laugh. Lady Aline had her own carriage and retinue of loyal servants, and any man fool enough to rob her would find himself at the business end of her thick walking stick. Likewise Lady Breckenridge was well looked after; her footmen were stronger and more agile than I.\nBut Lady Aline wanted me, for what reason I did not know, and so I answered, \"I will happily escort you to Mayfair, but I will not stay for cards. I have not the head for them tonight, and I have an early appointment tomorrow.\"\n\"Pity,\" Lady Aline said, struggling to her feet. I rose quickly to mine and helped her. \"You are such a splendid conversationalist, Lacey. You do not say only what everyone wishes to hear.\"\n\"You mean I am rude.\"\n\"I mean that you are refreshing. That is why Grenville favors you; you are nobody's toady, and the poor man must grow weary of toadies. He undoubtedly favors the unknown actress for the same reason. Difficult to find novelty in your life when you have everything handed to you. John, my boy, run and fetch my carriage.\"\nThe youthful footman jumped and ran out to obey his mistress. Two maids entered a moment later with wraps for the ladies, and we made ready to leave.\nI could not simply abandon Grenville, so I sent Lady Aline's footman when he returned around to say that Lady Aline had requested my presence. Grenville would understand. When Lady Aline commandeered a person, they stayed commandeered. She would have made a fine press-ganger.\nLady Breckenridge had traveled to the theatre with Lady Aline, so the three of us journeyed to Mayfair in Lady Aline's carriage, the two ladies facing forward, I facing the rear as a gentleman should. The carriage rolled north and west, leaving Drury Lane at Long Acre, then traveling through narrow byways to Leicester Square and beyond to Piccadilly, from which we turned north into the heart of fashionable London.\nLady Aline lived in Mount Street, around the corner from Lady Breckenridge's house in South Audley Street. Lady Aline's home was a typical London townhouse, brick with white pediments over the windows and an arched front door painted dark green with a brass doorknocker in its center.\nAs soon as we stopped, a footman hurried from the house to set a stool in front of the carriage door and assist us down. Another footman unrolled a rug from stool to door so that his mistress and her guests never had to tread on London's dirty cobblestones.\nRelieved of wraps, we went upstairs to Lady Aline's opulent sitting room. She bustled out with her servants, bellowing orders like a sergeant-major as she chivied them in preparations for her card party. The servants hurried after her, leaving Lady Breckenridge alone with me, which, I realized, had been Aline's intention all along.\nLady Breckenridge pulled a gold case from her reticule and extracted from it a thin black cigarillo. She held the cigarillo loosely in her fingers, pointing it ever so slightly at me. I took the cigarillo, lit it with a candle in an elaborate silver candelabra, and handed it back to her.\n\"Thank you,\" she said. She drew a long breath of smoke, as though she'd been wanting to do nothing but that all evening. \"The theatre is tedious,\" she remarked. \"I long for country walks--or rather walks in the country garden. I am not one to tramp mannishly across wet meadows and scramble through hedgerows and think it entertainment.\"\n\"Do you ride?\" I heard myself speak the words, but my attention was on the glisten of moisture on her mouth and the way her lips pursed as they closed around the cigarillo.\n\"Of course,\" she answered, as though there should have been no question. \"I imagine you have gone off the exercise after living in the saddle for the King's army.\"\n\"Not a bit. The one enjoyment I had in Berkshire this spring was riding again whenever I wished.\"\nHer brows lifted. \"The groom up and being murdered must have been inconvenient then.\"\n\"The one thing I did right in the eyes of Rutledge the headmaster was to ride every day. He approved of cavalrymen.\"\n\"And yet, in London you remain stubbornly on foot.\"\n\"Lack of steed, my dear lady,\" I said. \"I am acquainted with a gentleman who lets me ride his horse when available, but I can only prevail upon his charity so often.\"\n\"Oh.\" She inhaled smoke again, regarding me as though she'd never thought of this impediment before. \"Ride with me tomorrow in Hyde Park. I keep two horses, and one is fat and lazy and in need of exercise. I keep the horse for my son, but he has not been here much this Season. He stays with my mother--the country air is much better for him.\"\nI had met her son Peter not long ago, a small, dark-haired boy of five, who was now Viscount Breckenridge. I'd heard a few vicious people draw attention to the fact that six years before, Breckenridge had been in the army on the Peninsula, implying, of course, that the child wasn't Breckenridge's at all. But I could not agree. The lad had Breckenridge's sturdy build, somewhat scowling demeanor, and focus of purpose. Officers did take leave to see family if necessary. I imagined that Donata had not been pleased to see her husband return.\nThe thought of Breckenridge insisting on his connubial rights with Donata stirred anger in me, although Breckenridge had been dead for a year.\n\"I hope he dances in hell,\" I said.\nLady Breckenridge blinked. \"Who does?\"\n\"Your husband.\"\nShe gave me a look of surprise, not having the benefit of my train of thought. \"I hope so too, but I was speaking of riding in Hyde Park.\"\n\"My apologies, but I must decline.\"\n\"Must you? I see.\"\nAnger sparked in her eyes. I said quickly, \"I have an appointment tomorrow. More than one, in fact.\"\nLady Breckenridge shrugged as though it did not matter. \"So you said. Has it to do with your missing game girls?\"\n\"No.\" I came to her and plucked the cigarillo from her gloved hand. She watched me without expression as I set it on the edge of a table. I cupped her shoulders and turned her to face me. \"My wife has returned to London. The first appointment is with her, to speak about divorce.\"\nHer pupils narrowed to pinpricks, and she drew a quick breath. \"I remember you said you wanted to find her, to end the marriage.\"\n\"If I can. That is why it is complicated.\"\nLady Breckenridge opened her lips to respond, then she closed them again. I searched her face, looking for what she truly felt, but Lady Breckenridge was a master at hiding her emotions. I'd come to know her well enough, though, to see the tightening around her eyes, the small tug of the corner of her mouth. She was unhappy, but living with Breckenridge had taught her never, ever to show her hurt.\n\"I should not call on you again until I know what is what,\" I said. \"Because I am Grenville's friend, and because divorce is so sordid, it will get into the newspapers. I do not want you to be dragged into it as well.\"\nHer brows rose. \"Goodness, it is far too late for that. Gossip about you and me is already all over London, and I will get into the newspapers whether you are seen calling on me or not.\"\n\"That is likely true.\" My fingers tightened on her smooth shoulders. \"But I am imagining cartoons portraying me carrying on with one woman while I am busily discarding the other.\"\n\"Carrying on?\" she repeated sharply.\n\"A poor choice of words, but ones the newspapers will likely use. I hope to do this as quietly as possible, and if anyone can make it happen quietly, it is James Denis. But even he cannot guarantee there will be no damage to you.\"\n\"Ah, the intriguing Mr. Denis. He has promised to help?\"\n\"He has begun helping me whether I wish him to or no. That is another reason the appointment will be complicated. I do not know exactly what he will want in return for this favor.\"\nLady Breckenridge studied me a moment, her expression guarded. \"I observed earlier tonight that you knew interesting people.\"\n\"And I observed that I'd had an adventurous life, which is true.\"\nShe moved away from me, sliding from my grasp gently but firmly. \"My husband led an adventurous life as well. I soon grew tired of it.\"\nHer voice remained light, but I sensed the tension in her words. Her husband had given her nothing but misery, and she'd responded by becoming a daring, flirtatious, and acerbic woman with a barbed sense of humor. From what Lady Aline had told me, she'd made the decision not to become the downtrodden wife, and to do as she pleased. Her bold facade, however, did not mean she had not borne hurt.\n\"I am not Breckenridge,\" I said.\n\"True.\" Lady Breckenridge lifted her cigarillo from the table and drew another intake of smoke. \"But who knows who you really are? I am rather naive about gentlemen.\"\nI went to her again, and this time, I cupped her face in my hands. \"I never will be Breckenridge. I can promise you that. If not for you, I would let the matter with my wife lie, but if I have to prostrate myself before James Denis to get myself free, I will do it. It may be that my marriage is already legally ended because she abandoned me, but I need to know for certain. I want to start on a blank page with you, with no impediments to interfere when the banns are read. I have so little to give you but my heart, and so I want to offer you my honesty.\"\nHer eyes widened during this speech. She held the cigarillo out from her side, and a wisp of smoke wound around the pair of us. \"You are quite fervent.\"\n\"About this, I am.\"\nWe looked at each other, inches apart. She tried to close her expression again, but I saw fear in her eyes, the fear of pain. Lady Breckenridge was such a strong and intelligent woman that her tiny vulnerability touched the gallantry in me.\nI closed the space between us and brushed her lips with mine. When I ended the kiss, her voice grew soft. \"Go, then.\"\nI smoothed a stray lock of hair from her forehead. I wanted more than anything to remain here where I could watch her and converse with her and then retire discreetly with her to her home. But my thoughts were in too much turmoil, and I did not want to arrive at James Denis's unkempt and unshaven from a night of revelry.\n\"Good night,\" I said. I lifted her hand to my lips and pressed a light kiss to her glove.\nShe stepped back, the usual glint of humor in her eyes, and resumed the cigarillo. I bowed, turned, and made for the door.\n\"Do find out what happened to those poor girls,\" she said, standing firmly in the middle of the room, watching me go. \"And of course, tell me everything.\"\n*** *** ***\nI stepped down from a hackney coach in Russel Street and walked the rest of the way down tiny Grimpen Lane. Along its narrow length I saw a glow of candlelight from my window, a point of warmth in the darkness.\nI was surprised to see the light, because I'd told Bartholomew to go out and do as he liked for the evening while I attended the theatre. Bartholomew was not so careless as to leave candles burning. Not only was there danger of fire, but candles were dear.\nI ascended the stairs and entered my front room.\nA young woman sat on my wing chair next to a small table with a lit candle and a half-drunk glass of ale. She had a fat braid of very black hair draped over her shoulder, and her eyes sparkled as she gave me a wide smile.\n\"Now then, Captain,\" Black Nancy said. \"You look that surprised to see me.\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Five\n\nShe was the same Black Nancy, and she wasn't. The huge smile and cocky manner would never change, and she still had her fall of inky black hair. But the young woman in my chair was a far cry from the girl I had known last year in shabby castoff clothing, desperate for coin to take back to her father so he would not beat her.\nNancy wore a neat cotton gown as plain and modest as any servant's, and she was clean. Her air of wary desperation had gone, but as she rose to greet me, I saw that her lewd good humor was still in place.\n\"Ain't I glad to see you.\" She threw her arms around my neck and planted a noisy kiss on my cheek. \"Let's look at you now.\" Nancy stepped back, holding my hands. \"As handsome as ever. And such a fine coat. Have a tailor now, do you, just like a nob?\"\n\"Borrowed from Grenville,\" I answered. \"The tailor, not the coat.\"\n\"Grenville, now he's a true and rich gent, but I like you better.\"\n\"You flatter me.\"\n\"You're much more interesting, ain't you? I read about you in the newspaper all the time. Captain Lacey, up to his neck in the Berkeley Square murder, Captain Lacey in thick with Bow Street. You do have a nose for trouble.\"\n\"And how are you, Nance?\" I asked dryly. I broke from her grasp, closed the door, removed my hat and gloves, took up a spill from the shelf near the door, and lit more candles. \"Now that you're a slavey at an inn in Islington.\"\n\"Aye, that I am.\" Nance flicked her braid behind her back and held a candle steady while I lit it. \"I make up beds, plump pillows, carry trays of tea, and smile at the guests so they'll leave behind more coin.\"\n\"And you like this?\"\n\"Oh, aye. I have a soft bed all me own, food when I want it, a bit of coin, and I don't have to lay on me back for a gent unless I want to.\" She lowered her right eyelid in a wink. \"Don't mean I don't sometimes want to.\"\n\"You're incorrigible, Nance.\"\n\"Does that mean the same as a bawd? 'Cause I know I am.\" She glanced at the closed door of the next room. \"I'm thinking your bed is nice and soft. Strong, too, I'll warrant.\"\nI wanted to laugh. I'd rather missed her blatant attempts at seduction, and I was pleased to see that she was no longer so needy of kindness. She seemed to have found some contentment.\n\"I have a lady,\" I said.\n\"I know that. Mrs. Brandon told me. She told me everything about you. She's a good one for a gab, is Mrs. Brandon.\"\n\"How unnerving.\" I blew out the spill and tossed it to the cold grate.\n\"That we had a chinwag about you? Naw, it were all flattering. I have a gent of me own, you know. He's hostler at the inn. Knows all about horses, just like you. He ain't much handsome, but he's young and very strong and likes to laugh.\"\nThis was the first I'd heard of a paramour. \"Is he kind to you?\" I had a more fatherly demeanor toward Nancy than she'd like, but I did worry about her. She was apt to imprudence when it came to men.\n\"Aye, he's kindhearted. He knows he's got a good girl in his Nance.\" She gave me a sly smile. \"Thought I'd ask you, though, on the off chance.\"\nShe'd known I'd say no. Nancy had always loved to tease me.\n\"Did Mrs. Brandon tell you why I wanted to see you?\" I asked. \"I need your help.\"\nNance nodded, suddenly all business. She resumed her seat with a thump. \"She said something about missing game girls, but not much else. Want me to have a trot about Covent Garden, do you?\"\n\"I hoped you might know the girls who'd gone missing, or at least know someone who knows them. I want to be certain the girls haven't simply moved on and don't want to be found. Perhaps they encountered happiness the same as you've found in Islington.\"\n\"That was you yanking me off the street and telling Mrs. Brandon to take care of me. I was that furious at you for doing it. I'd wanted you to take care of me, you see.\"\n\"I know you did.\" I remembered the way Nancy had pursued me with relentlessness, puzzled because I had no intention of taking her to be my ladybird. The fact that I had very little money and was more than twice her age had not deterred her. I suppose that, compared to living with her father, the prospect of staying in two rooms with a gentleman who didn't beat her had seemed luxurious.\n\"I still think we could have chirped along quite nice in this nest, you and me, but I ain't sorry I went to Islington. Now, who were these girls?\"\nI sat down and told Nancy what Thompson and Pomeroy had told me about the two girls. As I talked, Nancy lifted her pint of ale and slurped it noisily. She gave me a nod when I finished. \"Could be they found someone new. But I'll dig up some of me old pals and have a gab. Can I listen in when you talk to this sailor chap? I'll know how he treated her if I hear what he has to say--whether she scarpered or really is in trouble.\"\n\"Tomorrow afternoon at the Rearing Pony. I do not know what hour yet.\"\n\"You send your slavey around to Mrs. Brandon's to fetch me. That's where I'm sleeping of nights for now.\" She looked thoughtful. \"Mrs. Brandon seems a bit low. I'm cheering her up.\"\nI blenched, wondering what Nancy thought would cheer Louisa. \"She went through much when her husband was in Newgate.\"\n\"Aye, I know so. She's that pleased with you for sorting it all out.\"\nI wondered. That episode had revealed many of Colonel Brandon's sins, and I'd left Louisa uncertain whether she could forgive him. Brandon had walked firmly into the mess himself, but my poking and prying had revealed much that both he and Louisa would have preferred to remain hidden.\nNancy drained the last of her ale and wiped her mouth. \"I'll be taking my leave then, if you're not offering me a bed.\"\nI gave her an admonishing look. \"I will find you a hackney.\"\nShe cackled with laughter. \"A hackney? Ain't we fine ladies and gents. I can go on me own. I'll look up me pals on the way. Course, some of them won't speak to me, like as not, since I've landed on me feet.\"\n\"Not when girls have been vanishing from the dark of Covent Garden. Look up your pals during the day.\"\n\"They're asleep during the day. Deserve to rest, don't they? I've been tramping these streets since I was a tyke, Captain. I know me way about.\"\n\"You're not a tyke any longer, nor are you a game girl. Respectable maids do not wander about dark London byways at night. I will fetch you a coach.\"\nShe flashed a grin and peeped at me from under her lashes. \"Sure you don't want a bed warmer, Captain?\"\n\"You flatter me, Nance, but you are still the same age as my daughter.\" Thinking of Gabriella made me falter. I had once worried that she'd become like Nancy, selling her body in order to buy bread. That she'd grown into a fine young woman as innocent and well cared for as any English lady made me shaky with relief. Whatever her mother had done to me, she'd not punished Gabriella.\nNancy lost her smile, came close to me, and put her hand on my shoulder. \"Aw, Captain, I know you're worried about her.\"\n\"It is not that. I have discovered that she is well.\"\nA look of genuine pleasure entered her eyes. \"I'm that glad, Captain. Truly I am.\"\nAs was I. I held on to that thought as I saw Nancy down the stairs and to a hackney waiting at a stand in Bow Street. The coachman leered at me as I gave him coin, no doubt believing I was sending my bit of muslin home. Nancy did not help matters by flinging her arms around me and kissing my cheek as I lifted her up into the coach.\n\"You're a fine gentleman, Captain.\" The coachman cracked his whip and the carriage sprang forward. Nancy stuck her head out of the window. \"Always said so, didn't I?\"\nThe horse's hooves threw sparks in the darkness as the coach skidded around the corner. Black Nancy's laughter floated back at me, more merriment than I'd heard on this street in a long time.\n*** *** ***\nI awoke early next morning after a bad night. Bartholomew drew a bath for me and shaved me while I lay in the cooling water and reviewed my dreams. I'd dreamed of small Gabriella running about camp, her golden hair tangled and her little feet filthy with mud. I'd carried her about on my shoulders, proudly displaying her to all and sundry, until my men had started calling me Lieutenant Nursemaid. I never minded.\nSpeaking with Gabriella yesterday had proved one thing: I still loved her desperately.\nMy morning correspondence included a note from Thompson, who fixed the appointment with the sailor he wanted me to interview for one o'clock. No doubt the man would expect me to buy him dinner.\nJames Denis's coach called for me at nine. The carriage, with its parquetry and velvet cushions, was as opulent as anything Grenville owned, except that no coat of arms reposed on its polished black door.\nI sat in the splendor alone, in my regimentals, which had been brushed and carefully cleaned by Bartholomew. I could have chosen to wear my best frock coat, but for some reason, I'd wanted to remind Carlotta exactly who I was and what I had been most of my life.\nLondon traffic, always thick, seemed particularly difficult this morning. We traveled slowly through Pall Mall to St. James's and waited for a long time while a broken coach in St. James's Street was hauled out of the way, the horses cut from their tangled traces.\nThe tall houses on this street were the abodes of bachelor gentlemen, all likely snoring hard in their bedchambers above. They would not rise until late morning and then saunter to their clubs in early afternoon. The traffic at this moment consisted of servants and workmen and all the people who earned their living catering to the wealthy of St. James's and Mayfair.\nOnce we started again, we rolled past White's, its bow window empty this early, and turned to Piccadilly. The coach rattled past Burlington House and its columned entrance, near which the young man that Brandon had supposedly killed had taken rooms. We turned up Half Moon Street, then to Curzon Street, and traversed its length to number 45.\nMy throat tightened as Denis's footman helped me from the carriage. Denis's house was plain on the outside, its facade betraying nothing of the vast wealth within. The hall inside was like the carriage, unadorned, but obviously costly. He'd left the house in the airy Adams style--white paneling, black accents, marble tile, straight-legged satinwood furniture, the walls hung with expensive and masterful paintings.\nI followed the footman, a former pugilist by the bulk of him, up the stairs and to Denis's study.\nI'd entered this room many times in the last year and a half since I'd had my first appointment with James Denis. As with the floor below, he'd furnished it sparsely, but with elegant furniture--a mahogany desk, bare but for a few sheets of carefully placed paper, a bookcase between the windows, a half-round table holding brandy and cups, two Louis XV chairs in front of the desk for visitors.\nToday, he'd brought in a Turkish sofa as extra seating. As usual, another former pugilist stood near the window.\nMy wife was seated on the sofa, dressed in a well-tailored dress, holding a cup of tea and a saucer. Major Auberge sat next to her, minus the teacup. He'd chosen civilian dress, a plain frock coat and trousers and shoes, nothing of the army about him at all.\nDenis rose from behind his desk. He was nearly as tall as I was, dark-haired and long-faced. Denis was barely in his thirties, but the chill in his blue eyes was that of a much older man. I wondered, not for the first time, what his life had been before this, and what had made him into the ruler of the underworld that he was. He had most of the London magistrates in his pocket with few exceptions. Any criminal who tried to cross him found himself quickly and mercilessly dealt with.\nDenis and I had an uneasy truce, forged after he'd had me trussed up and beaten as a warning not to interfere with him. Since then he'd helped me solve murders, but with the understanding that he wanted me beholden to him for his help. He'd decided to tame me not with violence but with obligation. For this reason, he'd hunted up my wife in France and had her brought over to face me.\n\"Captain,\" he greeted me with a neutral expression. I bowed just as neutrally.\nMy daughter was nowhere in evidence. \"Where is Gabriella?\" I asked Carlotta.\nShe gave me a shocked look. \"We left her behind. We certainly would not bring her here, to discuss this.\"\n\"You left her in a boardinghouse in King Street, alone?\"\nCarlotta shifted. Auberge said in English, his accent thick, \"She is being looked after. Madame Seaton, the landlady, said she would look.\"\nI shot a glance at Denis. He gave me an almost imperceptible nod. \"One of my men is watching the house.\"\nI exhaled, somewhat more relieved. I knew he had a man who watched me and reported my activities, and I knew that his pugilists could keep Gabriella as safe as could be. With girls going missing from Covent Garden, I disliked my daughter being near the place alone. \"Why could you not find them better accommodation?\" I asked Denis.\n\"I did offer to put them in a hotel in Mayfair. They declined, preferring to pay their own way.\"\n\"It is better, I think,\" Auberge put in.\nCarlotta said nothing. She bent her head to drink tea, then halted with the cup at her lips, as though she could not make herself swallow. She ran her tongue across her lower lip and set the teacup aside.\nDenis gestured me to sit. \"Shall we begin?\" He took his chair behind the desk and shifted the papers in front of him.\nI sat down and rested my hands on my walking stick. I noticed Carlotta glance at the stick and then the leg on which I limped. She had been gone long before I received my injury, which was a souvenir of my feud with Aloysius Brandon.\n\"I have consulted with a solicitor at length on this matter,\" Denis began without preamble. \"Separation--divorce a mensa et thoro--is possible, given that there has been, in this case, abandonment and adultery on the part of Mrs. Lacey. But a mensa et thoro is not a dissolving of the marriage. Neither of you could marry again legally with only this sort of separation. And I take it that marrying again is what all parties have in mind?\"\n\"It is,\" Auberge replied stiffly. I said nothing. What I chose to do afterward was not Carlotta's business.\n\"Annulment is the easiest route,\" Denis went on, directing his words at me. \"But unless you can prove that either of you has insanity or that you are too closely related or were married to other parties when you contracted your marriage, there are no grounds. Impotence, another cause for annulment, is also out of the question?\"\nHe looked at me without embarrassment, waiting for me to answer, as though I should not be uncomfortable discussing whether I could perform a man's function.\nI suppose I could make a pretense that Carlotta had left me because I'd become impotent after we'd produced Gabriella, but the fact of impotence would have to be proved. I scarcely wanted to know how I'd produce such proofs, or how I could make certain parts of my anatomy behave, or not behave, in front of a witness.\nI shook my head. \"Out of the question.\"\n\"That leaves a Parliamentary divorce,\" Denis said on. \"You, Lacey, would go through the process of the a mensa et thoro separation, then sue for adultery--bringing to court a case of criminal conversation between your wife and Major Auberge--and then you would request a private Act of Parliament for the complete divorce. This would allow both of you to marry elsewhere.\" He folded his hands. \"A long and, needless to say, expensive process.\"\n\"How expensive?\" Auberge asked worriedly.\n\"Several thousand pounds.\"\nAuberge waited while he translated to French francs, then his ruddy complexion paled. \"I think I have not this money.\"\nDenis minutely straightened a paper. \"I will be happy to furnish the cost of the procedures.\"\nAuberge looked surprised. \"Why would you?\"\nDenis did not answer. \"Are you agreed?\"\nAuberge glanced at me. It seemed unreal, after so many years, to have Carlotta in the same room with me, and for me to at last be able to take my vengeance on her. But the vengeance was flat and stale, like bread left too many days, tasteless and unpalatable.\n\"What must we do?\" I asked Denis.\n\"We go to the Court of Doctors' Commons and begin with the separation. Then we go to the Common Law court with the trial for adultery.\"\nI saw Carlotta wince. A naturally shy woman, the thought of standing in open court while a charge of adultery was read out would be a horrifying experience for her. I could not imagine that Auberge would be any happier with it.\n\"No,\" I said.\nDenis glanced at me. If he felt surprise, nothing showed on his damnably blank face. \"She has had children with this man while still being married to you, so there will be no question of her guilt.\"\nCarlotta's gaze became fixed to the floor.\n\"There must be another way,\" I said. \"Annulment. I will claim to be insane; half of London thinks it anyway.\"\nDenis did not smile. \"You must be proved to be legally insane, in any case. You have said that you are not impotent, nor have you ever been. Perhaps you could find a way to prove that you and she are too closely related?\"\n\"No.\" Carlotta looked up, her face white. \"I know we are not. My father tried to prove that when he discovered I'd married Gabriel. He failed.\"\nI hadn't known that. So, her father had tried to have our marriage annulled? Carlotta had never mentioned this interesting fact. My annoyance stirred, but I made a \"there you have it\" gesture.\n\"Annulment also would mean that any children of your marriage would be declared illegitimate,\" Denis said.\n\"That is out of the question,\" I said quickly.\n\"Another alternative,\" Denis continued in his monotone, \"is to send Mrs. Lacey and Major Auberge back to France, and declare Mrs. Lacey missing and presumed dead. She will live out her life as Madame Auberge and no one will be the wiser.\"\n\"Unless someone, like you, discovers her again,\" I said.\n\"If you and Major Auberge cooperate with me, I could erase any trail to her. Mrs. Lacey would, to the world, be dead. You might even inscribe a headstone,\" he finished, with chill humor, glancing at me.\nThe idea tempted me. To simply send Carlotta away, to tell the world she'd died in France, would be the simplest route, for her and for me.\nUneasiness pricked me. I pictured myself ten years hence, happily married to Donata Breckenridge--that is, if she did not turn me away over this business--and having some busybody announcing to her that the first Mrs. Lacey was still alive and well. I would be arrested as a bigamist, Donata humiliated.\n\"I dislike that solution,\" I said. \"Though I realize it is likely easiest. But there is more here at stake than our marriage.\" I looked at Carlotta. \"I want Gabriella. I do not want her to disappear with you, never to be seen again. I want her to stay in England with me.\"\nCarlotta looked up swiftly. \"No.\"\n\"She is my daughter.\"\nShe gave me a desperate look. \"She is my daughter. I will not let you take her away from me.\"\nMy anger rose. \"You had no qualms taking her away from me. I am her legal guardian, Carlotta, not you. I decide her fate, not you.\"\n\"She does not even know you are her father,\" Carlotta said hotly. \"She believes that Henri is.\"\n\"I gathered that,\" I said. \"It does not matter what you told her, the fact is that I am her father, and by law, you have no right to her.\"\n\"You would take her?\" Carlotta began to cry, tears pooling on her cheeks. \"You would do such a thing? Take her away from her mother and the father she knows and her brothers and sisters?\"\nMy hand closed on my walking stick. \"Of course I do not mean to rip her from the bosom of her family. I am certain she has affection for all of you. But neither do I intend to let you shut her away from me. She is mine, and I claim her. If that means I do have to drag you through every court in England to get her away from you, I will.\"\n\"And I will fight you,\" Auberge said quietly, \"if you do.\"\n\"You have no rights at all,\" I told him. \"You stole my wife and my child, and left me nothing. I find that your threats do not concern me.\"\n\"I was driven away,\" Carlotta choked out.\n\"That does not matter,\" I said. \"I would have let you go, because I know that in the end you hated me. But you should have left Gabriella.\"\n\"Abandon my child?\"\n\"My child,\" I said savagely. \"But you cared nothing for that.\"\nShe balled her fists. \"Was I to leave her to your horrible life following the drum? With mud and filth and sour food and the danger of being massacred at any time? What sort of life was that for a child?\"\n\"I might have given up the army and taken her home to England. But you never gave me the chance.\"\n\"You had no intention of living in England. You hated it. You loved the army. I remember.\"\nI could not argue this point. In England, I had my father's house to return to with my martinet father in it. I would rather submit a child to the dangers of army life than to my father and his insane rages.\n\"Louisa Brandon would have looked after her--gladly,\" I said.\nCarlotta shot me a look of pure hatred. \"Mrs. Brandon. Always Mrs. Brandon.\"\n\"Please,\" Auberge broke in. He looked at me in anguish. \"Please stop.\"\nI closed my mouth in a firm line. Carlotta collapsed back on the sofa, sobbing, her hands pressed to her face.\nDenis had sat through the exchange impassively, watching us without expression. He must have been used to listening to histrionics, especially when called upon to dispense his own form of justice.\n\"I am afraid that Captain Lacey is right,\" he said in his dispassionate tone. \"He is Miss Lacey's legal guardian, no matter what you, Madame and Monsieur, or even Miss Lacey herself, feel about the matter. I am certain we can come to some sort of arrangement after the marriage has been dissolved.\"\nCarlotta continued to cry. Auberge sat like a miserable lump next to her. My heart burned. They had wronged me, but I could not help but let Carlotta's pathos touch me. She had never been a strong woman, and from the look of things, she'd leaned heavily on Auberge throughout the years. Now Auberge was at a loss, and Carlotta could not master herself.\nDenis moved the papers aside again and nodded to his stolid footman, who'd said not a word or moved during the entire encounter. He was no doubt used to histrionics as well.\n\"I will have the solicitor begin the a mensa et thoro proceeding at the very least,\" Denis said. \"You need do nothing for now, Mrs. Lacey, but wait in your boardinghouse for my instruction. I know enough people in the right places to make this as painless as possible.\"\nI had no doubt. He would call in favors all over London from men too terrified of him to disobey.\nAuberge rose. He gently took Carlotta's elbow and pulled her to her feet. \"We will go now. Come.\"\nCarlotta wiped her hand over her face. Her cheeks were smeared with tears, her eyes bright red, her nose swollen. She was not a pretty woman, I realized. What I'd been smitten with as a lad of twenty had been young limbs, a shy smile, and large eyes.\nAuberge, however, looked at her with a tenderness that said he did not care a fig what she looked like. He loved her, doubtless more than I ever had.\nThe footman gestured Auberge and Carlotta out of the room. They went, Carlotta clinging heavily to Auberge's arm. When I tried to follow, the footman blocked my path to the door, which made me know that Denis had instructed him beforehand not to let me leave.\n\"I do not like this,\" I said, once the door had closed behind them. \"And I do not like your offer to foot the bill.\"\nDenis shrugged. \"You want this divorce.\"\n\"You may think nothing of destroying a woman for gain, but I must have compassion for her. If not for Gabriella, I'd turn my back on Carlotta's actions and let her be dead.\" I paused, sighed. \"No, truth to tell, I do not know what I would do. I am sorry, in a way, that you found her.\" That was not true either, because I was gladder than I'd ever been in my life to find Gabriella whole and well.\n\"There is another way,\" Denis began softly, his eyes cool, \"that we have not discussed. One that would make you free with the least amount of fuss.\"\nA chill crept into my bones. He stared back at me, blue eyes impenetrable.\nHe could do it. He could order Carlotta murdered and never turn a hair. He had enough pull in London to hire someone to do it quietly and send Auberge home alone, the magistrates none the wiser.\nI took a step closer to Denis. The footman bent a watchful eye on me, but I ignored him. \"If you harm a hair on Carlotta's head, I will kill you. I do not care how you'd try to stop me; I would do it.\"\nWe shared a look. I saw him assess what I was capable of and make his decision. He did not decide out of fear; he simply decided. \"Very well.\"\nDamn the man. He could coolly stand and contemplate murdering a man's wife as a favor and think nothing of it. Another reason why I could never bring myself to work for James Denis.\nI straightened up and set my walking stick on the floor. \"I would be the first man suspected, in any case.\"\n\"Very likely,\" Denis said, his mouth straight. \"Very well then, Captain. We will begin with the courts.\"\n*** *** ***\nI left Denis's house in a foul mood. I waved away the carriage that waited to take me back to Covent Garden and tramped on foot northward. I could not bring myself to go home and brood. I needed to walk, I needed to think, I needed to talk to someone who would understand.\nNot surprisingly, my footsteps took me up South Audley Street, past the home of Lady Breckenridge, who was no doubt fast asleep--a lady of fashion did not rise before noon--and through Grosvenor Square to the Brandon house in Brook Street.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Six\n\nMy knock was answered by Brandon's very correct butler, Matthews. I knew that the man had once been a corporal in the Thirty-Fifth Light, joining to escape a shady past, and had gotten himself into trouble in the army more than once. When he'd been about to desert, Louisa had rescued him, promising him protection if he reformed his ways. He'd become her devoted servant, taking the post of footman upon their return to London. Domestic service seemed to be his forte, as evidenced by his rapid rise from footman to butler.\nHe peered at me down his once-broken nose, his hauteur genuine but conflicting with his thick body and criminal-class stare. \"Mrs. Brandon is not at home, sir.\"\n\"At eleven in the morning?\" I asked skeptically. \"Is she at Lady Aline's?\"\n\"I beg your pardon, sir. I mean that she is not at home to you.\"\nI blinked. Louisa Brandon had never before instructed her servants to send me away. \"Is she all right?\"\n\"Perfectly fine, sir.\"\nI closed my mouth with a snap and looked him up and down. \"Let me in, Matthews.\"\nHis eyes widened. One eye had been damaged in a fight long ago and was perpetually half-bloodshot. \"And disobey the mistress? Never, sir.\"\n\"Tell her that I forced my way past you, which I will do if you do not stand aside.\"\nLouisa would be furious with Matthews--and me--if he let me in, but at the same time, I was desperate and angry. Mathews had witnessed my famous temper on the Peninsula, and though he probably matched me in strength, he always watched me warily.\nHe deliberately took one step to the side. \"Very well, sir. I will tell madam that I held out manfully.\"\n\"Good.\" I strode past him. As Matthews shut the door and reached for my hat and gloves, I asked, \"Why does she not want to see me?\"\n\"She does not want to speak to anyone in connection with the colonel's recent incarceration, sir. She is most sensitive about it.\"\n\"And where is the colonel?\"\n\"At his club. He, I believe, has decided to bluff it out.\"\nI could imagine. Brandon and I belonged to a fledgling club for cavalry officers in a tavern in St. James's. I pictured him sitting in the taproom with his newspapers, casting his chill blue gaze over anyone who tried to bring up the embarrassment of his brief stay in Newgate. Brandon had a fiery and compelling personality, and if he willed people not to talk about it, they would not.\nI knew where Louisa would be at eleven in the morning. I trudged upstairs to her yellow sitting room, where she liked to take breakfast and go over her correspondence on mornings that her husband was out.\nShe sat on a low sofa, wearing her favorite yellow, a gown of soft muslin. She had not yet dressed her hair, and it hung down her back in a loose golden braid. I'd always thought her lovely, with her crooked nose, wide mouth, and light gray eyes. Those eyes flashed irritation, however, when she beheld me entering, unannounced.\n\"I believe I will have Matthews flogged,\" she said.\n\"I bested him in a fair fight.\" I sat down on a sofa next to hers, tossing my walking stick to the floor. \"Do you deny me your door now?\"\nHer eyes held challenge. \"Am I not allowed a few moments' solitude?\"\n\"How long have we been friends, Louisa?\"\n\"Above twenty years, I believe.\"\n\"Exactly. And have we not shared hardship as well as good times? Have we not helped one another over the worst in our lives?\" I leaned forward. \"Do not shut me out now, Louisa. I need you.\"\n\"I found Black Nancy for you. Was that not enough?\"\n\"Carlotta is in London,\" I said abruptly. \"I've just come from a meeting with her.\"\nLouisa's irritation vanished in an instant. Her face lost color, and her gray eyes grew sharp and hard, like many-faceted diamonds. \"In London? Where?\"\n\"I spoke with her at James Denis's, but she is staying in a boardinghouse in King Street, Covent Garden. Denis brought her here, to facilitate a divorce.\"\n\"Oh.\" Louisa's voice was as hard as her eyes. \"I would like to see her.\"\n\"She has changed,\" I said, trying to keep my voice neutral. \"I believe life in the French countryside agrees with her.\"\nLouisa's mouth flattened. \"She had no right to leave you. I saw what it did to you. She had no right to do that.\"\nHer vehemence startled me. Louisa had been very angry when Carlotta had deserted me, but I had no idea she still clung to the anger. \"I forgave her, Louisa. The leaving of me, I mean. I made her terribly unhappy.\"\n\"Carlotta was a bloody fool. If she'd opened her eyes, she would have seen what a blessing she had in you, what a worthy man you are. But she was always selfish.\" Louisa broke off and held up her hand. \"Do not worry, Gabriel, I will not beg you again to run off with me to Paris. When I asked you that, I was hurt and confused by Aloysius's betrayal. That must have been extremely awkward for you.\"\nHer cheeks were red now. She, after learning of her husband's infidelity, had asked me to take her on a wild liaison to France. I would have been more flattered had I not known she had more wanted to punish her husband than be with me. I had reasoned her out of such a rash action.\n\"You were much agitated,\" I said. \"What happened that day is no reason to bar your door to me now.\"\nShe softened. \"I do hope you did not hurt Matthews.\"\n\"I battered him only metaphorically. I needed to see you.\"\n\"About Carlotta.\" Louisa frowned. \"I truly wish to tell her what I think. What of Gabriella? Where is she?\"\n\"She is here with Carlotta.\" I paused. \"I saw her. Louisa, she is so beautiful.\"\nTears welled in my eyes again, and I saw matching tears in Louisa's. She moved to me and took my hand, and we sat thusly, each of us thinking of Gabriella.\nI loved Louisa, my dearest friend, who'd helped me through every heartache. I knew now that we never would have been happy as husband and wife, or even as lovers, but I thanked God for her friendship.\nShe kissed the top of my head and sat back down, drawing out her handkerchief and wiping her eyes. \"We are a pair of boobies,\" she said, sniffling. \"Nancy told me you'd said you knew Gabriella was safe, but I thought you referred to the information Mr. Denis had given you this spring.\"\n\"Gabriella is well and safe, and a father could not be more proud of a child.\" I retrieved my own handkerchief, mopped up the damage, and stuffed the cloth back into my pocket. \"My task now is to decide what to do about Carlotta.\"\nI outlined everything Denis had told me. \"I dislike his hand in this. His solutions to problems are to cut ruthlessly to the quick, no matter who he harms in the process.\"\nBy the firm lines around Louisa's mouth, I knew she shared Denis's opinion. \"Why be gentle with Carlotta?\" she asked. \"She certainly was not to you. Divorce her and be done.\"\n\"The scandal will taint me as well as her.\"\nLouisa waved this away. \"She will return to France and be Colette Auberge. No one in her French village will worry about the divorce of Captain and Mrs. Lacey in faraway London. You are protected by the reputation of Grenville--if he says you are in, you are in. You could stand on Piccadilly in your shirtsleeves and chuck bricks at passersby, and still society would fawn on you because you are Grenville's favorite. Likewise, Lady Breckenridge and her family are quite powerful. No one will dare shun her for favoring you.\"\n\"Possibly not,\" I said.\n\"Take Carlotta to court, Lacey. She deserves it.\"\n\"You have become vindictive.\"\n\"Well, when my innocent husband can be accused of murder, why should a woman guilty of adultery be let free?\"\nI thought I understood. This spring, a woman with whom Colonel Brandon had confessed to having an affair had dragged him firmly into the murder in Berkeley Square. Louisa had not forgiven the woman for that or for the affair, and she likely had not yet forgiven Brandon. Louisa was extending this anger to Carlotta, another woman who'd broken a marriage.\n\"I wish I were as vindictive,\" I said. \"It would give me a plain path. As it is, I do not know which direction to take. I came here for your clearheaded thinking.\"\n\"About this, I cannot be clearheaded. I do not know what you will think of me, but I am afraid I wish Carlotta to suffer a little.\" Louisa paused, softening. \"Might I see Gabriella?\"\n\"Of course you may. I have an appointment this afternoon to interview a sailor from Wapping, but after that, I will be free. Come to Grimpen Lane this evening, and I will take you to Gabriella.\"\n\"Carlotta will not permit it,\" she predicted darkly.\n\"As I reminded Carlotta not an hour ago, I am Gabriella's legal guardian. She will permit what I say she will permit.\"\nLouisa sent me an odd look. She opened her mouth then shook her head, as though she'd been prepared to say something and thought better of it. \"I am sorry I cannot help you on the matter of Carlotta.\"\n\"There are no simple answers. That is not your fault.\" I squeezed her hand, then got to my feet. \"Is Black Nancy here? She wants to meet the sailor and quiz him about his lost ladybird.\"\n\"She is downstairs.\" Louisa rose and rang a bell. \"I quite enjoy having her here. She is an excellent conversationalist. Very diverting.\"\n\"She said the same about you. I do apologize for bursting in and burdening you with my problems. I seem to always be doing so.\"\n\"We are friends, Gabriel,\" she answered. \"Naturally, we seek one another when we are troubled. I hope that it may always be so.\"\nShe smiled a little, and I was pleased that she'd decided to put her embarrassment over our encounters during the Berkeley Square matter behind us. Perhaps anger at Carlotta and joy at Gabriella's return would unite us again.\nLouisa sent the footman who responded to the bell to fetch Nancy then accompanied me down the stairs, her hand tucked through my arm. We reached the ground floor to see Matthews pull open the front door as a carriage rolled to a stop before it. A footman sprang to open the coach, and Colonel Brandon descended and strode into the house.\nColonel Aloysius Brandon had black hair, graying at the temples, keen blue eyes, a trim physique, and a brusque manner. He had been a competent commander, earning respect as well as rank. He had gotten me my first commission, which I hadn't been able to afford to purchase, by knowing the right men and pulling in favors and possibly using outright bribery. He'd helped me up the ladder in the army, although I'd moved no further than captain. Beyond that I truly did need influence and wealth, and generals did not always appreciate my forthright manner and frank opinions. My own fault, but I'd never learned to scrape and bow.\nBrandon stopped as Louisa and I came off the last stair, and he directed his words at me. \"What are you doing here?\"\nI inclined my head. \"I am well, thank you.\"\nHe transferred his blue glare to his wife. \"I thought you said you were not allowing him the house.\"\n\"I pummeled my way past your butler,\" I said, not really in the mood to spar with Brandon. \"But I am leaving.\"\nI took my hat and gloves from the footman, noting that Matthews had made himself scarce. Black Nancy came from the back of the house just then.\n\"Ee, Captain, don't you look fine, all in your blue and silver.\" She took my arm. \"Me pals will be pea green when they see me with you.\"\nBrandon scowled at her. Despite his own indiscretions, he did not approve of Louisa's strays, especially not game girls. He said nothing, only turned his back on us all and ascended the stairs.\n*** *** ***\nLouisa insisted that her own coach take us back to Covent Garden. Nancy rode in it like a queen, staring regally out the window, pretending to be a lady of fashion. She looked down her snub nose at me and drawled nonsense in a ridiculous parody of an upper-class accent. At least her antics made me laugh, and I felt a little better.\nI decided to think over my choices concerning Carlotta and come to a decision about what best to do. I would consult Grenville--a true neutral party. He could put his fingertips together and narrow his eyes and examine the problem objectively. He also had solicitors at his beck and call who might find another solution than a public divorce. I did not necessarily have to use James Denis entirely in this matter.\nI bade the coachman put us down in Maiden Lane, in front of the Rearing Pony. We'd arrived a little before time, and I saw no sailing man awaiting us. I recognized the regulars, who nodded at me. The rest of the room was filled with reedy clerks or drovers stopping for a nourishing pint of ale.\nThey all rather stared when I led Nancy to an inglenook and slid into its more private benches. The landlord's wife, Anne Tolliver, brought us overflowing glasses of ale, cast a curious look at Nancy, flashed a smile at me, and departed.\n\"She fancies yer,\" Nancy said. She took a deep, satisfying pull of ale and licked the foam from her lips.\n\"She fancies every gentleman who gives her a an extra coin.\"\n\"Naw. She don't give a smile like that to the others.\" Nancy grinned at my discomfiture and took another drink of ale. \"What's your lady like?\"\n\"Very posh,\" I said. \"She's a viscountess.\"\n\"Oo-er,\" Nancy said, exaggerating the exclamation. \"I know that. Mrs. Brandon told me. A widow, very handsome, very la-di-da, and quite taken with you. But I mean, what is she like? Is she all smiles and laughs and a good heart, or is she cold and snobby?\"\n\"Neither. She speaks her mind, but she is kind, in her way.\"\nNancy looked doubtful. \"Sounds peachy. What will she think of you sitting here slurping ale with a game girl?\"\n\"Oh, I am certain she will have plenty to say about it. But she knows that you are helping me with an investigation. She wants to help as well.\"\nNancy grinned. \"Well, then, perhaps I'll look her up, and we'll talk all about it.\"\nI imagined an encounter between Lady Breckenridge and Black Nancy. \"Perhaps you will not.\"\n\"Maybe not. But I like to tease yer.\" She glanced up. \"I think that's your sailor, Captain.\"\nA short, rather square man had come into the tavern and stood looking around uncertainly. I rose and beckoned, and he, seeing me, made his way to the inglenook. He was bowlegged and walked like a man expecting a ship to roll under him at any moment.\nI realized when he neared us that he was not very old, perhaps in his midtwenties, although his weather-beaten face made him look older. His blue eyes held an air of worry, and he greeted me with an awkward bow.\n\"Mr. Thompson tol' me I should speak to yer, sir.\"\nI signaled Anne to bring another ale. I bade the man sit down, then Nancy and I took the bench across from him. He watched us with a blank expression until Anne set a tankard in front of him. He lifted the tankard, set the rim to his lips, and poured at least a third of its contents down his throat.\n\"Thank ye,\" he said, wiping his mouth. \"'Twas a thirsty journey from Wapping Stairs.\"\n\"I thank you for making it,\" I began. \"Mr. Thompson said you were very worried about your young lady. Tell me why you should be so.\"\n\"Because it ain't like her.\" He shot me a belligerent look, as though daring me to disbelieve him. \"She wouldn't walk out and not tell me or me landlady. She'd 'uv sent some word to me.\"\n\"When did anyone last see her?\" I asked.\n\"Week ago come tomorrow. She were there when I woke up in the morning. Went out at four. Never seen her since.\"\n\"She came to Covent Garden, to meet someone, Thompson tells me,\" I said.\nThe man nodded. \"Said she had something special. Said she'd make a few guineas from it. Said she'd bring them back to me.\" He swallowed. \"But she ain't come back.\"\nNancy leaned forward, her bosom resting on the table. \"What do you do with the money she usually brings you?\"\nThe sailor glanced at me, blue eyes troubled. He had a blue-black tattoo on the inside of his arm, an intricate pattern that looked oriental. I nodded at him to answer the question.\n\"Goes to housekeeping, don't it? Me wages and hers, we buy the bread and our bed. Our landlady ain't much, but she leaves us be.\"\n\"But she's a game girl, you know that,\" Nancy went on. \"Means she goes with blokes what fancy her for an hour.\"\n\"Only thing my Mary knows how to do,\" the sailor said reasonably. \"But she always comes home to me.\"\nNancy nodded as though satisfied. \"I don't think he did her in, Captain. And maybe she liked him well enough.\"\nChester scowled at her. \"'Course she did. My Mary, she's always waiting for me when I sail in, and there to send me off again.\"\nI held up my hand. \"We believe you, sir. What is her name? Mary--\"\n\"Chester, sir. I'm Sam Chester.\"\n\"She is married to you?\"\n\"In a manner of speaking. That's the name we give the landlady, and I don't know no other. She were with another sailor when I came home three year ago, and she didn't like him. But he wouldn't let her go. So I said, if I win at dice, she's mine. And I won. She been with me since. I only ever knew her as Mary.\"\n\"Very well. What does she look like?\"\nHope sparkled in his eyes. \"You'll look for her?\"\nI nodded. \"I will try. She is not the only girl who's gone missing.\"\n\"That's what Mr. Thompson said. Magistrate didn't believe there were anything wrong in Mary's going, but Mr. Thompson said he knew a chap what could find her if anyone could.\"\nI pushed my ale glass aside. \"I am pleased he has such faith in me.\"\n\"Mary's a bit of a thing, on the plump side,\" Sam said. \"Has yellow hair, but she dyes it and it don't look very good. I like it brown, like natural, but she says it has to be yellow.\" He thought a moment. \"Brown eyes, big smile.\" He stopped, his voice faltering. \"Such a pretty thing.\"\nI glanced at Nancy to let the man recover himself. She shook her head. \"I don't know her, but I never get to Wapping. But one of the girls at Covent Garden might 'a seen her. I can ask.\"\n\"Why should you want to help?\" Chester looked at me in sudden worry. \"You ain't the Watch, are you? Wanting to haul Mary off for trying to make a bit o' coin?\"\n\"I am not the Watch, Mr. Chester. I simply don't like to see girls hurt.\"\nNancy ran her hand up my blue-coated biceps. \"He looks after us.\"\nI slanted her a look, and she grinned back at me. Chester obviously didn't know what to make of this teasing, and he sagged against the bench. \"Thank ye, sir. I've been so worried.\"\nI asked for another ale for Chester, which he drank gratefully. I pressed him with questions, but he did not have much more to tell us. Mary Chester's habit was to leave the house at five or six in the evening, prowl around Wapping getting what customers she could, and return home around midnight to share a meal and a bed with Sam.\nThe only thing Mary had done differently the day she'd disappeared was to leave earlier than usual to make her way to Covent Garden. Sam did not know the name of the man she'd gone there to meet, or what he looked like, or when she'd met him. Sam had questioned her friends in Wapping but found no answers. The girls had not known; Mary had not told them much except that she'd met a gentleman who could give her a pile of money.\nI asked Sam where I could send word to him, and he gave me a direction of a boardinghouse near Wapping Stairs, not far from the magistrate's house where Thompson did his work. Sam said he would be staying in London for now, though he might be shipping out on a merchantman in two weeks' time. I told him I hoped I would know something by then.\nThe three of us left the tavern together. I sent Sam off a good deal more hopeful than when he'd come, though I was not sanguine myself. Finding a lost girl in London was like finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. I did have several ideas about where to start looking, however, and having Black Nancy here would be a help, as well.\n\"Poor gent,\" Nancy said as we watched him weave his way along Maiden Lane toward Southampton Street, which would take him to the Strand. \"I did meet up with a girl last night who might can help us. The hackney driver didn't want to stop, but I made him. You take your time walking home, and I'll run fetch her.\"\nBefore I could object, Nancy ran away down Maiden Lane toward Bedford Street, the opposite direction from Chester. I saw her black head bobbing along through the crowd, and then she was gone.\nI made my way after her slowly, turning north when I reached Bedford Street and then walked the length of Henrietta Street back toward Covent Garden. I was very much aware that on the other side of the church lay the house in King Street where Gabriella stayed. I made my feet continue to Covent Garden to find Black Nancy.\nWhen I reached the square, it was at the height of its activity. A mass of humanity thronged the market stalls to buy fruit or flowers, hens or milk, gewgaws or whatever else the vendors were selling. The shops ringing the square were likewise full: middleclass young ladies and their mothers shopping shoulder-to-shoulder with unwashed working-class women with coarse hands and weathered faces. Young male servants swarmed about trying to purchase their masters' dinners, hucksters sidled to passersby trying to entice coins from them, and vendors called out, desperately trying to pitch their voices above those of their rivals.\nThe sun shone hot and sweat dripped freely from faces young and old, thin and round, ruddy and pale. A water seller did a fair business letting passersby refresh themselves with a dipper of well water from his bucket. A man selling cool ale in the shade of a brick building also plied a good trade.\nI searched the crowd for Nancy, wishing she'd waited for me. She was nimble and young and I had no wish to tramp all over Covent Garden searching for her. I smiled a gentle refusal at an orange seller, then made my way across the south side of the square, heading for Russel Street.\nI spied Nancy in the shadows of the back of a stall halfway along the square. She waved when I saw her, and I made my way to her, dodging a maid carrying two squawking ducks by their feet.\nAnother girl stood with Nancy. Her skin was the color of cream-laden coffee, and her hair, shiny black, cascaded from under a broad-brimmed hat in a riot of fantastic curls. She'd dressed herself in an emerald green, high-waisted gown, and wore a hat with a long green feather.\nAs I neared, both of them grinned at me, the black-skinned girl with a gap in her teeth that was very fetching. She had chocolate-colored eyes that skimmed up and down my body, a narrow face, high cheekbones, and arched brows. Her smile widened when I bowed to her, and she dropped into the perfect imitation of a fashionable lady's curtsy.\n\"This is Felicity,\" Nancy said. \"A fine lady and a fair friend. This is him, Felicity.\"\nFelicity looked me up and down, again with a bold gaze that made me want to blush. \"I've seen him about,\" she said. \"You are right, Nance. He is a fine one.\"\nI was used to the game girls and their teasing banter, but Felicity's gaze seemed to burn. She was a little older than Nancy, perhaps twenty, and her greater experience showed in her eyes. She knew about men's desires and how to stir them.\nBlack-skinned girls were common in London. Some came to England from Jamaica as slaves, freed when they arrives; or they worked their way over as free women; or they were the daughters of former Jamaican slaves. They became servants if they were lucky, and if they were unlucky, they plied Felicity's trade. Black mistresses were quite sought after, and a clever girl could become a rich man's paramour.\nGrenville had once had such a mistress--Cleopatra, she was called--whose origins had been obscure. I'd never met her, she and Grenville having parted ways before he'd befriended me, but apparently, she'd taken London by storm. She'd gone from Grenville to the Prince Regent and then married a country squire with whom she'd fallen in love. Grenville apparently had assisted in pulling off that wedding, and he claimed she now lived in wedded bliss surrounded by fat children.\nFelicity, on the other hand, would likely remain on the streets unless she happened to catch a wealthy man's eye. That is, if she were not unfortunate enough to be abducted and transported to the West Indies. It happened from time to time that a person wanting to make quick money kidnapped free black women and boys to sell to plantation holders in Jamaica and Antigua. This was highly illegal, but it still went on. My reforming friend, Sir Gideon Derwent, wanted to stop this deplorable practice, and it had slowed, but they still had much to fight.\n\"At your service, madam,\" I said to Felicity.\n\"Don't I wish,\" Felicity answered, her smile brash.\n\"Felicity never saw the yellow-haired wench,\" Nancy said. \"But she might a' seen the other one. Name of Black Bess.\"\nFelicity folded her hands across the sash that hugged her bosom, a fair imitation of a debutante at her first ball. \"Black Bess is rather a friend of mine. Haven't seen her in a while, and her lad's been around looking for her. I thought maybe she'd taken up with a protector, but Nance says maybe not.\"\nFelicity spoke with a more cultured accent than Nancy's, as though someone had taught her middleclass English, or she'd carefully learned it herself. There was nothing to say, however, that Felicity was not a middleclass girl in truth. White fathers bore children with their black servants, sometimes raising the sons and daughters alongside their legitimate children. Felicity's father could have come from any background from small farmer to royalty.\n\"No,\" I said. \"Pomeroy thinks she might have been kidnapped.\"\n\"Pomeroy the Runner?\" Felicity asked, suddenly alert. \"That's interesting, Captain. Last time I saw Black Bess, she was in the company of Pomeroy of Bow Street. And they weren't simply having a chat, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Seven\n\n\"Well,\" Nancy said, eyes bright. \"Ain't that a turn up?\"\nIt was indeed. Pomeroy had neglected to mention this fact. \"How long ago was this?\"\nFelicity shrugged. \"Week and a half, I'd say. Bess liked to turn Mr. Pomeroy up sweet, so that he wouldn't take her in. She let him kiss her if he liked, no coins changing hands. Last time I saw her, in fact, she was there.\" Felicity pointed to a small gap between stalls in the middle of the square. \"It was late and dark, and she was with him, laughing in her way. Couple of days later, Bess's man comes through Covent Garden, looking worried. But I hadn't seen her since then.\"\nI would definitely have to speak again to my former sergeant. \"Are you certain the man with her was Pomeroy?\"\n\"No mistaking the Runner, Captain. Tall and big man, bright yellow hair, laughs like 'haw haw haw.'\"\nHer mimicry of Pomeroy's bellowing laugh was so exact that I couldn't help smiling. \"Where does Black Bess live? With her lover?\"\n\"She and her Tom have rooms in a passage between Drury Lane and Great Wild Street. Not much, but clean, and their landlady doesn't cheat them.\"\n\"Is he still there?\" I asked.\n\"Likely. I'll take you if you wish.\"\n\"I do wish,\" I said. I wondered why the devil Pomeroy hadn't mentioned that he'd known Bess, although he might not have wanted to admit such knowledge in front of Thompson.\n\"Tom won't be there now,\" Felicity said. \"He labors for a builder, moving bricks and such. Tonight, you come here, and me and Nance will take you down.\"\nNancy grinned her compliance. I was not certain Louisa would be pleased at Nancy lingering in Covent Garden until dark, but I did need her help.\n\"I'll see you home, then,\" I said to Felicity, \"and meet you later.\"\nFelicity's grin widened. \"I can take care of myself, Captain. Have done so for ten years.\"\n\"If young women are disappearing from Covent Garden, I do not want to risk you disappearing yourself, especially now that you've offered to help me.\"\n\"Told you he were a gentleman,\" Nancy said, giving me a wink.\nThey laughed at me, but my concern was genuine. No one cared much for prostitutes who plied for trade in the streets. Rich men's courtesans and women like Marianne fared better, but even so, when gentlemen no longer had interest in them, they had nowhere to go, unless they'd been prudent with the money their protectors had given them. Even the much-celebrated Lady Hamilton, mistress of Lord Nelson, had lived in near poverty after Nelson died, waiting for the pension Nelson had asked be given her, which never came.\nI pondered where to take them. Mrs. Beltan would never forgive me for bringing game girls to my rooms. Likewise, having them sit in her shop, with its respectable clientele, would also be out of the question.\n\"Well,\" I began, but Nancy was staring in a puzzled way at some commotion behind me, and I turned to see what she looked at.\nA young woman hurried through the crowd, pushing people this way and that, blindly running, earning curses from men and women alike. One matron caught her arm, shouting at her to watch her manners, but the girl twisted away and continued her journey.\nWithout a word, I left Felicity and Nance and pushed my own way through the market. With my longer stride and more forceful nature, I managed to move in front of the young woman and halt directly in her path.\nGabriella was sobbing. Her red face ran with tears, and her eyes were screwed shut. She tried to push past me, but I remained solidly in front of her, and she had to open her eyes and see who was in her way.\n\"No, not you,\" she cried. \"I do not want to see you.\"\n\"Gabriella.\" I caught her elbow as she tried to sway away from me. \"You cannot run pell-mell through Covent Garden market. Come with me. I will find you coffee.\"\n\"I do not want to go with you.\"\nHer vehemence drew attention. Fortunately, I was well-known in the market, and no one made to dash off for the Watch.\n\"Stop,\" I said sternly. \"Do not make a scene. Come with me and tell me what is the matter.\"\nShe seemed to realize she could not fight me, not in the crowd. She jerked from my grasp, but allowed me to lead her to Russel Street, and from there, while she wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand, to the bakery below my rooms in Grimpen Lane.\nMrs. Beltan raised her brows high when I pulled Gabriella inside, her hair straggling and her face swollen with weeping. I handed Gabriella my handkerchief, sat her down at on a bench in the empty shop, and asked Mrs. Beltan for coffee.\nShe brought it, still staring curiously at Gabriella. But Gabriella could not be mistaken for anything but a respectable miss, and Mrs. Beltan said nothing.\n\"What has happened?\" I asked gently, once Mrs. Beltan and her assistant had returned to the kitchen.\nGabriella glared at me with red-rimmed eyes. I pushed the mug of coffee toward her, but she ignored it. \"My mother told me that you were my father,\" she said, her words filled with rage.\nI drew a long breath. \"Oh.\"\n\"She did not mean to tell me. She and my father . . .\" Gabriella faltered on the word, tears welling from her eyes and running silently down her face.\nI sat still, wondering how to proceed. I wanted her to know the truth, but truth was a delicate thing. One wrong word, and I could shatter anything I wanted to build with her. \"I spoke with your mother and Major Auberge this morning,\" I said. \"Were they discussing that?\"\n\"Yes.\" She bit off the word. \"They did not know that I could hear them. But I wanted to hear them. I asked them what they meant about divorce and you wanting me with you. And so they explained.\" Gabriella balled her hands and stared at me in fury. \"It is a lie. It must be a lie.\"\n\"I married your mother twenty-one years ago,\" I said slowly. \"You were born four years later, in India. Carlotta Lacey is still married to me.\"\n\"That cannot be.\" Gabrielle stared at me as though she'd hoped I'd laugh and agree that her parents and I had decided to play a cruel trick on her.\n\"I regret that she never told you,\" I said. \"I regret so many things, believe me, Gabriella.\"\n\"Stop calling me by my Christian name.\"\n\"You were named for me.\"\nFresh tears ran down her face. \"Stop. Please.\"\nI closed my mouth, mostly because I had no idea what to say. I wanted Gabriella back, I wanted her to know about me, but it hurt me to watch her hurting. My anger grew at Carlotta, and also Auberge, for keeping the truth from her too long.\nGabriella cried silently for a time, and then sat still, as though too exhausted to rise and leave the shop. The coffee cooled, untouched between us.\nTwo customers came in, plump matrons in mobcaps with a maid listlessly trailing them. Mrs. Beltan bustled out to serve them. I leaned to Gabriella. \"Come upstairs and talk to me.\"\nShe nodded, not because she wanted to particularly, but because the two ladies and Mrs. Beltan were throwing curious glances at her. She pushed her loosened hair out of her face and followed me out, her breathing uneven.\nI opened the door next to the bakery and took Gabriella up the stairs to my rooms. I wished I could take her to better accommodation, but she did not seem to notice the faded paint and the shabby surroundings.\nBartholomew was sprawled on the straight-backed chair in my sitting room, polishing a boot and reading a newspaper spread on my writing table at the same time. He glanced up when I came in, closed the paper, and jumped to his feet. \"Afternoon, sir.\" He caught sight of Gabriella and stopped in surprise.\n\"Bartholomew, go and fetch us some dinner. Not from the Gull, bring us some good bread and perhaps fruit and a decent cut of beef. And wine, not ale.\"\n\"Right you are, sir.\" Bartholomew set the boots by my bedchamber door and departed. Gabriella remained in the middle of the room, staring about her as though she did not know what to do. I suspected she did not yet want to return to her parents, but at the same time, she did not wish to remain with me.\n\"Some food in you will help.\" I gestured to the wing chair. \"Please, sit down.\"\nGabriella might have been furious and confused, but she was still a gently bred miss, trained to obey her elders. She sat gingerly on the chair, resting her hands in her lap.\nI wet a handkerchief in the basin in my bedroom and brought it to her. \"Wipe your face.\"\nSniffling, Gabriella took the cloth and dabbed her eyes. Then she unfolded it, pressed it to her face, and inhaled a long breath.\n\"I am truly sorry you had to find out like this,\" I said. \"You were born after your mother and I tried to have a child several times. Nothing happened for the first few years, and then at last, we had you. I was pleased and proud of you; you were such a lovely thing. A year later, the Thirty-Fifth Light Dragoons, my regiment, left India for England. We were to train in Sussex, in case we were needed in the war with France, which was heating up on the seas. Then came the peace of Amiens, and we went to France with the Brandons, ostensibly as part of the party negotiating the peace between France and England.\" I smiled. \"Really, I think Louisa and your mother had a hankering to see Paris and insisted we go. Colonel Brandon and I obliged. There, your mother met Major Auberge and eloped with him. I had not seen you nor your mother from that day until yesterday morning, when I came upon you in Covent Garden. We never properly divorced, and your mother and Auberge never properly married.\"\nGabriella did not move during this lecture, breathing deeply behind the handkerchief, shaking once in a while as her body wound down. Quiet filled the room, punctuated only by the slam of a door below and the shrill voices of the matrons as they left the shop, one snapping at the maid to stop lagging.\nAt last, Gabriella lowered the handkerchief. She delicately wiped the hollows under her eyes, her eyelashes still wet. \"So he is not really my father.\"\nI realized that she was grieving. She was losing the man she'd always believed had sired her, the man who'd raised her and looked after her, who'd kissed her goodnight and paid her dressmaker's bills when she grew older and bought her little gifts when the whim took him.\nAuberge had done all the things I should have done. \"No,\" I said. \"Do you love him?\"\nShe gave me a fierce look. \"Of course. He is my papa.\"\n\"I never want to take that away from you, I promise you, Gabriella.\"\n\"Then what do you want? You sent for us. Mama said so.\"\n\"Not exactly. Mr. Denis did, although I did not tell him to do so. He knew I wanted to find you, and he brought you here.\"\n\"Why?\" Gabriella balled the handkerchief in her hands, her anger erasing her compliance. \"If you are my father, why have I not seen you all these years? Why did you let me grow up believing I was French, believing that my papa was my papa, that they were married to one another? Why did you never write me a letter?\" She met my gaze with a furious one. \"Why did you never come for me if you are truly my father?\"\n\"I never had the chance,\" I said as patiently as I could. \"I did not have the income to make a thorough search for you, and for much of the time, England was at war with France. I spent years on the Peninsula, up to my neck in mud and dust, fighting. When it was over, I was still too poor to try to find you, and I had thought it hopeless.\"\n\"You ought to have tried.\"\n\"I know.\" I looked at her limply. \"I know, Gabriella. It hurt me so much when Carlotta took you away from me. I have never recovered from it. You do not know how much it hurt to lose you.\"\n\"That was a long time ago. I am not a child any longer.\"\n\"You are the same.\" I studied her mussed golden brown hair, her soft dark eyes, the nose and cheekbones that were pure Lacey. \"You used to hug my boot, and I'd walk with you clinging to it, and make you laugh. You kissed me good night when your mother put you to bed. You used to sit on my lap and pull at the braid on my uniform.\" I touched the silver cords that crisscrossed my deep blue jacket. \"When you were ill or restless, I carried you about all night so you would not cry.\"\nHer hands tightened. \"I do not remember.\"\n\"I know. But I remember.\"\nGabriella drew a breath. \"It is not the same thing. You know nothing about me.\"\n\"I want to know about you.\" I leaned forward, put my hand on her clenched ones. \"I want to learn all about you. I want you to learn all about me. You are my daughter.\"\n\"I do not want to be your daughter.\"\nHer answer cut me to the heart, but I did not give up hope. She was upset now, but when she grew used to the idea, she would accept the situation.\nDeep down, I knew I was being a bloody fool, but I so wanted her that I would make myself believe anything.\n\"But I want to be your father,\" I said. \"I wish you to stay here with me for a time, so that we can learn about each other. I want to show you London, take you to Egyptian house and the theatre and the menagerie at Exeter 'Change. I have a friend who has traveled the world, and his house is filled with amazing curiosities. He would be happy to show them off to you. He likes an audience.\"\nI tried to smile, but Gabriella gave me an appalled stare. \"Stay with you?\"\n\"Not here, of course.\" I glanced at the arched ceiling, from which flakes of plaster were wont to fall if the door was slammed too hard. \"I will look for larger rooms in a better house. You would need a chamber of your own in any case.\"\n\"I will not stay with you,\" she said quickly. \"I am returning to France with my mother and father.\"\nI shifted. \"I'd like you to remain here. Not for long, a few months only. The summer perhaps. I have another friend, a viscountess, who has invited me to her country estate this summer. I imagine it is quite fine. Apparently people come for miles to pay a shilling to see the gardens.\"\nI hoped she would smile, but she only sat silently, digesting the information. I had seen the same look on the faces of soldiers on the Peninsula upon learning that the surgeon would have to saw off one of their limbs.\n\"I do not want to stay,\" she said.\nI exhaled slowly, trying to keep my patience. What had I expected, that Gabriella would brighten with joy and eagerly drag me out to look for rooms of our own? She was angry and confused, and she had decided to direct the anger at me.\n\"Gabriella, losing you nearly killed me. It left an emptiness in me that has never gone away. Please, let me know you.\"\nA flicker of surprise crossed her features. In her anger, she probably had not realized that the situation caused me pain as well.\nShe spoke haltingly, as though choosing her words with care. \"I have always been obedient as a daughter. I have always done what my mama and papa have asked me.\" She hesitated, her eyes darting sideways, and I almost wanted to smile. If Gabriella was anything like me, she'd have learned how to evade obeying when it suited her. \"Will they ask me to do this as well?\"\nI had to shake my head. \"Carlotta does not want you even to speak to me. I am sure Auberge does not either.\"\n\"But you will ask it.\"\nI could force Carlotta to let me have her if I wished, but I hardly thought Gabriella wanted to hear that I could do that. \"I do ask it.\"\n\"I must say no.\"\nI fell silent. I did not want to tell her that I could simply not let her make the choice. In any case, she would be in London for a time while I sorted out what to do about divorcing Carlotta. I could use the time to persuade her to stay with me. As much as I chafed, I sensed that forcing her now would do me no good.\nBartholomew opened the door and came in briskly, not looking at us. I wondered whether he'd waited outside the door for our voices to die down before interrupting. He banged a tray to the writing table.\n\"Best bread I could find, sir, courtesy of Mrs. Beltan, and sweet butter to go with it. Roast from the Pony and some potatoes Mrs. Tolliver said were best of the barrel today.\"\nSo saying, he clattered the plates onto the table and forks and a sharp knife beside each one, all borrowed from the Rearing Pony. At the smell of the roasted meat and fresh-baked bread, Gabriella lifted her head and gazed at the repast with the hunger of a young girl.\n\"Eat until you feel better,\" I said. \"And then I'll take you back to King Street.\"\nGabriella reached for the hunk of bread Bartholomew had dropped on her plate and lifted the knife to smear it with butter. \"No need,\" she said. \"I will go by myself.\"\n\"Best not, miss,\" Bartholomew broke in. \"Covent Garden's not the place for a lone young lady. Pickpockets at best. Robbers and procuresses at worst. Very unscrupulous ladies and gentlemen they are.\"\nGabriella nodded, as though heeding his wisdom, and began chewing the bread. Bartholomew poured a glass of wine for me and lemonade he'd brought from Mrs. Tolliver for Gabriella.\nI, too, was hungry after our emotion and fell to eating. The two of us dropped the subject while we consumed the beef and bread and potatoes, and Bartholomew bustled about cleaning the place, humming a buzzing tune in his throat.\n\"By the bye, sir,\" he said presently. \"Mr. Grenville sent word around with my brother asking would you please call on him. If it is not too inconvenient, he says, and if you can bother to remember.\"\nBartholomew's neutral tone betrayed none of Grenville's sarcasm, but I knew it had been there.\n\"Mr. Grenville is not gifted with patience,\" I said.\n\"No, sir. But he's interested in this new problem.\" Bartholomew grinned at Gabriella. \"The captain solves crimes, miss. Him and Mr. Grenville. Better than Bow Street Runners.\"\nGabriella eyed Bartholomew in curiosity, her eyes still red with weeping. \"What is a Bow Street Runner?\"\n\"Only the best in crime investigators in England,\" Bartholomew answered. \"But Mr. Grenville and Captain Lacey, they've uncovered criminals when the Runners and the magistrates were baffled. They've solved murders and kidnappings and fraudulent activities. I was shot once.\"\nHe spoke proudly. Whether he was trying to bolster my standing in front of Gabriella or boast of his own accomplishments, I could not tell.\n\"Were you?\" Gabriella asked with flattering interest.\n\"There.\" Bartholomew pointed to his thick leg. \"And there,\" pointing to his left biceps. \"Laid me low a long time. But we got the murderer. Crazy devil, he was.\"\nShe flicked her gaze back to me, as though reassessing me. \"Why do you catch criminals?\"\n\"To help people,\" I said, sawing at my beefsteak. \"Most were crimes that the magistrates ignored or did not know about.\"\n\"Bow Street's calling him in now, to help them,\" Bartholomew said.\n\"Oh?\"\n\"Some young--ah--ladies have gone missing from Covent Garden,\" he went on. \"That's why it ain't a good place to go walking alone.\"\n\"I see.\" Gabriella looked at me again. \"How will you find them?\"\nI shrugged, relieved we'd found a neutral topic, one not charged with drama. \"I am speaking to others who knew them. Once I know their daily habits, I will follow what they did until I find more people who saw them. Then I will simply look everywhere.\"\nGabriella sipped her lemonade and carefully set the glass back on the table. \"Why should you? I mean, why should you dash about London, when you have an injury, to find these young ladies? They are not respectable ladies, are they?\" She'd been intelligent enough to discern that.\n\"They do not deserve to be hurt or lost,\" I said. \"I dislike seeing anyone abused.\"\n\"He is a friend to the downtrodden,\" Bartholomew put in.\n\"All right, Bartholomew. You may cease now.\"\nBartholomew grinned. \"He is that humble; he don't like to be praised.\"\n\"Enough,\" I said.\nBartholomew subsided, but his grin did not diminish. Gabriella, on the other hand, continued to study me as she finished her food, as though I'd suddenly become a human being, much to her surprise. She ate with good manners, using the knife in the French way to push things onto her fork.\nShe finished quietly and seemed to wait for my direction. She was not happy, but she was resigned and likely tired from her outburst.\nLeaving the remains of our repast, I took Gabriella back downstairs, out along Grimpen Lane, and through Covent Garden toward King Street.\nEvening was approaching, although with summer, daylight could linger until well past ten o'clock. Stalls were closing, and maids and cooks hurried to buy the last vegetables for supper. Flower sellers, their posies wilting, lingered, determined to make as many pennies as they could before returning home. The square was littered with lettuce leaves, squashed cherries and strawberries, fowl droppings, and newspapers torn from wrapping flowers, fish, and greens.\nI headed across the market with Gabriella to the base of King Street at the right side of St. Paul's, Covent Garden. Bartholomew had accompanied us, declaring he needed to purchase some last-minute provender for tomorrow. We left him browsing while I escorted Gabriella halfway down King Street. I stopped a few houses away from her boardinghouse and let her traverse the rest of the street alone. I saw her square her shoulders, preparing to confront her mother and Auberge.\nJust before Gabriella reached the boardinghouse, the door flew open, and Carlotta herself dashed from it. She flung her arms around Gabriella, holding her a moment, then she took a step back and began to scold.\nGabriella's stance remained tall and straight; she would not wilt. She said something to her mother and pointed back at me. Carlotta followed her outstretched finger, saw me, and gave me a look of outrage that I could feel where I stood three houses away.\nCarlotta swung on her heel and dragged Gabriella inside. I tipped my hat at the door that slammed and turned away.\nI caught up with Bartholomew on his way back to Grimpen Lane, his basket filled to the brim with foodstuffs. \"She yours, sir?\" he asked as he fell into step with me. \"Your daughter, I mean.\"\n\"Yes.\" I glanced at him. \"I do not remember telling you that.\"\n\"Didn't have to, did you?\" He gave me a broad smile. \"She's the spittin' image of you, sir.\"\nThe answer pleased me, and I suppose I smiled foolishly, because his grin widened in response.\nI would speak again to Gabriella, I determined. I'd gradually bring her around to agreeing to stay with me while Carlotta and Auberge returned to France. I did not want to force my rights as her father, and things would be easier all around if she stayed by choice.\nI needed to find Felicity and Nancy after I'd unceremoniously left them behind in the market. I assumed the two had either retired to Felicity's lodgings or to a pub to catch up on old times. Also, I'd told Louisa to visit me this evening so that I could take her to see Gabriella. I wondered now whether Carlotta would even let us in, and more so, whether Gabriella was ready to see Louisa. I thought not. I would try to persuade Louisa to postpone the visit.\nI was reminded not twenty minutes after Bartholomew and I returned to my rooms that I needed to tend to other people as well. Bartholomew's brother Matthias rapped peremptorily on my door, and when Bartholomew opened it, Matthias announced that his master, Lucius Grenville, had tired of waiting and come to pay me a call.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Eight\n\n\"I have learned, Lacey,\" Grenville said as Bartholomew let him in, \"that to stay in thick in an investigation with you, I must insinuate myself. So, I am insinuating myself.\" He thrust his hat and stick at Matthias, then planted himself on the straightbacked chair and stretched out his legs.\nAs usual, Grenville dressed in the first stare of fashion; or rather, what he wore today would become the first stare of fashion tomorrow. He advocated monochrome colors, as had the famous George Brummell: black frock coat and tightly fitting trousers, ivory waistcoat, and glaring white neckcloth. In deference to the afternoon and the fact that he intended to hunt criminals, he wore a stock rather than a collar, his neckcloth was tied loosely, and he wore low-heeled boots and serviceable gloves.\n\"You did not happen to see Black Nancy on the way, did you?\" I asked.\nAt my question, Grenville's famous dark brows rose. \"Black Nancy? The creature that Denis hired to lure you into a trap on one occasion? The young lady for whom I rowed about on the cold Thames, ruining my gloves, while you rescued her?\"\n\"The same,\" I said.\n\"The answer is no, I did not. I had thought her in Islington in any case.\"\n\"She has graciously returned to the heart of London to help me look for these missing girls.\"\nGrenville put aside his dandy hauteur with a suddenness that was nearly comical. His eyes gleamed with interest. \"Excellent idea. Have you met with her yet? Has she found anything?\"\nSo speaking, he reached for the bottle of wine I'd left half-empty and motioned Bartholomew to bring him a clean glass. Bartholomew did, taking the wine from Grenville's hand and filling that glass and mine. Grenville's observant gaze darted about the table, taking in the remains of the meal and the two plates.\n\"Nancy has already been of help,\" I answered. \"She introduced me to a young woman called Felicity who knew one of the girls, Black Bess as she is called. I do not know yet whether they call her Black Bess because she has black hair like Nancy, or whether she has black skin like Felicity. Sergeant Pomeroy, it seems, was not amiss to kissing this Bess in dark passages, a fact he neglected to mention to me.\"\n\"Hmm,\" Grenville said. \"That is how many of these girls avoid facing the magistrates, you know. They bribe the Watch in kind.\"\n\"Pomeroy is an elite Runner, not the Watch. I do not mean that I wish to see these girls in the dock, but I dislike Pomeroy exploiting the situation.\"\n\"So many men do, Lacey.\"\n\"Yes, but Pomeroy, at least, I can put my hands on and shout at.\"\n\"I am certain he will be pleased about that,\" Grenville said dryly.\nI drank some of the wine, reflecting that Bartholomew had managed to procure a decent bottle. \"Nancy and Felicity told me of Black Bess's young man, who lives off Drury Lane. They promised to take me to him, but I dashed off and left them, and was about to go hunt for them again when you turned up.\"\nGrenville eyed me over the rim of his glass. \"That is most unlike you, to run off in the middle of an investigation.\"\n\"Not really, sir,\" Bartholomew broke in. \"The captain was helping his daughter.\"\nGrenville had started to drink. He coughed, then swallowed hastily and set the glass down. \"Indeed? You've spoken to her? What happened?\"\nI shot Bartholomew an irritated glance then explained, in clipped sentences, about my meeting with James Denis and my wife and about my choices for divorce. I also told him of Gabriella's distress when she learned of the matter.\nGrenville shot me a look of compassion, then he strove to hide it, because he knew I did not like pity. \"A difficult situation,\" he said. \"Though I understand how you feel about your daughter, now that I've connected with my own.\"\nHis situation was a bit different from mine, because he'd not known the daughter existed until a few months ago. I would not say so out loud, however. Grenville was ecstatic about her, the happiest I'd seen him in a long while. Though the daughter was now touring the country as a celebrated actress, he loved writing to her, reading her letters aloud to me, and visiting her whenever he could.\n\"If not for Donata,\" I said, \"I'd say the simplest solution would be to send Carlotta and her Frenchman back to France, and do nothing. They have been living in their supposed wedded bliss these fifteen years; they may as well continue. I can turn my back and declare that Carlotta is dead, and no one would be the wiser. But in that case, I would never feel right about marrying again. It would be bigamy, and I would know it.\"\n\"I read of a convicted bigamist who was branded in the thumb,\" Grenville said after a thoughtful sip of wine. \"But the iron was cool and the punisher was bribed to hold the iron to his skin only a second or two. This tells me that the law is unconcerned about bigamy.\"\nMatthias said, \"Bet his wives branded him good, though, when they found out about each other.\" He and his brother shared a chuckle.\n\"Sometimes simply looking the other way is the only answer,\" Grenville said. \"With the difficulty of ending marriage in this country, a couple who want to part and go their separate ways can only live happily by breaking the law.\"\n\"All parties are agreed in that case,\" I pointed out. \"They agree to say nothing.\"\n\"Have you asked Lady Breckenridge her opinion? She is not the most conventional of women, you know.\"\n\"She might draw the line at bigamy or perpetual adultery.\"\n\"Possibly,\" he conceded. \"Well, I will quiz my solicitor, thoroughly and at length. There must be a way to resolve this, without resorting to a trial for crim con.\" He shook his head. \"This is precisely why I have never put my own head in the noose. What happens if you awaken one morning and realize you've both changed your mind? In my case, every debutante's mama wants her daughter to be called Mrs. Grenville. The young lady would not be marrying me for my excellent character, and we'd know it.\"\n\"Marry Marianne,\" I suggested, \"and let the ambitious mothers mourn. Dukes and statesmen marry actresses, why not you as well?\"\nGrenville's look turned a bit regretful. \"Dear Marianne has insisted I give her more allowance. I would upbraid her for extravagance, except that she does seem to practice good economy.\" His brows drew together. \"Much as it pains me to admit it, Lacey, it might be time to let her go. Give her a large lump sum, since she enjoys money so much, and have done.\"\n\"And I will ask you not to,\" I said.\nGrenville gave me a sharp stare. \"Why? Would you like to watch her slowly drive me mad? I had not thought you so cruel.\"\nVery aware of Matthias and Bartholomew avidly listening, I only shook my head. \"I promise that you will understand everything about her, as soon as I can arrange it.\"\nHis eyes darkened, and his fingers tightened ever so slightly on his glass. \"I will be agog to learn all,\" he said, his voice deceptively soft.\n\"For now, let us hunt for Nancy and her friend. I am anxious to interview this Tom, paramour of the missing Black Bess.\"\nGrenville gave me a chill nod, and we let the touchy subjects of Marianne and my divorce drop.\nWhile we readied ourselves to leave, I told Grenville of my interview with the sailor and what he'd said about Mary Chester. After we spoke to Black Bess's gent, I said, I'd hunt up Pomeroy and quiz him thoroughly about Bess.\nWe stepped from the house into evening air that had cooled somewhat. It was eight o'clock, the sun just slipping behind tall London buildings. I liked this part of the evening, when the heat of the day abated, and the sky was azure, just barely streaked with gold.\nAs we neared Russel Street, where Grenville had left his carriage, I saw, to my astonishment, Carlotta dash around the corner to Grimpen Lane. She wore no hat and no shawl, her hair was mussed from the summer wind, and the hem of her skirt was muddy. She ran straight for me, shouting before she even reached me.\n\"Where is she?\"\nI stopped a moment in confusion, then I saw the stark anger and fear in her eyes. Alarm bit me. \"Do you mean Gabriella?\"\n\"Of course I mean Gabriella. I know she came to find you. Everyone in Covent Garden saw her come this way, and they were eager to point me the way to your rooms.\"\n\"I took Gabriella home,\" I said, puzzled. \"I watched her go into the house with you.\"\nI was aware of Grenville and the two towering footmen behind me, looking on, but Carlotta seemed to neither notice them nor care. \"Yes, then,\" she snapped. \"She has gone again, without a word. I know she must have come to you, so where is she?\"\n\"She is not here, Carlotta. Are you certain she did not simply stop to buy something in the market?\"\nShe shook her head. \"I came through the market on the way. I never saw her.\"\nMy alarm increased. \"What about Auberge? Did she go out with him?\"\n\"My husband is waiting in our rooms in case she returns. He would not have taken her anywhere without telling me nor would he have left her behind somewhere.\"\nHer glare told me that she'd expect such irresponsibility from me, but never Major Auberge.\nGrenville broke in. \"She might have gone into the bake shop. Perhaps she wanted to come upstairs but heard me in your rooms and decided to wait until I departed. She might be there even now, she and Mrs. Beltan having bread and a gab.\"\nHe spoke lightly, but I heard the thread of concern in his voice. With girls going missing from Covent Garden, we could not simply shrug this off. I decided that Grenville had a good idea and led the way back to the bake shop.\nMrs. Beltan was there, but not her assistant, and not Gabriella. To my inquiry as to whether Gabriella had returned, Mrs. Beltan said, \"No one's been in, Captain, in the last hour. I've been back scraping ash from the ovens, but if someone comes in, they generally sing out.\"\n\"She might not have wanted to sing out,\" I said. I scanned the bake shop, but my daughter was not hiding in its shadows. The shop was small, a six foot by about ten foot rectangle with a counter from which Mrs. Beltan sold loaves of bread and seed cakes.\nA door led from the shop into her parlor, but it was shut and, when I tried it, locked. \"No one's been in there all day,\" Mrs. Beltan said. \"Not even me. I've been run off my feet with custom.\"\nI turned to Carlotta. \"Go back to King Street. I will ask about here and in the market. We will find her.\"\nCarlotta gave me a belligerent stare, as she had done of old. \"How do I know you have not hidden her upstairs?\"\n\"Of course I have not,\" I began heatedly, but Bartholomew broke in. \"She might a' gone there, sir. She might have slipped upstairs to the empty rooms above or even the attics while we were jawing in your rooms.\"\nI stifled my impatience long enough to agree that it was a possibility. Gabriella might have wanted to speak to me without Grenville or the two servants about, and decided to wait, as Grenville had speculated. Perhaps she'd fallen asleep and not heard us leave.\nMrs. Beltan came with us. The rooms above mine were locked, because they weren't being let at the moment, and she wanted no vagrants sleeping there. But a young girl with determination might have been able to find her way in.\nMrs. Beltan unlocked the door on the landing above mine with her keys. Stuffy, close air enveloped us when we entered, but obviously no one had been in the rooms since Mrs. Beltan had sent her assistant to sweep a few days ago. We found the broom the assistant had left behind, but nothing else.\nThe attics were likewise empty. One was dark and cool, the other, warm with sunshine from a skylight. Bartholomew slept in the warm one and kept his bed neatly made. His clothes were folded on shelves, his nightshirt and extra coat hanging from pegs.\nGabriella was nowhere to be seen.\nBy the time we'd emerged into the street again, Carlotta was beginning to panic. \"She was coming to see you,\" she said, glaring at me again.\n\"Did she tell you that?\"\n\"She said nothing to me. I never saw her go. But I know.\"\n\"We'll look, sir,\" Bartholomew offered. \"Could be she went round the wrong corner. Streets here can be a warren, you know.\"\n\"What does she look like?\" Matthias began, but Bartholomew beckoned him on. \"I'll tell you,\" he said as the two of them loped away to Russel Street.\n\"My coach is at your service, madam,\" Grenville said, in his smooth, polite voice. \"I will escort you back to King Street. Best for you to stay there and let my lads do the searching. It is likely she has already returned there on her own.\"\nCarlotta had not changed in one aspect; she responded well when someone with authority told her what to do. Her flush of anger receded, and she thanked Grenville with manners that reminded me of the debutante she'd once been. Grenville touched her arm and led her to his opulent coach, which waited for him at the corner.\nHis coachman sprang to his feet from where he'd lounged against a wall, drinking from a flask. Grenville nodded at him to open the door, and Grenville handed Carlotta in with as much aplomb as if he'd been escorting her to the theatre. He climbed in beside her and looked back out at me. \"I'll see her safely, Lacey.\" He did not ask me to join them.\nThe carriage rolled off toward Bow Street, probably to take the roundabout route to King Street without having to press through the market. I walked in the opposite direction, back to the lingering crowd that filled Covent Garden on this warm summer evening.\nI scanned the square, looking in vain for Gabriella's golden brown hair in the sea of hats, caps, mobcaps, and bonnets. She'd worn a small, flat ivory-colored hat with ribbons when I'd met her yesterday morning, and I tried to spy something like that.\nI passed the peach seller who'd tried to cheat her. He remembered the encounter and bent a surely eye upon me when I asked if he'd seen the girl I'd been talking to the day before. He snarled that no, he hadn't, and no, he had no interest in seeing her again. I nearly grabbed him and shook him, but the vendors on either side of him, one for ale and the other for greens, confirmed that Gabriella hadn't come nigh them since yesterday morning.\nI asked at every seller down the line, to no avail. I asked the strolling vendors, the strawberry girls and orange sellers, flower girls and knife grinders. None had noticed or even remembered Gabriella.\nBartholomew and Matthias were no doubt right, I thought, trying to stem my rising fear. Gabriella probably had simply taken a wrong turn and could not have gone far. I might turn on to Henrietta Street and find her asking her way from the boy who swept paths across the street, or chatting with a maidservant.\nWith this picture in place, I hurried to Henrietta Street, my walking stick tapping, my leg protesting my frenzied pace. I saw carts and drovers, horses and mules, wagons and carriages. Maids and footmen, women and men, boys and other urchins swarmed about, but no Gabriella.\nI began to ask passersby if they'd seen her. Those who bothered to respond to me answered in the negative. A plump, older woman said to me, \"She's your girl, is she? I'm that sorry to hear you can't find her. Best go to Bow Street, you know. If I see her, I'll take her there myself. Don't you worry now.\"\nI thanked her and went on my way.\nI walked to Bedford Street and turned north, pausing halfway along at the churchyard of St. Paul's, Covent Garden. This was a quiet passage with the church looming at the end, elegant in its simplicity. I walked down it. The church at the end was open, dim and cool, but I did not find Gabriella wandering here as a reprieve from the hectic pace of Covent Garden.\nI continued north to King Street and turned east again. Grenville's carriage was just pulling away from Carlotta's boardinghouse, and I waited until it drew alongside me.\nThe coachman stopped, and Grenville opened the door. Major Auberge was in the carriage with him. The major peered down at me worriedly, his round face pale.\n\"She is not there?\" I asked.\nGrenville shook his head, his dark eyes troubled. \"The major wants to join the search. I said I'd take him through the streets, though I am certain Bartholomew and Matthias can cover them more quickly. Come with us.\"\nI refused. \"I am heading for Bow Street to ask Pomeroy to send out his patrollers. They know the area better than anyone. Go through Maiden Lane and make your way down to the Strand.\" I pushed my hand through my hair. \"It might be that she was only curious to see more of London. There are so many unusual shops in the Strand; perhaps she became mesmerized by them.\"\n\"Gabriella does like exploring,\" Auberge said. His eyes met mine, he, too, wanting to believe that she would easily be found. \"She wished to see all the sights when we were in Paris.\"\nShe was a Lacey, all right. \"She might have wanted to have a look at the river,\" I said. \"There are many confusing lanes south of the Strand. Look there if you do not find her shopping.\" I hoped she'd not gone to the winding lanes on the river, an area which had an unsavory reputation.\nGrenville nodded. I shut the door for him and stepped back as the coachman slapped the grays with the reins. As the coach rattled away through traffic, I strode back to Covent Garden, skirting it to James Street, its outlet leading north, and around the bulk of the theatre to Bow Street.\nPomeroy was not in, but he was expected soon. I did not care for this information, and I managed to bully the direction of Pomeroy's digs from one of his patrollers. I realized that in the two years Pomeroy had been back in London, I had not known where he lived. I'd always been able to find him at Bow Street or one of the taverns near it.\nI told the patrollers of my problem. The one I'd bullied said he could do little until Pomeroy's return, but he promised to send out a few lads.\nAs I emerged from Bow Street, ready to find the house off Long Acre that Pomeroy called home, I saw Black Nancy and Felicity coming from the direction of the theatre.\n\"Captain,\" Nancy called cheerfully. \"You ran off so fast and never said goodbye.\"\nI caught up to them and seized Nancy by the shoulders. \"Where have you been walking? Did you see the girl I took away to my rooms?\"\nNancy stared at me in amazement. \"No. You looking for her?\"\n\"She's gotten lost. Perhaps lost,\" I amended. She could still turn up in King Street, surprised at our concern, but as the minutes passed, I grew less and less certain.\nFelicity's silken black brows rose. \"That one? She's a young miss, Captain. She won't do well around here.\"\n\"Precisely why I am trying to find her. It could be she's simply taken a wrong turn, gone the wrong direction trying to fetch up in King Street and the boardinghouse.\"\nI tried to speak calmly, as though Gabriella were an ordinary girl who might have wandered away and would be back soon. But the tremor in my voice betrayed me. Nancy looked worried, and Felicity put a calming hand on my arm.\n\"We'll look out for her, Captain,\" Felicity said. \"You come with us now.\"\n\"I do not want to go anywhere with you. I want to find my daughter.\"\nNancy and Felicity exchanged an amazed glance. \"Coo,\" Nancy said. \"I didn't know that was your daughter.\"\nFelicity's grip on my arm firmed. \"Now, you come with us. I know when a man needs a gin.\"\nSo saying, she steered me across the busy street and into a tavern. I had not come into this public house before, preferring the Rearing Pony or the Gull. Heads turned as I entered in the company of so obvious a game girl as Felicity, but after one curious glance, the clientele, most of them well into their cups, looked the other way without rancor.\nFelicity and Nancy sat me down at an empty end of a long table, and Felicity sidled to the landlord and asked for three glasses of gin.\nNancy gave me a sympathetic glance. \"You're worrit that she got snatched by the same man who's taking the game girls, ain't you?\"\n\"I don't know.\" I drew a breath, resting my hands flat on the table. \"Gabriella is obviously a girl from a respectable family, and we still do not know whether the game girls were snatched. They might have decided to find work in a house, or they might have been taken up by protectors.\"\n\"Well, they ain't in any houses round here,\" Nancy said. \"Felicity and me had a look into all the bawdy houses, and neither Black Bess nor this Mary Chester has been in any of 'em.\"\n\"You can be certain?\" I asked. My entire being was focused on finding Gabriella, and at this moment, I couldn't keep much interest in girls who'd wandered away from their regular lovers, likely in search of better money. The two events might be connected, yes, but I did not want them to be. I could search for game girls, feeling a stranger's sympathy for their plight, but I did not want my daughter and her disappearance to be lumped with theirs. Their world was too dangerous.\n\"Fair certain,\" Nancy said. \"They treat Felicity with some respect, and I don't think they'd lie to her.\"\nUnless the house were keeping the girls secretly, for some unknown purpose.\nFelicity sat down and shoved a glass of clear, noisome liquid under my nose. \"You drink that, Captain. It'll stop your shaking.\"\nI hadn't realized I was shaking. But I saw that I had pressed my hands tightly against the table to still their trembling, and I was having difficulty catching my breath. I obediently raised the glass and gulped the gin.\nThe liquid burned fire into my gullet, and I wanted to cough. Foul stuff, but it warmed my blood and calmed my tremors a little. Felicity sipped her gin as though it were a delicate glass of champagne. Nancy took one drink, made a face, and set it down. \"Foul stuff. I like ale, meself.\"\nI took a long breath, my mouth tingling from the gin. \"I need to organize a search. We are all running about half-cocked at present, and might miss her coming or going. I did reconnaissance in the army; I can certainly do it in London.\"\n\"What do we do?\" Nancy asked, eager.\n\"Find Grenville for me. I sent him to the Strand. Tell him I will need a map. One of Horwood's will do--the man must have marked every house and every privy in London. I'll round up Grenville's footman and get Pomeroy to lend me his foot patrollers. I will look in every house in every street in this damn city if I have to.\"\n\"She might have already found her way home,\" Nancy pointed out.\n\"True. Then our effort will be for nothing.\" I paused. \"I hope so.\"\nI could see that Felicity was not as sanguine as Nancy. Felicity was a little older, perhaps a little wiser. Nancy had been lucky; Louisa had saved her before Nancy's life selling her body had broken her or even killed her. Felicity had already spent years on the streets and knew what a very harsh place they could be.\nFelicity laid her hand on my arm. Her skin was not really that much darker than Nancy's, but the essence of the color was different; olive and bronzed tones shone through whereas the tone of Nancy's skin was pink. My own tanned hand was more yellow.\n\"We'll find Mr. Grenville for you,\" Felicity said. \"I know his fancy carriage.\" She ran her fingers up my arm, her touch suggestive, though she said nothing. The unspoken offer was there, however. There was no desire in her eyes, only pity, as she offered comfort in her own way.\n\"Thank you,\" I said, answering both her words and her silent gesture. \"Send anyone you see on the way to Grimpen Lane, and I will await you there.\"\nIf Nancy noticed the exchange, she said nothing. Felicity smiled at me, a look of understanding, and withdrew her hand.\nI sent them off and continued to Long Acre, hoping that every corner I turned would reveal Gabriella. None did.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Nine\n\nTo my annoyance, I found Pomeroy not at home. His landlady, a woman of about thirty, her three small daughters busily cleaning the downstairs hall, told me he was looking into a death in Marylebone, trying to decide whether to put it down as suicide or murder. She seemed proud to have a Runner staying in her house.\nI left my card with a note on the back to Pomeroy to look me up at Grimpen Lane immediately on his return.\nMy leg aching with all my walking, I hired a hackney to return me home. The hackney moved through the crowd about as fast as I could walk, and I spent my time gazing across people and horses and down passages between tall slabs of houses to see if I could spy my daughter.\nI pictured in my head that Gabriella would be at the bake shop when I returned, with Carlotta there, scolding her. Everything would be all right, and we'd laugh at the fright she'd given us.\nI held on to this vision, so certain of it, that I knew that it would be true.\nBut when I arrived at the bake shop, it was shut and dark, Mrs. Beltan gone home. The disappointment of that cut me near to despair. Upstairs, empty rooms awaited me, with no Gabriella.\nTo keep myself from thinking of dire scenarios, I retrieved paper and sharpened a pen, and began making a list of likely places I could check and people I could call upon to help me.\nMy list grew lengthy, and I looked in surprise at all of the people with whom I'd forged ties since arriving in London: Sir Gideon Derwent; Leland Derwent and his friend Gareth Travers; Lady Aline Carrington; Sir Montague Harris, magistrate at the Whitechapel house; Thompson of the Thames River patrollers; Lady Breckenridge; Louisa Brandon and the many people she knew; Grenville, of course; and James Denis.\nI looked at the last name and felt my mouth go dry, the gin having left a foul taste behind. If Gabriella were truly missing, I would be a fool not to go to Denis. If any man could turn the city inside out, it was he, a man with resources I could not begin to match. And, I thought with dawning hope, if he'd had a man watching me as usual, that man might have noted Gabriella and where she had gone.\nI could not fathom what price Denis would ask of me for this favor. He wanted me to be under his obligation, so that I would not be a threat, and he had more than once hinted that he wanted to employ me outright. If Gabriella had truly disappeared, would enslaving myself to Denis be worth her return?\nIt would be.\nGrenville arrived not long after I'd finished my list. Bartholomew and Matthias came upstairs with him, as did Major Auberge. By the grim looks on faces all around, none of them had found Gabriella.\nNancy and Felicity arrived soon after, with two of Pomeroy's patrollers in tow. \"First time I ever told Bow Street to come with me,\" Nancy cackled as they ran up the stairs and into my sitting room.\nFortunately, my rooms, while sparsely furnished, were large, the architects of the house over a century ago having a liking for grand salons. My makeshift army fitted comfortably, though we would have been hard pressed had more joined us.\nGrenville unrolled a map sheet of Covent Garden and surrounding areas on my writing table. He had not bothered to send home for one; he'd simply walked into a shop on the Strand and purchased it. That particular shop had just closed for the evening, but the proprietor had opened it again for Grenville.\nI leaned on the table, looking at the streets I had walked not an hour ago, laid out in neat lines and squares. London looked so clean from this bird's-eye view, but the map could show nothing of the tall buildings, each with its own characteristic, streets that could narrow into crooked medieval lanes in three steps, the smell of unwashed people and dogs, the startling snorts of horses or pigs tucked into unseen yards, the noises of cart and carriage wheels, the clopping of hooves on cobblestones, shouting men, laughter and anger, joy and heartache.\nWith a sketching pencil Grenville had also provided, I squared off a part of the map, from Lincoln's Inn Fields in the east to St. Martin's Lane in the west, High Holborn in the north to the river in the south. It was a large slice of the city, but easy enough for a healthy young woman to walk.\n\"I am dividing up this area,\" I said. \"In pairs, we will each take a part of the grid, where we will walk every street and check every alley and ask everyone we see if Gabriella has been seen. I plan to recruit more patrollers and Pomeroy and send word to Thompson. If you find Gabriella, you will latch on to her, bring her back here immediately, and stay with her. We will check back here every hour to see if any of the others have made progress. Do you understand?\"\n\"Aye, Captain,\" Matthias said, touching his forelock.\n\"Bartholomew and Matthias, I want one of you with Nancy, the other with Felicity. They know people, and they know the streets. Listen to them if they think of a place to look. Grenville, you take a foot patroller, for the same reason.\"\n\"Jackson, my coachman, is willing to help,\" Grenville put in. \"He can speak to other coachmen who might report something.\"\n\"Excellent. Have him pair up with this fellow,\" I said, pointing to the other patroller. I folded the expensive map and tore the sheet into pieces around my gridlines, handing one to each pair. \"Leave no stone unturned. I want to find Gabriella before some unscrupulous person does. Bartholomew and Felicity, since you will be taking the southwestern part of the grid, check the boardinghouse in King Street every once in a while to see whether she has returned.\"\n\"Understood, sir,\" Bartholomew said.\nI stood up, my stance unconsciously becoming like the one I'd taken when readying my men for an upcoming battle. \"Go to it, then.\"\nThey dispersed and departed, very much like my soldiers when I dismissed them. They squared shoulders and stood straight as though determined to obey orders to the best of their abilities.\nMajor Auberge did not follow them. \"You did not give me a map,\" he said.\n\"Because you should go back to the boardinghouse and wait. Gabriella might return there, and I am certain Carlotta will be at her wits' end.\"\nIn truth, I was as angry as I could be at Carlotta and did not care much about her anxiousness. She should have watched Gabriella and not let her out alone. But I used her worry as an excuse to send Auberge away, because I wanted nothing to do with him. Also, if Carlotta had upset Gabriella enough for her to dash off, there was nothing to say that she would not do so a second time.\nAuberge gave me a stubborn look. \"She is my daughter. And I suspect, like you, that harm has befallen her. I cannot sit like an old woman and wait for her to be found. You have no second person. I will go with you.\"\nI opened my mouth to tell him to go away, then I stopped. His eyes mirrored my own anguish. He had known Gabriella all her life, had raised her from babyhood, had held her hand when she walked. I was furious with jealousy because of it, but I had to concede that his fear was as sharp as my own.\n\"Very well. But do not talk to the people we meet. The Londoners around here are suspicious of foreigners, especially Frenchmen. I do not want to waste time extricating you from a brawl.\"\nHe nodded once, his face set. \"I understand.\"\n\"Let us be off, then.\" I snatched up my corner of the map and ushered him out the door.\nBy the time we reached Russel Street, a hard lump had formed in the pit of my stomach, which would increase to full-blown panic if I let it. But damn it all, Gabriella was not a fool. She should come to her senses and return home. She must know that London was not safe for her, and she'd heard Bartholomew talk about the missing girls. If she found herself lost, she'd seek out a trustworthy person and ask the way to King Street.\nEven this logical thought could not comfort me. She was lost, and London was large and dangerous, and we had to find her.\nI had chosen the northwest corner of the map, where Broad Street cut through the warren of St. Giles to High Holborn. I had chosen it because it was close to Pomeroy's lodgings, and I still wanted to lay my hands on him. Also, the area was a bit dangerous, and I hadn't wanted to send my friends into the rookeries where they would be ripe for plucking. I had little to pluck, and Auberge, like me, had been a soldier. We could hold our own.\nWe rode in a hackney to where Broad Street met High Street, and we began the search there. We walked through crooked alleys on dirty cobbles, passing closed shops and houses that had stood in the narrow lanes for hundreds of years. Walls had been shored up and repaired as necessary, and the different colors of bricks and plaster gave them a piebald look. In one lane, the upper stories of the houses leaned to each other over the street, closing out the sky.\nNowhere did we find a sign of a girl in a sensible cotton frock, lost and trying to find her way home.\nWe walked slowly but purposefully, looking into every passage and every darkened doorway. In one lane, a young woman with a soiled apron held a boy of about five in her arms. He was naked but for a shirt that exposed his backside and spindly legs. She held her hand out for coin, and Major Auberge stopped and dropped some to her palm. She thanked him in a weak voice.\nAuberge and I had spoken little since leaving Grimpen Lane, except for me to tell him where we'd begin. Now, we walked in silence, saving our energy for our search.\nWe angled south from Broad Street to another King Street, my idea being that perhaps Gabriella had confused this King Street with the one that led off Covent Garden. Auberge followed my lead without argument. As I had instructed, he said nothing to the people I questioned, only listened to my conversation, observing without offering comment.\nAs we continued toward Little Earl Street and Seven Dials, he said to me quietly, \"Gabriella likes so much to explore. When she was a little girl, she would go to the stream below our farm and follow its course as far she could. She said she wanted to learn where it came from. I explained that it started in mountains far away, but she was certain that around the next bend she would find a fountain that spilled the entire stream into the valley. One day she had walked five miles, and a farm hand had to carry her home. She was asleep in his arms, as you say, soundly.\"\nI imagined my golden-haired daughter trudging sturdily along the bank of the stream, determined to find its source. \"She showed the propensity even at two years old,\" I said. \"She always wanted to come with me when I talked to my men, to see what her papa did as a soldier. One day, she crawled under the canvas of the tent to follow me to where I was meeting with one of the generals. I explained to the general when she popped up that she was eager to learn to be an exploring officer. Fortunately, she amused him, and he simply ordered his batman to carry her home. Carlotta, on the other hand, was not amused. She was quite hysterical about the incident, certain the general would throw me out of the army in disgrace.\"\n\"Yes, Carlotta becomes very worried.\"\nI closed my mouth on my reply, not wanting to grow too comfortable with the fact that I shared a wife and child with this man. Perhaps that was why divorce had been made so difficult to obtain, so we'd be spared these sorts of strange conversations.\nWe continued the search, slowly moving in a circle through the streets, heading south. When we turned to Long Acre, I stopped at the house in a lane opening from it where Pomeroy had rooms.\nThis time, I caught Pomeroy readying himself to go to Bow Street.\n\"Well then, Captain,\" he said cheerfully. \"My landlady said you had come to call. Couldn't think why, unless it was to do with the game girls.\"\nAuberge looked slightly confused, not understanding the expression game girls. \"No, no, we are looking for my daughter. She is seventeen, and lost.\"\nPomeroy looked at Auberge in sympathy but resignation. \"Not a good thing to hear, a respectable girl gone missing. Any number of procuresses wander up and down the streets, looking for such an innocent. It's a sad fact, but virgins fetch a nice price in the bawdy houses.\"\nAuberge's face went white as Pomeroy's flat words made the awful possibility that much more real.\n\"I want to borrow your patrollers,\" I said. \"Put every man you've got to searching the streets.\"\nHe gave me a dubious look. \"Can't spare that many, that's a fact, Captain. There are more crimes all over London than one missing girl.\"\nI stepped close to him, the fruitless search having raised all my fears. \"The girl's name is Gabriella Lacey.\"\nPomeroy's eyes widened. He remembered Gabriella and Carlotta. \"'Struth, sir. Your little Gabriella?\"\n\"Yes,\" I said tightly. \"She is not so little now. She's about the same age as your Black Bess, I would guess.\"\nI thought I detected a flicker of uneasiness in his eyes, but with Pomeroy, it was difficult to tell. \"You think the disappearances are connected?\"\n\"I do not know what to think. And I want to have a discussion with you about this Black Bess, including the fact that you did not tell me that you knew her, nor that she was paying you in kind to look the other way.\"\nHe bristled visibly this time. \"Now, as to that, sir, I'd say it was my business.\"\n\"I'd say it might have had something to do with her disappearance, and if you want me to find her, you will be frank with me. But first, go to Bow Street and send out your patrollers. I have people working already, but the more the better.\"\n\"Have to check with the magistrate first,\" he began.\n\"Send them, Sergeant. I do not want to call in James Denis, but I will if necessary. I'd rather use Bow Street, but I might not have a choice.\"\n\"Are you threatening me, sir?\"\n\"I am happy to threaten anyone who does not assist us in finding Gabriella. You said yourself she hadn't much chance. Instead of bleating about a dismal future, do something to ensure it is not dismal.\"\nHe stared at me a long moment. On the Peninsula, Pomeroy had argued with me when he thought my orders daft, and a few times, he'd been right. The times I'd known I was right, however, I'd stared him down until he wilted and did what I wanted. He seemed to remember those days, because his bravado deflated. He saluted. \"As you say, Captain. I'll get on it.\" He let his hand drop and gave me a serious look, the usual bonhomie gone from his eyes. \"I won't let you down, sir.\"\nHe trotted off toward Long Acre and turned in the direction of Bow Street.\n\"Will he do it?\" Auberge asked me.\n\"He will,\" I answered, my mouth set. \"Shall we resume?\"\nAfter another hour of walking, we had uncovered nothing. If Gabriella had come this way, no one had seen her. We took another hackney back to Grimpen Lane, Auberge generously counting out shillings for the fare. I met Grenville and the foot patroller in my lodgings. Both shook their heads unhappily. They had found nothing.\nThe others that straggled in as the four of us left again had nothing to report. Black Nancy touched my arm. \"I'm that sorry, Captain. None of the girls I passed the time with had seen her, or the other missing girls either. But we'll keep trying. I swear to you.\"\nThey were giving up. I heard it in their voices when they promised to continue. They were beginning to fear the worst.\nOutside, in darkening Russel Street, I sent a street sweep running off to the boardinghouse with news we had not found her. Auberge and I returned to the streets north of Long Acre and tediously trudged down every lane again.\n\"I am a stranger in London,\" Auberge said. \"Tell me what can have happened.\" He stopped me near the wall of a shabby house. \"Tell me in plain words.\"\nI did not want to tell him, because telling him might make it real, but I drew a breath. \"She might have fetched up in the river. Either fallen in or thrown in after she was robbed. As Pomeroy said, a procuress could have taken her to a bawdy house. Or a gentleman could have coerced her into his coach and be far away by now.\" I stopped, and Auberge nodded, trying, as I was, to make himself face these possibilities. \"I was involved in a case a little over a year ago,\" I went on. \"A gentleman had asked for young, respectable girls to be brought to him. He had an expensive house in Hanover Square.\"\nAuberge looked grim. \"Should we go to Hanover Square?\"\n\"The man involved was killed. I could not be terribly sorry about his death.\" I did not explain what had become of the particular young woman I had sought, and I did not like thinking on her fate.\n\"We must keep looking, then,\" Auberge said.\n\"Yes,\" I agreed.\nWe fell into step, resuming the search.\nAt eleven o'clock, we returned to Grimpen Lane to news. Bartholomew, Matthias, Nancy and Felicity were waiting, the latter eating strawberries she'd bought cheap from a strawberry girl who'd wanted to rid herself of her last wares for the day.\n\"We found something, Captain,\" Bartholomew said, his blue eyes subdued. \"Not your daughter. By the new bridge, near to Somerset House. A young woman, dead.\"\n\"Not Gabriella?\" I asked, my voice strained. \"You are certain?\"\n\"I saw her clear, sir. Wasn't the same girl. She had golden hair, but not natural.\"\n\"I think,\" Felicity said, \"from what you and Nancy said, it could be Mary Chester.\"\n*** *** ***\nI sent Matthias bolting off to fetch Pomeroy. Bartholomew told me that they'd left Grenville's coachman and his patroller to guard the spot. When Grenville came in, we took lanterns he had filched from his coach and made our way down to the Strand.\nThe new bridge rose near Somerset House, arched and lighted with flickering lamps. Bartholomew led us through the darkness to a passage near stairs that led down to the water. Pomeroy had joined us, his tow-colored hair bright in the moonlight. The stink of the river was strong here--fish, mud, and human waste.\nThe ground was hard-packed dirt; the cobbles did not extend here. Grenville's coachman, Jackson, a tall, muscular man with hard eyes, waited near a pile of debris, holding a lantern that was a bright pinpoint of light in the gloom. The patroller stood by him, somewhat more nervously.\nBartholomew bent down and moved a wet and grime-covered board. Beneath was the torso of a young woman, her hips and legs still covered by rubbish.\nGrenville lifted his lantern high, shining the light on her. She was dead without doubt. Her face was blue-white, and was wound loosely about her neck. Her hair, now dirt-streaked, had been golden-blond, but Bartholomew had been right about it not being natural. The roots of the hair that swept back from her forehead and temples was mostly dark brown, her own color starting to grow again.\nI crouched next to her, looking at another life too soon snuffed out. \"We need Thompson,\" I said. \"I want him to see her.\"\n\"And a coroner,\" Pomeroy put in.\nI switched my glance to the foot patrollers. They looked to Pomeroy, and at his nod, they loped off.\nI remained on one knee next to the woman, bracing myself on my walking stick. Gingerly, I hooked one finger around the sash and eased it an inch downward. Her neck was covered with bruises.\nNancy hissed through her teeth. \"That how she died? Strangled with her own sash?\"\nI looked at the girl's face, which was straight and serene, and shook my head. \"She didn't struggle.\" I studied the bruises, which were in the exact pattern of human fingers. My own fingers fitted over them easily. \"A man did this. One with large hands. But I'm not sure that's what killed her.\"\n\"Then why the sash?\" Grenville asked.\nI eased the cloth back over her neck. \"Perhaps she was in a struggle with a man and got away, and wore the sash around her neck to cover the bruises until they healed.\"\n\"In that case, how did she die?\"\n\"Coroner will tell us,\" Pomeroy said confidently. \"They're amazing at that sort of thing.\" He sighed and scratched his head. \"Will have to be an inquest, her dead back here, injuries like that.\"\nI got stiffly to my feet. Felicity was standing at my elbow, looking down at the corpse with an odd expression on her face. \"Are you all right?\" I asked her.\nShe looked up at me quickly, as though surprised at the question. \"Wasn't expecting to find her dead, is all.\"\nA shiver ran through me. I prayed with all my strength that Gabriella wasn't lying under another pile of rotting boards, cold and blue and dead. God, please let her be all right. Let her be waiting in a tavern for someone to find her, with a kindly landlord's wife feeding her thick soup and coffee.\n\"Looks like I should be asking whether you're all right, Captain,\" Felicity said softly. She touched my hand, again with the unspoken offer of bodily comfort should I need it. The gesture did not disgust me; she meant it from kindness, like Mrs. Beltan might offer me a cup of tea. I gave her a faint smile and shook my head.\n\"Jackson,\" Grenville addressed his coachman. \"Take the lads and the two young ladies and find yourselves a steadying pot of ale. You've earned it.\"\n\"So have you,\" I told him.\nGrenville shook his head. \"I'll wait for the coroner and Thompson with you. I'm curious what he has to say.\" He withdrew his watch and looked at it in the light of his lantern. \"Eleven thirty. Ah, well, I was not looking forward to Lady Featherstone's ball in the slightest. I will be the talk of Mayfair for not appearing.\" He sounded rather pleased with the prospect.\nAuberge, who had been watching from the back of the alley, said, \"I will resume the hunt for my daughter.\"\n\"I'd rather you didn't,\" I said. \"Not alone. Or we'll be hunting for you, as well.\"\nHe smiled faintly. \"Perhaps you would not be so troubled to have me go missing, eh?\" He met my gaze, his hazel eyes flickering in the light of Grenville's lantern.\n\"Not so,\" I said. \"I want your help. I know that you are the only other man who will be as adamant as I am about finding Gabriella.\"\nAuberge hesitated a moment, then he nodded. \"As you say, I have no knowledge of these streets. I will wait.\"\nGrenville sensed that the exchange had been personal. As though ignoring us, he tucked his watch away and straightened his frock coat, which he'd been wearing since early evening.\nIt was unusual for Grenville not to change his clothes at least twice in the course of an evening, sometimes three times. He seemed more interested, however, at the prospect of investigating a murder. He made to lean against the wall behind him, then looked at the smears of mud on it and thought better of it.\nI turned to Pomeroy, who was gazing down at the girl. \"While we are waiting,\" I said to him. \"Tell me why the last time Felicity saw Black Bess, you were with Bess in a passage like this one, kissing her.\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Ten\n\nGrenville looked up, interested. Pomeroy flushed. \"I believe I told you that that was my business, Captain.\"\n\"You did, but the girl is missing. A second missing girl has just turned up dead. I'd like to know everything you know about Bess so that we might find her before she suffers a similar fate. Am I right? Was she paying you in kind?\"\n\"I wouldn't say that, sir.\"\n\"What would you say, Sergeant?\"\nHe bathed me in a light blue glare. \"I would say we wasn't in the army any more and you can leave off bullying me. But I know that will do no good.\" He ran his hand through his already slick hair, pushing it behind his ears. \"The thing with Bess, Captain, is she weren't paying me to look the other way. We're sweet on each other.\"\n\"She has a lover,\" I said. \"He lives with her near Great Wild Street. I plan to interview him.\"\n\"I know that. Tom Marcus. But Bess didn't like him. He didn't treat her well enough, she said, and he clung to her something fierce. Like having a child about, she said.\"\n\"Did she want to leave him?\"\n\"Don't think so, not yet. She wanted to have something fixed for sure before she left him. He has some brass from working in a brickyard, and he's good at stretching the money both of 'em made.\"\n\"I wish you had told me of this before,\" I said. \"She might have threatened to leave him, and he might have grown angry with her, do you not think? Enough to harm her or at least to make her run away?\"\nPomeroy's brows lowered. \"Bess wouldn't have run away without coming to me. She knew where to find me. Tom didn't hurt her, because when he came and reported her missing, I shook him up a bit, to find out whether he'd hit her. I'm satisfied he hadn't. Besides, if he'd done her in, he like as not wouldn't come to Bow Street, now, would he?\"\n\"Unless he wanted to direct your attention elsewhere,\" Grenville suggested. \"Perhaps he killed Bess as well as Mary, then reported Bess missing to make it look as though he had concern for her. He killed Mary as a blind for the death of Bess, perhaps trying to make it seem as though a madman had decided to start killing game girls.\"\n\"You are reasoning ahead of yourself,\" I said. \"We haven't found Bess, and there is no reason to believe the two incidents are connected. Besides, Thompson told us that Mary had gone to Covent Garden to meet a man.\"\nPomeroy held up his hands. \"Well, it weren't me.\"\nI looked at him. \"If you say Bess was sweet on you, why did she not decide to leave Tom Marcus and live with you, instead?\"\n\"Would look fine, wouldn't it, Captain, a game girl living with a Bow Street Runner? She wanted to give up her trade first, find a proper job and become a proper girl.\"\nI traced the head of my walking stick. \"Felicity told me that Bess allowed you privileges without paying in order to keep you from arresting her.\"\nI thought that would anger him. I thought Pomeroy would puff himself up, offended, and tell me to go to hell and dance with the devil. Instead, to my surprise, his grin flashed, teeth white in the darkness. \"Thing is about Felicity, Captain, you can't always trust what she says. She's a clever one. Has to be, don't she? But she'll tell a tale, wind a chap around her finger, so to speak. I'm not calling her a liar, but you have to question her version of the truth.\"\nI mulled this over, realizing that I had been ready to believe Felicity, probably because I felt sorry for her. She exuded confidence in herself and her ability to please men, but because she was a game girl and had black skin, the world thought nothing of exploiting her. She must have come up with plenty of defenses against that.\n\"What is the truth, then?\" I asked.\n\"What I said. Me and Bess, we like each other. She was working to leave her man and take up with me. I last saw her when your Felicity spied us. I was a-kissing her goodbye.\"\n\"Goodbye? Where was she going?\"\n\"Good night, I ought to have said. She was off home, and I went to Bow Street. Last I ever saw her.\" For the first time, he looked troubled. \"So I would thank you, Captain, if you could help find her. I never want to see her like this.\" He looked back down at the corpse.\nI understood. I did not want to find Gabriella like this either, and by the look on Auberge's face, he shared my fear.\nWe waited in the warm night for Thompson and the coroner. Grenville had brandy in a flask, which he shared around. After midnight, one patroller returned with a plump man wearing an expression of curiosity, followed not much later by the second patroller and Thompson.\nThe coroner of the parish seemed in no way distraught that he'd been dragged from his comfortable home to examine a young woman's corpse in a back lane near the river. He spread a cloth on the ground and knelt on it, asking the patrollers to move the rest of the boards out of the way.\nThompson stood looking down at the young woman, his tattered-gloved fingers at his mouth. \"Yes, that is Mary Chester. I'll have to have her Sam tell us for certain, but I am sure it's her.\"\nThe coroner gently untied the sash and removed it from her neck. \"Her initials are on the dress,\" the coroner said, pulling back a fold of bodice. \"M.C., embroidered on the seam, nice as you please.\"\n\"Was she strangled?\" I asked, leaning down.\n\"Not a bit of it.\" The coroner turned her head, examining the bruises. \"This was done before she died. Maybe a day or two. She's been dead I'd say a few days, but she can't have lain here all that time. Someone would have found her, at least the dogs and the rats.\"\n\"How pleasant.\" Grenville took a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his lips.\n\"So she was killed elsewhere and brought here,\" I said. \"If that's so, why wait so long to move her here?\"\n\"Perhaps the gent had hidden the body in one place,\" Pomeroy said, \"then had to move it or risk it being discovered.\"\nGrenville patted his lips again. \"Then why not tip her into the river? He'd carried her this far; the stairs to the river are only a street away.\"\n\"Perhaps he was seen, or thought he was seen,\" I said. \"He leaves her at the first place he can find and flees.\" I turned back to the coroner. \"Can you see how she died?\"\n\"Well,\" the man answered, taking his time. He turned Mary's head again, lifting the hair from the back of her neck. \"So far, I've seen no sign of injury, but I'll have to examine her more thoroughly in better light. She might have suffocated, or been poisoned, or perhaps died naturally. I cannot say until I take her elsewhere.\"\n\"My carriage is at your disposal,\" Grenville said.\nThe coroner climbed to his feet. His hand went to his back, and his face creased in pain. \"Get a bit stiff on the hard ground.\" He grinned. \"There's not many a gentleman that would offer his fine carriage to a corpse, Mr. Grenville, but there's no need. I brought my own conveyance. I just need a strong man to lift her.\"\nThe patrollers, with Pomeroy watching, did the job. They moved the rotted boards, hoisted the girl between them, and carried her out of the passage, Her gown trailed to the ground, and neither of the three thought to lift the skirt out of the mud.\nThompson looked about the lane after the coroner had gone, his face somber. \"I believe he is right that she was killed elsewhere and left here. That poor sailor of hers will take it hard. I don't think he murdered her.\"\n\"Would he have tried to throttle her?\" Grenville asked.\n\"Possibly, if she angered him. But the fact that she didn't die of that is a point in his favor, because he stopped himself before he killed her.\"\n\"Or she managed to get away from him,\" I said.\n\"True. But then he would simply have tried again. I doubt he would have come to me, worried, if he'd wanted her dead himself.\"\nThe same argument could be applied to Black Bess's lad. I had the feeling that we'd discover that neither of these girls' lovers were responsible for their disappearances or deaths.\nThompson sighed as we emerged from the passage. \"Have to look up Chester and tell him the bad news. I'm not relishing that. Would you like to come with me, Captain? Not to break the news, but to see if he knows anything further?\"\n\"No.\" I told Thompson about Gabriella and that I needed to hunt for her.\nHis expression darkened. \"If I find the bastard who is doing this . . .\" He shook his head, his thin frame moving. \"I'll tell the magistrate of the Bow Street house and the others to put as many men as they can spare on it. I'll also employ some of my own.\" He held out his hand for me to shake. \"We'll find her, Captain.\"\nHis resolution only worried me more. Everyone except Auberge had offered the explanation that Gabriella had merely wandered off. Thompson, like me, believed something more sinister might have happened. Hearing my fear confirmed only increased the coldness in the pit of my stomach.\n*** *** ***\nAuberge wanted to return to King Street and tell Carlotta what was happening. He and I, Grenville, and Pomeroy walked back to the Strand, Grenville fetching Jackson from the tavern to which he'd taken the others. Grenville ordered Jackson to drive Auberge back to King Street, while Grenville himself volunteered to remain and help renew the search for Gabriella. Thompson departed for the coroner's house to learn the outcome of his examination.\nI decided to leave them and ride with Auberge, hoping against hope that Gabriella had returned to the house while we'd been distracted with the body of Mary.\nBut when we reached the house, Gabriella was not there. Carlotta flew down the stairs, wild for news. When Auberge merely shook his head, she flung herself into his arms, crying. I do not believe she even noticed me there.\nI left the house, uncertain where to turn. I told Jackson to take the carriage back to Grenville and the others and help them continue the search. Jackson nodded and drove away. I tramped back to Covent Garden alone, drawn to the place as though it held the answers.\nThe stalls were shut and quiet, the market closed. That did not mean that the place was deserted. Game girls wandered the shadows, their high-pitched laughter promising a merry time. Thieves roamed, waiting for victims.\nThe pile of Covent Garden Theatre hugged the northeast corner of the square, the back walls marked here and there with small windows. The theatre's entrance and grand piazza were on its other side, in Hart and Bow Streets.\nI saw a Mayfair gentleman near the back of the theatre, conspicuous in fine suit and tailed frock coat, a tall hat on his head. A dark carriage with a matched team waited not far from him. He was speaking to a game girl, the lady, bold in a feathered hat and scarlet dress, answering him with laughter.\nAfter a time, he held his hand out to her, offering. She took it, and together they went to the carriage and climbed inside. The coachman gave office to the horses and drove on at a snail's pace. I stepped aside to let the carriage pass.\nI'd recognized the gentleman, a man I'd met at White's with Grenville, one by name of Stacy. He was a husband and a father--likely his wife and daughter even now were inside the theatre, while Stacy entertained himself elsewhere.\nI knew that some rich men slummed, picking up game girls without discretion. I wondered as I watched the carriage recede into the darkness of King Street how often Stacy visited Covent Garden, and whose company he enjoyed there.\n*** *** ***\nI walked north on James Street. The intersection between it and Hart Street was busy with people leaving the theatre between performances. A few enterprising acrobats had set up on the corner opposite me, two men and a girl tumbling and dancing while a little boy wove through the crowd with an upturned hat.\nThe acrobats were quite good and had drawn a small crowd. The girl scrambled onto one man's back and stood up on his shoulders, then he tossed her high into the air. The other man caught her with ease and set her on her feet again. The audience applauded.\nI crossed the street, letting a threepenny bit drop into the boy's hat. He said, \"Thankee, sir,\" before moving along.\nA carriage rattled to a halt behind me, and I looked around to see a window drop down and a white face topped with an odd lace and feather headdress appear. A pair of shrewd eyes observed me, then the face left the window.\nA footman swarmed from the back of the coach and opened the door for me. He assisted me in and closed the door, shutting me into an opulent, stuffy, and dark box with the lady who'd stopped for me.\nI sank into the cushions next to Lady Breckenridge, relieved to have somewhere soft to rest.\n\"Whatever are you doing wandering the streets, Lacey?\" she asked.\nHer drooping headdress swayed with the carriage. Female fashions were heading down the avenue of the ridiculous these days, with stiff lace and many flounced ribbons decorating skirts, the fabric almost like canvas for layers of decoration. Headdresses weren't much better. I preferred the simplicity of a bandeau woven through locks, but women, especially in the aristocracy, were keen to follow fashion. Lady Breckenridge managed to look pretty even with the baglike lace hood covering her hair and the peacock feathers that sagged to either side of her face. Gloves covered her arms past her elbows, her short-sleeved, summer garment shimmering gold and silver.\nI'd come to prefer Lady Breckenridge in little but a peignoir, her black hair cascading, or better still, Lady Breckenridge wrapped only in her sheets. I raised her hand and pressed a kiss to her palm.\nHer eyes darkened. \"Come with me to South Audley Street?\" she asked.\nI'd been her lover for a few months now, and every moment spent with her had been a delight. But I lowered her hand and shook my head. \"Donata, the most terrible thing has happened.\"\nI meant to say the words calmly, but my voice broke, and I could not continue. I sat mutely in the carriage while it bumped its way to God knew where, holding her hand and staring straight in front of me.\n\"What is it, Gabriel? Please, tell me.\"\nI had explained to so many people today--to Pomeroy and Thompson, to Auberge, to Nancy and Felicity. The words grew more difficult, not less, as I repeated them. \"My daughter has disappeared.\"\nLady Breckenridge's eyes widened. \"Disappeared? What do you mean?\"\nI pressed my hand to my face. \"Oh, God, Donata, we've looked all afternoon and all night, and she is nowhere to be found. And someone is killing game girls in Covent Garden, and what if he took her too?\"\nI breathed heavily, my voice a dry rasp. I hated to break down in front of her, a woman whom I wanted to think nothing but high things of me. Most Englishmen hated displays of emotion--cool sangfroid was the rule, unless it was cold anger. I'd lived too long in hot countries, where rage or grief could be let loose under the merciless sun.\nLady Breckenridge chose neither to pat my shoulder nor to bathe me in scorn. Instead she waited until my weeping had run its course, saying nothing while the carriage creaked and swayed through the warm streets.\nI drew a long breath and wiped my eyes, my hands shaking. Lady Breckenridge sat calmly, a drooping peacock feather brushing her cheekbone.\nIn a low voice that threatened to crack again, I told her of the events of the day, beginning with the meeting with James Denis and my wife. Donata turned away as I described speaking with Carlotta, and Denis suggesting I bring a suit of criminal conversation against her and Auberge. I told her of seeing Gabriella while I talked with Nancy and Felicity, how I'd sent Gabriella home, and how Carlotta had come looking for her later.\n\"We searched,\" I finished. \"We took streets between us, and we looked and looked. Auberge and I walked every street, every lane, we looked in every suspect house. She is nowhere to be found.\"\nI finished, my elbows on my knees, my face in my hands. I could not afford to give in to despair. I had to remained clearheaded, to think.\nDonata put her hand on my arm. \"Gabriel, stay with me tonight.\"\nI shook my head. \"I have to return to Grimpen Lane. She might make her way back there.\"\nHer hand moved, stroking my arm, soothing and firm. \"There is no reason she would try to find her way to Grimpen Lane. If she is free, she will go to King Street, where her mother is.\"\nSwift pain darted through me, but I realized she was right. I hadn't been thinking logically. She'd try to find her mother, of course. And Auberge, much as I hated to admit it.\n\"Still, I must continue looking.\"\n\"You are all in, Gabriel. A wreck. Come home with me, and let Barnstable give you a drop of laudanum and put you to bed. You need to rest and clear your thoughts.\"\n\"I cannot. Anything can happen in the few hours I am asleep. I want to be out searching.\"\nShe rested her head on my shoulder, the spice of her perfume touching me. \"I will spread the word. All of London will turn out and hunt for her, every servant, every coachman, every errand boy. I know kind people. We will turn London upside down and shake it until Gabriella drops out again.\"\nPart of me was touched by her concern and generosity but that part was buried under a blanket of fear. \"She might have been taken to a bawdy house. Or even out of London. A fast carriage could get far by this time.\"\nLady Breckenridge squeezed my hand. \"I have many connections. I will use every one I can. I promise you that.\"\nI turned, my view of her rather obscured by her peacock feathers. I touched the headdress. \"Take this off.\"\nShe smiled and complied, as though she'd known how ridiculous it looked but waited for me to say so. She unpinned the headgear and dropped it to the seat opposite, where it lay like a misshapen bird.\n\"I prefer your tresses long and loose,\" I said.\n\"That is a bold thing to say to a lady.\"\nI slid my arms around her and pulled her close. \"It is only the truth.\"\nLady Breckenridge held me quietly. I had grown to care for her deeply, my feelings a far cry from those I'd had the first day I'd met her, when she'd directed cigarillo smoke and sardonic comments at me in the home of a rather tasteless baron in Kent.\nSince then I'd come to know her as a fond mother, witty observer, steadfast friend, and vulnerable woman whose hopes for happiness had been dashed early in life. She was a comfortable person to talk to, even when she was cutting a member of the ton to ribbons with her pointed humor. She was my lover without drama, taking and giving without rancor. I wanted to do nothing to lose what I had with her.\nWe reached her house in South Audley Street, and I managed to enter the very modern, monochrome dwelling without breaking down entirely. She called Barnstable, her butler, who seemed to live to administer to my aches and pains. He had massaged balm into my injured leg when I'd hurt it deeply this winter and helped heal my wounds after I'd fought with a French officer during the Berkeley Square affair.\nThis time, he led me upstairs to the spare bedroom in which I'd slept before, bustling about to fetch me a nightshirt, tea, and laudanum.\nI let him light the fire and warm the blankets for me--or rather, he gave sharp orders to Lady Breckenridge's maids and footmen to do so--but after he departed, I poured the laudanum-laced tea into the fire. I did not want to risk that Gabriella would turn up hurt or dead while I slumbered too deeply to wake.\nI did realize that I needed to rest. I could only push myself so far, and I had to be ready to take up the hunt for her again. I also knew that Donata would be as good as her word. If she said she'd stir her friends and neighbors to join the search, she would.\nI decided to rest a few hours in the bed Barnstable had prepared for me, the same one in which I'd lain months ago when I'd strained my knee. The room was small but elegant, in pale green with tasteful plaster medallions on the walls and a candelabra lending a warm glow to the night. I lay down in the bed, pulling the blankets over me because the air had cooled, and closed my eyes.\nI was still awake half an hour later when Lady Breckenridge joined me. She snuggled against me under the blankets, as though perfectly prepared to stay all night.\n\"I sent word to Lady Aline,\" she said. \"She promised to pass the news along. She is sending word to Sir Gideon Derwent, who will know some likely places to look, being a reformer. I also sent word to your Mrs. Brandon, though she has already retired for the night.\"\n\"Louisa. Dear God, I forgot all about her.\"\nDonata rose on her elbow and sent me a speculative look. \"Surely not.\"\nI scrubbed my face, noting the stiff bristles on my jaw. \"She was to have come to my rooms this afternoon, so that I could take her to meet Gabriella. She never turned up. She might have missed us when we went out searching, but she would have waited.\"\n\"Perhaps she simply could not come,\" Donata said.\n\"She would have sent word.\"\n\"Well, she is home now and in any case will know what has happened. Call on her when you wake up.\"\n\"I will never sleep. I poured away the laudanum.\"\nShe lay down again, draping her arm across my chest. \"You will break Barnstable's heart, you know. But you must sleep. I will stay until you do.\"\nI knew what she meant. Felicity had offered me the same thing, except that Lady Breckenridge did not offer out of pity.\nI laced my hand through her hair, wanting to tell her no, but instead I found myself pulling her to me. In the darkness, she slid her body over mine.\nShe gave me comfort in that high tester bed, and when she lay beside me again, I fell quickly asleep.\nAs morning brightened, I made ready to visit Louisa. Barnstable shaved me as well as any valet; he'd procured a razor to have ready for my visits, seemingly delighted that his mistress had taken a paramour. Barnstable approved of me. Perhaps, I thought with wry humor, because I gave him a chance to practice his remedies. My humor wronged him; he was an excellent butler and took fine care of Lady Breckenridge.\nLady Breckenridge, awake and dressed in a morning gown of ecru silk, her hair under a small cap, announced her intention of accompanying me to the Brandons'.\n\"You hate rising early,\" I said, surprised. And yet, she was on her feet, her eyes as bright as though she'd slept all night instead of snatching a few hours between dawn and full light.\nShe gave me a faint smile as her maid draped a shawl over her shoulders. \"I am a jealous woman, Gabriel, and I know how fond you are of Louisa Brandon. I will go with you.\"\nI could have argued, but I saw no purpose in it. I was grateful for Donata's help. She could have had many reactions to my daughter's disappearance, but she'd chosen worry and compassion. And further, she'd chosen action. Not for Donata Breckenridge a fit of the vapors and retiring to the country until it was all over.\nShe had her carriage readied to take us on the journey from South Audley Street to Brook Street. As we rolled through clean morning sunshine and cool air, the streets rather empty except for servants on errands, I said, \"You have no need to be jealous of Louisa Brandon, you know. We have always been friends, but nothing more, and since Brandon's troubles this spring, she has been quite attendant on him.\"\nDonata chuckled. \"You are so very literal, Gabriel. I know that you are not slipping off to her bed under the colonel's nose, but you have known Mrs. Brandon for a very long time. You and she share a deep friendship, and you exchange secret smiles when any subject is mentioned about which you and she have a common memory. I feel a bit left out.\"\n\"I beg your pardon,\" I said, heartfelt. \"I had no idea I was being so rude.\"\n\"You cannot help it. I imagine my mother and I do the same thing.\" She raised a delicate brow. \"But do not try to tell me that you regard Mrs. Brandon as you would a sister, because I will not believe you.\"\nI stretched my game leg, moving the tendons so they would not stiffen. I thought of the night Donata and I had just shared together and the scent and feel of her on me. I nuzzled her cheek. \"You have no need of jealousy,\" I repeated. \"None whatsoever.\"\nLady Breckenridge turned her head and met my lips in a kiss. The carriage bumped hard over a stone, and we broke apart, smiling a little.\nI had not quite banished the trepidation in her eyes. By nature of life in the army, Louisa and I had shared circumstances both happy and dire, had seen what men and women living sedately in London would never see. Louisa had been exposed to the full horrors of battle and death, the heat of India and Spain, bitter winters and roasting summers, disease, dysentery, dismemberment, and parasites. She had weathered it all with aplomb, the only thing destroying her peace being her marriage to her stubborn and turbulent husband.\nLady Breckenridge was correct--Louisa and I had shared much and had comforted each other whenever the need arose. Donata was also correct that I would never regard Louisa as a sister. I had been half in love with her most of my life, needing her, at least, until I'd stumbled upon the compelling attraction of Donata Breckenridge.\nWe said nothing more until we reached the Brandon house in Brook Street. A startled Matthews said that the master and mistress were breakfasting, but if we cared to join them, he would take us up.\nIn the dining room, we found Louisa picking at her meal, looking troubled. Brandon was lifting his newspaper, his face red and his breathing quick. We'd interrupted a quarrel, I guessed.\nLouisa raised her head when Matthews announced us and started when she saw Lady Breckenridge. \"Your ladyship.\" She rose hastily. \"Might I offer you breakfast? We are eating simply today, but my cook would be happy to prepare anything you like.\"\nBrandon rose as well, his veil of politeness descending. He pulled a chair from the table and swept a gesture at it. \"Please, sit here, your ladyship. You may have coffee, or chocolate, as you prefer. Matthews, get a footman up here. Her ladyship is hungry.\"\n\"No, indeed.\" Lady Breckenridge gracefully slid into the offered seat and rested her hands on its arms. \"I could not eat a thing at this appalling hour, but I am craving coffee. Fetch some very strong for me, Matthews, if you please.\" She flicked her gaze to Louisa. \"I would never dream of calling on you this early, Mrs. Brandon, and it is horribly rude to interrupt your breakfast, but Gabriel is in trouble, and we must help him.\"\nBrandon and Louisa exchanged a glance. I sat down, nodding at Matthews that I, too, wanted coffee.\n\"We have heard the news,\" Brandon said stiffly. \"My wife insists that it is her fault. Please talk her out of this nonsense, Lacey.\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Eleven\n\nLouisa did indeed look haggard. Her face was gray except for spots of color burning in her cheeks.\n\"How on earth is this your fault, Louisa?\" I asked. \"Gabriella walked away from the rooms in King Street and either has lost herself or someone sinister has her. Or someone benevolent,\" I added, praying that this was the case. The benevolent person might even now be returning Gabriella to her mother. I wanted that circumstance so much it put a sharp taste in my mouth.\nLouisa lifted her gaze, and the shame in her eyes startled me. \"I went to see her,\" she said.\n\"Did you? When? You and I were to go together.\"\n\"I know.\" Louisa's voice strengthened. \"I was too impatient, for which I will berate myself for the rest of my life. I did not want you with me, you see, because I did not want you to hear what I had to say to Carlotta.\"\nI grew still. \"I never gave you the direction to the boardinghouse.\"\n\"You said King Street, Covent Garden. It was easy, once there, to ask for the house in which the two people from France and their daughter stayed. I boldly asked the landlady if I could see Gabriella.\"\nI gripped the arms of my chair. \"And did you see her?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nLouisa's eyes moistened. She must have felt what I had--wonder that Gabriella had grown into such a beautiful young woman, love and pride. I saw in Louisa's eyes joy in Gabriella's intelligence and sweetness, sadness that Louisa had missed watching her blossom.\n\"You spoke to her,\" I said.\nLouisa nodded. At that moment, a footman bustled in balancing a tray with a coffeepot and cups. The wonderful aroma of coffee filled the room. Louisa wiped her eyes while the footman set down the tray, arranged the cups, and laid out the sugar bowl, silver tongs, and a jug of cream. He took the tray and slid from the room while we sat in silence.\nDonata took up the pot and poured coffee into my cup. She knew I liked it black and strong, so while she dropped sugar and cream into her own liquid, she offered me none. She stirred her coffee and cream until it became the color of Felicity's skin.\nLady Breckenridge tapped her spoon lightly on the edge of the cup and set it down, her movements elegant and economical, polished by a host of governesses and nannies. \"What did you say that upset her, Mrs. Brandon?\"\nLouisa's cheeks burned red. Brandon looked on, brows lowered.\n\"I told her that her mother had deserted Gabriel,\" Louisa said. \"I told her exactly what Carlotta had done--cuckolded him and left him for no good reason. I told Gabriella she'd been taken away and lied to because Carlotta did not want her returning to her true father. I told her what Carlotta's actions had done to Gabriel, how wretched he'd been when he'd learned that his daughter was gone forever.\"\n\"Louisa,\" I whispered. \"Dear God.\"\n\"I know it was utterly stupid,\" she said in an anguished voice. \"But Gabriella deserved to know the truth. I know that Carlotta painted you a villain and would have said that she had to run away from you and your cruelty. Carlotta wants her little nest in France with her lover and her children, and you know she will not risk losing Gabriella to you.\"\nI fell silent, having no idea what to say. Louisa liked to be my champion, but I could imagine the effect her words must have had on Gabriella.\nDonata sipped her coffee thoughtfully. \"And Gabriella was visibly upset?\"\n\"Yes.\" Louisa bit her lip, not wanting to look at us. \"She cried. I tried to comfort her, but she would not have me. She told me very clearly to leave. It broke my heart, but I did.\"\n\"You did not see . . . Mrs. Lacey?\" Donata asked.\n\"No. I left Gabriella in the downstairs parlor. By that time I was crying too, and I knew I could not face Carlotta. I decided to go home.\" Silent tears trickled from Louisa's eyes. \"It must have been after that interview that Gabriella left the house. I upset her, and she ran away. She might have been coming to see you, Gabriel, to demand the truth from you, or perhaps she simply wanted to walk and think, I do not know.\" She wiped her cheeks with the heel of her hand. \"I will not ask your forgiveness, because I do not deserve it.\"\nI sat in stunned silence, trying to take in what she had told me.\nBrandon noisily gulped his morning chocolate, leaving a dark stain above his upper lip. He wiped it away with a napkin. \"You are not to blame, Louisa. She might have walked out of the house because you upset her, but if she got lost, it is not your fault.\" He shrugged his broad shoulders. \"Who knows? She might have gone straight upstairs and had a row with her mother, and then decided to run away. Carlotta Lacey, as I recall, could try a saint's patience.\"\nHe flicked a glance at me but did not apologize. He had thought Carlotta a flighty woman from the first and had never been overly friendly to her.\n\"The point upon which we must focus,\" Lady Breckenridge cut in crisply, \"is not why Gabriella left the house, but where she went.\"\n\"I have been over that in my head,\" I said. I felt relief and gratitude toward Donata for simply being there. \"If she tried to go back to Grimpen Lane, she'd walk through Covent Garden to Russel Street. That is a straightforward route, no reason to go any other way.\"\n\"Perhaps she stopped to shop in the market and got turned around,\" Donata suggested. \"She thought she was heading toward Grimpen Lane when, in fact, she was walking down Southampton Street. This is her first time in London--England even--and she might easily have become confused.\"\nLouisa had said nothing, remaining with her head bowed, the golden curls at her forehead trembling. So worried was I over Gabriella's disappearance that I did blame Louisa at present. She'd had no right to tell Gabriella those things, no right to interfere. Louisa thought she'd acted for my sake, but had she? I had told her to leave Gabriella and Carlotta alone, and Louisa had not listened.\nColonel Brandon broke in. \"It seems to me, Lacey, that you are predicting dire events before the fact. Perhaps the girl simply made her way back to France. She was upset and wanted to go home. If she had money and was resourceful, she could buy a coach ticket to Dover. Or she could have stolen whatever tickets and money her parents had put aside for their return. Or sold gewgaws or some such, in her determination to go home.\"\n\"Alone?\" I asked. \"A young woman as well raised as she would not think to travel alone. No maid went with her.\"\n\"My reasoning takes in the fact that she is your daughter,\" Brandon said. \"And you are the most bloody stubborn man I know. If Gabriella decided to return by herself to France, I am certain she would try to do it no matter what she had to do to get there. I know you have done more than a few damn fool things in your past, and you succeeded only by dint of your refusal to see reason. Young girl or no, she is a Lacey.\"\nI sat still, torn between pride and irritation. \"You do have a point,\" I said tightly. \"I will check the coaching inns in and around London to see if she boarded a mail coach.\" Another thought struck me. \"Auberge told me that they'd brought Gabriella to London with them because an unsuitable young man was pursuing her. We might be making a mare's nest of this, when all she's done is elope.\"\n\"As you did,\" Brandon said.\n\"As I did. And as Carlotta did with Auberge.\"\n\"We'll find her, Lacey,\" Brandon said. He sat back in his chair, sipping his chocolate as though it were finest brandy. \"I know a commander whose soldiers are in sad need of something to do. Drilling is making them soft. I'll have him put them on to hunting down your daughter.\"\nI stared at him, touched that he would want to help. \"Thank you,\" I said.\nHe scowled at me. \"You did save my neck from the noose, damn you.\"\n\"If you find my daughter, sir, we will be more than even.\"\n\"Thank God,\" Brandon said, and fervently drank his chocolate.\n*** *** ***\n\"Where to now?\" Lady Breckenridge asked when we were in her carriage again.\n\"You do not have to do this,\" I told her. \"Have your coachman set you down at home, although I would be grateful for a ride back to Grimpen Lane. I must find Pomeroy and check in with Auberge.\"\nDonata looked at me without expression. \"Of course I must do this. She is your daughter, and I will do everything I can to help you find her.\" She leaned out of her window. \"John, take us to Russel Street in Covent Garden.\"\nI heard her coachman's terse, \"Yes, my lady,\" then his chirrup to the horses as we clopped off down Davies Street toward Berkeley Square and south.\nWe rode through awakening London, neither of us speaking much, then Lady Breckenridge's coachman stopped in Russel Street to let us descend. I expected Lady Breckenridge would want to wait for me in the comfort of her coach, but she bade her footman help her down after me.\nDonata had never seen my rooms, and I hoped she had no intention of coming to them now. But she walked with me serenely down the lane, her skirts lifted out of the mud.\nMrs. Beltan's bake shop was open, and business was thriving. I suggested that Lady Breckenridge wait there for me and enjoy Mrs. Beltan's yeasty bread.\n\"Not a bit of it, Gabriel,\" Donata said. \"Let us be scandalous and ascend to your rooms.\"\nI stopped her. \"I live rather meagerly.\"\n\"I gathered that. Do not be vulgar; I care nothing for your money, or lack of it. Worrying about money is only for the parvenu. We of breeding shrug it from our shoulders.\"\n\"It is a very convenient thing, on the other hand,\" I said, trying to keep my voice light.\n\"Gabriel, I have fountains of money, if you wish to continue on this vulgar footing. Let us please cease speaking of it; it is making me queasy.\"\nHer sardonic smile was firmly in place, and again, I felt gratitude. She was trying to put me at my ease.\nI led her into the stairwell. She looked around in curiosity, taking in the faded murals with the shepherdesses and shepherds of old chasing each other in idyllic bliss. Halfway up, I handed her to a stair above me and kissed her.\nShe eased away when we finished, looking pleased. \"Donata,\" I began.\nA door above us opened and Grenville's weary tones floated down to us. \"Lacey, is that you?\" He stepped out to the dark landing and looked down. \"Oh, I do beg your pardon. I am a gooseberry, am I?\"\nTo hear the most fashionable man in England describe himself as a gooseberry made me laugh, the first amusement I'd felt since Gabriella had gone missing.\n\"I stayed the night,\" he said, ushering us into the sitting room. \"I hope you do not mind. Matthias and Bartholomew fixed me up well.\"\nThe two young footmen were sitting on either side of my table, going at a repast that looked like all my breakfasts for the past week combined. The tray that Grenville must have eaten from, the plate scraped clean of food, reposed next to the wing chair.\nMatthias and Bartholomew sprang to their feet when they saw Lady Breckenridge, Bartholomew hastily chewing a buttered slab of bread.\n\"Steady, lads. Finish your meal,\" I said. \"Any news?\"\nGrenville sent me a grim look. \"I hoped you would bring some. No, we searched until we could not keep our eyes open, then I returned here for a few hours' sleep. Pomeroy's lads are still at it, as is my coachman, and Matthias and Bartholomew have been in and out. I succumbed to sleep; I am sorry.\"\n\"I did as well, but we may start fresh. Have you heard from Auberge this morning?\"\n\"Yes. He came as I was getting out of bed. No, she did not return.\"\nI took the news unhappily, but I'd somehow known that would be the outcome. I told Grenville of Brandon's idea that Gabriella had tried to journey back to France, and Grenville agreed that it was a possibility.\nAnd so the second day of the search for Gabriella began. Jackson returned with a fresh set of patrollers, five of them this time. Lady Breckenridge's servants joined in, two footmen and a coachman, and before long, servants from the households that Lady Breckenridge and Lady Aline had notified turned up, ready to look. Nancy and Felicity came as well, with a couple of girls in tow.\nAt the last came Colonel Brandon. He turned an uncomfortable shade of red as Grenville, neat and fresh and shaved despite making do with my bed, stared at him in surprise. Brandon had brought four others with him, lieutenants of the regiment he'd said needed something to do. We could not all crowd into my rooms, and so we spread out among Grimpen Lane while Grenville and I gave orders. A few urchins who generally hung about looking for handouts or odd jobs also said they'd join, for appropriate pay, of course.\nI outlined the task: Comb London and find Gabriella or find out where she'd gone. I sent a contingent to check the coaching inns, the urchins to check the bawdy houses, for which some of them already did jobs. A few of the patrollers were to make their way up and down the river, asking the watermen if they'd found her in the night.\nI sent Brandon's soldiers farther afield, to check the roads that led from London, especially those toward France. They were to ask at every inn and every posting point if anyone had seen a young girl, either alone or with anyone else, pass that way. Colonel Brandon joined them, riding out on their cavalry-trained horses.\nThey dispersed, and Grenville walked with me back upstairs. \"What shall I do, Lacey? You did not give me an assignment.\"\nWe entered the sitting room, where Lady Breckenridge had been watching out the window. She joined us when we came in. \"I need the two of you for inside information on Mayfair,\" I said. \"I am not completely convinced that searching alone will be the answer, either for Gabriella or for Black Bess.\"\nGrenville cocked a brow. \"Inside information?\"\n\"Yes.\" I described seeing the coach stopped last night in Covent Garden, while the gentleman fetched himself a girl. \"I met him with you once, I believe. Mr. Stacy?\"\n\"Jeremiah Stacy?\" Grenville looked taken aback, then thoughtful. \"I cannot see him doing such a thing; he is a shy man. If you had said his friend Brian McAdams, I could believe it. McAdams enjoys erotic novels and talking rather crudely about the act.\" He caught Lady Breckenridge's eye and blushed. \"I do beg your pardon.\"\nDonata waved away his apology. \"Do not be reticent on my account. My husband knew every crudity invented and openly boasted of doing each one, in my hearing. I think I can no longer be disgusted.\"\nGrenville looked embarrassed, and familiar anger for the dead Lord Breckenridge simmered.\n\"You could not have mistaken McAdams for Stacy, could you?\" Grenville asked me. \"If it were dark. Perhaps Stacy lent him the coach?\"\n\"No, it was Stacy. I remember him distinctly. He has a very long nose and a tall, lanky build, correct?\"\n\"Yes,\" Grenville said. \"McAdams is beefy. I never thought Stacy would slum. Not the type, I should think.\"\n\"I mean to ask him. I'll send around my card and pay a call.\" Because Grenville had introduced me to Mr. Stacy, I could presume to call on the man or at least arrange to meet him somewhere.\n\"He won't be at home this morning. He'll be at Tatt's. That's his passion, horseflesh. At least, I would have said so before you told me this. I'll go with you, and we'll quiz him.\"\nLady Breckenridge leaned against the writing table and crossed her ankles. \"You think he might have something to do with Gabriella?\"\n\"I have no thoughts one way or the other,\" I said. \"He might have seen something while he was busy chatting up game girls. He might know something about Mary Chester and Black Bess. He might know something about Gabriella. Then again, he might know nothing at all and is simply enjoying having it off with girls from Covent Garden.\"\n\"Well, we can quiz him at any rate,\" Grenville said. \"I'll take you to Tatt's this afternoon. What else do you want us to do to storm Mayfair?\"\n\"If you know of any other gentleman with a fixation on street girls, please tell me,\" I said. \"I will quiz every one of them if I have to.\"\n\"My husband certainly knew gentlemen of odd tastes,\" Lady Breckenridge said. \"I could find out what some of them have been getting up to, lately.\"\n\"Thinking of you even speaking to them is repugnant to me,\" I said.\nShe shrugged. \"I am not overly fond of them myself, but I can find out what they know without much trouble. I will ask Barnstable to invade their servants' halls and refresh himself on gossip. He'll enjoy it.\"\nI had no doubt that Lady Breckenridge's energetic butler would be delighted to be asked to help with covert investigation.\n\"What will you do?\" Grenville asked. \"While we're hard at it?\"\nI had thought of my idea last night before Lady Breckenridge found me. \"I want to pay a visit to a nearby house, one Marianne showed me during the Hanover Square investigation. It's possible that Gabriella or Black Bess went there.\"\nGrenville looked dubious. \"Are you definitely connecting the two--or the three, rather--disappearances?\"\n\"I do not know whether to connect them. But two game girls vanish from Covent Garden, and then my daughter goes, all in the space of a few weeks. I hardly think it coincidence. Brandon reminded me that Gabriella was my daughter--but that is only another point toward her being kidnapped. I go off halfcocked, but I am also resourceful. Unless her mother has purged that quality completely from her, I doubt Gabriella would have run away without preparing. Everything points to her having meant to return to the boardinghouse quickly. No bundle of clothing missing, none of her personal possessions gone. I will ask Auberge whether she stole any money from him or Carlotta, but I feel in my bones that she did not.\"\n\"But if she eloped,\" Lady Breckenridge said, \"she might have gone with the clothes on her back and trusted the young man to provide for her. Perhaps this man is quite rich, and his unsuitable qualities are something besides lack of funds. \"\n\"True,\" Grenville said. \"He might be a bounder, or have a reputation for ruining young women, or have a gambling addiction. So many things can attract a young woman and upset her parents at the same time.\" He winced as he said it, having discovered his own daughter in a marriage with a man he found detestable.\nI wondered which scenario disturbed me more, the thought of Gabriella snatched as she innocently walked through the square or the idea of her willingly running off with a rakehell.\n\"I will certainly ask Auberge all about him,\" I said. I looked at them, my friends so ready to drop their appointments for the day to help me. Grenville, the great man of fashion, had turned his back on a social engagement the night before to keep searching for Gabriella. I could not help but be touched by their generosity.\n\"Thank you,\" I said. \"To the pair of you.\"\nTrue to their upbringing, both looked slightly embarrassed at being caught out doing good deeds.\n\"My dear friend,\" Grenville said. \"I would a hundred times rather help you find your only daughter than be at home to the dozens of dandies and aristocrats who assail me at White's, coffeehouses, and gaming hells. Most of them are half-drunk and only want my approval on their cravat knots and the cut of their coats. Their company, quite frankly, has palled. Far more interesting things happen around you.\"\n\"I am happy I can provide entertainment,\" I began, but I did not mean it harshly. I'd said the words so many times that they had become rather a joke between us.\n\"More than just entertainment. You soothe my vanity by making me think I can actually do some good in the world.\"\n\"It must be difficult being one of the wealthiest, most influential men in England,\" I said.\nGrenville gave me an ironic glance, but let it go.\nLady Breckenridge came to me. \"I am quite fond of you, of course, Gabriel, but I also very much enjoy prying into the affairs of my Mayfair neighbors. The veneer hides such sordid secrets, I have always found. I can dig through the dirt for you and feel virtuous at the same time.\" She laughed softly, self-deprecating.\n\"In other words, we don't help entirely for your sake,\" Grenville said. \"We are selfish and pleasure-loving.\"\n\"Precisely,\" Donata said.\nThey were not at all these things, but I let them have their pretense.\n\"Well, no matter your motives, I do need you. Go home and rest, Grenville, then we'll meet for Tatt's.\" I touched Donata's shoulder. \"You gossip to your heart's content and ask Barnstable to visit servants' halls. Send for me anytime you like.\"\nDonata slanted me a smile, telling me without words when she'd like to send for me. Lady Breckenridge was not a fainting flower with false modesty. She enjoyed desire and saw no reason to hide the fact.\nGrenville rubbed his chin as though his makeshift shave in my rooms hadn't suited him. \"I'll hunt up Jackson, Lacey, and have him take you where you need to go in my carriage. I'll take a hackney home.\"\n\"Generous of you.\"\n\"Jackson needs the exercise. And if you're determined to go alone, I want someone with you who will report to me when you forget to.\"\nI acknowledged the hint. Often, when I was in the heat of an investigation, I pursued things on my own without calling in Grenville, and this offended him.\n\"I will not be alone. I plan to take Major Auberge with me.\"\n\"Will you?\" Grenville asked, brows rising. \"Why?\"\n\"Because I need to know about my daughter. And much as it pains me, he knows her far better than I do.\"\nGrenville acknowledged this with a sympathetic glance, but he said nothing. Lady Breckenridge rose on her tiptoes, pressed a kiss to my cheek, and with her back to Grenville, gave my forearm a surreptitious and suggestive stroke. Then she turned away as though she'd done nothing untoward.\n\"Never mind the hackney, Grenville,\" she said. \"You will ride back in my carriage, and we shall talk about people.\"\n\"An excellent idea,\" Grenville said.\nHe offered her his arm, and the two strolled out. Grenville's cool sardonic tones floated up the stairs. \"By the bye, did you notice Rafe Godwin's fantastic ballooning pantaloons at Lady Woodward's musicale Tuesday night?\"\n\"Ghastly,\" Lady Breckenridge agreed. \"I quite expected him to float to the ceiling.\" Grenville's laugh answered her, and then they were gone.\nI closed the door. The two of them occupied a world I did not understand. It would never occur to me to made witty comments on a gentleman's pantaloons, no matter how ridiculous I found them. Lady Breckenridge and Grenville delighted in such things, and yet, I'd come to value their good sense.\nI gathered what I wanted and went downstairs to walk to King Street.\nAuberge proved willing to resume the hunt with me. As we left the boardinghouse, Jackson, responding to Grenville's command that he drive me about, pulled up in Grenville's carriage. I gave Jackson the direction to a house in a lane off High Holborn, and I climbed inside with Auberge. Auberge's face was chalk white, his eyes sunken, and I realized that he had not slept at all.\nI did not see Carlotta at the boardinghouse. Auberge had come down alone, and quickly, although I heard a door bang as he descended the stairs. He thanked me for looking him up then said nothing as we left King Street and went north toward Long Acre.\nAs we pulled up in front of the house near High Holborn, Auberge finally bestirred himself. \"I'd hoped when I saw you coming you had brought good news with you.\"\n\"I wanted to,\" I answered.\n\"My wife . . .\" He flinched then went past the awkwardness. \"She wants to return to France after we find Gabriella. She has always hated England. But if we do, I do not know how to do the divorce, then.\"\n\"The solicitors will find a way if they suspect a hefty fee,\" I said. \"Why do you say she hates England? She had everything here, friends, a come-out, a country home. Her father was a squire. He was enraged that I'd married her, but that was to be expected, since we'd eloped without permission. Then I dragged her off to India, where she was miserable.\"\n\"She married you to get away from her father.\" Auberge's voice held more life now, as though surprised he had to tell me this. \"She disliked India, but she hated England more. You did not know this?\"\n\"She never mentioned it.\" Or at least, not that I remembered. If Carlotta had ever tried to tell me, I had not listened very hard. I had been young and brash and full of myself.\nI wanted to ask him why Carlotta had wanted to flee her father, but we needed to descend.\nIt had been a year since I'd knocked on the door of the small, quiet-looking house, but the same maid answered it, and she looked me up and down with the same belligerence. \"It's you, is it? What'yer want?\"\n\"Does the woman called Lady still live here? I would like to see her.\"\n\"Maybe she does, maybe she don't.\" She switched her black gaze to Auberge. \"Who's he when he's at home?\"\n\"His name is Major Auberge,\" I said.\nThe belligerence increased. \"Is he a Frog? What's he want to come here for?\"\nI wasn't certain if she meant this house or England altogether. \"If Lady is here, I would be obliged if you'd take her my card.\"\nThe maid gave me another once over, and her expression changed to mere sullenness. \"She liked you last time. Said you were a gentleman, and not many like you about.\" She snatched the ivory rectangle I held out to her. \"I'll see if she's receiving.\" The maid backed up and slammed the door in my face.\nI leaned against the brick of the house, settling in to wait.\n\"What is this place?\" Auberge asked, gazing up at it. He saw what I saw, gray-brown brick, a brown-painted door, windows blank with no one looking out of them, some of them shuttered.\n\"A lying-in house for game girls and courtesans. Some benevolent person set it up, I still do not know who, but the girls pay their bed and board. It is a sort of place for them to go when they can go nowhere else. I found it a year ago when I was searching for another missing girl.\"\nAuberge looked at me. \"Did you find this girl?\"\nI couldn't lie. \"Not in time.\"\nHis gaze held mine a moment, then he turned away, though not before I'd caught the fear in his moist eyes. I think I realized at that moment how much he loved Gabriella.\nThe door opened again, and the maid reappeared. \"Come on, then.\"\nShe took us to the small, rather shabby sitting room where I'd waited the last time I'd been here. Marianne Simmons had brought me to this place, thinking that perhaps the girl I'd sought had come here to give birth. She had been wrong, but I'd met a woman called \"Lady,\" a young woman of the gentry by her accent and manner, who had come here for her own lying-in and then stayed to help the other girls.\nLady would not tell me her real name nor the name of the man who'd impregnated her. I had thought of her off and on over the last year, but had made no inquiry, fearing to destroy the haven she'd found here. If the young woman had wanted to or had been able to go home, no doubt she would have gone. She seemed competent and intelligent and resourceful, the sort of young woman who knew what she wanted.\nWhen Lady entered the room, I saw that the year had changed her little. She still moved with confidence and grace, and her face was unlined and serene. A small linen cap covered her dark hair, and she wore a dark serge gown with a raised waistline and no adornment. She looked much like a servant, but her manners made it plain that she was not.\nShe dropped a curtsy to me and then extended her hand. \"Captain Lacey. It is a pleasure to see you again.\"\n\"And a pleasure to see you. Is all well?\"\n\"Indeed. You may not believe me, but I enjoy staying here and helping the girls. Some of them dislike me for interfering, others are grateful. It is of no matter.\"\n\"And you have not changed your mind about giving me your real name?\"\nShe shook her head. \"I will not. On the other hand, I have read much about you in the newspapers, stories about how cleverly you help the magistrates find murderers. I read them with interest.\"\n\"Thank you,\" I said with some dismay. The newspapers either exaggerated or got things blatantly wrong. \"This is Major Henri Auberge, from France. We would like to ask you a few questions, about girls who have gone missing.\"\nHer expression became troubled. \"Missing? Street girls, you mean?\"\n\"Yes. And one other.\" I gestured for her to sit, which she did, again gracefully. I moved to shut the door to the sitting room against the noise of female shouting upstairs. The maid, who had stationed herself near the open door, flashed a disappointed glance at me as I closed her out.\nI took a seat facing Lady, and Auberge sat rather awkwardly on a tattered Sheridan sofa.\n\"Do you know of girls named Black Bess and Mary Chester?\" I asked Lady.\n\"Goodness, yes,\" she said at once. \"Both of them have come here. Mary to have a baby, Black Bess because she was ill after she'd rid herself of one.\"\nMi interest piqued. \"When did these events happen?\"\n\"With Black Bess, a year ago. She's managed to keep herself from increasing since then, but that may be because the abortionist damaged her. She was quite ill, poor thing.\"\n\"Damn all quacks,\" I said. \"I beg your pardon. What about Mary Chester?\"\n\"Mrs. Chester had her baby not long ago. April, I believe. She was relieved it had come then because she didn't want to face her man, a sailor who was supposed to return on a merchantman in early May. She had the baby and gave it up. I believe the ship was late in returning as well, and she was happy she would be able to face him without him being the wiser. Broke her heart, though. Mary is rather a simple girl, but a good one, at least as good as she can be living the life of a street girl. Her father sold her to a brothel when she was twelve, and she has been struggling ever since. She is fond of Mr. Chester--calls herself Mrs. Chester--but she still plies her trade when he's gone; she knows how to do nothing else. He leaves her money, but it runs out, of course.\" Lady twined her long-fingered hands together. Her nails were white and clean and trimmed. \"Why do you ask about her, Captain?\"\n\"I fear I have to tell you that Mary Chester is dead.\"\nShe stared at me, her lips parted. \"Oh dear. I hadn't known she was ill. Why didn't she come here?\"\n\"She was not ill. She was killed.\"\nHer gentle face whitened with shock. \"Killed . . . ?\"\n\"I do not know how she died, but it looked to be murder.\" I described how Mary had been found in a back lane between the Strand and the river. \"Mr. Thompson of the Thames River patrol is investigating, but I do not know yet what he has turned up.\"\n\"How terrible.\" Lady straightened her skirt with a shaking hand, trying to remain composed. \"Poor Sam Chester.\"\n\"Thompson must have broken it to him by now. I am afraid that Mr. Chester will be suspected. Motive: jealousy. Perhaps he discovered that she'd been pregnant with another man's baby and grew angry. He seemed to be understanding of her profession when I interviewed him, but perhaps he hid his true feelings from me. And Mary had mentioned to her friends that she was to meet a wealthy gentleman in Covent Garden. His jealousy might have gotten the better of him.\"\nLady shook her head. \"Not Sam Chester. I have met him a few times. He is gentle, even though he is a sailor. I doubt he could ever hurt Mary.\"\nI rested my hand on the cool brass handle of my walking stick. \"I agree with you. I liked him and was sorry for him. He seemed genuinely worried. The magistrate, however, will want an easy solution to a sordid case unless the true culprit is discovered. Do you know who was the father of Mary's child?\"\n\"No, she never said. She might not have known--he might have been one of her customers. Likewise, I do not know who is this wealthy gentleman you mention. The only man she ever talked about to me was Sam Chester. She loved him.\"\n\"Black Bess--who did she talk about?\"\n\"Oh, heavens, never tell me she has been killed too?\"\n\"I do not know. She has disappeared as well. She, too, has a young man, a laborer who lives near Drury Lane. I have not spoken to him yet, but it seems she had the same sort of understanding with him that Mary Chester did with Sam. She mentioned meeting a wealthy man in Covent Garden, same as Mary.\"\n\"I truly wish I could help, Captain,\" Lady said, distress in her eyes. \"But I cannot. I have not heard from the others of a wealthy man offering them more than a night, and if I may say it, Captain, more than one highborn gentleman has had his way with street girls.\" Her cheeks burned red.\n\"I know. I have my eye on one, whom I will shake about, but I know of no others. This is an imposition, but could you ask the other girls? If a wealthy man has been preying on them in Covent Garden, I want to find him. They might confide in you more than they would in me.\"\nLady inclined her head. \"Of course. Anything I can do to help.\" She looked curiously at Auberge, who had followed the discussion without a word.\n\"Now to the more difficult question,\" I said. \"My own daughter has gone missing. She is seventeen, the same age as the game girls, and she has quite vanished.\" I swallowed hard as I said the last word. Auberge bowed his head, not protesting that I called her my daughter. \"Her name is Gabriella. Do you know anything, anything, about her?\"\nLady's eyes softened with compassion. \"Captain, I am so sorry. I am afraid I have heard nothing about it, although I will ask the girls who come in. She was not a . . .\"\nShe left the question hanging, and all at once, I saw Lady as a refined young lady sitting in her parlor, pouring tea and talking of her charitable works with her father's friends. She did not belong here, and yet, she seemed to fit here, like a benevolent young mother to troubled children.\n\"She is not a game girl,\" I said. \"She lived most of her life in France and knows nothing of London and its ways.\"\n\"I am sorry,\" Lady said. \"I will certainly keep my eyes open and ask the girls to also. If they know anything at all, where may I send word?\"\n\"Any number of places.\" I withdrew one of my cards and a stub of pencil and began scribbling. \"My rooms in Grimpen Lane or the bake shop below it. Grenville's house in Grosvenor Street. The Bow Street Public Office, or number 31 King Street, a boardinghouse there. Ask for Madame or Major Auberge.\"\nLady took the card, and her brown gaze flicked again to Auberge, clearly wondering how he fit into all this. He stirred and offered his hand. \"I, too, am Gabriella's father. Her--how do you say in English? Stepfather.\"\nI saw the flash of confusion on Lady's face while she struggled to remain politely impassive. It was highly unusual for a father and a stepfather to be alive at the same time. That we were suggested scandal, but Lady was far too well bred to inquire into it, or even betray any interest in the situation.\nI rose, ready to return to the search. Lady got to her feet with us. \"I will do what I can, Captain. I promise.\"\nShe shook our hands prettily, again reminding me of the gentleman's daughter in her drawing room.\nI did not release her hand, but held it and said in a low voice, \"Tell me who you are. I can restore you to your family, I swear to you. Or, I know people who could arrange a marriage for you, a good one.\" I felt confident that between Grenville, Louisa, Lady Aline, and the Derwents, we could find a kind man happy to have such a pretty and compassionate wife, no matter what had happened in her unfortunate past.\nLady's smile deepened, and amusement twinkled in her eyes. \"You do not understand, Captain. I am happy here. This is my family, as odd as they are. My own family, I am afraid, are in no hurry to see me restored.\"\n\"A marriage then. Let me do something.\"\nShe shook her head and gently but firmly withdrew her hand. \"It is difficult to explain. At home, I did little besides look pretty in a frock and play at the harp and paint insipid watercolors. I was nothing, and I did not even know it. If I marry, I will be nothing again, a wife in a cap who arranges fetes and paints more insipid watercolors.\" She spread her hands to indicate the room and beyond. \"Here, I found myself. After my initial distress, I realized that, at last, I could be useful. I can help a girl who is in despair, I can try to make her life better. They need someone like that, even if some of them hate me for it. The midwives and doctors will come here because of me, the apothecary will let me have medicines for little or nothing. The girls need me. I want to stay here. Please, Captain, do not inform my family, and do not find me a husband. Let me stay and do what I was meant to do.\"\nHer eyes glowed fervently, and I thought I understood. I bowed to her. \"I will keep your secret. But if you ever change your mind, you know you have only to come to me.\"\nShe smiled, dimples appearing at the corners of her mouth. \"You are a kind man. I will help you all I can. Good day, Captain.\"\n\"Good day to you, Lady.\" I bowed again and left the room, joining Auberge, who waited, under the scrutiny of the curious maid, in the foyer.\nWe traveled back down High Holborn in near silence. As the carriage rolled along Drury Lane toward Long Acre, Auberge lifted his head and said, \"I am in near despair, Lacey. What do I do if Gabriella is truly gone?\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Twelve\n\nI clenched the handle of my walking stick. \"Not despair. Not yet. We must not give in yet.\"\nAs Auberge continued to watch me in anguish, I drew a breath and said, \"Good God, man, how do you think I feel knowing that if I had not expressed interest in finding Carlotta and Gabriella, she would even now be happily home in France with you. Denis used that interest to hunt them down and bring them here, where her world turned over. He never would have, but he saw how much I wanted to find them, and he did it to have leverage over me. How do you think that makes me feel?\"\nAuberge only watched me stonily. \"We were caught up in our own worries about this divorce, and we neglected her. If I had been more careful . . . If I had left her with my brother . . .\"\n\"We can flog ourselves until we bleed,\" I said. \"You brought her with you because of a young man, you said. Tell me about him. Is he the sort of blackguard who'd follow her to England and convince her to elope?\"\nAuberge switched to French, his words flowing more easily. \"I would not say so. Emile is no worse than any other young man. He is a few years older than Gabriella and will come into his money when he is aged twenty-five. We wished them to wait until then, but Gabriella is impetuous.\" He sighed. \"I love Gabriella dearly, but she is stubborn. My God, but she is stubborn.\"\nI smiled grimly. \"I am not surprised. She comes from a long line of stubborn men and women. I eloped with her mother, and so did you, and I am afraid now that Gabriella knows that, she will use it as leverage in her argument to marry him.\"\nHis eyes crinkled, his despair lightening a little. \"No doubt.\"\n\"What is it about Carlotta that made us both run off with her?\" I mused. \"Her air of distressed innocence, I suppose.\"\nTo my surprise, Auberge smiled. \"She had her way, you know, even as we thought we were having ours. She is stubborn.\"\n\"So I learned.\" I paused. \"And you are--fond--of her?\"\n\"I love her deeply.\" He answered with a French lack of shame about sentiment. \"I know we wronged you. I knew even when I carried her to my home. But you never came after her.\"\n\"I gave up, I suppose. I'd tried to be a good husband, and failed. I knew in my heart that she was better off with you. Happier. I am not amazed that she ran away with you. She must have hated me.\"\nAuberge gave me a surprised look. \"Carlotta never hated you. She was upset when we ran away, saying that you were a good man and that she hated to hurt you. She cried to think on what you would feel when you discovered her gone.\"\nI stared, astonished. \"Did she? She left a letter for Louisa. Not even a note for me,\" I finished bitterly.\n\"She could not bring herself to write it. She knew she wronged you. She would not have written at all, but I persuaded her to leave a letter for Madame Brandon.\"\n\"I nearly went off my head,\" I said. \"Poor Louisa had to break the news to me, and then stop me from violence. I was sore angry.\"\nAuberge reddened. \"I know it was a terrible thing. But not only was Carlotta unhappy as an army wife, but she had just learned you were returning to England, and she was frantic not to go back there. She would do anything not to go to England, including run away with a French officer to a farm near Lyon. She could disappear forever, become Madame Auberge, and none would know. I was the--as you call it--blackguard. I was in love with her, and I did not try too much to persuade her to stay with you.\"\nI looked at him in puzzlement. \"You said that before, that Carlotta wanted to leave England forever. The eagerness with which she accepted my proposal astonished me, and I flattered myself that she loved me madly. But your words paint a different picture. She wanted to leave England, and India was as far away from England as anything can be.\"\nAuberge nodded. \"Her father wanted her to marry a certain gentleman, she told me. This man had money, and her father needed to extricate himself from a very nasty debt. But the man was repugnant to Carlotta. He was much older than she, and lecherous. He wanted only to get his hands on a young girl, if you see. When she refused him, her father beat her quite harshly, and threatened to force the marriage.\" He paused. \"Carlotta said that as a good Church of England girl, she did not believe in miracles and magic, but she thought that God must have sent you to her to save her from misery. What she suffered following the drum, she said, was nothing to what she would have suffered as this man's wife.\"\nI stared in astonishment. \"Why the devil did she not tell me this?\"\n\"I do not know. She was young and afraid. Perhaps if you discovered that she'd been so disobedient, you would take her back to her father? It is not Carlotta's way to think clearly all the time. I suppose she decided to simply be happy with you and far from her father.\"\n\"If she had told me . . .\" I sat back, awash in regret for the past and what had not been. \"I would have been kinder. I would have told her she need have no fear of her father ever again. She was, and is, a Lacey. We are not known for giving back what we have.\" I frowned. \"But why did Carlotta fear returning to England later, when she was safely married to me? She was out of her father's reach by then.\"\n\"I do not know,\" Auberge said. \"I know only that she was afraid and wanted to run away with me. I did not question her too closely, and I have let it lie ever since. I must admit that I was pleased that Carlotta wanted to leave you for me, and I did not want her to change her mind. And so I took her away.\" He gazed at me, his look defiant.\n\"And as you say,\" I said lightly. \"She had her way.\"\nAuberge gave me a faint smile. \"She had her way coming to London this time, as well. When we received the letter from Mr. Denis, I wanted to refuse. But Carlotta wished to come. Her father is dead now, and she wants the divorce from you so she can marry me in truth. We live in a Catholic country, and although I am not devout, divorce is difficult there. Carlotta does not care at all about the Catholic Church; she wants only the divorce and then a quick English marriage to me. That way, in her mind, it will all be fair. We long ago began the fiction that Madame and Major Auberge had married in England, so that our neighbors would not wonder that our parish had no record of it, and she wants it to be true.\"\n\"I see. That sounds like Carlotta.\" I thought a moment. \"And if Denis had not put the idea into her head, she likely would still be there with you on your little French farm.\"\n\"Possibly. I confess to you that Carlotta had to argue a long time with me before I agreed. I feared, you see, that when she saw you again, and you still her husband, well . . .\" He lifted his hands in a shrug.\n\"You thought she would want to come back to me? And you profess to know Carlotta.\"\n\"I thought that you would claim your rights to her. You are her true husband. You have the English law behind you. I am only the Frog roue who stole your wife.\"\n\"My life with Carlotta finished years ago,\" I said, realizing the truth. \"She is not my possession, whatever the law says. I, too, want this divorce, so that I can marry another.\"\nHe looked relieved. \"When I met you, I knew you no longer wanted her, which I confess, pleased me. You wish to marry a woman called Lady Breckenridge?\"\n\"I suppose I should not be so surprised it's common knowledge.\"\nThe corners of his mouth creased. \"The English servants of the boardinghouse gossip. They know you are a friend of Mr. Grenville, who seems to be more worshipped than royalty. They also know that you are paramour of Lady Breckenridge, a widow of some means.\"\nI grimaced. \"I ought to post a notice outside my door.\"\n\"It is the same in a small French town. The women in the market square, they know everyone's business but their own. They are curious about Carlotta but dismiss her past because she is English, and they are fond of her. They look after her, and my children.\"\n\"Which is how Carlotta wants it,\" I observed.\n\"Yes.\"\nI fell silent as the coach bumped through Bow Street and then to a halt in Russel Street. Carlotta, the sweet, innocent slip of a girl, certainly had manipulated me into carrying her off. Then she'd used that same sweet innocence to persuade Auberge to carry her off to a provincial French village, where she'd made a home for herself. Auberge and I thought ourselves strong and masterful, but Carlotta in the end always had what she wanted. Strength masquerading as weakness. I had to admit her success.\nHowever, I would not let her have her way in the matter of Gabriella. I wanted my daughter, and I would fight for her.\nAs we descended and walked into Grimpen Lane, a man pushed himself from the wall next to the bake shop and approached us. I did not recognize him, but his pugilist build and stoic patience told me that he worked for Denis.\n\"Captain,\" he greeted me. \"Mr. Denis, he sent me to find you.\"\nI could not be surprised. \"I suppose Mr. Denis already knows what has happened?\"\n\"That your daughter done a bunk? 'Swhy he sent me.\" The man straightened his rather battered hat. \"You need to come with me, Captain. Something I need to show you.\"\nMy heart squeezed, and Auberge went white. \"Gabriella?\" I asked.\nHe shook his head. \"Naw. A man. Come on.\"\nHe gestured us to follow and set off at a lumbering gate back toward Russel Street. Auberge and I came after him.\nThe man led us to an opulent carriage that had stopped in the square of Covent Garden at the end of Russel Street. A coachman sat on his perch, holding the horses in a bored manner.\nThe pugilist opened the carriage door. I looked in and stopped.\nHuddled against one of the seats, holding his arms around his body and regarding me fearfully, was the pathetic figure of Bottle Bill, the drunken man who turned up most days at the Bow Street magistrate's house.\n\"He has something to tell you,\" Denis's man said. He gestured for me to enter the carriage. I glanced at Auberge, who returned the look blankly, then I hoisted myself into the coach, the pugilist assisting me.\nI sat down opposite Bottle Bill and waited for Auberge to take the seat beside me. Bill watched me from bloodshot eyes, his usually amiable face pale with fear.\n\"What's all this about, Bill?\" I asked him.\nThe pugilist leaned in the door. \"You tell him now.\" He did not speak threateningly, but Bill cringed from him.\n\"I didn't mean nuffing. Leave me alone.\"\n\"Bill,\" I said sharply. Bill swiveled his gaze back to me. \"Tell me what you know.\"\n\"I didn't mean to, did I? I don't know what I'm doing when I've drunk a bottle or two. That's why the bills always haul me in, inn't it?\"\nI was in no mood to placate the man. \"What the devil did you do?\"\n\"Tell him,\" the pugilist said, his tone still bland.\n\"I found her, didn't I? The girl with the yellow hair. She were dead, weren't she?\" His eyes moistened.\n\"Mary Chester?\" I asked.\n\"Never knew her name. I found her. In me lodgings, all dead and cold. Right inside the door, so I tripped over her when I went in. I never meant nuffing, I swear to you.\"\n\"Did you kill her?\" When Bottle Bill only began to weep, I shook him. \"Tell me. Did you kill her?\"\n\"I don't know,\" he wailed. \"I were drunk, weren't I? I'm always drunk.\"\n\"Where are your lodgings?\" I asked.\n\"Down Strand way. Back of beyond. I had to move her, didn't I? Had to get her out of me doorway. He helped me. We wrapped her up tight, carried her to a lane, and buried her there. Out of sight. No one to find her. Rest in peace.\" He pressed his hands to his face and sobbed.\nAuberge looked bewildered, clearly unable to follow Bill's garbled speech.\n\"You said he helped you,\" I prompted. \"Who?\"\n\"Don't know 'im. Said he'd help me, and I wasn't to tell, 'cause I'd swing.\"\n\"Bill, for God's sake. You have to tell me who it was.\"\n\"Don't know, do I? Had a posh carriage. But it were dark, and I were drunk, and I don't remember.\"\nI believed him. Bill sober was a weak, gentle man; Bill drunk was mean and violent. Two Bills, one in a bottle.\n\"What did he look like?\" I asked. \"Tall, short? You must remember something.\"\n\"I don't. Don't hurt me, Cap'n, I swear I don't remember nuffing.\"\nI tried another tack. \"Why did you bury her under debris?\"\n\"Don't know. Seemed decent. Gent said no one would think I did it if she were streets away.\"\n\"What I mean is, there are better ways of disposing of a corpse. Toss her into the river, take her out into the country and bury her, sell her to a resurrectionist.\"\nBill blinked. \"Never thought of that.\"\n\"Of course you didn't. It was the gentleman's idea to hide her, was it not?\"\nBill nodded fervently. \"He helped me. He helped me 'cause he said I'd swing.\"\nAuberge frowned, trying to work out what we were talking about. \"What is this resurrectionist?\"\n\"Grave robbers,\" I answered. \"They prey on corpses of the indigent and sell them to quacks who teach other quacks. Some of the more unscrupulous stoop to murder to further their trade.\"\n\"Ah,\" Auberge said. \"In France, we have a similar thing.\"\n\"Why did this man help you?\" I asked Bill. \"Why should he not shout for the Watch when he saw you with a dead woman?\"\n\"Don't know. I were drunk, Cap'n. I don't remember nuffing, I said.\"\n\"I know you don't. That's why I don't believe you killed her.\"\nBill opened his red eyes wide. \"She were on me doorstep. And I were drunk as anything.\"\n\"Likely you were. And this posh gent, knowing Bottle Bill can't control himself when he's in his cups, places the body of a young woman inside his doorway to shove the blame onto you. When you come home too soon, he's happy to help you hide her, because, he says, he feels sorry for you. But instead of disposing of her body in a way in which she won't be found for some time, he helps you hide her in a nearby lane, where someone is certain to find her very soon. Perhaps someone will even see you covering her up. That will scream your guilt, and you will pay for a crime you did not commit.\"\nBill looked confused. \"I didn't kill her?\"\n\"I'll wager you did not. I wish you could tell me about this gent with the posh carriage.\"\n\"I didn't kill the poor thing?\" Bill asked hopefully. \"You sure?\"\n\"Almost sure. I will be completely certain when I find him. Now then, I want to ask you something else. Did you know a girl called Black Bess?\"\nBill looked surprised. \"Bessie? Sure, I know her. She laughs at me but sometimes gives me a penny when I've drunk away all me coins.\"\n\"She went missing about the same time Mary did.\"\nHis eyes widened. \"Cor.\"\n\"When was the last time you saw her?\"\nHe considered. \"Don't remember. Not long. Days are all the same to me.\"\n\"When you saw her last, did Bess talk about having a wealthy protector? Or that she soon would have one?\"\n\"No,\" he answered doubtfully. \"But then, she did say she'd come into some money. Maybe she meant a rich flat.\"\n\"Maybe she did.\" I sat back, not satisfied, but my mind turned over several ideas. \"If you remember anything, anything at all, about Bess or Mary or the gentleman who helped you, you come and tell me right away. If I'm not about, tell Denis's man. Understand?\"\n\"Aye, Cap'n.\" Bill fumbled a salute. \"I don't want to swing,\" he added in a trembling voice. \"I truly don't.\"\nI left him huddled in the carriage. Outside, I addressed Denis's man. \"Watch him. Both because he might be lying, and because this other man might try to make certain he remembers nothing more. If Denis objects, he can speak to me.\"\n\"Planned to watch 'im, Captain,\" the pugilist said. \"We're looking out for your daughter, too, sir. Mr. Denis said to.\"\n\"Tell him I am grateful.\" I was, at that moment.\n\"He wants to see you, sir.\"\n\"No doubt. I have an appointment at Tattersall's that I must not miss, and I might be able to call upon him after that.\"\nThe pugilist's face never changed expression, but I saw skepticism in his eyes. \"He likes gents to make an appointment or come when they're called.\"\n\"I know he does. He will simply have to make do.\"\nI set my hat straight. The clear blue sky was beginning to cloud over, England's rainy climate tired of giving us sunshine. The pugilist watched me as I nodded to Auberge, and we started back for my rooms.\n*** *** ***\nI left Auberge behind when I kept my appointment at Tatt's. Auberge rejoined the search with Bartholomew and Matthias, who, to my knowledge, still hadn't slept, but they looked none the worse for wear.\nBlack Nancy wandered in as I made ready to depart, and flopped into the wing chair.\n\"Goodness, but I'm wrung dry. I ain't run this hard carrying ale at the inn. It's heartbreaking, too, Captain. No sign of her.\"\n\"I know,\" I said, trying to keep the dejection from my voice.\n\"That Mr. Thompson says his watermen haven't reported finding anybody in the river. Me pals is checking more of the bawdy houses, but so far, nothing.\" Nancy stuck out her feet and pointed her toes, swiveling her ankles. \"I'll be out again soon as I rest a bit, don't you fret.\"\n\"Rest as long as you want, Nance,\" I said. \"You are kind to help, but I fear very much that it will all be in vain.\"\nI had not wanted to express that fear in front of Grenville, or Auberge, or even Bottle Bill. But with Nancy, for some reason, it came out of me. My voice caught as I said it, and my eyes stung.\nNancy rose from the chair and came to me. \"Take heart, love,\" she said softly. \"I didn't mean to sound like I was giving up.\"\n\"I only . . .\" I swallowed, wet my lips, and tried again. \"I know too much about London and what happens to girls in it, you see. They can be ruined, or lost, or dead, in the blink of an eye. You know that.\"\n\"Maybe, but most girls don't have someone like you looking out for them.\" Nancy rubbed my shoulder. \"Don't give up, Captain. We'll bring her in.\"\nWith effort, I mastered myself and wiped my eyes. \"What can you tell me about Felicity?\"\nNancy blinked. \"Felicity? She's a good sort, I suppose. Not mean spirited, like some game girls can be. Why d'ya want to know?\"\n\"She intrigues me. Where did she come from? Has she always lived in London? I've not seen her about, in any case.\"\nNancy looked a bit annoyed at my interest. \"Her mother was a maid, brought over from Jamaica. Her father, who knows? A white gent, by the looks of her, but Felicity don't know. She was downstairs maid in a Mayfair house, but she legged it because the master kept trying to have it on with her. She said if that were going on, she might as well get some coin for it, and so she took to the streets. Gentlemen like Felicity 'cause she's fine spoken and pretty, in a foreign-looking way.\"\n\"Exotic,\" I said.\n\"That's the word. That's all I know about her, Captain. What's your interest?\" She shot me a suspicious look.\n\"Do not worry, she has not replaced you in my affections. I merely wondered. Felicity is shrewder than most, and I wonder if she doesn't know more about this than she lets on. A wealthy gentleman picking up girls in Covent Garden would surely be interested in Felicity with, as you say, her fine speech and her exotic looks. So why has he not taken her up?\"\n\"You meant the gent what Black Bess and Mary were talking about?\"\n\"Possibly. I might be meeting this very gent today.\"\n\"Ooh, are you going to shake a confession out of him?\" Nancy asked, delighted. \"Can I watch?\"\n\"I will try to find out all he knows, certainly. And no, you cannot come with me, because I am going to Tattersall's, which is a haven for gentlemen. No women.\"\n\"Ah, well, I will have to console meself. As long as you tell me all about it after you pummel him.\"\n\"I assure you, you will have the entire story.\" I settled my best frock coat and took up my walking stick. \"By the bye, why is Bess called Black Bess?\"\nNancy tugged at a lock of her own richly dark hair. \"Same reason I'm called Black Nancy. 'Cause of our tresses.\"\n\"Why isn't Felicity called Black Felicity?\"\n\"Don't know. Never thought of it. Don't sound as good, though, does it?\"\n\"No, I admit Black Nancy has better cadence.\"\nNancy grinned. \"Well, I don't know what cadence is, but I'm glad I got it. You go off and shake up the gentleman. As long as you like me best, I'll overlook your interest in Felicity.\"\n\"You are too kind.\" I snatched up my hat. \"Rest here as long as you like. You have been at it all day and night. Sleep on the bed if you like.\"\nNancy laughed and twirled around, skirts swirling to reveal plump ankles. \"Thought you'd never ask, Captain. I'll take you up on that. And brag to me pals I was flat on me back in your bed.\" She blew a kiss to me, and I went out the door, certain I'd regret my sudden charity.\nJackson waited for me at the carriage. He was checking over the harness but looked up when he saw me coming. \"Ready, sir? Mr. Grenville said I was to deliver you to Tatt's safe and sound.\"\nJackson was a typical coachman, broad of shoulder and of hand, used to working around horses. Like other coachmen, he'd filed his incisors to points, giving him a rakish look when he smiled, which was seldom, in Jackson's case. In his red livery and black hat with its stiff brush, he looked well turned out but just a bit savage, a man more at home with beasts than men.\nI knew that Jackson must be one of the best coachmen in the business, because Grenville employed only the best. I also noted that Grenville let him use his real name rather than calling him \"John Coachman\" as most people did their drivers.\nJackson held the door open for me, and I thanked him. I sat back against the leather seat as the coach listed as Jackson hauled himself to his perch. I heard him give command to the horses and crack his whip, and we jolted through traffic toward Mayfair.\n*** *** ***\nTattersall's, near Hyde Park Corner, was the demesne of the Jockey Club and an auction block for the very best in horseflesh. Here, upper-class gentlemen and the aristocracy bought and sold horses, placed bets on races important and unimportant, and talked horses, sport, and hunting.\nGrenville often invited me to join him at Tatts, asking my opinion when he wanted to buy or sell. As a cavalryman, I knew horses. I could quickly discern correct conformation, or whether the horse was sound or sickly, and whether he had the spirit for racing or was better suited for country hacks. Best of all, I could ride whatever horse interested Grenville, and in the saddle, I was the equal of or better than any man.\nA number of gentlemen had drifted in to spend the summer afternoon discussing horses. In the enclosure, with its small rotunda in the center, I saw Lord Alvanley and a few of his cronies watching two grooms put mounts through their paces. Leland Derwent and the friend who was his shadow, Gareth Travers, stood nearby--although, since Travers was the more robust of the pair, I should more rightly say that Leland shadowed him.\nGrenville, resplendent in fashionable riding garb--cutaway frock coat, immaculate buff breeches, and polished high boots--saw me, broke away from the group of gentlemen he'd been speaking with, and came to me. \"Lacey, what news?\"\n\"None, I am afraid. Is Mr. Stacy here?\"\n\"Not yet. I told him three o'clock--if he does not arrive, we will hunt him down. In the meantime, there's a horse I want you to look at.\"\nSo saying, he led me along the columned walkway that surrounded the green.\nLeland Derwent hailed me as we approached. \"Well met, Captain.\" He shook my hand, staring at me with admiration that a year of acquaintance had not diminished. In Leland's eyes, I was a war hero. He loved my stories of the hardships of the army, the harsher, the better. A bit strange for a timid young man from one of the wealthiest families in England. I had worried Leland a bit this spring when I'd questioned him during the investigation of Berkeley Square murder, but by the eager manner with which he clasped my hand now, he'd forgiven me.\n\"I am so sorry about your daughter,\" Leland said, anguish in his eyes. \"My father is doing all he can.\"\n\"Thank you. Tell him that I very much appreciate his assistance.\"\n\"He knows all the reform houses and workhouses in London. He'll look through them all.\"\n\"Thank you,\" I repeated with sincerity. They were a kind family.\n\"Father is using the opportunity to put another reform bill before the House of Commons. He will call it the Lacey Bill if he can.\"\nI winced. \"God help me. Grenville, where is this horse?\"\nThe horse in question proved to be a bay stallion, five years old, which Grenville thought to use as a hunter. I handed Grenville my walking stick and let a groom boost me into the saddle.\nI walked the horse to the rotunda, casting a glance at the bust of the Prince of Wales within it, then squeezed my lower legs against the horse's sides. The stallion picked up his pace, trotting smartly where I guided him. Well trained. His trot was so smooth I barely had to rise in the saddle with it.\nI tapped the stallion with the crop and leaned into my left leg, and the horse flowed like water into a canter. I took him around at this gait, not letting him move too fast, collecting him if he extended too much.\nThe stallion responded well, although I was not too surprised at his sound going. Grenville always asked my opinion, but in truth, he was a fine judge of horses and could pick out the best. I suspected that he asked my opinion under the guise of giving me an opportunity to ride. Richard Tattersall liked Grenville, because any horse for which Grenville showed interest automatically jumped in price, whether he bought it or not. Everyone wanted a horse that had caught Grenville's eye.\nI cantered the stallion around again, letting him pick up speed, so that Grenville could see what he'd be like at full tilt. A few gentlemen applauded. I slowed the stallion, trotted him out, then walked back to where Grenville stood waiting.\n\"He is a wonderful horse.\" I patted the stallion's neck. \"Who wants to part with him?\"\n\"Lord Featherstone. He doesn't ride much anymore and decided yesterday that he had no reason to keep the horses he had. So they all went on the block.\" Grenville grimaced. \"I had better get my bid in before the price goes up. I always pay a mint for my horseflesh, having to outbid every gentleman who wants a horse of which I approve.\"\nI slid to the ground, reminded that I was no longer whole the moment my left foot touched the ground. The groom handed me my walking stick, and I leaned on it, flexing my leg. \"Another difficulty of being the most fashionable man in London,\" I said.\n\"Yes, do not rub it in. Ah, here's Stacy, come at last.\"\nI looked to where a tall, thin man walked into the enclosure, his riding coat and breeches as well made as Grenville's. When Grenville inclined his head at him, Stacy started over.\nGrenville extended a hand to him when he reached us. \"Stacy,\" Grenville said. \"You remember Captain Lacey. Chat with him a moment, will you, and I will snatch up this horse while I can still afford it.\" Grenville strode off, and Stacy chuckled at his back.\n\"He makes a good joke,\" he said.\nI studied the man beside me while he watched Grenville walk away. Jeremiah Stacy was a few inches taller than I was, with oddly long and thin limbs, as though someone had taken a normal man and stretched him. He had dark hair and blue eyes and a reasonably handsome face, leaning on this side of plain. Stacy looked down at me without concern, genially wondering why Grenville had left me in his care.\n\"Will you walk with me, Mr. Stacy?\" I asked. \"I would like to speak with you privately.\"\nHe looked surprised. \"Very well.\" He gestured toward the corner of the enclosure nearest the loose boxes. \"There?\"\n\"That will do.\" I fell into step beside him, waiting until we were out of earshot of the other gentlemen before I began. \"I asked Grenville to bring you here today on purpose so I could speak to you.\"\n\"Oh? What about?\"\nI heard no trace of trepidation in his voice, as though he had a clear conscience. I plunged on. \"I saw you last night. In Covent Garden.\"\nStacy nodded. \"I attended the theatre with my wife.\"\n\"Not at the theatre. You left it early.\"\n\"I did. To meet friends for cards.\" He studied me. \"What are you getting at, Captain?\"\nGrenville reached us before I could expound. He looked satisfied. \"Excellent. Featherstone was in a hurry to sell, so I got close to my price, only a little inflated because Alvanley decided to stick in his oar. Alvanley used to emulate Brummell, now he wants to emulate me. Such a tragedy he cannot have his own personality.\"\nStacy laughed. \"Congratulations, Grenville.\"\n\"Thank you. Carry on, Lacey.\"\n\"You left your wife and daughter at the theatre,\" I said to Stacy, \"and went off to play cards.\"\n\"I have just said so. My daughter and wife were to attend a soiree together after that. We often arrange our evenings thus.\"\n\"On your way, your carriage rolled through Covent Garden. The carriage halted, and you descended. You spoke to a game girl and invited her into your carriage with you.\"\nStacy stopped, his cheeks burning a sudden red. \"Why do you say so?\"\n\"Because I saw you.\"\n\"Oh, did you?\" His look turned hostile. \"And what business is it of yours?\"\n\"Then you do not deny that you did this,\" I said.\nStacy looked at Grenville for support, but Grenville only pinned him with a black stare. \"Always thought you marched the straight and narrow, Stacy.\"\nStacy shot a fearful glance at the crowd of aristocrats and dandies under the colonnade. \"For God's sake, keep your voices down. I couldn't . . . I do not want anyone to know.\"\n\"Least of all your wife?\" I asked.\n\"Oh, you would not be so much of a bounder to tell her, would you? She would die of shame.\"\n\"Your secret is safe with us,\" Grenville assured him. \"At least for now. As long as you tell us what you did.\"\nColor flooded Stacy's face, and he regarded Grenville with distaste. \"What the devil do you think I did? Why should you want to know?\"\n\"Do not worry,\" Grenville said. \"The captain and I are not voyeurs. What I mean is, where did you go? How long did you stay with the girl, and where is she now?\"\n\"As I say, what business is it of yours?\"\nI leaned on my walking stick, giving him a cold stare worthy of James Denis himself. \"Tell us, Stacy.\"\nStacy's eyes glittered in sudden worry. \"How should I know where the devil she is? I did what I always do. My coachman drove through the quietest streets he could find, while . . .\" He trailed off. \"And then returned me to Covent Garden. I set her down there and went on. To play cards, as I said.\"\n\"Do you do this often?\" I asked sharply.\n\"Yes.\" His gaze shifted. \"Rather too often.\"\nGrenville adjusted his hat and gave a sniff, his way of showing disapproval. \"I was surprised when Lacey mentioned that he'd seen you. I would not have pegged you for it.\"\n\"It really is my business, Grenville,\" Stacy said desperately.\nI cleared my throat. \"For myself, I do not care for your reasons. I want to know whether you enjoyed yourself with a girl called Black Bess or a girl called Mary Chester.\"\nStacy gasped. \"Black Bess?\"\n\"Specifically, I want to know whether you promised either of them a good sum of money to take up with you.\"\n\"Dear God. What has Bess been telling you?\"\n\"Bess has told me nothing.\" My voice went harsh. \"She has disappeared, and Mary Chester has been murdered, and I want to know what you had to do with it.\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Thirteen\n\nStacy went pasty white. \"Murdered? Bloody hell.\"\n\"You knew Bess and Mary, then?\" I demanded.\n\"I do not always know their names. Black Bess told me hers. I don't remember a Mary.\"\n\"Dyed blond hair, pretty. Came from Wapping.\"\nStacy drew a ragged breath. \"You don't have a flask on you, do you, Grenville?\"\nGrenville produced a silver flask of brandy from his pocket and handed it to Stacy. Stacy opened it and drank deeply. \"Thank you.\"\n\"Mary Chester,\" I prodded. \"Had you been with her?\"\n\"Possibly. Several weeks ago, if she is the same girl. I haven't seen her since. That is the truth. I certainly did not murder her. What do you take me for?\"\n\"I take you for a man who goes trawling for game girls,\" I said. \"Why you choose to is your own business, as you say. They likely appreciate your coin and your fine carriage on a rainy night. But Bess and Mary went missing, and you were with them both.\"\nStacy's face was still wan, the brandy clearly not helping. \"Coincidence.\"\nGrenville drew out his quizzing glass and peered at Stacy through it. Stacy flinched. Grenville examining a man thusly was preliminary to said man being dismissed as a vulgarian. Grenville doing so in front of a large crowd at Tatt's could ruin a man.\n\"You know, Stacy,\" Grenville said in a cool, rather bored manner. \"Slumming can be a recipe for the clap.\"\nStacy reddened again, a vein pulsing in his neck.\nI recognized that Grenville was very angry. I generally blustered and threatened when enraged, but Grenville turned ice cold. The death of Mary and the disappearances of Bess and Gabriella had distressed him, and the thought that Stacy, one of his own crowd and a friend, could have anything to do with it enraged him.\n\"Damnation, Grenville,\" Stacy said. \"I am not the only one who does such a thing.\"\nThe quizzing glass didn't move. \"Yes, but you are the only slummer who has drunk from my flask. Keep it, there's a good fellow. I hardly want it back.\"\nStacy's mouth opened and closed, but before he could respond, a new voice broke in. \"Extolling your own virtues, are you, Grenville?\"\nA man strolled to us, one of a height between mine and Grenville's, his tailed coat hanging from broad shoulders. His breeches and boots hugged legs muscled from riding, but although his garb was fashionable, he wore it as though he cared nothing for fashion and had bought it because that was all his tailor would make for him. He had dark hair and eyes, a square jaw, and a chin blue with whiskers. He spoke with the faintest of Scottish accents, as though he secretly wished to speak broad Glaswegian but strove while in London to speak like a Londoner.\n\"Not got a leg to stand on, I should think,\" the man said. He looked pointedly at my walking stick.\nI did not rise to the bait, but Stacy looked uncomfortable. \"McAdams, this is a private conversation.\"\n\"But I am here to rescue you, my friend. Is Mr. Grenville berating you because you enjoy spending time in Covent Garden?\" McAdams made a tut-tut noise. \"While Grenville parades about with an actress who's little better than a whore? The captain, now, he's caught himself a viscountess. Very well done, I must say, Captain. Although I'd say the Breckenridge came after you with all flags flying, wanting to snare herself a cicisbeo. A feather in your cap, that is.\"\nGrenville twirled his quizzing glass in his fingers, his eyes flat. \"Crudely done, McAdams. Insults ought to be subtle.\"\n\"What?\" McAdams's eyes widened in mock surprise. \"You will not slap my face and call for your seconds? After I have spoken so of your lady?\"\nGrenville hid a yawn behind his gloved hand. \"You are hardly worth the effort of rising early and making my sleepy way to Hyde Park Green. Waste of gunpowder, as well. My lady, as you call her, has far better manners than you, albeit she is an actress from the gutter. As for Lady Breckenridge, she could flatten you with a single barb at twenty paces. She has a command of language and a true wit that you will never achieve in your lifetime, no matter how you strive. Perhaps she has disparaged you at some time, so that you feel it your right to speak so slightingly of a lady who is well beyond your reach.\"\nMcAdams smiled coldly. \"Grenville, my friend, I do not fear your censure.\"\n\"You are a fool then. I can make certain you never set foot in a respectable parlor again, let alone White's or any other club, just by putting about that you are a blackguard.\"\nThe lines around McAdams's mouth tightened, but he would not back down. My own anger was up, but I took a step back to let Grenville fight it out. This was his world, with its own rules, and here, Grenville was master.\nStacy clenched the flask in his hand. \"McAdams, I have no need of rescue. Please go.\"\n\"But you looked so distressed, my friend. If Mr. Stacy wishes to invite a girl into his carriage, that is nothing to do with you, gentlemen. Why do you harp at him for it?\"\n\"Tell me, McAdams,\" Grenville said, \"were you the one who put him on to it? Dragged him from the respectability of Mayfair to the dark of Covent Garden?\"\n\"Perhaps.\" McAdams shrugged. \"He wanted a bit of diversion, and I gave it to him.\"\n\"And I am sorry you ever did,\" Stacy said under his breath.\nMcAdams looked at us in disbelief. \"Good Lord, can three Englishmen be any more stifled? What is the matter with passing an hour with a gutter girl? That's what they're for. They don't expect you to give them houses and expensive presents, like courtesans do, and they don't cry when you beat 'em a little. They expect it.\"\nI made a noise of disgust. Grenville's brows rose in cold hauteur. \"Well, that has torn it for you, McAdams. You're out.\"\n\"Over game girls?\" McAdams laughed. \"I've always thought you a bit touched, Grenville.\"\n\"It is not funny,\" Stacy said. \"Some of them have gone missing, and one is dead. The Captain and Grenville think I had something to do with it.\"\nMcAdams laughed again. \"Good Lord, so what if he did? They're not worth bothering about, gentlemen. Go look at the horses. They're far more important.\"\nI broke in. \"Murder is murder, Mr. McAdams. It is a capital offense, whether you are convicted of killing a game girl or your own brother.\"\nMcAdams paled slightly but lost none of his bravado. \"A jury might not think so. Girls no better than they ought to be. They'd die soon enough of some disgusting disease anyway.\"\n\"Perhaps you are right about a jury, but the kidnapping and murder of a respectable young woman is a different matter altogether,\" I said, keeping my temper tightly reined. I might learn nothing if I gave in to impulse and knocked McAdams to the ground.\n\"A respectable young woman?\" Stacy stared. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\"My daughter has gone missing as well. She left a boardinghouse in King Street, presumably walked through Covent Garden, and has not been seen since.\"\nStacy stilled. McAdams hooted a laugh. \"Better keep a rein on your offspring, Lacey. Such a comedown for a gentleman of standing, to have his daughter enter the world of the demimonde.\"\n\"Now, for that, I will call you out,\" I said, surprised I could say it so calmly. \"After I conclude this business, my seconds will make an appointment with you.\"\n\"We duel over whores now?\"\nStacy's voice went sharp. \"McAdams, for God's sake, shut your mouth.\" Gentlemen under the colonnade turned to stare at us. Alvanley brought out his quizzing glass. Stacy stepped to McAdams. \"Shut up, I tell you. This is serious business.\"\n\"For you perhaps,\" McAdams said, though he shot me a wary look. \"I have nothing to do with it.\"\n\"Yes, you do,\" Stacy said. \"You told me to look up Black Bess in the first place. And now she's missing. It is bad for the both of us.\"\nMcAdams raised his brows. \"Not for me. I haven't been to Covent Garden in weeks.\"\nI turned to Stacy. \"Both Bess and Mary spoke of a wealthy gentleman who'd soon do well by them. They went to Covent Garden to meet him, each of them, a week ago. Did they have an appointment with you?\"\nStacy shook his head. \"No. I've spoken to neither of them in some time.\"\n\"You never promised them money? Or to set them up well?\"\n\"No, indeed, why would I? Spending an hour with them is one thing, taking them as mistresses is something else entirely. No, I never promised a thing.\"\n\"Then who was the wealthy gentleman they so looked forward to meeting? He would settle them for life, they thought. McAdams?\"\nMcAdams barked a laugh. \"Good God, no. Why would I spend more than a crown on a street whore? They wouldn't know what to do with money if they had it, except drink it up.\"\nI gave him a steady look. \"I look forward to shooting you.\"\nMcAdams returned my look with mock dismay, but the wary light in his eye grew deeper. Grenville, on the other hand, ignored him altogether. Grenville was already cutting him, but McAdams was too self-important to notice.\nStacy looked at me in trepidation. \"The thing is, Captain, I believe I might have seen your daughter.\"\nMy disgust at McAdams vanished in an instant. I brushed him away and advanced on Stacy. \"Did you? Where? When?\"\n\"Was it yesterday? I was in Covent Garden in the evening, on my way to the theatre to meet my wife. I drove through to, um, decide . . .\"\nHe'd gone to survey the girls for his later visit. I waited.\n\"At any rate, I'd descended, because I fancied an orange, and I wanted to get it myself from the orange girl. After I purchased it and, er, chatted with her a few moments, I saw a young woman pushing through the crowd, looking a bit lost. I thought, you know, that she seemed out of place, and I asked if I could help her. She stopped, grateful, and asked the way to Russel Street. We were near to it, so I pointed it out. She thanked me and walked on, more cheerfully. I got back into my coach and drove away.\"\n\"Did she reach Russel Street?\" I asked.\n\"Have no idea. I was in the coach, and my coachman drove away.\"\n\"Busy eating your orange, no doubt,\" Grenville said.\n\"Yes, getting dratted peel everywhere and knowing my coachman would cut up rough. He's fond of the conveyances, treats them like they were his children. Anyway, he dropped me in front of the theatre, I met my wife and daughter, and I never saw the girl again. That is all I know.\"\n\"What did she look like?\" I asked, my throat dry.\nStacy considered, his eyes flickering nervously. \"Pretty, in a girlish sort of way. Light brown hair, cannot remember the color of her eyes. Wearing a nice enough frock, nothing that caught my eye. Definitely not a street girl, I could see. Daughter of respectable parents, I thought.\"\n\"And she spoke like a respectable English girl?\"\n\"She did, though I detected a faint accent. Prussian maybe, or French.\"\nI felt hotness rush through me, followed by tingling in my fingers. \"That was her. It must have been.\" I gave him a hard stare. \"If you harmed her in any way . . .\"\nStacy's eyes widened. \"I did not. I promise you, Captain, I directed her to Russel Street and left her alone. I do know the difference between a street girl and a young lady. Good Lord, she was the age of my own daughter.\"\nHis words rang with sincerity, but I would not take them at face value. \"I hope you are right,\" I said softly.\nGrenville looked Stacy up and down with his quizzing glass. \"So do I. You are our primary suspect, Stacy. Mind what you do in Covent Garden. There is a massive search going on for Lacey's daughter, which includes Bow Street Runners and men who work for James Denis. I should be careful, were I you.\"\nMcAdams clapped Stacy on the shoulder. \"I advise you to inform your solicitor, my friend. He may be able to bring a case of defamation of character.\"\nStacy gave McAdams a cold look. \"I will be fine.\" He stalked off, but instead of joining the group watching the next horses to be exercised, he departed through the walkway and was gone.\nI handed one of my cards to McAdams. \"So that your seconds may call on mine. Good day.\" I inclined my head and walked away under the curious stares of those not looking at the horses.\nGrenville, on the other hand, cut McAdams dead. I watched from the colonnade as he turned his back, removed his snuffbox, and took a pinch, blatantly ignoring McAdams. Every man turned to stare as Grenville calmly replaced his snuffbox and walked away from McAdams without acknowledging him.\nAs I joined Grenville to seek out Tattersall and arrange delivery of the stallion, the assembled dandies, earls, and barons began to gabble like a mad flock of geese. Not one of them spoke to McAdams.\n*** *** ***\nGrenville invited me back to Grosvenor Street so that he could change his suit before resuming the search for Gabriella with me. Ensconced in his dressing room while his valet, Gautier, dressed him, I sipped a much-needed brandy.\n\"Do you think any of what Stacy told us was the truth?\" Grenville asked, cranking his head back so Gautier could tie his neckcloth. \"Or was it all rubbish?\"\n\"He admitted that he saw the girls and was with them,\" I said. \"But after that, who knows? I'd like to borrow your coachman and have him help me talk to Stacy's coachman. He'd be an eyewitness to everything Stacy does. Whether he's a loyal servant or loves to gossip about his betters remains to be seen.\"\n\"Take him.\" Grenville said, waving a hand at me and causing his valet to cluck in disapproval. \"As for McAdams, he is certainly worth investigating, far more likely to lure girls to their doom. You heard what he said about beating them. The man is disgusting.\" He held out his arms for his coat, and Gautier slid it over his slim shoulders. \"I dislike duels, but I will gladly hold the pistol box for you on this one. Although McAdams may not last long enough to meet you, now that I've cut him. He might flee England altogether.\"\n\"He seems resilient to opinion,\" I said.\n\"Well, he will not be for long. If I cut him dead, then other men will follow suit. They know I only cut for a good reason. Alvanley muttered to me as I left that it was time the boor got his comeuppance. Alvanley is an imitator, but in truth he has a great deal of power.\"\n\"Perhaps we will get McAdams for murder, and there will be no need to cut him.\"\nI liked the idea of McAdams as murderer, because watching him stand in the dock would satisfy me. I felt a little sorry for Stacy--not too sorry, however--and hoped McAdams proved to be the culprit.\nI would check with Thompson to see how Mary Chester had actually died. Perhaps McAdams began his violent ways and went a bit too far. Perhaps the prior bruises on her throat had come from him, indicating that he'd already enjoyed being rough with her. Perhaps this time, she had died, and in panic, McAdams had hidden the body inside Bottle Bill's doorstep. If McAdams went often to Covent Garden, he'd have become familiar with Bottle Bill and his habits, as we all were. The magistrate would easily believe that Bill had become violent under the influence of drink and killed Mary, intentionally or no.\n\"I will pot him one way or another,\" I said. \"I'd like to speak to Marianne as well. She might know Stacy if he haunts Covent Garden. I'd like her opinion of him.\"\nMarianne, like Lady Breckenridge, was a shrewd observer. As an actress, she'd have seen the seamier side of the upper classes and been privy to gossip that gentlemen wouldn't dream of taking home to their wives, daughters, and sisters.\nGrenville looked uncomfortable. \"I am afraid you cannot speak to Marianne. I meant to tell you but hadn't a chance at Tatt's. She's gone missing as well--but do not be alarmed. She went as she usually does, taking her best hat and a handful of guineas and telling my footman she'd be back when she was ready.\"\n\"Damn and blast her,\" I said feelingly. \"Why did she decide to disappear just now, when girls are going missing left and right?\"\n\"I really could not say,\" Grenville answered. His lips were pale. He told Gautier, who was busily brushing the coat, to run off somewhere. The valet nodded, laid down the brush, and discreetly departed.\nGrenville faced me. \"You warned me from the very beginning about her. I wish to God I'd heeded you, but the woman intrigued me. I gave her clothes, money, jewels, a house and servants, and then my carriage. I've made a grand fool of myself, haven't I? If it ever comes out that she runs off to other men whenever she pleases, I'll be a laughingstock.\"\nHe exhaled slowly. \"I have decided, Lacey. I will not see her again. When she returns, will you please tell her for me that I am finished chasing her? She may keep the money and jewelry and do whatever she likes with them. I no longer care.\"\nHis hands fell to his sides, and his cool mask slipped. I'd never seen him so dejected.\n\"You would break her heart,\" I said. \"She truly cares for you.\"\nGrenville gave me a bitter laugh. \"She has a damn odd way of showing it. I wish she hadn't chosen now of all times to go, because I am worried that she too has become a victim. I believe I'd rather hear that she is in the arms of her lover than that she is dead under a pile of rubbish near the Strand.\"\nI eased back in the chair and made my decision. Marianne had asked me to tell him, and as much as I did not want any part of this business, they'd both fully dragged me into it. Besides, I counted Grenville a friend and was fond of Marianne, in a way. I hated to see them at cross-purposes like this.\n\"She is not cuckolding you, Grenville,\" I said. \"She's gone to Berkshire.\"\nGrenville stilled, and an odd look came over his face. \"Berkshire?\"\n\"A small house near Hungerford, to be exact.\"\nColor flooded his cheeks, then he pointed a long finger at me. \"You knew why she went last time, and you never told me, blast you.\"\n\"Marianne begged me to keep her secret. Two days ago, I saw her in Covent Garden, and she told me she was thinking of making her way to Berkshire again. This time, however, she asked me to tell you why. I tried to talk her out of it, but you know how well Marianne listens.\"\n\"Indeed,\" Grenville said in a cool voice. \"Pray go on.\"\nHe was angry again, at me this time. I felt the full weight of his wrath, just as McAdams must have.\n\"Marianne has a son.\"\nGrenville stared at me a moment as though waiting for me to go on, then his black eyes focused sharply. \"A son?\"\n\"He is about seven years old, and he is a halfwit.\"\n\"A halfwit.\" Grenville frowned. \"Lacey, you had better not be inventing this. Is she inventing it?\"\n\"I've met him. His name is David. Marianne keeps him in a little house near Hungerford and pays a woman to look after him. That is where all the money you give her goes, to buy David's food and his clothes and to pay for his upkeep. She would not tell me who the father was, only that he'd died years ago. I believe her.\"\nI lifted my brandy to my lips and drank, but for the first time since I'd been allowed to partake of Grenville's fine stock of brandies, I barely tasted the liquid.\nGrenville's face was utterly still, his gaze fixed, his lips parted. He remained thus for a long time, watching me while I watched him.\nAn ornate gold clock in the corner sweetly chimed the quarter hour. Grenville passed a shaking hand through his hair. \"Why in God's name didn't she tell me?\" He fastened his glare on me. \"Why didn't you tell me?\"\n\"She feared your reaction.\"\n\"My reaction? She would rather let me believe she had a lover she could not give up than that she was taking care of a child by herself?\"\nI held up a hand. \"Consider. Your money is going to another man's child, a halfwit child at that. When you learn the truth, will you withdraw the gifts in disgust? If so, what is Marianne to do for the money? Return to the theatre? Look for another protector who won't scrutinize her so closely?\"\nGrenville stared at me in amazement. \"Is that what you think I would do?\"\n\"It is what Marianne fears.\"\nHe swung away and paced across the small space of the dressing room. Abruptly, he brought his fists down on the dressing table, sending the mirror and Gautier's various brushes dancing on the surface.\n\"God damn the pair of you. Is this what you think of me, that I'd beggar a child? That I'd throw Marianne out to grub her living on the stage, so that she can hang about in hopes that some disgusting man like McAdams takes her home? Is that what you have thought all this time, that I am the sort of man who could do that?\" Grenville's face was red, his eyes hard and glittering.\nI remained quiet. \"You must admit that you are difficult to predict.\"\n\"For God's sake, Lacey, have I ever behaved anything but generously to her--to you? I have offered you both everything I have. Damnation, I offered you my friendship and her my love, and both of you stare at me as though you cannot deign to accept it. I have taken Marianne among my friends; I have given you the cachet of my approval. You know you would have been nothing in London without it, but I gladly gave it, because I saw the worth of you.\" He ran out of words and breath.\n\"I know what you have done for me,\" I said, meaning it. \"You have always told me that it was because I interested you.\"\n\"Yes, and you puff up with pride because you believe it an insult. Selfish of me to expect gratitude, I suppose. From either of you. But consider, if the bloody girl had told me, what do you think I could have done for this David? I can give him the best care money can buy. I can give him his own house, a string of attendants if he wants them. I can do this, Lacey, I am damn rich. Why the devil doesn't Marianne understand that?\"\n\"This is the other reaction she feared,\" I said. \"That you'd smother David with generosity and take him away from the place where he is happy.\"\nGrenville stared at me in shock. \"You agree with her.\"\nI set aside the brandy with reluctance and rose. \"Yes. I do.\"\n\"Devil take you, Lacey.\"\n\"She does not want you to overmaster her. She wants David left in peace.\"\nGrenville scrutinized me a moment longer, his face sheet white except for red that stained his cheekbones. I watched him try to contain himself, to draw his cool poise about himself in the same manner as his valet had eased on his coat.\nHis next words were quiet but spoken with finality. \"Tell Marianne I will continue the money to help her son, but I no longer wish to see her. And I believe I no longer wish to see you either, Lacey. I will allow my servants to help carry on the search for your daughter, but that will be all.\" His eyes were filled with suppressed anger and, behind that, hurt. \"I gave you my implicit trust, Lacey. I was a fool to expect it in return, I suppose.\"\nI bowed in silence. \"I am sorry to have angered you.\" I turned without further word and strolled to the door.\nI half expected him to call me back, to say in good-natured exasperation, \"For God's sake, Lacey, let us sort this out,\" but he did not. Both Marianne and I had wronged him. Grenville had cuffed us, and I, for one, felt I deserved the blow.\nI quietly closed the door behind me and made my way down the polished staircase, the satinwood rail gleaming as deeply as gold. With some regret, I took my hat and gloves from the footman at the door and went back out into the London afternoon. It had clouded over, and the first drops of rain fell as I made my way to the hackney stand at the corner of Grosvenor Street.\n*** *** ***\nI decided to pay a call on Denis, notwithstanding his lackey's suggestion that I should not arrive without an appointment. If Denis were indisposed, he would not admit me, and I would go on. I had plenty to do without this aside.\nDenis's butler, as cold as his master, took me upstairs and bade me wait in the austere reception room in which I'd awaited his attention before. Not long after that, the butler returned and ushered me to Denis's study. Denis flicked his dark blue glance from his correspondence, curtly told me to take a chair, and asked what I wanted.\n\"Only to know if you have heard anything about my daughter,\" I said.\n\"If I had, I would have sent word or already restored her to you.\"\n\"Yes.\" I remained seated, uncertain how to explain what I wanted. Reassurance? I would not get it from Denis. Or maybe I wanted truth, which was what Denis dispensed in abundance--brutal, unromanticized truth.\nDenis seemed to sense my need. He set his correspondence aside and twitched his fingers at the lackey who stood at the window. \"Fetch the captain port,\" he said.\nThe man moved to the door and summoned another footman. I noticed he did not leave the room, which would have put me alone with Denis.\n\"Tell me what you have learned this afternoon,\" Denis said, \"and perhaps I can aid you.\"\nI hesitated. \"You are heavy-handed with your aid.\"\n\"Heavy-handedness is often effective. The trick is to know when to employ it and when to be restrained. You have learned something. What is it?\"\nI told him about Stacy and McAdams. I was worried enough and angry enough that I did not care whether Denis and his ruffians paid a call on either of them. If Stacy or McAdams had hurt my daughter, Denis could do his worst.\n\"I have met Mr. McAdams,\" Denis said, twining his fingers on his desk. \"A man who does not know when to be restrained, or even how to be, I would say. He is crude and ill-mannered. You think him a better candidate for the crime than Stacy?\"\n\"McAdams is the sort who would hurt a girl for the pleasure of it. Stacy might do the same, I do not know. The only difference between the two is that Stacy is ashamed of his proclivities while McAdams boasts of them. But either of them could have killed Mary Chester.\"\n\"You mean that either of them are capable of it. You are not being as rational as you could be, Captain. Think of it this way. Did either gentleman have the opportunity to kill her? Where do they say they were on the night--or day--she died? Do they have witnesses? Could Bottle Bill have killed Mary Chester and be inventing the 'gentleman' who assisted him to throw you off the scent? You certainly believe Bill capable of murder, when he is drunk. He is often arrested, I understand, for being violent.\" Denis spread his hands. \"Many possibilities, Captain.\"\nThe butler entered, placed a table at my elbow, and laid a round white cloth on its precise center. He set on this a crystal goblet filled to a quarter inch of the brim with dusky amber port. The port's rich scent reached me as the butler bowed and departed.\nI ignored the glass for now. \"You mean I ought to stop frantically running about and begin to investigate. I have been searching, not thinking.\"\n\"You have plenty of people going through London for you,\" Denis said. \"Sit back and think.\"\nI was not sure he meant for me to do so at the moment, but I leaned back in his comfortable chair, lifted the goblet of port, and drank deeply. As did Grenville, Denis kept the best in wines, and this was one of the finest I'd tasted.\n\"I will quiz Stacy's coachman,\" I said. \"The man drives him everywhere; he would know what day Stacy picked up Mary Chester and where he took her. He would know when Stacy was last with Black Bess, he would know whether Stacy is telling the truth about seeing Gabriella. I should question McAdams's servants as well and find out about his visits to Covent Garden.\"\nDenis gave me a nod. \"Reason and thoroughness. That is what will find Miss Lacey.\"\n\"This is what you do, is it not? You sit in this house and reason, and then you send hirelings out to do your bidding.\"\n\"I employ many, that is true. Some do well running about the streets bringing me small bits of information, others do well sitting back and reasoning in their own right.\"\nI swallowed another draught of port then set down the goblet, off center, on the cloth. \"You wish to employ me. In which role do you see me, as runner or reasoner?\"\nA thin smile lifted the corners of his mouth. \"I see you as unique, Captain. You have an interesting perception of upper-class society--you are one of them but also on the fringes, and you can observe both as an insider and an outsider. You were reared at Harrow and Cambridge, yet you abandoned that life to fight in the heat of India and the mess of the Peninsula. You were an officer among officers, yet you achieved your rank through merit instead of money, which gives you a perception of what merit truly is. You are trusted by the demimonde, yet you choose your lovers from the loftiest of women. You can see what a man truly is and yet be blindly loyal to him for all his faults. You were befriended by Grenville, a severely cautious man who befriends very few, and you are equally befriended by people in the gutter. Even my own servants express admiration for you.\"\nI listened to all this with a touch of disquiet. \"I had no idea I was such a paragon,\" I said.\n\"You are not. You are evil tempered and too ready to give in to your passions. You are too curious for your own good, and you have allowed past hurts to fester inside you. But these are flaws common to many.\" Denis dismissed them with a flick of fingers and fixed me with a sharp look. \"What I can obtain from you is a unique perspective on events and your peculiar way of reasoning through a problem. Also, you are able to win people's trust and regard, which could be quite useful to me.\"\n\"Useful to you,\" I said. \"An interesting way of putting it.\"\n\"I intend to own you, as I once told you. I still consider you a threat, precisely because of your unique perspective and the fact that people whom I do not own rally to your side.\"\n\"I inconvenience you.\"\n\"An interesting way of putting it.\" Denis tossed my words back to me. \"I am making quite an investment, searching for your daughter and funding your divorce, and I intend to collect.\"\n\"Do not bother with the divorce,\" I said. \"I will look elsewhere for help.\"\n\"Where? Of your acquaintance, only Grenville or I can fund such an endeavor. Lady Breckenridge could, but she would draw herself into deep scandal should anyone discover it. Sir Gideon Derwent could, but he would be more likely to encourage you to reconcile with your wife, which I know to be impossible. You and Grenville have had a falling-out, so I am much afraid, Captain, that you are saddled with me.\"\nI had reached for the port again during this speech, but at his last sentence, my fingers fell away from the glass. \"Good Lord, I've only just come from Grenville's.\" I lifted the goblet and took one last sip. \"I suppose that each time I visit the privy, you receive a report.\"\nDenis smiled thinly. \"You exaggerate. One of my men saw you leave Grenville's very soon after you went in, and from the look on your face, you were upset and angry. You went away to find a hackney, and my man hurried straight back here, arriving before you did. I simply guessed the rest, and you have now confirmed it.\"\n\"I must learn to control my expression,\" I said.\n\"You never will. You convey your exact thoughts, which is a reason people trust you. You never say one thing and think another.\"\n\"Many would call that rudeness.\" I got to my feet. \"Do you have any other useful information for me, or shall I sit here while you tell me exactly what I do every day and why?\"\nDenis did not even blink. \"Question the young woman called Felicity. She has had the privilege, if you can call it that, of entering Mr. Stacy's coach.\"\nI stopped. \"Has she? How do you know that?\"\n\"When you began an interest in Mr. Stacy this morning, I called in all information about him. He has often been seen in Covent Garden by my men. They cannot give me a list of names of which girls he has taken up, as it has been, up until now, casual observation only, but one saw Felicity with you and remembered that she had been one of them.\"\n\"I wondered myself,\" I admitted. \"Felicity is a beautiful young woman and stands out from the others. I doubt that Stacy could resist her.\"\nDenis quirked a brow at me. \"You have.\"\nI touched the head of the cane that Lady Breckenridge had given me, a gift that had sealed our friendship. \"I am satisfied with what I have. Stacy, obviously, is not.\"\n\"Perhaps not. I have also asked my men to follow Stacy and his friend McAdams to see what they get up to. We will soon know if they lead us to the lost young women.\"\n\"Thank you,\" I said.\nWhether Denis appreciated my gratitude or not, I did not know, because he drew his correspondence in front of him and returned his focus to it. He was finished with me. I was just as happy to depart.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Fourteen\n\nI returned home to a written message from Thompson of the Thames River patrol. Like his speeches, the note was laconic.\nMary Chester suffocated--likely deliberate. She'd been dead two days when we found her. From the dirt stains on her frock, she'd lain in or rolled in soil before she died for whatever reason. Coroner is convinced it's unnatural death and has called an inquest for Monday. Sam Chester is beside himself with grief. Thompson.\nAt least we knew how Mary had died. Suffocated. The word implied a pillow or some such thing pressed against her mouth. I had a sudden fear that the soil stains meant someone had buried her alive, but consoled myself with the thought that, if the coroner had thought such a thing, Thompson would have written it.\nI set down the letter, making a note to attend the inquest.\nGrenville kept his word that his servants would continue to help. Later that evening, his coachman, Jackson, came to fetch me.\nJackson filled my doorway, a strong, broad-shouldered man who looked capable of handling unruly horses or ruffians. \"Mr. Grenville says you want to talk to Mr. Stacy's coachman,\" he said. \"I know the tavern where he drinks. I'll take you there.\"\nI snatched up my coat, ready. Bartholomew, even during his continued searching, had found time to bring me beefsteak for supper and to brush my clothes. \"Will I be allowed into this hallowed hall of coachmen?\" I asked.\nJackson smiled, revealing his pointed teeth. \"We'll make an exception, sir. Just mind your manners.\"\nThe tavern he took me to was near where the Strand ended at Charing Cross. The church of St. Martin in the Fields loomed above the rooftops, but on this Friday night, the tavern was full to bursting with noise while the church sat silently.\nThe regulars of the tavern eyed me askance as I entered, but the landlord looked at my fine frock coat, courtesy of Grenville's tailor, and his eyes brightened.\n\"My lord,\" he said, on the off chance that I was one. \"A private room for you?\"\n\"No, thank you,\" I said. \"But three tankards of your best ale, please.\"\nThe landlord nodded, took the crown I offered him, and scuttled away. Jackson led me to a table where a man in coachman's livery waited. The long table was occupied by other drinkers, but the end Stacy's coachman had chosen was relatively empty.\nJackson hooked his foot around a stool and pulled it out, plopping himself down at the end of the table. I seated myself on the bench opposite Stacy's coachman. The landlord obligingly plunked three tankards of ale in front of us.\n\"Captain Lacey, this here is Payne. He's been coaching for Mr. Stacy for eleven years.\"\nPayne offered a work-roughened hand across the table. \"Obliged, Captain.\" He raised his tankard to me and drained at least a third of it.\nHe was a bit older than Jackson, his hair going gray at the temples, with gray scattered through the darker hair on top of his head. Whitish lines feathered about his eyes. His square-tailed coat was of fine green serge, and the brass buttons on it gleamed with polish. A polished brass chain hung across his chest, and his coachman's tall hat with brush lay on the table next to him. He, like Jackson, had a master who wanted his coachman well turned out.\n\"Mr. Stacy is a good man to work for?\" I asked.\nPayne lowered his tankard and wiped his mouth. \"It's a good position, fine coaches to look after, and I'm fond of the beasts.\"\nI noted he'd said nothing directly about Stacy. \"I am afraid that I've come to pry into your master's habits. But there's been murder done, and I want to know by whom and why.\"\nPayne jerked his thumb at Jackson. \"So he said. I told Mr. Stacy I was meeting you here tonight--thought it would be fair. He told me to tell you straight up truth.\"\n\"I appreciate that, both from you and Mr. Stacy. You know, in that case, that I wish to ask you about the girls Mr. Stacy invites into his coach in Covent Garden?\"\n\"In Covent Garden, in Haymarket, in the Strand.\" Payne looked mildly disgusted. \"He can't resist a tart swishing about in her skirts. He likes to watch them--from inside the coach, mind you--getting to know them all. You know, some gentry-coves like to look for birds and note them down in a book, some go into the country and pick up rocks and old bones. Mr. Stacy likes game girls.\"\n\"His collection, so to speak.\"\n\"A good way of putting it, sir. He has me dawdle the carriage along while he looks out of the window and watches where they go and who they talk to and what they buy in the markets. He learns when they come out and when they go home, and even where they live. And then, once he's decided which one he wants to meet, he gets out of the coach, chats to the girl, and invites her up. That's usually in the dead of night, although sometimes he'll get down in the evening, just to talk to them. Make an appointment to meet him later.\"\nI turned my tankard on the table. \"Once he invites one into the coach, he asks you to drive slowly about the streets?\"\n\"Aye. He says I am to drive for one hour, very slowly, any route I choose, as long as I return to where I started at the stroke of the clock.\"\nJackson offered, \"While he gets to know them even better, eh?\"\nPayne took another pull of ale. \"Do you know, sir, I could not tell you what he gets up to with them. They might chat about bonnets for all I know. I looks after the carriage, both inside and out, and I never find anything you might call disgusting.\"\n\"Perhaps he is very careful,\" I said.\n\"Oh, aye, he must be. Else he'd have the clap or something else nasty, wouldn't he? But Mr. Stacy is always clean as can be.\"\nI considered this as I drank my ale. The brew was good, a mixture of malt taste and a touch of tartness. \"I must ask you about Black Bess and Mary Chester. Will you describe what he did on the nights he took up with them? You know which girls I mean?\"\nPayne nodded. \"He told me you'd ask about them. He said to tell what I knew.\"\n\"Start with Mary Chester, as she is the one who's turned up dead.\"\n\"Poor girl, eh? Well, he meets this Mary about a week and a half ago, I'd say. He'd seen her when he had business over Wapping way. Mr. Stacy invests in ships, betting his money that they won't go down or be stolen by pirates. Sometimes he loses, mostly he wins. He likes to look at the ships, sometimes, so we go to London docks or Wapping.\"\nHe took another slurp of ale and continued. \"On one journey, he sees the girl. She looks half respectable but smiles like one of them game girls. Mr. Stacy wants her, so there's nothing for it but he talks to her and fixes it up to come back after dark and have at her. I found him a public house that didn't look too down-at-mouth--which ain't easy near the docks, mind you--and he had wine in a private parlor, reading a book, nice as you please, until time. Then he goes, meets her, we have the hour drive, and he sets her down again. We went back to Mayfair then, thank the Lord.\"\n\"And after that?\"\nPayne looked puzzled. \"How do you mean, exactly?\"\n\"Did he ask Mary to meet him again, in Covent Garden perhaps?\"\n\"Well, if he did, sir, he never told me.\"\n\"Did he often tell you?\" I asked. \"What he meant to do, and with whom?\"\n\"Not in so many words. But I see who he gets down to talk with and who he invites in later. He never talks to me about it at all, 'cept to tell me where to go and when to do the slow drive.\"\n\"Now for Black Bess,\" I said. \"When did he meet her?\"\nPayne grinned, showing that he, too, had filed his teeth. \"I remember her. Black-haired wench, a taking thing. He met her about a day or so after Wapping. Had his eye on her for a long time, and it wasn't the first time he'd had her in the coach. He liked Black Bess. Had her twice. But he set her down again as usual, and we went off home. Didn't see her after that.\"\n\"Again, did he make an appointment to meet her later in Covent Garden?\"\nPayne shook his head. \"Not that I knew about.\"\nIt looked more and more as though McAdams could be the wealthy gentleman who promised to meet the girls. Stacy might have made the appointments for his friend, perhaps recommending girls he liked the best.\nI halted that thought. Stacy was urbane and polished, McAdams crude, despite their similarities in station. I remembered Stacy's embarrassment at McAdams' boorish comments when Grenville and I interviewed him at Tatt's. Would Stacy wish McAdams' company on a girl he liked?\nThen again, I had no idea how Stacy thought about things. The man had a wife and a daughter but preferred to hunt and capture game girls for his sport.\n\"I have to ask a distasteful question,\" I said. \"Does Stacy hurt the girls?\"\nPayne looked surprised. \"Naw. Leastwise, I never saw such a thing. They like him, smile when the carriage stops and all. If they were afraid of him, they'd melt away when they saw him coming, wouldn't they? They must tell each other all about it, wouldn't you think?\"\n\"True,\" I conceded. If Stacy had the habit of beating the girls, word would get around, and only the most desperate would go to him. \"Now, we come to yesterday afternoon. Mr. Stacy was in Covent Garden?\"\n\"That he was. I drove him--not through the square, too crowded--but down Russel Street, thinking to skirt round to Southampton Street. He was looking again, you know, for who he'd like to take up with next. At the edge of the market, he signals me to stop, and he gets down. There's an orange girl he talks to, and he sees her and makes his way to her. He paused to talk to another on the way, but he left her pretty soon for the orange girl. He likes her. He buys an orange and walks back to the carriage. He tells me to drive on, gets in, and we're on our way.\"\n\"Did you see a young lady stop him, seemingly to ask directions?\"\nPayne looked shamefaced. \"I have to admit I didn't notice, sir. The crowd was big, and people kept pushing by the horses. A few boys were tweaking the harness, and I had to clear them off before they spooked the beasts. So Mr. Stacy might have talked to one such as her, but I wasn't looking at him all the time. Sorry, sir.\"\n\"The game girl he paused to speak to--she could not have been my daughter? Gabriella has light brown hair, and she might have seemed agitated and in a hurry.\"\n\"No, this were a game girl, right enough. My master knows the difference.\"\nNo doubt he did. That was one point in Stacy's favor--at least he regulated his proclivities to girls who were used to such things.\nI recalled Thompson's note about Mary. \"What was Mr. Stacy doing Wednesday night?\" I asked abruptly.\nPayne blinked. \"Wednesday?\"\n\"This Wednesday just gone. Did he come to Covent Garden?\"\n\"No, sir.\" His voice held more confidence. \"He went to Almack's to meet his wife and daughter. They go every Wednesday.\"\nI'd never darkened the door of Almack's, that bastion of respectability, where the ton paraded. The most blue-blooded went to Almack's Assembly Rooms to parade their eligible daughters, drink lemonade, and dance on the roped-off dance floor. Young ladies making their debuts waited in some anxiety for the approval of the patronesses, in the form of vouchers for tickets, before they could attend.\nLady Breckenridge had described it to me. \"The lemonade is insipid, the talk is insipid, and the orchestra is insipid, and the patronesses rule over it like it was the kingdom come. I longed to go as a debutante, and then wondered why the moment I entered the place. I begged my mother to take me home, and she did, to my surprise. She hated it too. But Lord, a young lady must go, and good heavens, she mustn't dance the waltz until one of the biddies says she can. Is it any wonder I am so scandalous? I had to be, for the relief.\"\nSo Stacey went to Almack's one night and brought Covent Garden game girls into his coach the next. I knew that many respectably married gentlemen kept mistresses, but I wondered how many lived such a double life as Stacy. \"Did he go to Covent Garden Wednesday at all?\"\n\"No, sir. Dinner at Lord Featherstone's, Almack's Assembly Rooms at eleven o'clock, and home again at two. That was all. Why do you want to know?\"\n\"Because that was the night Mary Chester died, apparently.\"\nPayne's graying brows lifted. \"Was it now? Well, it couldn't have been my gentleman. He never went near the place all that day.\"\n\"What about his friend, Mr. McAdams? Did Stacy ever take McAdams to Covent Garden with him?\"\n\"Naw. This is something my master did alone.\" Payne drained his tankard and swiped the last of the ale from his mouth. \"It were Mr. McAdams got my master started in that way, though, about three year ago. I overheard them--Mr. McAdams telling Mr. Stacy that he could find good sport right here in London without having to go out to the country. Kind of shoved him in the direction, like. I've never seen Mr. McAdams in Covent Garden, but that don't mean he don't go.\"\n\"True. \" I signaled the landlord to bring Payne another ale. \"I do appreciate you answering my questions so frankly, but I must ask, why do you continue to work for Stacy? If you find his activities repulsive.\"\nPayne shrugged. \"Well, he ain't no worse than any other master, I'm thinking. The wages is good, and he buys the livery. I don't much like his 'sport,' but then, all gentry-coves are a little mad for wenches, ain't they? He likes the game girls, but it's what they're for. He don't push his attentions on those he should not, if you take my meaning. And they don't seem to mind him.\"\nI nodded and lifted my tankard, which was still half full. \"In other words, he treats ladies like ladies and game girls like game girls. I suppose most gentlemen do.\"\n\"Exactly, sir. So, I shake my head and drive on as I'm told. Even if he does write it all down in a book.\"\nI stopped, my tankard halfway to my mouth. \"A book?\"\n\"I almost forgot.\"\nAs the landlord deposited another tankard in front of Payne and took up the empty, Payne reached into his coat and drew out a leather-bound book, one made for keeping a journal. He slid it across the table to me. \"He told me to give you this. He's that embarrassed, like, but he wants you to see that there is no entry for your daughter.\"\nI waited until the landlord was well away, then, with some trepidation, I peeled open the book and scanned a page.\nStacy wrote in a clear, flowing script, the kind perfected by tutors in public schools. I still could feel the sting of the cane across my knuckles when my fumbling fingers could not shape the loops and curls to my tutor's satisfaction.\nOctober 3, ran the entry. Brown, blue, good teeth, round. Haymarket. SnT2n.\n\"What does that mean?\" I asked, pointing to the letters and numbers.\n\"Don't know, sir. Never asked.\"\n\"Something about the girls he don't want no one to know?\" Jackson suggested. \"In case someone else reads the book?\"\n\"Quite,\" I said. I wondered why the devil Stacy would let me see this, but if I could not understand half of it, perhaps he saw no harm. \"Even so, he wrote his observations in a book? Good Lord, what if his wife found it?\"\n\"She won't, sir,\" Payne said. \"He has me keep it for him, and I give it to him only when we make our outings, if you see. He's not written his name anywhere in it, so if someone finds it, they won't know it's his, unless they recognize the writing.\"\n\"They might think it yours,\" I pointed out.\n\"Makes no difference. It's mostly nonsense, ain't it? He wants you to read the entries for yesterday.\"\nI flipped to Thursday: 3 o'clock, CG, oranges, blonde, round. AySnTn.\nFarther down the page was another entry: Midnight, oranges, T2yC3.\nFrom this I surmised that the orange girl had made him happy at midnight, but nothing more. It coincided with me seeing Stacy's carriage in Covent Garden that night. I flipped back to the entry for Wednesday and found none. Either Stacy had gone to Almack's in truth, or he'd removed the page for that day. I lifted the book and peered down the length of its spine, but could see no evidence of pages cut from the binding.\n\"May I keep this?\" I asked. \"I will return it tomorrow.\"\nPayne's brows twitched. \"Mr. Stacy would not be happy.\"\n\"If Mr. Stacy has nothing to hide but this little peccadillo, there will be no harm. I will return it with my own hands to your master tomorrow.\"\nPayne did not look pleased, but he nodded.\nI tucked the book into my coat. \"Thank you, Payne. Enjoy the ale.\" Nodding, I rose. Payne stood, bowed to me, and thanked me nicely for the drink.\nJackson followed me outside into the deepening night. He clapped on his hat against the rain and straightened it. \"Nasty goings-on, ain't there?\"\n\"A bit.\" I pressed the book in my pocket against my chest, and we started down the lane to the Strand, where a groom watched after Grenville's horses and rig.\n\"At least I have no cause to be ashamed of my master,\" Jackson said. \"Catch Mr. Grenville doing anything so sordid.\"\n\"Indeed,\" I said.\n\"And writing it down. The man must be daft.\" Jackson shrugged. \"Ah, well, there ain't many like Mr. Grenville.\" He opened the carriage door. Rain streamed down the windows and the polished wood, but Jackson was as poised as he would be on a clear afternoon. \"Where to now, sir?\"\n*** *** ***\nI elected to return home. I saw candles glowing in my front windows above the dark bakery and concluded that Bartholomew had returned and was waiting for me. I quickened my pace, hoping there was news.\nWhen I entered my sitting room, I found Bartholomew nowhere in evidence. Instead, Lady Breckenridge was curled in my wing chair, her eyes closed.\nWhen the door shut, she opened her eyes and smiled. \"There you are, Lacey,\" she said. \"You've been ages.\"\nI had held myself upright too long. Seeing Donata brought of flood of warmth to my limbs, and I had to press my walking stick against the carpet in order to remain standing.\n\"Gabriel?\" Lady Breckenridge asked with a frown. \"Has something else happened?\"\nShe rose and came to me. I dropped the walking stick and gathered her up, much preferring to lean against her. She smelled fine, as she always did, and I buried my face in her neck.\nI felt her soft chuckle. \"Well,\" she murmured. \"That's all right, then.\"\n*** *** ***\nDonata slept with me all night, and said hang the scandal. \"They know,\" she observed in the early hours of the morning as she lay next to me. She traced patterns on my bare chest with one slim finger. \"Everyone knows. They can make of it what they will. I no longer care.\"\n\"Bold lady.\" I touched her cheek. \"I like you being bold.\"\n\"You were not made for a timid woman, Gabriel. It does not suit you.\" She paused. \"Did you know? Today is my birthday.\"\n\"Is it?\" I'd had no idea. \"And you've chosen to spend it with a wreck like me. You honor me.\"\nShe shrugged. \"I usually spend it at home in Oxfordshire, but I did not want to leave London while you were in the midst of troubles.\" Her fingertips moved to my lips. \"I am thirty.\"\nI smiled, feeling her warm body curving against mine. \"Ancient.\"\n\"I am certainly ten times wiser than at twenty. What an astounding innocent I was.\"\n\"I am sorry you've had to face so much,\" I said.\n\"One must hurt to learn,\" Lady Breckenridge answered with a stoicism I knew she did not feel. \"I have my little lad. I in no way regret that. And I trounced you at billiards. I in no way regret that, either.\"\n\"I paid up that five pounds,\" I reminded her with mock severity.\nShe remained silent, studying me, her eyes a mystery. \"What do you in no way regret?\"\n\"Losing to you at billiards,\" I said.\n\"Not a fair answer. You knew I wanted you to say that.\"\n\"Perhaps.\" I leaned down and kissed the dark line of her hair, breathing in her scent. \"I in no way regret falling in love with you.\"\nShe looked at me, startled. \"In love?\"\n\"The feeling came unlooked for, but I have grown to cherish it. I love you, Donata.\"\nHer answer came without words, and it satisfied me very much.\n*** *** ***\nBrilliant sunlight and the sound of curtains drawing back woke me. I pried open my eyes. Donata lay in a nest of linens beside me, sleeping the deep sleep of a late riser. Bartholomew hovered in the room at a respectful distance, holding a tray heaped with dishes.\n\"Good morning, sir. I brought breakfast for yourself and her ladyship, along with your morning correspondence.\"\nI brushed hair out of my eyes and sat up carefully so as not to disturb Lady Breckenridge. \"Thank you, Bartholomew. It was good of you.\"\nBartholomew set the tray on the bedside table. The aroma of sausage wafted to me, and my stomach rumbled.\n\"And Miss Simmons has come to see you.\"\nI half groaned, torn between relief that Marianne was all right and annoyance that she had chosen to call just now. \"Marianne on an empty stomach is not to be borne. Tell her to come back later if it has nothing to do with the search.\"\nBartholomew hesitated. \"The thing is, sir, she arrived in London early this morning and went to the Clarges Street house. The servants there were instructed to deny her admittance, and she is most distressed.\"\nBloody hell. \"Yes, she would be. Very well, hand me my dressing gown, I'll see her.\"\nI looked regretfully at the beckoning sausages, took a quick sip of the coffee that steamed in its cup, then climbed from the bed. Bartholomew helped me don my dressing gown, then I went out to explain things to Marianne. Through it all, Donata never woke.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Fifteen\n\nMarianne wore a chocolate brown traveling gown with a red sash, and her brown-and-green plaid shawl matched the trim on the bonnet she dangled from its cherry-red ribbons. She was well turned out and looked quite smart, the ensemble complementing her childlike looks and golden curls.\nHer face, however, was white and strained, her eyes red with weeping. \"Lacey, what in God's name happened?\" She threw the bonnet to the floor as I emerged from my bedchamber and closed the door behind me. \"I went to Clarges Street and that pious maid Alicia refused me the door. When I argued with her, she said it was his orders, and then Dickon pressed forward, sweet as you please, and said I had to leave. They would not tell me why. They would not let me in even to get my things. Damnation, what has happened?\"\nSkirts swirling, Marianna fell into the wing chair, where she sat with arms folded like a petulant child.\n\"I told him about David,\" I said.\nMarianne grabbed the chair's arms and sat up straight. \"You did, did you? Well, I suppose I told you to. You were to have sent word to me, so that I could stay with David if he cut up rough.\"\n\"There was not time to send word, had I even known you'd gone. I told him the entire tale late afternoon yesterday.\"\n\"I expect that he was disgusted, knowing his money went to the by-blow of another man, never mind that man's dead and gone seven years now. Catch me taking your advice again, Lacey. You lost me a soft billet.\"\nMarianne spoke offhandedly, but her fingers whitened where they gripped the chair.\n\"He was not angry because of David,\" I said. \"He was all sympathy and even said he'd keep the money going to the boy. No, he was incensed because we had not trusted him about it.\"\nShe looked startled. \"What do you mean?\"\n\"We believed he'd either refuse to have anything to do with David or that he would take complete control of David's life. Grenville decided to do neither. But the fact that we did not trust him to be goodhearted upset him a great deal.\" I paused. \"He is a man slow to anger, but we have managed it between us.\"\n\"He is angry at you as well?\"\n\"He asked me to explain that he would continue your allowance so that you could care for David but requested that he never see you again. Or me.\"\n\"You? Why?\"\n\"Because I doubted him, just as you did. Because Grenville has unbent a great deal for both of us, and we repay him by suspecting everything he does. You and I are cautious by nature, but with Grenville, we went too far. He was trying to do good by us, and we threw it back in his face.\"\nMarianne's throat worked. \"I have ruined your friendship as well?\"\n\"I ruined it.\" I touched my chest in my worn dressing gown. \"With my pride. Hence all the pithy warnings about pride going before a fall.\" It hurt, that loss of friendship, and I'd feel the emptiness when I had more time to think about it.\nMarianne turned her head and stared at the cold fireplace. \"It does not matter. I was ready to give him the push, at any rate. So dull living in his house and being paraded about only when he likes.\"\n\"Stop,\" I said.\nShe jerked her head up, her eyes bright with tears. \"It is true.\"\n\"No, it is not.\" I spread my hands. \"I plan to pen him a letter of abject apology, and I believe you should as well. If we throw ourselves at his feet, he might condescend to acknowledge us again. Or he might tell us to go to the devil. But I believe it worth a try.\"\n\"Throw myself at his feet?\" She gave me a look of disbelief.\n\"Whyever not? What have you to lose that you have not already lost?\"\nMarianne tried to hold on to her bravado, and then, for the first time since I'd known her, she let her mask fall away. Even seeing Marianne with David hadn't revealed what she showed me now. I saw a woman desperately lonely and frightened of her coming life, a woman who had finally found one straw to cling to, and now saw that straw being ripped from her grasp.\nMarianne cared for Grenville--I had known that before, but I had not realized how much. Tears spilled from her eyes, not tears of self-pity. She pressed the heels of her hands to her face and let the tears flow. \"God help me, Lacey, what have I done?\"\nI drew a handkerchief from my dressing gown. Crouching before her, I dabbed at the tears that smeared her face. \"You fell in love and did not know what to do.\"\n\"Fell in love,\" Marianne repeated bitterly. \"What kind of idiot am I?\"\n\"He cares for you as well. I know he does. Go to him and grovel--on your knees if you have to. Tell him what you feel for him.\"\nShe gave a short laugh. \"So he can kick me and have his footmen drag me from the house? I am already in pain enough, thank you very much.\"\n\"You must trust him. He might not take you back, or me either, but we have to tell him what he means to us. For me, he means a loyal friendship, better than I ever thought I'd find. For you, a man who can make you happy.\"\n\"Can he?\" She wiped tears from her eyes. \"I have never been happy, Lacey. I cannot imagine what it is like.\"\n\"Do you think it worth a little groveling to find out?\"\nMarianne gave a shaky laugh. \"Oh, why not? I don't suppose he can make me feel any worse than I do now. You are right, you know. I love the bloody man. I love everything about him, damn him.\"\n\"I know you do.\" I stroked her hair, trying to look hopeful, but in truth I did not know what Grenville would do. He'd been angry and deeply hurt, and I had the feeling that he wished the both of us at the bottom of the river.\n\"I vow,\" came Lady Breckenridge's voice. \"I really ought to send someone ahead before I enter rooms.\"\nMarianne jumped. I rose carefully, knowing that Donata could not be pleased to see me, clad in only my dressing gown, kneeling before Marianne and touching her tenderly.\nDonata herself had dressed, her long-skirted, half-sleeved gown looking as fresh as it had when she'd arrived yesterday evening. She'd bundled her hair into a long velvet hood, and a fine chain dangled from her wrist. She looked ready for a brisk walk in Hyde Park rather than just having come from the bed of her lover.\nMarianne heaved herself from the chair. \"I'll go down and get Ma Beltan to give me coffee,\" she said wearily. \"What time do you think his nibs pries himself out of bed?\"\n\"I have no idea,\" I said. \"He rises at a fashionable hour but might get up earlier today, because of our current problem.\"\nMarianne's face softened. \"Bartholomew told me what happened. I am sorry, Lacey.\"\nI nodded. \"Come back after you've found coffee. I have a few things I need to ask you while you're waiting.\"\nShe wiped away more tears. \"If I must.\" She moved past Lady Breckenridge, who watched her coolly. \"You needn't worry, my lady. I am not after stealing him. I only borrowed his shoulder to cry on.\"\nDonata's brows arched as Marianne went on out the door. A lady of the demimonde such as Marianne should not have presumed to speak to a lady of the ton. They both should pretend the other did not exist. In their worlds, they did not.\nThe door closed with a click, and Donata turned to me. \"That is Marianne Simmons? The lady I saw in Grenville's box a few nights ago?\"\n\"Indeed, it was.\"\nHer face softened to understanding. \"You told me you were forever smoothing the waters between them.\"\n\"Yes, but the waters might now be too rough for me to steer. I will have to let the two of them flounder on their own for a time.\"\n\"Hmm.\" Lady Breckenridge's eyes narrowed, and she drew Stacy's crisp leather-bound book out from behind her back. \"I came to tell you that this makes for interesting reading, I must say. What the devil is it?\"\nI started. I had taken the book from my pocket when I'd undressed the night before, and I realized I'd left it on the bedside table. I reached for it. \"Nothing for your eyes.\"\nLady Breckenridge lifted it high and walked away from me. \"But it is quite intriguing. March Fifteenth, the Strand, blonde, brown eyes, innocent, quite pretty. I do not imagine this means a horse. I cannot make out the rest, SnTy2y. What on earth is that?\"\n\"The book does not belong to me,\" I said quickly. I held out my hand for it, but Donata ignored me, leafing through the pages as she paced.\n\"To whom does it belong, then? And what are all these numbers and letters? Code for races on which this gentleman will place bets?\" She looked back at me. \"I think not.\"\nI rubbed my hands on my suddenly cold arms. \"I did not mean for you to find that. It belongs to Jeremiah Stacy and might contain evidence as to whether or not he murdered Mary Chester.\"\nHer look of suspicion was replaced by one of interest. \"Really? Why?\"\n\"I hesitate to tell you. It is rather sordid.\"\n\"Excellent, then it will not be dull. Do tell me, Lacey. I am a bored widow in need of excitement.\"\nI smiled to myself at the description, then I launched into an abbreviated version of my discussion with Payne. Donata listened avidly, glancing at the book from time to time.\nWhen I finished, she grimaced. \"Goodness, who would have guessed that Jeremiah Stacy would be up to such goings-on. Patrice Stacy is a vapid thing, but I do not think she deserves a husband with an obsession with prostitutes. Are all men so disgusting?\"\nI was saved from having to answer by Marianne reentering the room, carrying a mug of coffee and a hard roll. \"I believe they are,\" she said to Donata's question. \"With a few exceptions.\" She plopped down comfortably at my writing table and took a noisy sip of coffee. \"I heard you mention Mr. Stacy. What's he done?\"\nI leaned against my chest-on-frame and folded my arms, giving up trying to pry the book from Donata's hands. \"I wanted to ask you about him, Marianne. Whether you'd ever met him, what you thought of him, anything you've heard about him. He might have murdered a game girl and kidnapped another.\"\nMarianne raised her brows. \"Really? I wouldn't have pegged him for that, but he is an odd cove.\" She tore off a bite of bread with white teeth and chewed thoughtfully. \"I haven't seen him in some time, but he used to linger at the theatre in Drury Lane, waiting for the opera dancers and girls in the chorus to emerge. He liked to talk to us; sometimes he'd single one out, sometimes another. Some of the girls hoped he'd set them up as their protector, because he has plenty of blunt, but he never did.\"\n\"He was never rough or threatening?\" I asked. \"No one was afraid of him?\"\nMarianne shrugged. \"He seemed harmless. He liked to talk and jest, liked to pretend he was friends with all the girls, though in truth, they only wanted his money. Some gentlemen are like that. For them, talking to low women and getting to know them is a thrill, even if they never touch any of them.\"\nLady Breckenridge continued leafing through the journal. \"I think I see. Stacy went one better and wrote of his encounters in this book. Rather like a man who describes sightings of exotic birds. Vulgar,\" she said dismissively. \"His name is rarely on my guest lists, but it will be nonexistent now.\"\n\"He wrote it down?\" Marianne asked. \"May I see?\"\nWordlessly, and before I could stop her, Lady Breckenridge held the book out to Marianne. Marianne took it, wiped her buttery fingers on the bread, and began leafing through the book. \"I wonder what the letters and numbers mean.\"\n\"I have no idea,\" I said. \"His coachman did not know either. Stacy's personal code, for whatever he wanted to note without being obvious.\"\n\"A point in Stacy's favor that he let you see this,\" Lady Breckenridge said.\n\"His coachman answered my questions readily enough, apparently with Stacy's blessing. Stacy seems quite eager to be open and aboveboard, as though he has nothing to hide among gentlemen. The coachman could be a very loyal servant, however, and help Stacy cover up anything he might have done.\"\n\"The smaller letters are all y and n,\" Marianne said, studying the pages. \"Probably for yes and no. So the larger letters are a question or a quality, and the answer is yes or no.\"\n\"You might very well have hit on it,\" I said.\n\"What are the numbers then?\" Lady Breckenridge asked. \"If 2y is 2 yes . . . I wonder what that means?\"\nThe fact that the two of them, my lady and Marianne Simmons, were clinically discussing sordid notes made by a gentleman about street girls made me shudder. I could only stand by and watch.\n\"I wonder if S stands for syphilis,\" Marianne said. \"All entries are marked with an S with either a y or n following. That would be of concern to a Mayfair gentleman with a family. Perhaps one reason he walks among the street girls and gets to know them is to discover what diseases they have. Sn means they are healthy, and therefore acceptable.\"\nLady Breckenridge nodded. \"Yes, I can see the fastidious Stacy making certain they have no disease.\" She sniffed and opened the reticule that she'd left on the writing table, from which she withdrew a thin cigarillo. \"Rather like purchasing horseflesh. Does he check their teeth?\"\n\"Perhaps that's what T stands for,\" Marianne said, scanning an entry.\n\"Teeth, yes, I suppose that makes a sort of sense.\"\n\"Unless it means something more sordid.\"\nLady Breckenridge lit the cigarillo with a candle. She filled her mouth with smoke then let it trickle out with her words. \"I can think of several sordid things that begin with the letter T.\"\n\"So can I,\" Marianne agreed.\nI lifted the book from Marianne's hands. \"That will be enough of that.\"\nMarianne frowned. \"I am trying to help, Lacey. If Stacy offed this girl, I shall be very angry with him. Grenville will have to cut him dead.\"\nLady Breckenridge had sunk gracefully into the wing chair, a little smile on her face at my discomfiture. There were no other seats in the room, so I remained standing.\n\"Grenville has already cut Brian McAdams,\" I said. \"He is another possibility for the murderer.\"\nLady Breckenridge wrinkled her nose. \"I am pleased to hear it. McAdams was a friend of my late husband. I have been cutting him for years, but Grenville's gesture will blackball him entirely.\"\n\"Even if Stacy did not kill Mary Chester, do you think, Marianne, that he could kidnap a girl and hold her against her will? Do you think he is the sort who would do that?\"\nMarianne shrugged. \"I'm not certain. He was always friendly and chatty, but as I said, a bit odd. His good nature could mask cunning, but as you know, I never trust a gentleman.\" She finished with a bitter twist to her lips.\n\"My thought was that perhaps Stacy did kidnap Mary Chester and Black Bess, and very possibly my daughter. Perhaps he did not mean to kill Mary, or perhaps someone else did that--McAdams with his rough ways. When Stacy discovered that either he or McAdams had killed Mary, he panicked and carried her to Bottle Bill's, knowing about Bottle Bill's violent drunken spells--having learned this either from the girls or from his own observation.\"\n\"You could always ask him,\" Lady Breckenridge said. \"You and the sword in your walking stick.\"\n\"I intend to.\" I ran my hand through my unruly hair. \"I would like to have Pomeroy arrest Stacy while we continue to look for Bess and Gabriella, although I am afraid that if Stacy is taken, McAdams might harm the girls. Pomeroy could arrest both, but moving against two upper-class Mayfair gentlemen is risky for him.\"\n\"You could have Pomeroy arrest Stacy and then follow McAdams to see what he does,\" Lady Breckenridge suggested.\n\"I thought of that as well. Denis has already put men to follow Stacy and McAdams, so we may see what they do, and I will certainly grab Stacy and shake him again. What I want most of all . . .\" I stopped and drew a breath. \"Is the return of my daughter.\"\nBoth ladies looked at me, true sympathy in their faces. Each of them had a son, and they knew what I felt.\n\"Stacy and McAdams might be innocent of this crime,\" I said after a time. \"Bottle Bill is a panicked and pathetic man. He will say what he needs to say to keep himself from Newgate. He might have killed Mary himself, even accidentally, and be lying through his teeth about it.\"\n\"Then what do we do?\" Marianne asked.\n\"Keep searching,\" I said. \"I'll not stop until she's found.\"\n\"Neither will we,\" Lady Breckenridge said. She did not come to me. She remained seated with her cigarillo, but her eyes told me more than words what she felt.\n*** *** ***\nThe search continued that morning, through the afternoon, and on into evening, with various contingents reporting to me. Pomeroy sent messages from Bow Street with information gleaned by his patrollers.\nCoaching inns had been searched and landlords questioned, to no avail. None remembered seeing a girl fitting Gabriella's description at their inn, either alone or with a young man. Sir Gideon Derwent persuaded a few magistrates to invade and close down several known bawdy houses, but Gabriella was not found in any of them. Neither was Black Bess.\nColonel Brandon came to report to me himself around eight o'clock that the inns he and the soldiers had checked along the road to Dover had yielded nothing. If Gabriella had fled to France, no one had seen her. Brandon had sent the soldiers farther, to check Dover itself and any ships leaving for Calais.\n\"Thank you,\" I said sincerely. \"Your help has made much difference.\"\n\"I would feel better if I had some news to report,\" Brandon said.\n\"Even knowledge that she has not been somewhere helps. We can narrow the search, concentrate effort elsewhere.\"\nWe stood in the bake shop, where I had returned for coffee and bread for supper. Brandon lowered his voice so that the lady who had come in to purchase a loaf would not overhear. \"How long do you plan to search?\"\n\"As long as it takes,\" I said. \"The rest of my life if necessary.\"\nHe scrutinized me with his piercing blue eyes. \"You do know that she might never be found. I dislike to tell you that, but it happens. We saw it all the time in Spain and Portugal, where families would be separated and sons and daughters lost.\"\n\"I know.\" I remembered the despair and grief of people searching for one another in the Spanish towns we had taken and the sickening feeling that I could do nothing to help them. French soldiers dragged off daughters for their pleasure, sons to recruit against their will. The English, there to drive out the French, had not necessarily been kinder.\n\"I know you will not cease,\" Brandon said. \"I will help as I can.\"\n\"Tell Louisa it was not her fault.\"\n\"She is apt to take the blame, especially in matters where you are concerned.\"\n\"Whatever happened to us?\" I asked abruptly.\n\"Eh?\" He gave me a sharp look. \"How do you mean?\"\n\"We used to be fast friends, in the first days, in India. You got me my commission. You pinned the rank on me yourself, smiling like a proud papa. And then . . .\"\nBrandon scowled. \"And then I realized that you were a stubborn, arrogant, hotheaded pain in the fundament.\"\nI had to smile. \"If you thought so, why did you not cut me? Why help me rise through the ranks? You risked your money and your good name on this arrogant hothead.\"\nHe looked uncomfortable. \"Because you were a damned fine officer, that is why. We needed good officers, and much as I hate to praise you to your face, you were one of the best.\" Brandon loosened his collar. \"Besides, if I had dropped you, Louisa would have killed me.\"\nI wanted to take offense at his words, but there was nothing for it. I laughed out loud. The bread-buying lady stared at us on her way out. \"You are a poor specimen, Brandon.\"\n\"You were not married long enough to understand.\" He gave me a superior look. \"When your Lady Breckenridge gets her fingers into you, it is I who will laugh.\" He nodded to me, then to Mrs. Beltan behind her counter. \"I'll be going, Lacey. I will help you search as long as you need me.\"\nHis face a bit redder than usual, he ducked out of the bake shop, slapping on his hat. Any conversation that hinted of sentimentality or reconciliation embarrassed him.\nI finished my dinner and went out in search of Felicity. I found her in Covent Garden, talking to another game girl in the shadow of the theatre. I didn't know the girl's name, but she had often called out to me as I walked in the area, teasing me with her friends.\n\"Any good news, Captain?\" Felicity asked as I walked away with her after a short exchange of banter with the other girl. \"Lela there hasn't seen Black Bess in ages, or anyone who looks like your daughter, I'm sorry to say.\"\n\"Thank you for trying. But I do want to speak to you about something else. May we?\"\nFelicity flashed a smile as I gestured her onward as though she were a society lady at a garden party. We made our way toward where an ale seller had set up makeshift benches by laying boards across empty ale kegs.\nI reflected that \"exotic\" described Felicity well. Her deep brown eyes and bone structure conjured visions of harems of the East, complemented by dark skin and glossy black hair that enticed a man's touch. She showed off each of her advantages, wearing a gown of striking blue that accented her skin, and dressing her hair in heavy braids looped against her head. She could smile with a combination of red lips and white teeth to entrance a man's gaze to her mouth. She did not dress immodestly, but any gentleman looking at her would find his thoughts turning to desire.\nI seated her on a relatively empty bench and sat down next to her. I removed Stacy's journal from my pocket, opened it to a page I'd marked, and held it up so we both could see it.\n\"Great happiness,\" I read in a low voice. \"Sn2y3y. Pleasure untold. I have not quite worked out what all the twos and threes mean, but I do understand what he means by great happiness. It's another way of saying Felicity.\"\nHer eyes were still, but I sensed quick thoughts behind them. \"What is this, Captain?\"\n\"The notes of a man called Stacy. You know him.\"\n\"What if I do?\"\nI closed the book and tucked it back into my pocket. \"I noticed this entry when I read through it this morning. Strange that I have been looking for a wealthy gentleman who could have lured Black Bess and Mary Chester to Covent Garden. Yet you have never mentioned Mr. Stacy, a wealthy man of Mayfair who likes to talk to game girls and make appointments with them.\"\nHer gaze flicked from mine. \"Maybe I did not want to get him into trouble?\"\n\"Why should Mr. Stacy get into trouble if he has nothing to do with this?\"\nFelicity shrugged. \"I would not like to see him arrested, Captain. He is very rich.\" She sent me a suggestive smile that did not reach her eyes.\n\"He might have kidnapped and killed Mary Chester, and the same fate might await Bess. Not to mention my daughter.\"\nShe laughed, a sultry, seductive sound. Anyone watching us would believe Felicity busy seducing me. \"Mr. Stacy wouldn't hurt a fly.\"\n\"Mary Chester is dead.\"\n\"Her hard luck.\"\nI raised my brows. \"You do not care that Stacy, a man you let bed you, might have killed a woman, even accidentally?\"\n\"And I tell you, he could not have.\"\n\"Why not?\" I set my mouth in a hard line. \"Explain it to me. Why should I not have Pomeroy arrest him for murdering the girl? He is the most likely person to have done the crime--both women went to meet a wealthy gentleman, and Stacy has admitted a passion for game girls. An obsession, more like, judging by his journal entries.\"\n\"Maybe,\" Felicity said. \"But I tell you, he's a gentle sort. Wouldn't hurt a fly, like I said.\"\n\"But what if a girl refused him? Might he cut up rough? Force her?\"\nTo my surprise, Felicity laughed again. \"You do not understand, Captain. Of course he would not. He never did the job with any of us. He couldn't.\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Sixteen\n\nI blinked. \"You mean that Stacy is impotent?\"\n\"That's exactly what I mean. His wick won't stand up long enough for anything. Poor man.\"\n\"But he has a daughter.\"\n\"He might have been able to do the deed when he was younger. But now, no. Happens to some.\"\n\"Then why on earth does he take all these girls into his carriage?\" I asked. \"According to his coachman, they stay with him for an hour, while Payne drives through the streets, dead slow.\"\nFelicity gave me an amused look. \"You are obviously a man with no fear in that regard. Mr. Stacy dandles them on his knee and talks to them. He touches them; they touch him. But there is never consummation.\"\n\"But perhaps, in his frustration . . .\"\n\"He hurts them? Naw. He likes the touching, and the girls don't mind him pawing. He doesn't hurt anyone, he's never going to give any of us a by-blow, and he pays good money. And Stacy is friendly, doesn't treat a girl like she's gutter trash and then expects her to give him what he wants, even when it's clear he hates her.\"\nAt this last, her eyes flashed sudden anger, a rage so incandescent I could not believe it could be contained in one human being. Felicity shielded her gaze a moment later, but I had seen.\n\"This has happened to you?\" I asked quietly.\nShe tried to sound offhand. \"It happens to all girls who ply a particular trade.\"\n\"You are thinking of a certain instance.\"\n\"It does not matter, does it? When you do what I do, you learn to expect it. There's gentlemen, Captain, that hate women. Perhaps their mothers beat them or their wives scorn them, I do not know. But they hate them with fury. And so they find a woman who must sit still while he despises her. She has to let him unleash every ounce of anger and frustration and hatred on her, and she has to take it, because that's what she's for.\"\nHer dark eyes swam with tears. She did not cry, as Carlotta might, wanting pity and soothing words. Felicity fought her demons and did so on her own.\n\"That is not what you are for,\" I said.\nShe brushed moisture from her eyes. \"Don't talk like a reformer, Captain. They come round telling me I can be 'useful.' As what, I'd like to know.\"\n\"My friend Mrs. Brandon found Nancy a position at an inn. Perhaps she can do the same for you.\"\nFelicity laughed again, this time in true mirth. \"Nance is different from me. She's a cheerful soul and gets on with people. I am no fool. Any man who employs me wants me in his bed, and that is all. Women dislike me on sight. Maybe it won't be so when I'm old and wrinkled, but it is now.\" She gave me a knowing look. \"And Nance adores you. If you told her to climb up into yonder church spire and cluck like a chicken, she'd do it. For you.\"\n\"You exaggerate. And I cannot help but notice you also have led me a long way from my original questions. If you think Stacy could not have harmed Mary or Bess or Gabriella, who could have? If you are protecting someone, I will have the law on you as hard as I will on him. I want my daughter back.\"\n\"I know.\" Felicity laid her hand on my arm. \"I really do not know where she is, Captain. I wish I did, 'cause I'd love to see the look on your face when I brought her home to you. You'd be that grateful. You might even forget about that pretty gentry lady you have as your ladybird long enough to thank me.\"\nI slanted her a quick smile. \"You will have to make do with my gratitude.\" I stood up and pulled her to her feet. I gave the ale seller a coin and had him draw a cup, which I handed to Felicity. \"Take some refreshment and then keep searching, if you will. And if you know anything, anything, I want you to tell me. All right?\"\nFelicity took the cup. \"I'll do my best for you, Captain, promise.\" She drank the ale, but gave me such a smoldering look over the rim of the goblet that I strode away as quickly as I could. Her low laughter floated behind me.\n*** *** ***\nMajor Auberge had come to Grimpen Lane in my absence. He waited uncomfortably for me in the bake shop and, at my invitation, ascended with me to my rooms.\nHe looked unhappier than ever, his face aged and tired. \"Please tell me you have discovered things,\" he said. \"I cannot bear this much longer.\"\n\"I have been questioning people, but no, I have not found her.\"\nAuberge covered his face and was silent for a time. I left him alone, moving about my rooms, reading messages and scribbling answers to them.\nWhen at last Auberge lowered his hands, his lashes were wet. \"What are we to do? Carlotta is grieving. She has begun to worry about our children in France, though I assure her that my brother can look after them especially well. Better than we can, it seems.\"\n\"Do not give up,\" I said savagely. \"We owe it to Gabriella not to give up.\"\nAuberge shook his head. \"This is perhaps why France was pushed aside by England in the war. We feel things so, and we cannot go on.\"\nI tossed down my pen, sending ink spattering over my clean paper. \"Do not talk like a fool. We feel things as much, but I refuse to give up. And I will not let you either.\"\n\"I am an old man, and tired. I have not slept since she went, no matter how I have tried.\" He gave me a look of naked misery. \"I know she is not my daughter in truth. I know she belongs to you. But I love her, and I cherish her.\"\n\"Tell me about her,\" I said suddenly. \"Tell me what she was like when she was young, how she grew, what she learned. Tell me everything.\"\nHe looked surprised, then reluctant, as though he did not want to sift through memories that were now painful. After a moment, however, he sank to the wing chair, and began to tell me. He spoke haltingly, sometimes groping for the words in English, but as he spun the narrative, my daughter came alive for me.\nAuberge described how he'd had difficulty adjusting to living with a small girl in his house, how she'd wanted to see everything and explore everything and overturn everything. She'd taken eagerly to riding, with Auberge leading the little horse, she perched on a tiny saddle. Gabriella had grown swiftly, her pudgy arms and legs lengthening to coltish limbs, as she'd run and played and rode across the hills of their home in provincial France.\nShe had great affection for her younger brothers and sisters and helped her mother look after them all. She was a quick learner, reading both French and English and writing in a good hand before she'd been six years old. She'd had lessons with her brothers under their tutor and declared she wanted to be a teacher or a governess. Everyone had laughed, because of course, she would marry well and hire governesses of her own. She'd blossomed into a young woman and had already caught the attention of a few young gentlemen, although she had not yet made her debut.\nI listened intently, picturing what Auberge told me, my chest tight with envy. I laughed when he described how Gabriella had told the parish priest that she refused to say rosaries because she wanted to worship the English God, like her mother. Though Gabriella had grown up far from me, some of her antics put me in mind of myself as a child. I smiled with pride at the story of her donning on her brother's clothes at age twelve and climbing a fence to steal apples.\n\"She is a Lacey,\" I said. \"Carlotta must grind her teeth over it.\"\nAuberge nodded. \"She is apt to blame Gabriella's wilder escapades on you. In my hearing only, of course.\"\nOf course. I imagined that Carlotta had never wanted to tell Gabriella of her true origins, because the girl might have wanted to rush off to England to find me. Carlotta, on the other hand, obviously wanted nothing to do with me.\nOnce more, in the continuing litany in my head, I prayed to God that Gabriella was alive and well.\nBartholomew marched upstairs to interrupt our reminiscences. \"Mr. Grenville has arrived, sir.\"\nI heard his step, and then Grenville, resplendent in afternoon riding clothes, appeared. He hesitated at the sight of Auberge, but nodded cordially. \"Major.\"\nAuberge seemed to sense his wariness. He rose. \"Mr. Grenville. I will go.\"\n\"No need,\" Grenville said. \"I have come to continue assisting you. Jackson, too, is keen to have another go.\"\nI got to my feet. \"I am grateful. There was no need to come yourself.\"\n\"There was need.\" Grenville shifted. \"Like to see a thing through, and all that.\"\nI shrugged as though I did not care one way or another. \"I was about to go down to the Strand, to the place Mary was found, and look near there. I know Denis's men and Pomeroy's have scoured the place, but I want to look again. Whoever carried the body to Bottle Bill's would not have wanted to take it far.\"\n\"Excellent. I will have Jackson drive you.\"\n\"That is not necessary, but good of you to offer. Perhaps you and he can join Colonel Brandon, who has started searching points farther east, into the City and beyond.\"\n\"Dash it, Lacey.\" Grenville shifted again, his eyes dark and troubled. \"I am trying to eat humble pie. I am not good at it, never having had to do it before.\"\nI blinked. \"You are apologizing?\"\n\"Yes, do not sound so devilish shocked. I know it is a strange endeavor for Lucius Grenville, but you might let me get through it.\"\n\"I am surprised only because I had thought to write an apology to you,\" I said. \"I behaved badly, and I know it.\"\n\"No, I behaved badly.\" Red crept into Grenville's cheeks. \"Throwing a tantrum because neither you nor Marianne would think and speak as I wanted you to. I expected you to fall down and worship me because I condescended to befriend you. You ought to have struck me with that walking stick of yours and told me what a prig I was.\"\n\"Why, when you are striking yourself so well?\"\n\"Do not laugh at me, Lacey, I beg you.\" Grenville squared his shoulders and held out his hand. \"We could both go on and on about who is the worse, but shall we shake and settle it? My stomach will certainly feel better.\"\nI took his hand, feeling better myself. I had feared my friendship with him at a true end.\nGrenville grinned at me as we clasped hands, hard, then he assumed his usual air of nonchalance. It would never do for the great Grenville to be seen having an emotion.\n\"What about Marianne?\" I asked as I stepped back.\nHe looked pained. \"I will cross the Marianne bridge when I come to it. I am certain that she will step on me when I grovel to her, but I will do it.\"\n\"She said much the same thing about you.\"\nHis brows rose. \"Did she?\"\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"She returned from Berkshire very early this morning and was most upset to be turned away from the Clarges Street house.\"\n\"Hmm.\" Grenville straightened his already straight neckcloth. \"Well, this will be an interesting reconciliation. Shall we go out and search, gentlemen? The air around the Thames might not be as cloying as it is here.\"\n*** *** ***\nThe sun had finally set after long summer twilight by the time Jackson let the three of us out on the Strand. Jackson stayed with the carriage while we found the lane near Bottle Bill's lodgings where Mary's body had lain.\nIn the approaching night, a few rats scuttled there, but no one else. One of Denis's men went past on a cross street. He noticed us and came to us, lantern in hand. I told him what we were doing, and he left again without word.\nThe lane was cluttered with debris, old boards, part of a door, and rusting basins. Bottle Bill and his helper had brought Mary here from Bill's lodgings two streets over. Once the sun fully set, this lane would be inky black. Already the blank walls of the houses to either side cast deep shadows.\n\"Let us return to Bottle Bill's rooms,\" I said, \"and widen the search from there.\"\nGrenville and Auberge agreed, probably because they, like me, felt that there was little else we could do. We walked in silence to the house were Bottle Bill eked out his existence.\nThe door to Bill's lodgings was gray with age. The paint had peeled until only a few streaks of black were left to tell us the door's original color. I'd wondered how the murderer managed to get the body inside Bill's lodgings, but I saw that the door did not latch correctly. Bill probably never bothered to lock it in any case. The door was ajar even now, and I knocked on it as I pushed it inward.\nI found an empty room, fairly large but stuffy, the only air coming from the cracked window near the door. A pallet of blankets lay against the wall near a fireplace, which was cold. Across the room sat a table holding the remains of a meal.\nThe room led to no other. Where I would expect to find a door to a stair that would take me to the upper rooms, I saw blank brick instead. As Auberge and Grenville looked about, I went outside and noted a second window next to Bill's and a door beyond that, which looked much newer than Bill's door. I concluded that this had once been one house, with the downstairs partitioned off to create a room that could then be let.\nI wondered if the landlord lived next door, or whether the rest of the house was let to someone else. I stepped up to the second door, which had a little more paint on it than Bill's, and lifted my walking stick to tap on it.\nJust then, I heard shouting in the street beyond. \"Nab 'im! Come back here, you!\"\nBottle Bill himself hurtled down the lane, arms pumping, head down. I stepped in front of him, and he rammed into me full force.\nI dropped my walking stick and seized him. Bill fought furiously. Auberge and Grenville emerged from Bill's lodgings, and two of Denis's men ran up behind me.\n\"Let me go,\" Bill screamed. \"I didn't do it.\"\nI shook him. \"Didn't do what?\"\n\"Let me go,\" he moaned.\n\"There you are, ye little bugger.\" Denis's man, who'd looked in on us earlier, breathed hard in anger. \"Let me have him, Captain. I'll thrash him for you.\"\n\"What did he do this time?\"\n\"Didn't stop when we said to. He were trying to hide something, he was, but he runned away when he saw us coming.\"\nMy grip tightened on Bill's bony shoulder. \"Bill? What are you hiding?\"\n\"Nuffing. It ain't nuffing. I didn't do it. Let me go.\" He began to weep.\nI shook him again, but Bill only cried in gasping sobs, and I knew I'd get nothing coherent from him. \"Show me,\" I said to Denis's man.\nHe hoisted his lantern. \"This way, sir.\"\nI dragged Bill along. He tried to twist away from me, but Grenville caught his other arm, and together we half-carried him back down the lane. Denis's lackeys, whose names I had never learned, led us down a street.\nThe plaque on the nearest wall that named the street was so worn I could not read it, but I had a vague idea where we were from my searching this morning. This narrow lane led us in a meandering course to a flight of stairs that went down to the river. Another plaque, this one more legible, assured us that these stairs had once been used by Elizabeth the Queen, two hundred and more years before. A house stood at the top of the stairs, worn and crumbling.\n\"Not in there, sir,\" the man with the lantern said. \"Over here.\"\nHe led me to a triangle of space between the house and the top of the stairs. The triangle was about three feet on a side, the remains of someone's attempt at a tiny garden. The earth had been turned up here, as though someone had been digging. On the stair side, the bank tumbled away to the roiling Thames, and the house pressed its other side. Nothing the size of a girl could be buried here.\nBottle Bill whimpered. I let him go, and he sank to the stones in front of the house, pulling his knees to his chest.\n\"Why were you digging here, Bill?\" I asked, but not forcefully; I knew he would not answer.\n\"He was burying something.\" The lackey with the lantern swung it over the patch, and the second one squatted down and started digging with a flat knife.\nI pulled a clod of earth away and saw the glint of glass. Denis's man slammed his knife into the earth in disgust. \"It's gin. Bottles of gin. Bloody son of a bitch was burying bottles of gin.\"\nBehind me, Bill twitched. \"I didn't do it.\"\nI sighed in exasperation. I pulled out three bottles, green glass and heavy, and let them fall to the cobbles. \"Damn you, Bill.\"\nDenis's man with the lantern yanked out one more bottle, which I had missed, and smashed it to the ground. Bill winced, cringing from the broken glass.\n\"Sorry, sir,\" Denis's lackey said. \"It's for nothing.\" He started to turn away.\n\"Wait,\" I commanded. \"Bring the light back. Shine it just there.\"\nI pointed to where he'd pulled out the last bottle. I'd seen something when the dirt fell away, but I was not quite certain what. I scrabbled in the mud, disliking the cold ooze, but I was beyond caring. I scraped away earth from what I'd seen, and the others crowded in behind me.\n\"It's a board,\" I said. I started to lift it away, then I realized it was nailed in place. I wrenched it, hard, and the rotted thing at last gave way.\nI almost slithered forward into a hole about two feet in diameter. Denis's man grabbed me in time, but I shook him off. I lay down and inched forward until I could peer into the dark hole. Dank, fetid air washed over me, sickening and heavy.\n\"There was a covering here of some kind. It's mostly gone. Give me the lantern.\"\nDenis's man nearly hit my face with it in his eagerness to hand it to me. I passed the lantern down into the hole.\nI recoiled as a small rat climbed up the dirt, scrambling to get away from the light. I waited, but none others followed. It was either alone, or its fellows were braver. I leaned in again.\n\"Careful, Lacey,\" Grenville said behind me.\nDenis's man held my legs, his weight like a rock. I doubted I'd fall, unless the man suddenly decided to rid Denis of a problem called Captain Lacey for once and for all. I risked it, lowered the lantern inside, and shone the light about.\nThis must have been part of an old cellar, but it, like Bottle Bill's room, had been bricked off from the rest of the house. Perhaps the original wall had leaked, long ago, and the owner found it easier to seal off the room. The brick to my right was infested with slime and mold. To the left, rotting timbers barely supported a wall that had crumbled to let in the dirt of the bank. About ten feet below me, or as near as I could judge, was an earthen floor, hard packed.\nI withdrew. \"Help me get down there.\"\nGrenville had pressed a folded handkerchief to his nose. \"Lacey, it cannot be healthy down there. It smells like a cesspit.\"\n\"If rats can exist there, so can I.\" I turned to Denis's man. \"Will you lower me until I can drop to the ground?\"\nHe nodded stoically. I stripped off my coat and handed it to Grenville. He shook it out and folded it carefully over his arm, like a good valet.\n\"I, too, will go down,\" Auberge announced.\n\"No,\" I said. \"Let me see how safe it is first. I do not want us all plummeting down there and caving in a wall.\"\n\"You should let one of us go, sir,\" the man who'd held the lantern said. \"Mr. Denis will be angry if something happens to you.\"\nI eyed their burly, muscular bodies and shook my head. \"You'll never fit. Now lower me until I tell you to let go.\"\nSo saying, I lay on my belly and swung my legs into the hole, letting my booted feet drop in first.\nI had a sudden and vivid flash of one of my soldiers lowering me into a similar hole on a Spanish summer night, so I could rescue a group of Spaniards who had gotten trapped when the building above them collapsed under canon fire. Their eyes had gleamed in the darkness, teeth flashing in grins as I came tumbling in with ropes. They'd hidden in a cellar full of wine and had seen no reason not to indulge while they waited, believing themselves buried forever.\nThat cellar had been dry and warm; this hole was foul with damp, rats, and rot. Denis's man got on his knees and held me under the arms. He strained his weight against mine as he lowered me slowly. When I judged that I was about four feet from the floor, I told him to let go.\nHe removed his hands, and I slithered down through mud and earth, a little farther than I'd thought, then my feet landed, thud, on the hard-packed floor.\n\"Lantern,\" I barked. My words fell flat on moist walls, close around me. The lackey lowered the lantern to me, and I reached up and grabbed its handle.\nThe light showed me little but a narrow tunnel with mildew-encrusted brick on one side, rotten boards and mud on the other. The air was fetid and as Grenville had remarked, smelled of cesspits, but as I stepped forward, the smell receded, as though it had been trapped here but released when we opened the hole.\nI heard the voices of the men I'd left on top. \"You all right, Lacey?\" Grenville called down. \"Please answer. I am the smallest man out here and do not relish climbing in to pull you out.\"\nI knew full well that Grenville would ruin his coat climbing down if necessary. He'd destroyed gloves, waistcoats, and fine suits in his adventures with me without a word, much to his valet's despair.\n\"I am fine,\" I said. \"I am moving forward, following the house wall.\"\nSo saying, I took a few steps, hoping I did not come to a rotted part of the floor that would send me plunging into a far worse hole, or straight into the Thames.\nI moved on carefully, wondering if anyone had truly been down here in recent times. The air was still, but breathable, and I reasoned that there must be more holes in the bank somewhere.\nDarkness yawned before me. I took a few more steps, and then the brick wall angled sharply in front of me. \"Damn,\" I muttered. I called back. \"I've come to the end. There's nothing here.\"\n\"Do you want me to shake up old Bill, Captain?\" Denis's more talkative man shouted. \"Make him tell what he knows about this place?\"\n\"No,\" I said, turning back. \"Let him alone. He's terrified enough.\"\n\"Right, sir.\" He sounded disappointed.\n\"I'm coming back. You'll have to lift me out.\"\nI started forward, and then I heard it. Distinct, and behind me, soft in the close air, I heard a faint whimper.\nI hadn't imagined it. I couldn't imagine it down here in this horrible place with nightmare things crawling over my feet. I swung around, holding the lantern high.\nThe brick wall, I found when I examined it again, didn't reach all the way to the ruined wall. There was a space between it and the dirt bank, just large enough for me to squeeze around. Or rather, almost large enough. I got caught between brick and mud and had to struggle and curse before I popped through.\nBeyond was a dugout space, black and close, not four feet square, beaten against earth and shored up with old brick.\nIn this space lay two girls together. One sat against the wall, and the other leaned on her, her head on the older girl's breast. They wore dirty blindfolds tight against their eyes, their hands bound behind their backs.\nI did not know the girl sitting upright, but I did know the other one who lay on her--my own Gabriella.\nThe cry that tore from my throat echoed in the still air. Tears blurred my vision, and I dashed them away, needing desperately to see.\nThe girls lay motionlessly, not reacting to my presence. I banged the lantern to the floor, grabbed a knife from my pocket, and knelt, jerking the blindfold from Gabriella's eyes.\nIt must have been she who whimpered, because she did it again, screwing her eyes shut at the glare of the lantern. I pulled her up from the other girl, who did not move, and sliced the bonds that held Gabriella's hands.\nI gathered Gabriella into my arms, holding her against me, kissing her hair and face, tears wetting my cheeks and smearing mud against hers.\n\"Gabriella,\" I whispered over and over again. \"I found you. My sweetest girl. I found you.\"\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Seventeen\n\n\"Lacey!\" Grenville's cry rent the air. \"Where are you? Answer, damn you.\"\nI choked on sobs, rocking Gabriella in my arms. I could not tell if she knew who I was, but she relaxed against me, limp, and did not fight.\nThe other girl moaned and stirred. Alive, thank God. Holding Gabriella, I reached over and wrenched the other young woman's blindfold away. As Gabriella had, she cringed from the light, making noises of panic.\n\"It's all right,\" I said hoarsely. \"You're safe now. You're safe.\" I turned and shouted through the gap in the wall, \"They're here. I found them!\"\nMy voice came out a croak. I couldn't project it all the way to the hole in the roof.\n\"Lacey?\" Grenville's voice sounded closer, as though he'd stuck his head through the opening. \"Shout again.\"\n\"I found them,\" I said, tears in my voice. \"Bring rope, for God's sake.\"\nThere was a stunned moment of silence, then Grenville scrambled up and began shouting orders. More noise at the entrance, argument, this time Auberge's voice, and then I heard someone scramble into the hole.\n\"You're safe,\" I whispered into Gabriella's hair. \"Oh, my dearest love, you're safe.\"\nShe looked up at me, coherence entering her eyes. \"You,\" she whispered, sounding puzzled, her voice cracked.\n\"Sweetheart, I have been looking everywhere for you.\" I squeezed my eyes shut and simply held on to her.\n\"Gabriella.\" Auberge panted on the other side of the gap.\nGabriella shoved me away. Joy lending her strength, she flew to her feet, flung her body through the hole in the wall, and threw her arms around Auberge. \"Papa!\"\nThe word struck through my heart. Auberge caught Gabriella, crying and kissing her.\nThe other girl was squinting at me through the lantern light. \"Who the devil are you?\" she asked in a weak voice.\n\"Captain Gabriel Lacey,\" I said. \"At your service, ma'am.\" I sliced the ropes from her wrists, and she sagged against the wall. \"Are you Black Bess?\"\n\"Aye, it's me.\" Her eyes were haggard rather than hopeful. \"I'm that glad to see you, whoever you be. Lord, but I could murder a beefsteak.\" Then she fainted.\n*** *** ***\nWe lifted the two girls from the foul hole with the aid of ropes Grenville had fetched. Gabriella was boosted out first, Auberge holding her until Grenville could hoist her up. Gabriella tried to hold the rope herself, but her grip slipped in her exhaustion. Grenville and one of Denis's men caught her and eased her onto the ground, moving as gently as could be.\nI carried the recumbent form of Black Bess, limp in my arms, she having endured a longer burial than Gabriella. She opened her eyes again as we lifted her free, and she reached for the brawny arms of Denis's man, who pulled her to the open air.\nAs I dragged myself from the hole, the last one up, I saw Grenville's carriage, his matched grays pale smudges in the night, pull up at the end of the street. The lane was too narrow to admit the coach, and Jackson climbed down from the top.\nAuberge cradled Gabriella in his arms, crooning something softly in French. She leaned her head on his shoulder, eyes closed, her body melding to his, as though it knew the source of safety. I laid my hand on her head, smoothing her hair, but she never responded to my touch.\nBlack Bess stood on her feet, but she leaned heavily against Grenville. \"I can walk on me own,\" she insisted. She took a step, and her legs crumpled. \"Devil take it.\"\nGrenville lifted her without a word and began to carry her to the carriage. One of Denis's men grabbed Bottle Bill, who still rocked and wept against the house, and dragged him along with us.\nAt the end of the street, the shadow of Jackson strode toward us, on his way to lend assistance.\nBlack Bess raised her head and saw him. She gave a hoarse cry and a moan, and struggled to get away from Grenville.\n\"Stop,\" Grenville said. \"You're all right.\"\nGabriella lifted her head to see what was the matter. Her eyes widened in fear, and she clung to Auberge. \"No, Papa.\"\nJackson neared us, took in the two girls, and exhaled in relief. \"You've got them, sir? Thank God Almighty.\"\nBlack Bess looked up at him, her eyes still round in fear.\n\"They're afraid of Jackson,\" Grenville said. He looked at his coachman, his eyes going flat. \"Why should they be afraid of you, Jackson?\"\nJackson looked taken aback. \"Couldn't say, sir.\"\nDenis's men crowded him, belligerent. Gabriella buried her head in Auberge's shoulder.\n\"No,\" I said suddenly. \"Not Jackson.\" I was looking hard at him, in this light only his costly tail coat, gold braid, brass buttons, and his tall hat with upright brush distinguishable, his face in shadow. A costume distinctive all over London. \"They are not afraid of Jackson. They are afraid of his coachman's livery.\"\nThe others stared at me in surprise, including Jackson. \"A coachman, sir?\" he said. \"I'll be damned.\"\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"We were looking in the wrong direction. Not Stacy or McAdams. Payne.\"\n*** *** ***\nPomeroy was kind enough to allow me, Auberge, and Grenville to accompany him when he went to arrest Payne, coachman to Mr. Jeremiah Stacy.\n\"Payne?\" Stacy said in confusion when Pomeroy announced his errand. \"I do not understand.\"\nIt was early morning, and Stacy received us in a sitting room in his house on Upper Grosvenor Street. His attire had been hastily donned, his hair still tousled with sleep. I imagined that when his valet had announced to him that a Bow Street Runner had come to call, Stacy had tumbled out of bed in tearing hurry.\nThe sitting room was pleasant enough, with paneling picked out in gold trim, chairs upholstered in rose damask, and paintings of pretty landscapes lending their colors to the white walls. Touches of beauty that soothed the eye.\nStacy faced us in the middle of this lovely room, his blue eyes slightly red from however many bottles of port he'd consumed the night before.\n\"Your coachman, one Lewis Payne, has kidnapped three young women and killed one,\" Pomeroy said with good humor. Pomeroy was always happy when about to make an arrest, particularly one certain to lead to conviction and reward. \"We would like very much to speak to him.\"\n\"These are the girls you quizzed me about at Tatt's, Lacey? You are saying that Payne did this?\"\n\"I am afraid so,\" I answered. \"Both of the young ladies we recovered have sworn that a coachman answering to the description of Payne waylaid and kidnapped them, held them hostage in a filthy hole, and killed Mary Chester. Mary's death seems to have been accidental, but he was responsible.\"\nStacy gaped. \"Good God.\"\n\"Could not have pegged him without your evidence, Mr. Stacy,\" Pomeroy said. \"The Runners are always grateful for cooperation.\"\n\"My evidence?\" Again Stacy looked to me for enlightenment.\nI removed his journal from my pocket, the leather a little more creased than when I'd received it. \"It makes interesting reading, Stacy. I'd keep it well hidden. But it made me understand why Payne did it.\"\nStacy's face whitened, and he snatched the journal from me. \"Where did you get that? This is a personal diary, Captain, how did you come by it?\"\n\"Payne gave it to me. You mean to say you did not tell him to?\"\n\"No. Good Lord, why would I?\" Stacy went red. \"I suppose you and Grenville spent a merry evening over it.\"\nGrenville shook his head. \"When Captain Lacey told me of its contents, I admit that I did not wish to read it. What a gentleman does in his private life is his own affair. Lacey is a man of honor, I assure you. He will not breathe a word of it.\"\n\"No?\"\n\"No,\" I said. \"An odd hobbyhorse you have, but I have been told by the young ladies of this book that you are harmless.\"\nStacy held the journal close to his chest, as though protecting it. \"But you say Payne is not?\"\nI said, \"You must remember that while you were riding through Covent Garden observing game girls like a naturalist observing flora and fauna, Payne was observing them as well. You like the girls because they amuse you, or perhaps you enjoy feeling a bit lofty, playing benevolent lord to them. The point is, you like them, and they are fond of you in an indulgent sort of way. But there are men, as I was reminded by Felicity, who hate game girls, who see them as objects on which to take out their rage and disgust at women in general. Payne must be that sort of man.\"\nStacy stared at me in shock. \"Mary and Bess were girls that I . . .\" He bit his lip.\n\"You favored them. Perhaps Payne justified taking them because you'd been kind to them. I imagine that he loathes you as much as he loathes them.\"\nAuberge, who'd been very quiet since we'd returned Gabriella last night to her weeping mother, cleared his throat. \"But my daughter, why did he take her?\"\n\"I imagine that Gabriella was a mistake,\" I said. \"Payne saw Stacy speaking to her in Covent Garden. That is what you usually did, isn't it, Stacy? Spoke to the girls beforehand and set appointments with them for later. You were on your way to the theatre that night. Payne dropped you there, drove round the corner to Russel Street, found Gabriella again, and took her.\" The anger in my voice rose. \"I do not know how he lured her away, but I mean to ask him, quite closely.\"\n\"Dear God,\" Stacy said, dazed. \"Those poor girls. Are they all right?\"\n\"Black Bess and my daughter are recovering. Mary Chester, of course, is dead. Bess told me that Payne tried to rape Mary, she resisted, and she died when he wrestled her down. Probably suffocated in mud or earth; there were patches quite deep down there. I had wondered why Mary had soil stains on her gown, as though she'd been buried, but I understood once I had a look in the place he'd kept them. It is almost like a grave. The bruises on Mary's neck were put there by Payne, likely when he took her in the first place.\"\nPomeroy broke in. \"But then he sees he has a dead body on his hands and knows he can swing for murder. He already knew that Bottle Bill liked to stash gin by the empty house. He sees his chance--he can dump the body on Bottle Bill, and then if the other girls are found, well, there's good old Bottle Bill with his pile of gin and his violent tempers when he's drunk. Poor old sod. I wager Payne even took off his coachman's livery and pretended to be a gentleman-- Bottle Bill regards anyone not in the gutter with him as well above his station.\"\n\"Payne did his best to shift the blame to you in several ways, Stacy,\" I said. \"Not only did he offer me your journal with all your secrets, he lured Bess and Mary away with the hint that you were willing to take them up and be their protector. With the temptation of a large amount of money dangling before them, they gladly agreed to meet Payne in Covent Garden--thinking, of course, that he would drive them to you. Their friends would remember them chattering about a wealthy man who planned to do well by them, which pointed attention to you.\"\n\"The bloody man,\" Stacy said, his anger rising. \"This is the thanks I get for giving him good employment. By all means, Mr. Pomeroy, arrest him.\"\n\"He'll be in the mews, then, will he?\" Pomeroy asked. \"We'll have a walk round there and speak with Mr. Payne.\" He bowed. \"Captain, Major, will you accompany me? But I must ask you not to murder the fellow. I won't get my reward money unless he stands more or less upright in the dock, and is still breathing.\"\n*** *** ***\nGrenville elected to stay inside with Stacy. \"You are a man in sore need of brandy,\" he told Stacy. \"And a bit of a convivial chat. We'll allow the army men to tend to the messy work.\"\nStacy looked grateful, and he and Grenville moved to Stacy's dining room, Grenville signaling to a footman to bring brandy on the way.\n\"He's a kind gentleman,\" Pomeroy observed. \"Mr. Grenville, I mean. Shall we?\"\nStacy's townhouse was located in Upper Grosvenor Street near Park Lane, an address that reflected his wealth. We went around the corner to the King Street Mews, a collection of stables and outbuildings nestled between the houses of Upper Brook and Upper Grosvenor Streets. In the coach house behind Stacy's home, we found Payne.\nPayne was busily inspecting the right front wheel of Stacy's elegant town coach, crouching to observe the lay of the axle. The man's livery coat was unbuttoned, his coachman's hat hanging on a peg near the door.\n\"Good morning to you,\" Pomeroy sang out.\nPayne started, and rose. He saw Pomeroy, he saw me, and he stopped.\nAfter a moment of silence, he tugged his forelock. \"Captain. What can I do for you this fine morning?\"\n\"Allow me to introduce Milton Pomeroy,\" I said. \"He was my sergeant during the Peninsular War and is now a Bow Street Runner. He has come to arrest you.\"\n\"Bow Street,\" Payne said hesitantly, his lined face paling.\n\"For the murder of Mrs. Mary Chester,\" Pomeroy broke in. \"And for the kidnapping and assault of one Mademoiselle Gabriella Auberge and one Miss Bessie Morrow.\"\nPayne stared as one amazed. \"Not I, Mr. Pomeroy. Mr. Stacy did that.\"\n\"Not according to the witnesses, Mademoiselle Auberge and Miss Morrow. They give very--what you might call, vivid--descriptions of your build and your face. Not to mention an exact account of how Mrs. Mary Chester died.\"\nPayne scoffed. \"The evidence of game girls. Which is no evidence at all.\"\n\"One game girl,\" Pomeroy corrected him, \"and one very respectable daughter of a war hero. I believe a jury will not like that one bit, since many of them'll likely have respectable daughters of their own.\"\n\"No,\" Payne said, puzzled. \"She were a game girl. My master only touches the nastiest ones.\"\nMy walking stick came up. \"That is my daughter you speak of, Payne. I have promised Pomeroy I will let you live to face your trial, but do not press me.\"\nPayne spat. \"You gentlemen and your pity for game girls disgusts me. They're dirty whores, full of the clap and ready to lay on their backs for any gent with a penny.\"\n\"Most of them are driven to earn their living as they can,\" I said tightly. \"That does not give you permission to kidnap them and murder them. Their lives are miserable enough without men like you making things worse.\"\nHis lip curled. \"That's what they're for, Captain. They want to be used and thrown off. They're like rats in the sewers, waiting to be flushed out like the filth they are.\"\n\"That's why you put them in that hole,\" I said, realizing. \"Rats in a sewer.\"\n\"That's where they belong. Look what they did to my master, a respectable gent before he started wallowing in them and writing it all down in his book. They pulled him down and made him as disgusting as they are. If your daughter was waltzing about Covent Garden market on her own, she's just like them.\"\nI had him pinned against the wall before Pomeroy could stop me, my walking stick hard across his throat. Auberge closed in beside me, but he in no way tried to hold me back. I heard Auberge's breathing, hoarse and tight with fury.\n\"Remember, Captain,\" Pomeroy warned. \"He needs to be more or less upright.\"\n\"You stole her,\" I said, in Payne's face. \"You hurt her, and you terrified her, and you buried her. I'll give Pomeroy his conviction, but first you are going to learn exactly what you did to her.\"\nPayne's eyes widened. My fist caught him on the jaw, and his head rocked back. He was a big man, and tried to fight, but Auberge held him fast as I hit him again. And again. I sensed Pomeroy lurking behind us, ready to rescue Payne or cut off his escape, as need be.\nPayne blinked at me from his bruised and bloody face then shifted his gaze to Auberge. \"Why are you doing this?\" he bleated, as pathetic as Bottle Bill.\n\"I am Gabriella's father,\" I said, drawing back my hand again.\n\"As am I,\" Auberge said quietly.\nWhat entered Payne's eyes then was abject terror, and the sight of it pleased me very much.\n\n* * * * *\nChapter Eighteen\n\nSeveral weeks later, as the Season wound to its conclusion and the ton began to drift to their country homes for summer, Lady Breckenridge hosted a private supper party for an exclusive slate of guests in her South Audley Street house. Present were Lucius Grenville; his friend Captain Gabriel Lacey; Colonel and Mrs. Aloysius Brandon; Sir Gideon Derwent, his wife and son Leland, and his son's faithful friend Gareth Travers; Lady Aline Carrington; and to everyone's surprise, Grenville's new paramour Marianne Simmons.\n\"We are all old enough and wise enough to allow one of the demimonde in our midst without fussing,\" Lady Breckenridge told me when I'd discovered she'd invited Marianne. \"We are widows and wives or world-wise spinsters and will not faint because a woman has been an actress.\"\nMarianne, at least, behaved herself. She was well turned out in a modestly cut frock that breathed the same elegance as the gowns Lady Breckenridge wore. Her only jewelry was a thin string of diamonds in her hair that winked and shone as she turned her head.\nHer manners were impeccable, and even Lady Derwent spoke to her without dismay. Occasionally Marianne flashed me a wry look, but I could see her trying hard not to embarrass Grenville.\nAll her polish did not come entirely from Grenville, in my opinion. Marianne, I had suspected before, might have once belonged to the middle or even upper-middle class. What circumstances had led her to the stage at Drury Lane, and whether the birth of David had anything to do with it, I had not yet learned. Marianne, as both Grenville and I had come to know, kept her secrets well.\nAfter supper, we adjourned to the drawing room together, rather than having the gentlemen linger in the dining room over port. I preferred the company of the ladies, in any case, their softer voices and finer scents more appealing to me than loud-voiced gentlemen who smoked cheroots and became drunker by the hour.\nLady Breckenridge raised her glass of wine. \"To the safe return of Miss Gabriella Lacey.\"\n\"An excellent toast,\" Grenville said, looking at me.\nMurmurs of \"Hear, hear\" filled the room as glasses flashed upward, raised in honor of Gabriella.\nLady Breckenridge had invited Auberge and Carlotta with Gabriella, but Auberge had declined. Too soon, he said. Gabriella had agreed to give evidence at Payne's trial that afternoon, and she was recovering from the ordeal.\nI had explained to Gabriella that she did not have to appear as a witness if she did not want to. She could go back to France, with no one the wiser to her ruin. Payne had not raped her, she'd told us when she could speak of it, but I knew that the abduction would scar her heavily even so. Society being what it was, there would be people who would blame Gabriella for making herself available to be abducted at all.\nGabriella, however, had resolutely decided to appear as a witness. Payne had frightened her very, very much, but he'd also made her deeply angry. She wanted justice and more than a little revenge. The stubborn outrage in her brown eyes I'd often seen in my own. She was her father's daughter.\n\"The trial was splendid,\" Lady Aline said, beaming. \"So satisfying to see a beast get his comeuppance.\"\n\"Pomeroy got his conviction,\" I said. \"And his reward. He is most satisfied.\"\n\"But he lost his sweetheart,\" Grenville said.\nBlack Bess had also agreed to be a witness in the trial for Mary Chester's murder, and had spoken in loud, clear tones about everything the monster Payne had done. Gabriella had not had to answer many questions after all, only to confirm Bess's story. Bottle Bill, sober and meek, had sung Payne's guilt with the fear of a man still believing he'd be blamed for everything.\nSir Gideon Derwent and Sir Montague Harris had worked between themselves to fill the jury with gentlemen sympathetic to the plight of game girls, reformers who tended to blame men like Payne for the women's downfalls. Payne, standing fearfully in the dock with his face sporting half-healed bruises, was condemned to hang, and taken down.\nBlack Bess and her laborer lover, Tom, had been tearfully reunited, and Bess had scarcely let go of him when they'd met up again after the trial.\nPomeroy had been surprisingly cheerful even so. \"Got my man,\" he said. \"Congratulate me, Captain.\"\n\"And Bess has hers,\" I remarked, shaking his hand.\nPomeroy shrugged. \"Aye, well, she's proved too fickle for me. Besides, I have me eye on another.\" With that he flashed a grin across the cobbles in front of the Old Bailey. I followed the grin to see it caught by Felicity, who returned it with a sultry smile.\n\"Good Lord. I thought you did not trust her.\"\n\"I don't,\" Pomeroy said. \"But I know where I stand with Felicity, and just how far to take things. Besides, she's a beautiful lady, ain't she?\"\n\"You are a brave man, Sergeant.\"\nHe laughed. \"Right you are, Captain. I'm off then. Call on me when you find another dead body.\" He'd strolled away in Felicity's direction, whistling.\nSoon after, Black Nancy kissed me goodbye and departed for Islington and her hostler. \"He's a good man,\" she said. \"He does well by me, and he must be missing his Nance.\"\n\"Thank you, Nancy,\" I said. \"For all your help.\"\nShe grinned and patted me on the shoulder. \"Anytime for you, Captain. You know, I could take to this investigating business. Next time you hunt a kidnapper, or a murderer, you just sing out for me, and Nance will come a-running.\"\nI'd laughed and hugged her hard, to her delight. Giving me an impish wink and a pat on my backside, she'd gone away home.\nIn Lady Breckenridge's drawing room, we turned the talk to the upcoming summer months. The Derwents were going on holiday to Italy, taking Leland and their daughter and Gareth Travers with them, to hopefully warm the treacherous cough from Lady Derwent's throat.\nGrenville spoke of his own estate and the hunts in which he'd partake. He had invited me to accompany him, and then, in an act of generosity that touched and humbled me, he told me that the stallion he'd purchased at Tatt's had been intended for me all along. The horse could stay in Grenville's mews, tended by Grenville's grooms, but he was mine.\n\"This is a stunning gift,\" I told him. \"Especially after I spit in the face of our friendship.\"\nGrenville waved that away. \"I learned that you still loved to ride but lacked a horse. And so . . .\" He shrugged, as though considering the matter unimportant. I remembered telling Lady Breckenridge that I'd missed riding in almost those words. The two of them had been embarrassingly kind.\nGrenville planned to take Marianne with him to his estate this summer and be damned to those who were shocked by it. He and Marianne had traveled together to Berkshire to visit David before the trial, and Grenville had returned home much subdued.\n\"Dear God, Lacey, what she has borne,\" he'd said to me. \"She can have everything I have. All of it.\"\nThey had much to smooth out between them, but I suspected the process had begun. Marianne clung possessively to Grenville's arm tonight, and the looks he gave her were openly fond.\nMy duel with McAdams over his comments at Tatts came to nothing. As Grenville had predicted, the man left England before Payne's trial. Just as well. Dueling was illegal, and I'd have gotten myself arrested, but I did regret that I couldn't at least put a bullet into the man's shoulder.\nLady Aline said she would make a round of country houses before returning to her own in September, and she spontaneously invited all of us to spend time with her there. We accepted with pleasure.\nWhen our party began to break up and drift home, I found myself at one point alone with the Brandons. \"Lacey,\" Brandon said. He shook my hand, then I gave Louisa a light embrace and a brief kiss.\n\"We retire to Kent for the summer, as usual,\" Louisa said. \"Please say you will join us for a time.\"\nI looked from Louisa to her husband. Louisa would not ask unless she meant it, but it all depended on whether my former mentor wanted me or not. To my surprise, he nodded. \"Do, Lacey. Perhaps we do need to find out what happened between us.\"\nI saw the plea in Louisa's eyes. For her, I said, \"Very well. Set aside a bed for me that is on the hard side. I am used to that.\"\nLouisa's smile flashed, relieved. She had been worried that I would blame her for Gabriella's disappearance, as she did herself, though I had tried to reassure her as much as I could. She would always regret it, but at least she had the knowledge that Gabriella was safe at home.\nAs the Brandons departed, the last guests to do so, Lady Breckenridge slipped her hand through the crook of my arm and smiled warmly at me. She'd dressed her hair how I liked it, in long curls, with a few caught and held by a diamond pin.\n\"So many country house visits for you,\" she said. \"Lady Aline, Grenville, the Brandons.\" She squeezed my arm. \"And I promised my mother I would bring you home to Oxfordshire with me at the end of June. Shall you come?\"\nI touched her chin, bent, and kissed her. \"I would be delighted.\"\n*** *** ***\nBefore I ran off to enjoy my summer bliss, I had to settle the question of divorce from my wife and my guardianship of Gabriella.\nCarlotta and Auberge met with Denis and me in the parlor of their boardinghouse with some trepidation. Carlotta had said very little to me since Auberge and I had returned Gabriella, and she did not look at me as we waited for Denis to spread long pieces of parchment across a writing table.\nGabriella reposed on a worn Sheraton chair, her hands held calmly on her lap. She insisted on being here with us, although Carlotta had tried to dissuade her. She was seventeen now, Gabriella had said, and this was her fate as well.\nGabriella sent me a serene look. She had endured much, I could see in the shadows beneath her eyes, but she sat upright, determined not to be broken by it. My heart swelled with pride in her.\nDenis cleared his throat, as dry as any solicitor. \"Captain Lacey has asked me if the process of freeing the both of you can be expedited. As I outlined previously, dissolving a marriage entirely is a long and expensive process, designed to discourage such a thing.\"\nCarlotta looked downcast, Auberge, stoic.\n\"However,\" Denis continued without pause, \"I am a man of means, and a man of special circumstance. I have . . . business acquaintances . . . in the Doctors Commons and in Parliament, many of whom owe me rather large favors.\"\nSince one of Denis's practices was to maneuver men into seats in the House of Commons and other high places by means of manipulation and outright purchasing, he was able to control the outcome of certain issues. A man owned by Denis did exactly what Denis wanted.\n\"The official separation will be easily achieved,\" Denis went on. \"In fact, I have a gentleman who should be signing the papers for that even as we speak. The conviction of criminal conversation will be handed down without a lengthy trial, and without you having to appear, Mrs. Lacey. The captain will have to make a brief testimony, and I have provided for that as well. The private Act of Parliament to dissolve the marriage entirely will take more time, but I believe it can be done by the autumn.\"\nI stared at him, and so did Auberge.\n\"This must cost you much,\" Auberge said.\n\"Quite.\" Denis's cold blue gaze flicked to me. \"The captain will pay me back for the endeavor.\"\n\"I will,\" I said. \"Every ha'penny.\"\nDenis inclined his head, pretending to acknowledge my resolution. \"I have a few papers for you to sign, Mrs. Lacey, and then you may go back to France and lose yourself as Colette Auberge. I will notify you when the divorce is final so that you and the major may return, sign the final papers, and begin your life of wedded bliss.\"\n\"Thank you,\" Auberge said. He took Carlotta's hand in his and squeezed it hard. \"We both thank you.\"\nDenis moved another paper, unconcerned by Auberge's sentimentality. \"The next issue concerns Miss Lacey--Gabriella Auberge, as you call her. As you know, Captain Lacey is, by law, her guardian. It is his decision where she goes and with whom she lives until she comes of age or marries. And then it will be his decision whom to allow her to marry.\"\nAuberge and Carlotta flicked their gazes to me at the same time. Gabriella kept her eyes straight ahead, sitting as still as marble.\nI remembered her joyous cry of \"Papa!\" the night I'd rescued her, how she'd pushed away from me and flown into the arms of Auberge. I remembered the knifelike pain in my heart that had cut through the joy of finding her safe.\nAuberge had raised her, had watched her turn from child to youth to woman, had loved her. Gabriella loved him as much in return, trusting and admiring him as her father. I was a stranger from her past, one she did not know quite what to do with.\nI wet my lips, pulling the words from deep inside me. \"Gabriella should return to France with her mother and stepfather. She belongs there.\"\nCarlotta raised her head. Gabriella's gaze met mine in stunned surprise.\n\"Are you certain that is what you want?\" Auberge asked, his tone pleading me to say yes.\nI studied Gabriella, her honey brown curls trickling from beneath her modest cap, her brown eyes so like my own. \"I love you, Gabriella,\" I told her. \"You are my daughter, and I will always love you. But I cannot rip you away from everything you have ever known.\"\nGabriella hesitated, then she inclined her head. Her expression was neutral, as though I'd turned down an invitation for tea, but the ringlets about her face trembled. \"Thank you, sir. Might I visit you, though? I would like to come to know you, and about your family . . . My family.\"\nMy heart caught. \"You are certain?\"\n\"My father told me what you did to find me. He said that if not for you, all would have been lost.\"\nThat was true. Auberge could not have bullied Pomeroy, Denis, and Grenville to turn out half of London to search for Gabriella. A few patrollers might have looked, found nothing, and sent Auberge home.\n\"I had resources,\" I said.\n\"For which I am forever grateful,\" Gabriella answered, haughty as a duchess, I noted with amusement. \"May I begin my visits soon?\"\n\"In September,\" I said. \"I will take you to Lady Aline Carrington's in Hampshire. We will have a fine time.\"\nGabriella relaxed her hauteur and gave me an impish grin as good as Black Nancy's. \"Will there be games and country dances? I have read much in the newspapers about games and country dances at English house parties.\"\n\"Lady Aline is at the forefront of society,\" I assured her. \"I am certain she will provide exquisite entertainment.\"\nGabriella clasped her hands. \"I will be most happy to go, then.\"\nI felt a sudden stab of trepidation. I wanted to know and cherish my daughter again, but I realized that I had no idea how to be a father.\nDenis, who had watched the exchange with no flicker of warmth, gathered his papers. \"I will leave documents for Mrs. Lacey to sign and dispatch to me.\" He rose, tucked the rest of the papers under his arm, took up his walking stick, and bowed coolly. \"I bid you good day.\"\nI walked him to the door of the parlor, politely opening it for him. \"I meant what I said. Every ha'penny. You will see it again.\"\nDenis gave me a wintry smile. \"There are a few problems that have come to my attention about which I wish to consult with you. You will be just the man to find the answers.\"\n\"I do not work for you,\" I reminded him.\nHis look turned wise. \"Wait and hear the problems first,\" he said. \"And then decide. Good day, Captain.\"\nHe was gone, settling his hat and climbing into the elegant carriage that waited for him in the summer mist.\nAuberge asked me to stay and speak with him, but Carlotta wanted to take Gabriella upstairs again, ready to hide her away once more.\n\"Thank you, Gabriel,\" Carlotta said stiffly as we parted at the foot of the stairs.\nI lifted her hand, though she did not offer it, and pressed a brief kiss to it. She had been my first love; I had kissed the dainty fingers so long ago. \"Be well, Carlotta.\"\nShe looked startled, then swiftly inclined her head and started up the stairs. Gabriella allowed me to kiss her cheek, although she still behaved as though I were merely a kind stranger. Tears filled my eyes as she gracefully caught up to her mother and slipped her arm about the older woman's waist.\nAuberge joined me in watching them. \"I cannot repay you for what you have done,\" he said. \"You have my deepest obligation.\"\nI remained gazing up the stairs after Carlotta and Gabriella had gone. \"I don't know, Auberge. I cannot help feeling that Gabriella would not have been in danger at all if not for me.\"\n\"No, Captain. I, too, feel great guilt, but the one who should bear it is Payne. Were he not such a beast, Gabriella would have gone without incident to your rooms and been comforted by you. We might have had a merry argument, but no more.\"\n\"My reason tells me this,\" I said. \"Still I go over it and over it, wondering what would have happened if I had said the right things or done things differently.\"\n\"Whatever we feel, I am forever in your debt for restoring her to us.\" He paused. \"And for not taking her away again.\"\nI met his gaze. \"She loves you. You are her family.\"\n\"You have the law,\" he said.\n\"The law is not everything.\"\nAuberge pressed his lips together and nodded, as though afraid that if he went on in this vein, he'd lose what he'd gained. \"You will take care of her when she is here?\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" I answered fervently. \"You can be assured, I will watch her every move.\"\nWe stood awkwardly a moment, two men who were, in truth, rivals, and whose bond over a common problem had come to an end.\n\"Carlotta finally told me,\" he said after a time, \"the reason she left you to stay with me in France. I asked her quite closely about it last night.\"\nI lifted a brow. \"And what did she say?\"\nAuberge slid into French, as though unable to keep up his halting English. \"That when you were in France with her, she'd had a letter from her father. He wrote that he would dissolve her marriage to you and drag her home to marry the man to whom he'd tried to betroth her before. Her father was sore in need of money, as I said, and you had little. He convinced her, in her naivete, that he could do such a thing. Carlotta said that she had no idea until now that divorce and annulment were such difficult things to obtain. You were ready to return to England, and she feared that if she came back here, her father would force her into the marriage she'd run to India to escape.\"\n\"Good Lord. The little fool. Why did she never tell me of this?\"\nAuberge shrugged. \"She was young, she was afraid, and as we agreed, Carlotta is not one to think things through. She simply acts. She and I had grown to know each other, and I admit, I flirted with her and quite fell in love with her. So, when she came to me in trouble, I had no compunction against taking her away. For that, I am sorry.\"\n\"Dear God.\" I exhaled. \"Poor Carlotta. She must have been terrified. And she did not feel that she could come to me.\" The knowledge hurt, even now. \"But you made her happy, Auberge. She fled with you into safety, and you loved her.\"\nAuberge nodded quietly. \"We have been very happy.\"\n\"And she would not have been happy with me.\" I knew this to be true. \"Not even in the absence of her father's threats, which were empty. She would never have had what she has with you.\"\nAuberge sent me a warm smile. \"You are a good man, Captain.\"\n\"No, I am not.\" I studied him for a time. \"I have always wanted to hate you. But I have to admit that you are a good man in your own right.\" I shook his hand once more, deciding to begin my life again, free of the past. \"Be well.\"\n\"Au revoir,\" he said.\nI bowed and departed, not returning his wish.\n*** *** ***\nTwo weeks later, a hired coach let me off before a spreading, graceful house, approached by a mile-long drive that wound beneath powerful and ancient oaks. The house, golden brick in the middle of Oxfordshire, welcomed me with promise.\nA tall butler met me at the front door, bowed to me, asked how my journey was, and bade two footmen in full livery take my valise to my room.\n\"Her ladyship is in the gardens,\" he said. \"She directed me to lead you there once you had arrived. If you need to refresh yourself, I can have a footman take you upstairs.\"\n\"No, thank you,\" I said. Lady Breckenridge had departed London a week ago, and I had missed her more than I liked to admit. \"I will visit the gardens.\"\n\"Very good, sir.\"\nThe butler led me into a wide echoing hall, cool in the summer heat. Gilded frescos graced the ceiling, and a windowed rotunda far above let in soft light.\nAt the end of the hall, French doors led to a three-stepped terrace, and below this were the gardens. They ran for acres, cut into sections by wide walkways. Climbing roses blanketed trellises in scarlet and pink, and fountain after fountain played in the main walkway, lending a cool sparkle to the sun's brilliance.\nAt the base of the terrace, Lady Breckenridge waited, splendid in summer yellow, a wide hat over her dark curls. An older woman with a basket over her arm snipped roses from a nearby trellis. She had the same pointed features and dark blue eyes as Lady Breckenridge.\n\"So you've arrived, then,\" Donata said as I came off the stairs.\n\"Indeed.\" I bowed, leaning heavily on my walking stick. The ride had been long, the hired coach, cramped.\nThe countess, Donata's mother, looked up. \"This is your captain, Donata?\" She gave me the same sharp scrutiny as her daughter. \"Yes, he'll do. We'll take supper in the blue dining room. It is the least stuffy.\"\nSo saying, she hoisted her basket and wandered off into the garden in pursuit of perfect roses.\nDonata slipped her hand through the crook of my arm. \"She has been asking me when we will wed.\"\n\"Has she?\" I said. \"This winter. New Year's, perhaps?\"\nShe looked up at me, startled. She had been gone before my interview with Denis and Carlotta, and I had not written her of the details, preferring to discuss them with her in private.\nHer expression turned suddenly warm, then thoughtful. \"Yes, I believe New Year's would do very well.\"\nI placed my hand over hers and met her gaze. \"If you will have me.\"\nDonata smiled up at me, and I realized that I loved her to distraction. \"Yes, Gabriel,\" she said. \"I will.\"\nI kissed her, enjoying tasting her lips in the soft summer's light.\nWhen we caught up again with her mother, she said, \"Mama, Gabriel and I will be married at New Year's.\"\nWithout looking round, the countess snipped another rose. \"Excellent, dear. A special license, I think, in the gold drawing room. It is the warmest that time of year.\"\n\nEND\n\nPlease continue reading for a preview of Captain Lacey's next adventure\n\nA Death in Norfolk\n\nBy Ashley Gardner\n\nBook 7 of the Captain Lacey Regency Mysteries\n\n* * * * *\nChapter One\n\nEngland, 1817\n\nIn September, amidst a driving rain that swept across the Norfolk coast, my hired coach rolled up the drive to my ancestral home and deposited me at the house's front door.\nMy valet-in-training, Bartholomew, a lad used to working for the very rich, gazed at the edifice in doubt. \"You lived here, sir?\"\nThe house stood silently under lowering skies, the roof over one wing completely collapsed. The windows were dark, and many had been broken. Bricks and weeds decorated what was left of the lawn, and the drive was pitted and weed-choked.\n\"Indeed I did,\" I said.\nThe house had at one time been a fine Palladian affair, with fanlights, columns, and a pleasing symmetry. Now the golden stone was chipped and fallen away, the Corinthian columns at the door dark with grime. Bits of brick and fallen slates littered the ground.\n\"And you're going to invite her ladyship here?\" Bartholomew's doubt rose several decibels.\nMy wife-to-be, the Dowager Viscountess Breckenridge, daughter of an earl, had grown up on an elegant estate in Oxfordshire and now dwelled in a modern, costly townhouse in South Audley Street in London. I had spent a month at the Oxfordshire estate this summer, and the comparison between the two houses was dire indeed.\n\"Her ladyship insists,\" I said.\n\"Well, you've got your work cut out, sir, I must say.\"\n\"That is why I'm pleased you've come along to help.\"\nBartholomew's mouth popped open, his face taking on a look of dismay. Former footman to the great and wealthy Lucius Grenville, Bartholomew held himself high above common laborers. I could not resist teasing him.\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\n\"Do not be alarmed; I was not suggesting you try a bit of carpentry. But you can help me coordinate and supervise the repairs.\"\nThat was more to Bartholomew's liking, and he relaxed.\nI had another errand to run while I was here in Norfolk, a letter to deliver which had weighed heavily in my pocket all the way from London. I was reluctant to carry out the errand, though it was a simple one, because doing so would be symbolic.\nTake the enclosed to one Brigadier Easton at Winston House south of Cley. Completion of delivery deducts twenty guineas from your debt. Denis.\nI'd been tempted to put both letter and enclosure onto the fire. First, because I'd rather earn back on my own the cost of my recent divorce, paid for by James Denis, than in any way feel that he owned me.\nSecond, because a letter written by Denis would not be innocuous. If Grenville had asked me to deliver a message, I'd think nothing of it, but anything involving Denis could never be that simple.\nThe enclosed message hadn't been sealed. Denis had known I'd insist on reading what I delivered, and he'd not tried to hide it. I'd opened the paper and found a note that had made no sense to me.\nI decided I'd make the delivery in case it proved important to Brigadier Easton, but I would not let Denis or the brigadier draw me in further, nor would I become their go-between. I'd deliver the letter, and that would be that.\nMy front door was locked but I had a key, kept among my possessions for twenty years. I hadn't been back to this house since I'd left it to follow my mentor to the army and India, to fight the Tippu Sultan long before the Peninsular Wars began.\nThe lock proved to be frozen, the key immovable, but a firm shove broke the bolt right out of the wall.\nI walked into a dim, dust-coated interior.\nI left footprints in the dust as I moved through the wide entrance hall and looked into rooms on either side of the corridor. I expected memories--good and bad--to assail me, but this ruined house looked so different now that it spoke to me not at all.\nI studied the fireplace in the dining room, where my father had leaned while he regaled my mother and me with his pompous lectures. The fireplace had been painted wood, but now the mantelpiece had fallen, exposing the brick behind it.\nBehind me, Bartholomew coughed and pulled out a handkerchief. I moved on to the next room, the library with windows looking over the back garden. The garden was nonexistent now, a stretch of weeds that ran down to join the fens at the bottom of the field.\nHere I did feel the touch of my past. My father had beaten me in this room, me bent over the desk, my face pressed into its wooden surface so often that I remembered every swirl of its grain.\nMy father had beaten me for every sin, real and imagined. He'd been trying to make me obedient and instead had made me rebellious. As I'd grown older, I'd started deliberately inviting the beatings, because I'd realized that if Father were beating me, he wouldn't be beating my mother.\nAs I stood in this room, I remembered why I'd been so keen to follow Aloysius Brandon and his young wife into the army, why I'd hurried to procure a wife of my own. My mother had died long before I'd gone, and I'd wanted out of this existence, to get away, to find the world outside these walls, to live.\nWell, I'd done that. And now here I was, twenty years older, injured, world-weary, far more cynical, and about to marry again. To a lady who'd have put my father into his place faster than a cat swats a sparrow out of the sky.\n\"Captain!\"\nBartholomew's shout cut through my musings. His voice held a startled note, and I hurried out, my walking stick tapping in the dust.\nI found him at the front door. Coming up what was left of the drive was an elegant carriage with high-stepping horses complete with silver-gray plumes. The coachman had a matching brush in his hat, and the door of the carriage held the crest of the viscounts Breckenridge.\n\"Bloody hell,\" I said.\nThe horses shook their heads at the rain, plumes dancing. Bartholomew hurried forward at the same time a footman jumped from the back of the coach right into the mud. The footman unhooked a box from under the coach and placed it under the carriage door.\nBartholomew opened the door, and a well-formed ankle came down, foot in a pristine leather shoe stepping onto the box. I came forward to help the lady descend as Bartholomew and the footman stretched a canvas between them, holding it high to shield her from the rain.\nDonata Anne Catherine St. John, Dowager Viscountess Breckenridge, was thirty years old and my betrothed. That she'd agreed to marry me still came as a bit of a shock.\nLady Breckenridge let go of my hand, thanked Bartholomew and her footman, and lifted her skirts to walk the few feet to the house. She said nothing as she went inside the front door, tilting her head to take in the entire wreck of the house.\n\"I thought you were to stay with your friend near Blakeney,\" I said, following her. \"With its wonderful view of the sea.\"\n\"I am, but I could not resist seeing the house of your birth.\" Lady Breckenridge turned in a circle in the hall, staring up the wide staircase. \"A man's home can tell much about him.\"\n\"That is what I fear,\" I said.\n\"Nonsense. It's falling apart, but there are good bones here. Well designed. Late seventeenth century, with later additions.\"\nAs I stood, rather uncomfortably, on the bones of my ancestral home, she patted my arm. \"Now, Gabriel, I know it's bad of me to pounce on you without warning, but I do so want to see the place.\"\nShe was determined, and I complied. A marvelous thing happened as I took my betrothed from room to room, explaining what was what. The past became just that, the past. My father was no longer the ogre who ruled my life. He'd become a distant ghost, gone for eight years now, releasing his stranglehold on me.\n\"Good bones, as I said,\" Donata remarked as she stood in the largest bedroom, empty of all furnishings. \"Well anchored. The wing that has fallen in was an eighteenth-century addition, was it not? A good architect can restore it and fix the flaws that kept it from standing.\"\n\"The Lacey fortune hardly runs to architects,\" I said.\n\"But the Breckenridge one does.\"\nI took her hands. \"I know you berate me for being too proud, but the last thing I want is to run through your money to repair my life. Every member of the haut ton supposes that's what I'm doing, but I want you to believe that I am not.\"\nDonata shrugged. \"I like you being proud, and to the devil with what my friends believe. But I'm not being charitable, Gabriel. I am being practical. I will have to live here too, and so will my son, and I hardly want to worry about bricks falling on me as I walk about the passages. Besides, I will be inviting Lady Southwick--the friend with whom I am staying--and this house is so much better than hers. The Southwick house is gigantic, but modern, gaudy trash. I do want to best her.\"\nThe gleam in her eyes was both alarming and amusing.\n\"You generally say you care nothing for what your friends think,\" I said.\n\"And I do not, but Lady Southwick and I have always been rivals. She even had it off with my husband--briefly--a long time ago. I believe she was as appalled by him as I was, so that one-upmanship didn't quite work out as she liked.\"\nAs always whenever Donata mentioned her brute of a husband, whose face I'd once had the pleasure of bruising, I felt both irritated and protective. \"Why do you stay with her, then?\"\n\"We rather enjoy the game, I think. You'll understand when you arrive. And she will try to lure you from me. It is her way, I must warn you.\"\nHer words were flat, but her eyes flickered.\n\"I have no wish to be lured, I assure you,\" I said.\nWhy the devil Lady Breckenridge wanted me to stay at a house with a woman who would try to cuckold her, I could not guess, but I didn't have much choice. The nearby inns were hardly fit for a viscountess used to the very best of everything, and I'd been pleased that she had a friend of equal rank and wealth nearby. I'd been included in the invitation to stay at the house, and it would have been churlish of me to refuse.\nI did finally persuade Donata that she should leave the cold dankness of the Lacey home and return to her rival's house, which would at least be comfortable. Donata kissed me lightly on the lips and let me lead her back to the carriage.\nOnce she was gone, I went back through the house, looking at what furniture and things the assessors had not taken. I knew I was simply delaying my errand for Denis, but the rain was pouring down, and Denis's mission could wait. I was not his lackey.\nI ended up in my mother's sitting room, her sanctuary, once a room of whites and golds, light and airy. The view from the windows looked past the ruined garden to the fens and the sea. A windmill with a tall, cylindrical body and four-bladed fan turned slowly in the wind.\nThe windmill had been there for as long as I could remember, a sentinel in the flat land, built in the last century as part of the ongoing effort to drain the fens. I'd sneaked into in the windmill more than once as a child, only to be hauled out by the keeper before I could ruin the pumps. The great creaking machinery had fascinated me.\nI turned back, the room now dark after the rain-soaked glare. As I stood waiting for my eyes to adjust, I realized that something incongruous lay across the one remaining, mice-chewed sofa.\nI went to the sofa and leaned down to look. In the dim light I saw a dress--a long, high-waisted pale muslin that a young debutante might wear. The garment was thick with dust now, the hem tattered. When I lightly touched the sleeve, the gauze that covered the silk crumpled to nothing.\nI straightened up, puzzled indeed. I had no sisters and no female cousins. My mother had died when I'd been a lad, and she'd not brought out any young women as favors to friends or even had them to visit. My father, as far as I knew, had chosen his mistresses from the glittering demimonde, ladies with much experience who'd never wear such an innocent gown as this.\nWhy the dress was there and who it had belonged to was a complete mystery. If a couple had broken into the house for a tryst--they'd have found it quite easy to gain entrance--why leave the gown behind?\nI didn't touch the dress again, fearing it would dissolve further if I handled it. The fabric was so very fine.\nThe rain began to slacken, and I knew I needed to complete my errand before the paper burned my pocket to ash. I left the intriguing puzzle of the dress and closed the door of the room, locking it with the key I'd found in the lock. I put the key into my pocket.\nMy hired coach had returned to Norwich, and I prepared to walk the two miles to the brigadier's house. I told Bartholomew to find the nearest public house and indulge himself in a well-earned ale, and I went to the brigadier's alone.\nThrough the lightened rain, I could now see across the marshy flats that ran eastward from here to the spit of land called Blakeney Point. The tide was out, fishing boats marooned on sand that ran a long way out to sea.\nI remembered the brigadier, though through the perspective of a boy. Brigadier Easton had been a martinet, like my father, but with a streak of fairness that my father had lacked. He lived in a brick house that was as tall and deep as it was wide, windows in even rows covering all three floors of it.\nThe footman who opened the door took my card, gave my damp clothes and muddy boots an askance look, but at least he let me wait inside, out of the rain. The brigadier must have recognized the Lacey name, because the footman quickly returned and bade me follow him upstairs.\nI was shown into a long, narrow study whose windows looked north to the village of Cley and another windmill. This windmill was dark and tall, its fan like spindly arms.\nThe brigadier, on the other hand, was short and pale. Easton was in his sixties, as my father would have been had he been alive. While my father had been a big man--the same six-foot, broad-shouldered build as myself--the brigadier was small and slight. He made up for his stature with a powerful voice, which had, before his retirement, bellowed orders to troops in India.\nHe came to me, hand extended. \"Gabriel Lacey. Not the young hothead who eloped and raced away in the middle of the night?\" He chuckled as I shook his hand. \"I'd wondered when you'd make your move and become a man. Captain now, eh? Commended for bravery at Talavera; you and all the Thirty-Fifth Light. Damned bloody battle, that.\"\nIt had been. I'd started the morning a lieutenant and had been given captain that evening, both for my actions and because too many other captains had died. My father had passed away here that night, though I'd not known until I'd received the letter weeks later.\nEaston released my hand but peered up at me nearsightedly. \"Back home now, are you? What are you going to do with the place?\"\n\"I have some idea of repairing the house and living in it,\" I said.\nEaston's look told me doubted my sanity but wouldn't argue. \"And, you're getting married. Don't look surprised. We read the London newspapers even out here. My felicitations.\"\nI bowed politely. I put my hand into my coat and withdrew the message from Denis.\n\"Thank you. I did not come here only to call on a neighbor. I was charged with delivering this to you. From London.\"\nEaston frowned at it. He took the folded paper from me--thick, cream-colored, and expensive--walked to his desk, sat down, and opened a drawer. He removed a pair of spectacles from the drawer and balanced them on his nose. He opened the paper, read the one word of the message, and went utterly still.\nI approached the desk as Easton stared down at the paper, his face drained of color.\nThe one word on it was Corn. Obviously a code, but what Denis meant by it I couldn't imagine.\nThe expression on Easton's face was telling me. He slowly stood, his skin wan, the man looking ten years older now than when I'd walked in.\n\"You brought this from Mr. Denis,\" he said.\n\"I did. Denis . . . asked me to.\"\nNow what was in Easton's eyes was abject fear. He studied me anew, taking in my large build, my big hands, the walking stick I held, inside of which rattled a sword.\n\"I suppose I ought to have known. What else did he ask you to do? Tell me quickly; I've faced it before.\"\nI frowned. \"Nothing. To deliver the message was my only charge. What does it mean?\"\nThe brigadier let out a breath and sank to his chair. He put both hands on the desk and looked up at me, shoulders slumped in defeat.\n\"You've brought me my death sentence, my boy. That's what it means. This is my last day on earth.\"\n\n* * * * *\nAbout the Author\n\nAward-winning Ashley Gardner is a pseudonym for New York Times bestselling author Jennifer Ashley.

Av TT Familjen flydde fr\u00e5n kriget p\u00e5 Balkan och bakgrunden har pr\u00e4glat m\u00e5lvaktstalangen Zecira Musovic. Familjen har l\u00e4rt mig att h\u00e5lla ut och v\u00e4nta p\u00e5 chansen, s\u00e4ger 21-\u00e5ringen. Nu \u00e4r hon utsedd till f\u00f6rstam\u00e5lvakt i Roseng\u00e5rd - och vill i framtiden n\u00e5 samma position i landslaget. Dela 0 Tweeta 0 \nEn dryg vecka har g\u00e5tt sedan Zecira Musovic satte signaturen p\u00e5 ett efterl\u00e4ngtat kontrakt. M\u00e5lvakten blir kvar i Roseng\u00e5rd till och med s\u00e4songen 2020 \u2013 en tydlig signal om att 21-\u00e5ringen \u00e4r Malm\u00f6klubbens f\u00f6rstaval mellan stolparna i framtiden. Efter s\u00e4songen l\u00e4mnar m\u00e5lvaktskollegan Erin McLeod klubben. \n\u2013 Det g\u00e5r inte l\u00e4ngre att jag ska ta tv\u00e5 steg fram\u00e5t och ett tillbaka varje s\u00e4song. Jag \u00e4r v\u00e4ldigt tacksam f\u00f6r att klubben har visat sin tydlighet gentemot mig om vad de vill och hur de kommer att satsa, s\u00e4ger Zecira Musovic, som kom till klubben inf\u00f6r s\u00e4songen 2013. \n\u201dIngen enkel resa\u201d \nDe tre senaste s\u00e4songerna har talangen gjort 38 allsvenska matcher och har under \u00e5ren konkurrerat med tre m\u00e5lvakter med landslagsmeriter \u2013 Thora Helgadottir, Island, Sofia Lundgren, Sverige och McLeod, Kanada \u2013 samt Kathrin L\u00e4ngert, som har spelat i tyska ungdomslandslag. \n\u2013 Det \u00e4r ingen enkel resa man har gjort. Det har kommit nya utmaningar inf\u00f6r varje \u00e5r och det \u00e4r ju fyra m\u00e5lvakter p\u00e5 yttersta niv\u00e5 jag har f\u00e5tt tampas med inf\u00f6r varje \u00e5r. Det \u00e4r inga l\u00e4tta \u00e5r jag har haft, men v\u00e4ldigt l\u00e4rorika, s\u00e4ger Musovic, som dessutom var skadad under delar av v\u00e5ren i fjol. \nTT: \u00c4nd\u00e5 har du blivit kvar \u2013 varifr\u00e5n har du f\u00e5tt ditt tuffa psyke? \n\u2013 Jag tror att mycket ligger i familjen. Familjen har inte alltid haft det l\u00e4tt. De flydde fr\u00e5n kriget (i tidigare Jugoslavien) och har tvingats ha ett starkt psyke f\u00f6r att inte brytas ner. Bara att lyckas komma in i det svenska samh\u00e4llet p\u00e5 ett bra s\u00e4tt, det tyder p\u00e5 ett bra psyke enligt mig och det har mina f\u00f6r\u00e4ldrar gjort. Familjen har l\u00e4rt mig att h\u00e5lla ut och v\u00e4nta p\u00e5 chansen. \nUttagen i landslaget \nChansen har Musovic nu \u00e4ven f\u00e5tt i landslaget. Den nye f\u00f6rbundskaptenen Peter Gerhardssons tog under h\u00f6sten ut 21-\u00e5ringen till sina tv\u00e5 f\u00f6rsta VM-kvalsamlingar. \n\u2013 Det var en j\u00e4ttestor l\u00e4ttnad framf\u00f6r allt. Att k\u00e4nna att n\u00e5gon ser en \u00e4ven fast jag inte f\u00e5r spela alla matcher. N\u00e5gon ser faktiskt att jag har en j\u00e4kla bra konkurrenssituation hemma och att det \u00e4r kanske d\u00e4rf\u00f6r jag inte f\u00e5r spela, men att jag trots det \u00e4r en bra m\u00e5lvakt, s\u00e4ger sk\u00e5nskan. \nM\u00f6ter Chelsea och Lindahl \nEfter att dansken Jack Majgaard Jensen f\u00e5tt sparken som tr\u00e4nare under h\u00f6sten har Musovic l\u00e4mnat b\u00e4nken p\u00e5 allvar i klubblaget.

Crown Prince MIDDLE EAST Iran supply of rockets is military aggression: Saudi Crown Prince Reuters | Dubai | November 07, 2017 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman | Reuters \nSaudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said on November 7 that Iran\u2019s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of \u201cdirect military aggression\u201d, Saudi state news agency SPA reported. \nThe supply of rockets to the Iran-allied rebel Houthi movement could \u201cconstitute an act of war against the Kingdom,\u201d SPA quoted the crown prince as saying in a telephone call with the British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson. \nSaudi air defence forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired towards Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthi militia which controls large parts of neighbouring Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, in the country\u2019s civil war. \nIran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as \u201cdestructive and provocative\u201d and \u201cslanders\u201d. \nIn an interview with the media on November 6, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir accused the armed Lebanese Hezbollah group of firing the missile at Riyadh from Houthi-held territory. \n\u201cWith regards to the missile ... that was launched on Saudi territory, it was an Iranian missile launched by Hezbollah from territory occupied by the Houthis in Yemen.\u201d \nHe said the missile was similar to one launched in July at Yanbu in Saudi Arabia and was manufactured in Iran, disassembled and smuggled into Yemen, then reassembled by the operatives of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and Hezbollah, \u201cthen it was launched into Saudi Arabia.\u201d \nIn reaction to the missile, the Saudi-led military coalition fighting against the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country. \nThe move is likely to deepen a humanitarian crisis in Yemen that according to the United Nations has pushed some seven million people to the brink of famine and left nearly 900,000 infected with cholera.

November 2017 von Redaktion \nBerlin (dts Nachrichtenagentur) \u2013 Die Gr\u00fcnen haben in der strittigen Klima-Debatte \u00fcber die Abschaltung von Kohlekraftwerken die Bereitschaft zu pragmatischen L\u00f6sungen signalisiert. \u201eF\u00fcr uns kommt es nicht darauf an, ob das letzte Kohlekraftwerk 2030 oder 2032 vom Netz geht. Da sind wir pragmatisch. Entscheidend ist die CO2-Emissionsminderung\u201c, sagte Gr\u00fcnen-Chefin Simone Peter der \u201eRheinischen Post\u201c (Dienstagsausgabe). \n\u201eUns geht es darum, dass die CO2-Emissionen 2020 um 40 Prozent unter dem Aussto\u00df von 1990 liegen und dass die Sektorziele f\u00fcr 2030 eingehalten werden, auch mit Blick auf die Paris-Ziele\u201c, sagte Peter, die Chefunterh\u00e4ndlerin ihrer Partei beim Klimathema ist. Die Bonner Klimakonferenz setze die Parteien in Berlin zus\u00e4tzlich unter Druck. \u201eDa Deutschland Gastgeber ist, muss nicht nur die amtierende Regierung ihr Bekenntnis zu den Klimazielen bekr\u00e4ftigen, sondern auch die Jamaika-Sondierer sollten beim Klimaschutz sichtbar und effektiv etwas voranbringen\u201c, sagte Peter.

Aber von der j\u00fcngeren Generation w\u00fcrde ich mir mehr Interesse w\u00fcnschen\u00bb, sagte Eiber. \nAuch Projekt-Betreuerin Steffi Behncke von der Stadtverwaltung in Plauen best\u00e4tigt: Die Nachfrage sei seit Jahren sehr hoch, aber vor allem \u00e4ltere Menschen buchten die dreist\u00fcndige Bustour, die durch das Dreil\u00e4ndereck von Sachsen, Th\u00fcringen und Bayern f\u00fchrt. \u00abViele wollen die Orte sehen, zu denen sie fr\u00fcher nicht durften, und wollen die Geschichten h\u00f6ren, was damals genau dort passiert ist.\u00bb \nAnfragen kommen aus ganz Sachsen und Th\u00fcringen, aber auch dar\u00fcber hinaus. Von Plauen aus geht die Tour unter anderem nach M\u00f6dlareuth. Durch den Ort verlief einst die innerdeutsche Grenze - ein Teil geh\u00f6rt zu Th\u00fcringen, ein anderer Teil zu Bayern. Alfred Eiber zeigt Fotografien, die er als fr\u00fcherer Sachbearbeiter f\u00fcr den Grenzabschnitt auf bayrischer Seite angefertigt hat. \n\u00abAlles, was an der Grenze vorfiel, landete auf meinem Schreibtisch\u00bb, berichtet Eiber. Darunter auch spektakul\u00e4re Fluchtf\u00e4lle. Wer die Grenze \u00fcberwinden konnte, wurde von Alfred Eiber nicht selten mit \u00abGr\u00fc\u00df Gott\u00bb begr\u00fc\u00dft. \nAufsehen erregte eine Ballonflucht Ende der 1970er Jahre. Eiber: \u00abDie Insassen starteten im th\u00fcringischen Lobenstein und mussten nachts notlanden, weil das Gas alle war. Und sie wussten erst nicht, auf welcher Seite der Grenze sie nun waren.\u00bb \nEin anderes Mal sei eine Frau \u00fcber ein 70 Meter langes Abwasserloch nach Westdeutschland gekommen. Die \u00d6ffnung der Grenze 1989 bezeichnet Eiber als Gl\u00fccksfall - auch wenn sie f\u00fcr den bayrischen Grenzpolizisten wegen des gro\u00dfen Andrangs Sonderschichten und 70-Arbeitsstunden in der Woche bedeutet hatte.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "german", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:50:45.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f488dca8a9247ac63264858ce69573e1d1fdd84a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxlqVmI918w7x.8XFsQZHmZ93UslhAQ.W2KWbv3z5_pXLb3QBYhqqvNA9wpKRx.vsnkkxomoDKO3kt_RomtuKtc", "site_full": "forum.index.hu", "site": "index.hu", "site_section": "http://forum.index.hu/Topic/showTopicList?t=9111349", "site_categories": ["non_standard_content", "adult"], "section_title": "Gazdas\u00e1gpolitika - Index F\u00f3rum", "title": "Radik\u00e1lis nyugd\u00edjcs\u00f6kkent\u00e9st!", "title_full": "Radik\u00e1lis nyugd\u00edjcs\u00f6kkent\u00e9st! - Index F\u00f3rum", "published": "2017-11-06T09:31:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 29, "participants_count": 15, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "HU", "spam_score": 0.508, "main_image": "http://forum.index.hu/img/forum_logo.png", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1931, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "fb222d4194a97dc0273a0c4f8ccb90780438e89c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgxlqVmI918w7x.8XFsQZHmZ93UslhAQ.W2KWbv3z5_pXLb3QBYhqqvNA9wpKRx.vsnkkxomoDKO3g9TdzItWu68lGPfD97GqNw-", "ord_in_thread": 29, "author": "Tu Sok", "published": "2017-11-07T10:35:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Nem lesz meg a szolg\u00e1lati \u00e9vsz\u00e1ma.\nXar \u00fcgy..", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "hungarian", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-11-07T11:50:45.000+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e270fb50d7e91acc5fc985dacab76067d5bdbc2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVFEwpaBDocKfEyMVrCAi7Bwnqo8e79eqKnZqSKVz4O4IiJwkPMPAjVOPW7GBo3fJokY41cKR0P1vb04Z4M4EYR79WzDbloF9Zu7ch5EbR7FQZj5adrX6aE", "site_full": "norran.se", "site": "norran.se", "site_section": "http://norran.se/category/sport/feed", "site_categories": ["pro_ice_hockey", "social", "sports"], "section_title": "Sport \u2013 Norran, Skellefte\u00e5", "title": "[PLUS] Lena Lindberg europam\u00e4stare med nytt fint rekord", "title_full": "[PLUS] Lena Lindberg europam\u00e4stare med nytt fint rekord", "published": "2017-11-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "SE", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://norran.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/942143-1200x630.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 73552, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e270fb50d7e91acc5fc985dacab76067d5bdbc2c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJVFEwpaBDocKfEyMVrCAi7Bwnqo8e79eqKnZqSKVz4O4IiJwkPMPAjVOPW7GBo3fJokY41cKR0P1vb04Z4M4EYR79WzDbloF9Zu7ch5EbR7FQZj5adrX6aE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "rogerl", "published": "2017-11-07T11:02:00.000+02:00", "title": "[PLUS] Lena Lindberg europam\u00e4stare med nytt fint rekord", "text": "Lena Lindberg m\u00e4stare med nytt fint rekord Publicerad f\u00f6r 45 minuter sedan (uppdaterad f\u00f6r 23 minuter sedan) .

Geeignet f\u00fcr den t\u00e4glichen Gebrauch am besten nach der Dusche. \n350 ml 28.90\u20ac \nFazit, Als erstes kam mir der sehr angenehme Duft entgegen, beim eincremen muss ich echt zugeben das sich das toll anf\u00fchl, man merkst sofort das die Haut sich glatter anf\u00fchlt und nicht schmierig wie bei vielen anderen Cremes, auch der angenehme Duft ist echt toll, der sehr lange anh\u00e4lt.Meine Haut f\u00fchlt sich nun Streichelzart an und selbst meine Tochter die diese Creme f\u00fcr ihr Babybauch benutzt ist begeistert , sie sagt so Jucken die Narben sehr viel weniger.
