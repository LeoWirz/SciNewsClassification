What Is Morph EQ? \nMorph EQ allows you to smoothly transition from one EQ setting to another. By setting up two different EQ states, one in slot A, the other in Slot B. Full control of the transition time is given with transitions measured in seconds or musical divisions for tempo-synced effects. \nThe transition can be a single action from A-B (or B-A), return (A-B-A) or looping. The spline, control point interface makes the transition simpler to visualise but both the A and B curves are visible simultaneously to make it easier to keep track of how the two EQ states relate to each other. Filter Modes \nThe high and low pass filters in SEQ-S operate in one of three modes during a morph: Off - The filters are disabled during the morph Static - This mode performs a 'cross-fade' between different pass filter positions Dynamic - The dynamic mode morphs the cut-off frequency of the pass filter between two different positions In This Tutorial \nWatch the tutorial to see how this technique can be used to create anything from a slow transition to fast tremolo/wah effects.

Of these, 172 were in Johannesburg, with 8 percent of these cases resulting in death. \nListeriosis is a food-borne illness associated with eating food contaminated with Listeria monocytogens, including dairy products and produce, fresh vegetables and fruit, as well as ready-to-eat products. \n\u201cWe have activated our environmental health outbreak units to monitor all our food outlets and also assist in educating communities on what steps to take to remain safe,\u201d Johannesburg director of public health Dr Baskie Desai said. \n\u201cIt is important to tell our people to always take precautionary measures and to avoid certain foods that might cause Listeriosis if not prepared accordingly.\u201d \nSymptoms are usually mild and may include fever, muscle pain, restlessness and sometimes nausea or diarrhoea. \nThe spread of infection to the nervous system can cause meningitis leading to headaches, confusion, stiff neck, loss of balance or convulsions. The presence of bacteria in the blood, also known as bacteraemia, may also occur. \nThe disease primarily affects pregnant women and their newborns, adults aged 65 and older and people with weakened immune systems. \n\u2013 African News Agency (ANA) \nFor more news your way, follow The Citizen on Facebook and Twitter .

These clots restrict blood flow through the circulatory system. It is classified into two type\u2019s deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Formation of blood clot in a deep vein (generally in the leg) is called deep vein thrombosis. The formed deep vein thrombosis clot break off and travels to the lungs, called as pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a serious complication from deep vein thrombosis. It occurs in almost one-third of patients suffering from deep vein thrombosis. Venous thromboembolism can occur at any age; however, it is common in adults aged 60 and above. People who are overweight, older, whose blood is thicker than normal or suffer from some other diseases such as autoimmune disorders (rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, etc.) or cancer are at a higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Hospitalization due to major trauma (fractures or immobilization) or surgery increases the risk for venous thromboembolism. Up to 60% of venous thromboembolism cases occur during or after hospitalization. Venous thromboembolism equally affects men and women. Globally, venous thromboembolism is the third most common cardiovascular disease and leading cause of death and disability. Report Overview and TOC @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/venous-thromboembolism... Venous thromboembolism is a life-threatening medical condition that requires immediate medical treatment. Treatment primarily focuses on breaking the clots and preventing further formation of clots. Treatment includes blood thinning agents such as anticoagulants (such as unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin as well as warfarin), mechanical devices (compression stockings), and thrombolytic therapy (tissue plasminogen activator). The venous thromboembolism market is expected to expand in the near future, led by the development of novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) to overcome the limitation of current treatment options and provide improved patient of care. NOACs are classified into direct thrombin inhibitors (argatroban, dabigatran), which inhibit factor IIa (thrombin), and factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban). NOACs offer major pharmacological benefits over current vitamin K antagonists (heparin or warfarin). These include rapid onset and offset of action, predictable pharmacokinetics, and less drug interactions, which eliminate the need for regular coagulation monitoring associated with conventional anticoagulant therapy. Increase in government expenditure, rise in incidence rate of venous thromboembolism, growth in patient awareness about treatment, and high unmet needs of current treatment options are fueling the venous thromboembolism market. However, complex pathophysiology of the disease, high cost of treatment, and side effects associated with it act as key restraints for the venous thromboembolism market. Request brochure @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag... The venous thromboembolism market can be segmented based on disease type, product type, and geography. In terms of disease type, the venous thromboembolism market can be segregated into deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The pulmonary embolism segment is estimated to expand more than the deep vein thrombosis segment, as pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause for hospital related deaths. Based on product type, the venous thromboembolism market can be divided into anticoagulants, medical devices, and others. In anticoagulant segment, NOAC\u2019s market is expected to grow because it eliminates the need for regular coagulation monitoring, overcoming the major limitation of current standard of care. In terms of geography, the venous thromboembolism market can be classified into North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Middle East & Africa. North America dominates the venous thromboembolism market, followed by Europe, due to the higher incidence and prevalence rate than that in Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa, increase in demand for advance treatment, and rise in geriatric population in the region. Asia Pacific is an emerging market for venous thromboembolism due to the developing healthcare infrastructure and rising government expenditure in the healthcare industry. However, affordability issues, lack of proper treatment, and poor patient education are factors restraining the venous thromboembolism market in such as Middle East & Africa and Latin America. for Specific and Customized requirements@ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag...

(Photo by Philip Maeta/Gallo Images) Baroka FC coach Kgoloko Thobejane appears to be a subscriber to the Biblical verse \u201cprisoner of hope\u201d, as he insists that his league title aspirations have not been dampened even though his side was given a 4-0 hiding by Mamelodi Sundowns on Tuesday night. \nSundowns\u2019 emphatic win saw them move level on points with Baroka and Orlando Pirates, and they have three games in hand on both. \n\u201cIt was not a good result, they beat us convincingly. It was test of character,\u201d said Thobejane. \n\u201cIt tells us to keep going and be strong. If you want to be champions this is the situation and you don\u2019t look down, you keep your head up and say I can make it. \n\u201cWe want to maintain the top spot. Sundowns are on 19 points, we are also on 19 points and so are Orlando Pirates, so we are still there and we still believe we can do it,\u201d he added. \nREAD: I am not troubled \u2013 Thobejane \nHis opposite number Pitso Mosimane reckoned his side could\u2019ve rubbed more salt into the wounds with more goals, but will gladly take the four unanswered goals along with the three points. \n\u201cWe could\u2019ve scored more, we missed a lot, but we scored four. Sometimes we shouldn\u2019t be ungrateful, but they could\u2019ve done better to be honest. The first goal gave us comfort \u2026 it was the ice-breaker. \n\u201cWe managed to play a bit because of the goals, they brought a lot of confidence. It has been long since I\u2019ve seen Sundowns pass the ball around like this, I am happy,\u201d he said. \nMosimane believes those extra goals could\u2019ve come from Man-of-the-Match Percy Tau, even though he scored his second brace this season. Mosimane seemingly expects a lot more from the 23-year-old. \n\u201cPercy can do better, let\u2019s be honest. We appreciate and acknowledge him. He is a good player, he fights, but he could do better in front of goal. He got one against Chippa United, he got one against Wits and he delayed.

Well presented \nFirstly, I\u2019ve got to give kudos on the layout. \nRather than wait for a hard copy to ship to Australia, I bought my copy on Apple iBooks and was impressed at how you could interactively explode the ingredients list to full screen on my phone. \nThis feature would be invaluable when actually using the book in the kitchen, especially on a phone where showing a full page of small text on a screen is impractical, and all you want to see is the ingredients from a distance. Whole food \nThe recipes in the How Not to Die Cookbook are full of nutritious minimally processed whole food, which is a win for me. \nThere are heaps of colour on the pages, which is indicative of the range of vitamins and minerals present in these minimally processed foods. \nIn the introduction, Dr Greger makes the critical distinction between a vegetarian diet (which could be filled with highly processed grains and sugars) and minimally processed plant-based whole foods. \nMost of the issues with nutrition come when we overly process our food and make it shelf stable for increased profit margins. Some of the recipes in the How Not To Die Cookbook call for some whole wheat bread, pasta and date sugar and the like, but overall, the recipes rely on minimally processed whole foods. \nIf you want quick and easy, this may not be the book for you. Although there are headings of \u2018easy\u2019 and \u2018moderate\u2019 on the recipes, most of the recipes have a significant number of ingredients, including a range of herbs and spices. You may have to gear up your kitchen with a range of new ingredients if you are not already following this way of eating. However, for the experienced WFPB enthusiast who wants to add some flair and variety to their diet and dinner parties, this book is ideal. Plant-based \nIn spite of being the Director of Public Health and Animal Agriculture for the Humane Society by day, Dr Greger doesn\u2019t overtly focus on being vegan or vegetarian in the book. \nUnlike many others in this field, he doesn\u2019t lead with animal welfare as the primary basis for not eating animals. In the introduction to the cookbook, he talks about his personal experience of seeing his grandmother\u2019s life turned around by this way, under the guidance Nathan Pritikin (who happens to be another engineer-cum-doctor) (pictured below). \nGreger is a self-confessed \u201cnutrition nerd\u201d who appears to find genuine excitement in unpacking the research to find links between different aspects of diet and their impact on health. His Nutrition Facts YouTube channel has become viral and has become the primary resource for pre-processed nutritional inspiration for many. \nFrame of reference \nNutrition is still an emerging science. We seem to still be fumbling trying to understand the mechanisms, the cause and effect relationships of the food we eat on our health, well-being and longevity. \nTo deal with complexities of a topic like nutrition, we adopt a simplified frame of reference to help us navigate our reality without our mind exploding. These simplified frames of reference are never perfect. Over time we strive to create new and more useful frames of reference that suits use best. [1] For example, the Paleo frame of reference says we should eat foods that we evolved with. The vegan frame of reference says we should eat foods that don\u2019t harm other sentient life forms. The hedonistic frame of references says, \u201cif it tastes good, eat it.\u201d The cost frame of reference, which applies for many, optimises for the lowest cost per calorie with minimal consideration of nutrition. The Heart Association frame of reference believes that minimising fat, especially saturated fat, will help us avoid heart disease. The conservationist frame of reference tries to eat in a way that we should eat in a way the minimise our impact on the environment. The low carb/keto frame of reference suggests that minimising carbohydrates and maximising fat will lead to optimum health for most people. \nAs a doctor, Dr Greger relies on the medical research frame of reference. He draws associations between different food properties and health outcomes and tries develop a system that avoids the properties of food that he believes to be dangerous. \nWhile some people suggest that Greger cherry picks the studies and interprets the data to fit his plant-based perspective, [2] [3] [4] the research-based frame of reference is at least a refreshing contrast to the fear-based sensationalist frame of reference in more militant vegan presentations such as What the Health and Cowspiracy . The Optimising Nutrition framework Nutrient density \nWhile I don\u2019t call myself a Nutritarian, my frame of reference has more in common with Dr Joel Fuhrman\u2019s focus on nutrient density. Rather than focusing on foods to avoid I think we need to focus on foods that contain the nutrients we need, which tends to automatically manage the things that aren\u2019t good for us in excess. The food we eat should give us the nutrients without having to ingest too much energy to get those nutrients. \nDr Mat Lalonde\u2019s take on nutrient density has also been a major inspiration. Lalonde took Fuhrman\u2019s approach and re-ran the analysis to consider only essential vitamins, vitamins, amino acids and essential fatty acids for which there are widely available data and some consensus on the minimum nutrient intakes. \n\nThe problem with Lalonde\u2019s approach, though, is that amino acids are very easy to find in our food system, so the system ends up optimising for very high protein foods at the expensive of vitamins and minerals which can be harder to obtain in our food system. \nDr Greger is also a big fan of nutrient density as shown in this NutritionFacts.org video. \n\nRather than emphasising all nutrients, the Nutrient Optimiser algorithm identifies the nutrients that you are not getting in large quantities and identifies foods that will boost those nutrients. \nIf you want to follow a particular dietary template (e.g. vegan, paleo, ketogenic, low carb, whole food plant based, pescetarian, vegetarian, bivalve vegan etc) the algorithm can work within those parameters. However, the optimal nutritional outcome tends to be to simply focus on the most nutrient-dense foods available. Insulin load \nAs the husband to someone who has type 1 diabetes, I also see the importance of eating food that doesn\u2019t require massive amounts of insulin to maintain normal healthy blood sugar levels. There is value in moderating dietary insulin load to make sure you don\u2019t need industrial levels of insulin to stabilise your blood sugar. The food insulin index data demonstrates that our glucose response is proportional to the carbohydrate we eat. [5] [6] \nWhile our insulin response is related to the non-fibre carbohydrates minus about half the fibre. Energy density \nAnd lastly, I think energy density can be a useful tool to help us moderate our food intake. \nThis is another area where the WFPB approach shines in contrast to the low carb or ketogenic approaches, which can be energy dense and make it possible to overeat. \nWithout the use of added oils or a significant amount of processed grains and sugars, it will be practically impossible to overeat using only the meals set out in the How Not to Die Cookbook . Meals analysed \nRather than entering in the whole book, I chose representative meals from the various sections of the book.
