Author: Brought to you by Vicks VapoRub. 6 SHARES \nI'd heard that once a kid starts preschool, the whole family gets sick...a lot. And that's certainly been the case around here this winter. No matter how often I wash my hands, toddlers aren't exactly cautious when it comes to spreading their germs. I feel terrible for Sloan when she has a cold or cough, but I relish in the opportunity to take care of her (and happily soak up the extra cuddles). Here are some of the ways that we combat sickness in our house, relying on several of the tried-and-true methods my own mom used on me. \nSleep is always important, but even more so when your kid is sick. We typically abide by a pretty strict regimen at night, making sure Sloan is in bed by around 7:00 pm (which means she gets about 11 hours of sleep). When she's not feeling well, we try to be a little more flexible, encouraging multiple naps and plenty of rest. Since she still has a tendency to move all over the bed (and not remain nestled under her covers), occasionally I'll put her in a sleep sack to make sure she doesn't get chilly. \nWhen I was little, I found comfort in the routines my mom created when I was sick. At the first sign of a cold or cough, she'd bring the humidifier into my room, prop pillows under my mattress, and rub Vicks VapoRub on my chest. The smell is so nostalgic\u2014as well as the feeling of relief it brought by quickly reducing my cough. If I could create a cold medicine for her, it would look a lot like this one, since it's safe, topical, and fast-acting. It also lasts for eight hours, which means she and I both are able to get some much-needed sleep. Now that Sloan's old enough to use it (it's for kids two-years and older), I like knowing that I'm not only helping make her more comfortable, but also passing along the same soothing treatments my mom used on me. \nAny healthy habit that involves your toddler's participation makes it that much more appealing to them. While Sloan has been reluctant to embrace vegetables (if you only knew the amount of songs I now sing about them in hopes of swaying her), she loves fruit and is enthusiastic about squeezing her orange juice each morning. She loves being involved and it makes me happy to know she's getting a good dose of Vitamin C. \nI remember watching my mom from my bed when she'd bring in the family's humidifier and set it up when I had a cough. We do the same for Sloan and just like her orange juice, we even let her help by turning it on before bed. The increase in air moisture eases the symptoms of her cold while she sleeps. \nLike me, Sloan loves a bath, especially when she has a cold. It provides much-needed relief and helps her transition for bedtime. I close the door so that it gets nice and steamy and occasionally add essential oils to the water that help clear her sinuses. \nIt's hard for most two-year-olds to understand why they can't go outside and run around when they're sick. To keep Sloan from getting too stir crazy, I keep a stash of craft supplies, stickers, and new coloring books so that she's excited and engaged anytime I bring them out. We also become much more lenient with our 'no tv during the week' rule because I find that if she's lying down and resting, often times it will also lead to much-needed (unscheduled) naps. \nWhen I'm sick, nothing is appealing about having a kale salad\u2014all I want is warm comfort foods: chicken soup, raisin toast with butter, etc. But I also understand the importance of eating things that are nutrient-dense that will help me get better. I follow the same protocol when it comes to Sloan and allow her the same simple foods I crave, but also sneak things like fresh fruit and spinach into her smoothies. \nOne of the things I've learned as a mom is that, when you feel something is off, trust your instincts. There's so much information out there that it can be overwhelming trying to sort through it all.

Well, two things really.\nThe first thing is that Eve is able to manipulate the cells of eukaryotic organisms because they have mitochondria.\nViruses are neither eukaryotic, and most definitely do not have mitochondria. Alex Mercer is consisting of nothing but viral matter that turns biomass into more of itself kind of like John Carpenter's The Thing. If it ever developed any sort of crisis of morality after eating a bunch of helpless pedestrians (and if you played Prototype, and didn't do that at least once you're lying). Which doesn't stick because the writers of Prototype II are not good at their jobs.\nHe does not eat because he has to. It's because it is his way of reproducing, and replacing any lost viral matter by transforming any nearby biomass into more of himself. Just take for example literally the first time he consumes something. Namely, the real Alex Mercer. He is not actually Alex Mercer, and only his creator's memories remain. His body is nothing but the virus. Hence, why he is Black Light rather than being infected by it.\nMitochondria produces energy from oxygen, and regulates the metabolism of a eukaryotic organism.\nThe second thing is the fact that a thermonuclear explosion fails to destroy Alex Mercer completely. If somehow Eve could ignore the fact he is not an eukaryotic organism? Unless she lights him up with fires exceeding temperatures of say 10,000,000 degrees or so it's not going to stick.\nQuite literally Eve would be powerless against Alex.\nIt would be like a hollow from Bleach trying to snack on the soul of a vampire from Buffy: The Vampire Slayer. It just doesn't work because what they need isn't there to begin with.\nAnd there have even been normal human beings who have survived being set ablaze by the Ultimate Being (who is even more powerful than Eve) so long as they quickly hit the water afterwards. Daniel Dollis for example after he throws Maeda's bullets to Aya. Plus, the victims of it tend to be charred corpses rather than being disintegrated outright.\nAlex Mercer is a highly adaptive super virus that turns biological matter into more of itself, can survive thermonuclear explosions, tear through the US military with his bare hands destroying everything they have from tanks to heavily armored vehicles, and assimilates the abilities and memories of everything he consumes. He can easily make his way across the entire city on foot, outrun cars, and dodge heavy munitions.\nWhereas Eve's greatest ace would be pretty much useless against him, and in terms of physical ability he would squash her like a bug.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:57.046+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d83bdc2c2fbcaed8adfdde31943fbecff3ca4ad9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtpCCVVi8HvR5Ynt119eMrgdHerov73FyakSFT_j8Yy8H.cozaY6SUDI4X4bWY8Zk.w--", "site_full": "floridastate.forums.rivals.com", "site": "rivals.com", "site_section": "https://floridastate.forums.rivals.com/forums/premium-recruiting-board.38/", "site_categories": ["football", "sports"], "section_title": "Premium Recruiting Board | Warchant.com", "title": "can anyone even commit now?", "title_full": "can anyone even commit now? | Warchant.com", "published": "2017-12-06T14:55:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 3, "participants_count": 2, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.178, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3057, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d83bdc2c2fbcaed8adfdde31943fbecff3ca4ad9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR_yr1tUcsexU0svHpUFg8U80XCYdO4SPKP6iSpCkgLtpCCVVi8HvR5Ynt119eMrgdHerov73FyakSFT_j8Yy8H.cozaY6SUDI4X4bWY8Zk.w--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "CarlsbadNole", "published": "2017-12-06T14:55:00.000+02:00", "title": "can anyone even commit now?", "text": "maybe some of the...", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:57.054+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "01cf5047618d6ed9d5d77af90407e01b6b689900", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVW7ggCoBajNELItA63CT7yEzTjuxE5JZxD_lDfYd4B2mQvkaHfvq94emeH00X98EhkxRcUTQeR21G_kGb4FksO1g1c2CbCz5m62G6YjUIlmr7nJB_5NbtaEET80r_UdWA--", "site_full": "www.expedia.se", "site": "expedia.se", "site_section": "https://www.expedia.se/Onondaga-Lake-Park-Hotell.0-l6185539-0.Reseguide-Filter-Hotell", "site_categories": ["travel", "air_travel"], "section_title": "Hotell Onondaga Lake Park, Syracuse | Expedia.se", "title": "Best Western The Inn At The Fairgrounds", "title_full": "Best Western The Inn At The Fairgrounds (Syracuse, Amerikas F\u00f6renta Stater) | Expedia.se", "published": "2017-08-18T22:49:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 18, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 96941, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07c13e5066d1a9910b67d88829c4e2228592813d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSG88jOJcAhbVW7ggCoBajNELItA63CT7yEzTjuxE5JZxD_lDfYd4B2mQvkaHfvq94emeH00X98EhkxRcUTQeR21G_kGb4FksO1g1c2CbCz5m62G6YjUIlmr7nJB_5NbtZnH4gc9HAN1vUBRoN6SfSR.eh5hPyiQbsWc..uurczEg--", "ord_in_thread": 18, "author": "expedia.com", "published": "2017-12-07T07:03:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "It is nicely located by the highway and with in a good price range.

My late husband deals on Crude Oil with Federal Government of Sudan, and he has a personal Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone town, and Upper Nile city.

Due to the recent civil an Ethnic war cause by our President Mr. Salva Kiir, and the rebel leader Mr Riek Machar.I have been Under United Nation refugee camp in Chad, to save my life and that of my little daughter.I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to invest the $8 million dollars deposited by my late husband in Bank; this is because my life is no longer safe in our country.This is because the rebels are looking for the families of all the oil and gas business men in the country to kill, saying that they are the one that is making the country to dry.Though, I do not know how you will feel to my proposal, but the truth is that I sneaked into Chad our neighboring country, where I live as a refugee.I escaped with my little daughter, when the rebels bust into our house on 21/04/2016and killed my husband as one of the big oil dealers in the country, ever since then, I have being on the run.I left my country and move to Chad our neighboring country with the little ceasefire we had, due to the face to face peace meeting accord coordinated by the US Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry and United Nations in Ethiopia (Addis Ababa), between our President Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar, to stop this war.I will offer you 20% of the total fund for your help, while I will partner with you for the investment in your country which we will agree on what the percentage sharing will be for our partnership.I will wait to hear from you, so as to give you relevant details and the necessary document.

REUTERS/Bo \nBy Jennifer Hughes \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - HSBC has a three-year head start on its foreign investment banking rivals in China because of the British bank's unique position of having management control of its securities venture there, chief executive Stuart Gulliver said on Thursday. \nGulliver's comments come after Beijing, in a surprise move last month, announced it will allow foreigners to control their onshore operations. Currently non-Chinese groups are limited to 49 per cent stakes in joint ventures in the fast-growing market. \nHSBC's 51 percent control of HSBC Qianhai Securities is unique because it was able to use its long-established Hong Kong unit to take advantage of a rule favoring banks based in the city. \nMany international banks are keen to launch new Chinese ventures with majority control or to boost their stakes in existing partnerships to help integrate those operations with their global networks and to better manage reputational risk, bankers have said. \nBut it will be some years before things fall into place for foreign majority-owned ventures to kick off, according to HSBC's CEO. \n\"The regulations will come in two years time. Then you have to pick your partner and you've got to hire people - we think we've got a three-year head start,\" Gulliver told a media briefing at the launch of its securities joint venture in Shenzhen. \nThe joint venture, with Qianhai Financial Holding Company, an investment unit controlled by local government, is part of the UK-headquartered bank's \"pivot to Asia\" - a strategy launched in 2015 that aimed to capitalize on its strong links in the region and the closeness of China's Cantonese-speaking Pearl River Delta region to HSBC's Hong Kong stronghold. \nThe venture's license allows HSBC to underwrite bond and equity sales in the mainland and to act as a broker for shares listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen. It can also publish research on Chinese companies to local clients. So far, almost 100 staff have been hired, with investment bankers making up the biggest group. \nAsia accounted for 70 percent of HSBC's adjusted pre-tax profit in the first nine months of this year. Gulliver said on Thursday he expected the Pearl River Delta business, which includes retail and commercial banking as well as the new securities business, to produce $1 billion in cumulative pre-tax profit in the next three to five years and add about $500 million a year after that. \nThe bank has about 17,400 staff in the area already, with 15,000 in data processing and software. About 2,400 are in its branches - a number he expects to double by 2020. \nGulliver is due to step down in 2018 as chief executive after seven years at the helm. He will be replaced by John Flint, who currently runs the bank's retail and wealth management division. \nThe CEO welcomed news that Ping An had become HSBC's second-largest shareholder. The Chinese insurer began buying shares in 2016 as part of its insurance investments and on Wednesday passed the 5 per cent threshold after which it had to announce its holding. \n\"We are really very happy about this,\" Gulliver said, adding that he and other senior managers met regularly with Ping An executives as they did with other large shareholders. \n(Reporting by Jennifer Hughes; Editing by

Jamestown, North Dakota. (photo: Dan Harris) \n\u201cThat\u2019s a big ass buffalo,\u201d I said, because there\u2019s not much else to say when you\u2019re standing on black ice trying not to break your neck in the middle of a frozen North Dakota winter and staring up at a giant bronze bison that exists for no particular reason. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Dan, because that\u2019s the appropriate response. \n\u201cWell\u2026I\u2019m ready.\u201d \nThe photos were snapped, and away we went. The buffalo had done its job. It made us stop in the middle of nowhere, the way a thousand roadside attractions across the nation used to encourage a million drivers to pull over and linger, just long enough to drum up a bit of business in a place where business was certainly not booming. They\u2019re relics, these roadside attractions. Strange museums. Odd statues. Giant balls of yarn. Curiosities of a time when road travel itself was still a curiosity. Some of the lucky ones, like our friend the giant buffalo, sit on the Interstate system, which turned drivers off the old highways with their efficiency, and whose speed limits discouraged stopping. \nThe Interstate is a dull country. Quick marts and gas stations, chain fast food joints, billboards reminding you to shop here and find Jesus. Not necessarily in that order. But there are breaks in the beige fabric of those red line highways. You just have to keep your eyes out for them. * * * Dan Harris. Writer, editor, Levittown escapee. \nI\u2019ve gone coast to coast on the U.S. highway system many times, but I\u2019ve usually done it alone. This trip was a means of escape. Not for myself, but for my friend Dan Harris, a former schoolmate of mine who was fleeing America\u2019s first planned suburb (and his hometown) for the wild strangeness of Seattle. He\u2019d expressed some reservations about doing a drive that far, and I\u2019d asked if he wanted a co-driver. \n\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who would fly across the country just to drive across the country at the drop of a hat,\u201d he said. \nWe left Levittown on a Saturday, both to get past the traffic from the next day\u2019s New York City marathon, and because Levittown, the archetype of mass-produced suburbs in the U.S.A., is an insidiously unnerving place. Like the best horror movie settings, there\u2019s nothing obviously wrong with it. And yet, everything feels off. You can feel the life draining out of your shoes. My second day there I was struck with one of the worst headaches I ever had. By the third day, when we skipped town earlier than expected, my neck muscles had turned to stone. \nWith the blessing of, and a box of Italian pastries from, Dan\u2019s incredibly kind mother, we rolled across the Cross-Bronx Expressway and holed up for the night in Paterson, New Jersey, a former milltown whose gorgeous waterfall inspired the work of William Carlos Williams. Paterson Great Falls, an unexpected New Jersey gem. \nPaterson is a town rough around the edges, but gleaming underneath. It\u2019s one of the America\u2019s most diverse cities, containing some of the largest concentrations of Peruvian and Dominican immigrants in the country, as well as a Turkish population large enough to give the city its own \u201cLittle Istanbul.\u201d It holds the second largest Muslim population, by percentage, in the U.S. (after Dearborn, Michigan). And it holds a place in the imagination of America\u2019s writers, having served as a homebase and setting in the works of William Carlos Williams, Nelson Algren, and Junot Diaz. \nIt\u2019s my kind of town. \nDan and I settled into a hotel for the night and started out in the morning for another town that\u2019s been hit by hard times in the past few decades: Pittsburgh. But unlike Paterson, Pittsburgh has begun to thrive on the back of influx of new arrivals, young entrepreneurs, and tech money. But that\u2019s another story all its own. What makes a city like Pittsburgh rebound is a story by itself, as is what makes Paterson an immigrant destination, as well as the factors that keep it a safe one. But on a massive, week-long road trip, you only get glimpses of these things. A hint at the deeper waters you\u2019re skipping across. * * * On approach to Chicago. \nI still think of Chicago as home. Or one of my homes, anyway. It remains, for me, the most quintessential American city. Unlike the grand ports of the coast, Chicago opens only onto the heartland itself. Follow the Great Lakes, and you get to the cities of the northeast. Follow the river, and you wind up spilling past New Orleans and into the Gulf of Mexico. Follow the railroads that made its reputation, and you wind up at the front door of the Pacific. \nBut it\u2019s still a gateway to America for so many communities. Lithuanian. Polish. Turkish. Russian. Mexican. Jews and Muslims and Catholics. Small Buddhist temples tucked away on residential streets. I came to town and had dinner with a friend whose family came from Holland and breakfast with a friend whose family came from India. Like a lot of my favorite places, Chicago is a crossroads and a trading post. A port that opens its arms to the world. Dan Harris and Tim Cook get down with some ice cream at Margie\u2019s Candies. \nBut first and foremost, for me, this is a town where my community lives. Ten years after leaving the city, it still feels like home. Still welcomes me back every time. There\u2019s a stability here. A continuity. Chicago may be a port where the world rolls in, but it\u2019s also got a deeply entrenched work ethic. People come to Chicago to learn things, to get good at something. And sometimes they take that work and move on to the next town, and sometimes they dig in and make the city bloom. \nMy friend Tim Cook was born here, and continues to teach school while cranking out his own poetry, teaching many of the same courses he took himself when he was coming up as a fourth generation Chicagoan. Zeeshan Shah came here and studied as a chef, and now runs his own restaurant at the north side bar The Long Room, knocking out big breakfasts under the name of The Biscuit Man. Zeeshan Shah thinks you should try his fried chicken biscuit. \nI\u2019ve lived in two cities as an adult that truly felt like home: Chicago and New Orleans. But the differences in feel are profound. My Chicago community feels rooted. The vast majority haven\u2019t gone anywhere, and coming back still feels as solid as it did a decade ago. \nLast November, I left New Orleans after a nine year run, and I still don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to feel like going forward. Will it still feel as stable for a me a decade from now as Chicago does today? Or is it a more malleable town? A place whose shifts are so dramatic it\u2019s easy to feel like once you\u2019re gone, you\u2019re gone forever? \nIn Minneapolis, I ran into two friends who also recently left the city: Ali Arnold and Greg Good. Ali and Greg in their Minneapolis home. \nIt\u2019s always a shock to see people you know from one city in a brand new space. Greg and Ali are still new to Minneapolis. There\u2019s a certain familiarity for Greg, who grew up in South Dakota. But for Ali, who grew up in the south and had spent nearly 20 years in the New Orleans, I wondered how the transition to the north would take. \nIt\u2019s been an adjustment, but perhaps the strangest adjustment has been to being in a city that\u2019s high functioning. New Orleans is still, to me, the most exciting city in the U.S. But things get challenging when the institutions you depend on are suddenly needed. Decades of corruption and ineffectiveness have bred a culture where people depend on each other, but generally expect the city to do nothing at best, or make things much more difficult at worst. \nMinneapolis may not be perfect, but the contrast is pretty stark. Streets get swept. Roads get repaired. Things get done, for the most part, on time. When a wheel fell off one of their trash cans early on, a worker from the sanitation department was out to repair it the following day, while Ali stared out the window, slack-jawed. \n\u201cMove your car before 7 a.m.\u201d said Greg, referring to the next day\u2019s planned street sweeping. \u201cThey take it seriously.\u201d \n\u201cHuh,\u201d I said. * * * I feel like Sir Mix-a-Lot should know about this. \nFrom Minneapolis, it was time to start booming for the coast. The old industrial heart of America was behind us and now it was on to prairie fever. The route across North Dakota and Montana doesn\u2019t beg for postcards. The roads are as flat as the scenery, and the 80 mile an hour speed limit seems determined to rush you across to the next break in the landscape. Only the occasional roadside attraction can break up the monotony. \nTwo of my favorites: The Berkeley Pit Mine, and the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum. \nI am very sad the Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum was closed the day I rolled in, because it\u2019s a doozy. A creationist-themed \u201cmuseum,\u201d the GD&FM maintains that the earth is no older than 6000 years, that dinosaurs rode the ark with Noah (or at least, lizards with the genetic makeup to become dinosaurs), that humans lived inland while dinosaurs were coastal, and that animals and humans used to live ten times longer due to surplus oxygen in the atmosphere. \nIt also counts as its donors Greg Gianforte, the Montana congressman who bodyslammed a reporter for the Guardian . \nI\u2019m particularly taken with this type of insanity, because it manages to take a deranged view even farther than I thought possible. Many creationists have argued that dinosaurs never existed, and that their bones were merely planted there by God to test our faith (meaning God is either a cosmic golden retriever who just likes burying bones, or that he\u2019s gaslighting us\u2013I don\u2019t know which is worse). \nBut to keep a straight face while you tell people that dinosaurs were on the boat with Noah? That takes some chutzpah. The remnants of the Berkeley Pit Mine, possibly the most polluted spot in the U.S. \nI\u2019m sad to report that I had no better luck with the Berkeley Pit, a former copper bonanza that is slowly, unavoidably, filling with toxic water on the edge of Butte, Montana. This is the horrifying remnant of a deplorable bit of engineering by the Anaconda Mining Company, who somehow managed to make an environmental disaster into an even bigger environmental disaster by leaving. \nThe pit mine, which was shut down in 1982 over environmental concerns, has been slowly filling with groundwater which leeches chemicals out of the rock and turns them into a toxic, acidic cocktail. On at least two occasions, large flocks of geese have died from landing in the pit water to rest. Without massive environmental action, the acidic water will eventually fill to a point where it can poison the groundwater at the head of the Clark Fork River. Without the water being pumped out, this could happen sometime in the next decade. \nAnd you know what that means? It means gift shop. \nThe former mine now has a gift shop and an observation deck. For just two dollars, you can go out and see this monstrosity for yourself. I tried, but as with the creationist museum, I was thwarted. \nI did see two guys butchering a deer on the sidewalk outside a market, though. So, that was something. * * * This troll lives under the Fremont Bridge in Seattle. Note the VW Bug in its hand. \nFew cities have as wonderful an approach to them as Seattle. Everything is thick forest and canyon walls right up until the last second, when it reveals itself like an emerald set against a gleaming sky. Assuming you can see it, of course. \nIt wasn\u2019t easy to see when we came in. Seattle\u2019s notorious winter rain kept it shrouded for most of my visit. But up close, the city reveals itself. In spite of the billions of dollars pouring into it as the tech industry booms\u2013just like logging and aeronautics before it\u2013it\u2019s a city whose heart is still a bit wild, and whose hair is permanently unkempt. \nYou can see some of the strangeness on display in the Fremont neighborhood, where a giant troll keeps watch under the bridge, and a huge statue of Lenin, purchased by a local as the USSR was collapsing, stares out disapprovingly over the neighborhood. \nBut for Dan, the end of the line was south of town, where he\u2019d be moving in with his girlfriend. Seven days of travel. 3,000 miles. And for the first time in his life, he\u2019d be living far from his hometown, in a place that couldn\u2019t possibly feel more different. \n\u201cHey Dan,\u201d I said. \u201cYou live here now.\u201d \n\u201cYeah I do.\u201d \nA new life on the strange end of a strange nation. An immigrant in a wild new place. There\u2019s nothing that speaks more to the spirit of the country than that. End of the line.

Earlier there was no issue with my handset but 2-3 days back I noticed that my mobile's battery is going \"fatter\" and more \"fatter\" day by day. So, I decided to visit one of the MI's service centers at \"I Pick Solutions India Pvt. Ltd.\" - Rohini, New Delhi which is quite near to my location. So, When I reached there and asked for its solution to fix this issue they said that I would need to pay INR 1180 to change the battery. So, I said that it has only been 4 months operating this mobile how could you ask for any charge. Then, they said that if you get it repaired here then you would have to pay that much. My mobile is under warranty as of now and the service center executive is asking to pay for a new battery.\nI would request you to please take some appropriate actions against the service center as i mentioned above.\nThanks!\nDeepak", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:07:00.014+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3afca1b8fb666653ee81b7c11099b8770452a440", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W7qt.n06nd9N0orPwVYzfxnL51sovdUkMwPWuhn7E1iCqU6H.OYGFOmXXZbAAIUAfqlqNSgtNeqnrg.uj0exaI6LpYfRxJS5XQ--", "site_full": "www.reddit.com", "site": "reddit.com", "site_section": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/", "site_categories": ["media", "adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "Ask Reddit...", "title": "You time travel 30 years into the future, what's the first thing you Google?", "title_full": "You time travel 30 years into the future, what's the first thing you Google? : AskReddit", "published": "2017-12-06T13:12:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 197, "participants_count": 189, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.023, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 33, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f5183c2be168f9f831f327d844b6317e791f51cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2F8au4ugZad_J4qnGXapSDnB.slOz8p9HlaakxtI3W7qt.n06nd9N0orPwVYzfxnL51sovdUkMwPWuhn7E1iCqU6H.OYGFOmXXZbAAIUAfqlqNSgtNeqnrg.uj0exaI7viZv4b8iP6NInJEn5FaaYeuwIUj3WZGM-", "ord_in_thread": 193, "author": "GeorgeousWall", "published": "2017-12-07T10:27:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "Yeah no shit, idiot.

Risk tolerance is a guide for choosing an asset allocation \u2013 the proportions of money invested in different assets that give your portfolio a risk level you\u2019re comfortable with and expected returns to reach your target. First off, what is risk tolerance? Risk tolerance is the amount of variability when it comes to your investment returns that you as an investor can withstand. It is one of the many important concepts in investing. When it comes to risk tolerance, it is important that you set a realistic gauge that you can tolerate. Determining Risk Tolerance Risk tolerance is a subject matter that is often discussed but rarely defined. It is not unusual to read a trade recommendation discussing alternatives or options based on different risk tolerances. But how does an individual investor determine his or her risk tolerance? How can understanding this concept help investors in diversifying their portfolios? Time Frame An often seen clich\u00e9 is that of what we\u2019ll refer to as \u201cage-based\u201d risk tolerance. It is conventional wisdom that a younger investor has a long-term time horizon in terms of the need for investments and can take more risk. Following this logic, an older individual has a short investment horizon, especially once that individual is retired, and would have low-risk tolerance. While this may be generally true, there are certainly a number of other considerations that come into play. First, you need to consider investment. When will funds be needed? If the time horizon is relatively short, risk tolerance should shift to be more conservative. For long-term investments, there is room for more aggressive investing. However, be careful about carelessly following conventional wisdom. See Also: Short-Term vs. Long Term Investment: The Difference Risk Capitals Net worth and available risk capital should be important considerations when determining risk tolerance. Net worth is simply your assets minus your liabilities. Risk capital is money available to invest or trade that will not affect your lifestyle if lost. It should be defined as liquid capital or capital that can easily be converted into cash. Therefore, an investor or trader with a high net worth can assume more risk. The smaller the percentage of your overall net worth the investment or trade makes up, the more aggressive the risk tolerance can be. Investment Objectives Your investment objectives must also be considered when calculating how much risk can be assumed. If you are saving for a child\u2019s college education or your retirement , how much risk do you really want to take with those funds? On the other hand, you can take more risk if you are using true risk capital or disposable income to try to earn extra income. See Also: How to Increase Retirement Income? Investment Experience When it comes to determining your risk tolerance, your level of investing experience must also be considered. Are you new to investing and trading? Have you been doing this for some time, but are branching into a new area, like selling options? It is wise to begin new ventures with some degree of caution, and trading or investing is no different. Get some experience under your belt before committing too much capital. Conclusion When determining the answer to a seemingly simple question, \u201cWhat is my risk tolerance?\u201d The answer will vary based on your age, experience, net worth, risk capital and the actual investment or trade being considered. Once you have thought this through, you will be able to apply this knowledge to a balanced and diversified program of investing and trading. Spreading your risk around, even if it is all high risk, decreases your overall exposure to any single investment or trade. With appropriate diversification, the probability of total loss is greatly reduced. This comes back to preservation of capital. Knowing your risk tolerance goes far beyond being able to sleep at night or stressing over your trades. It is a complex process of analyzing your personal financial situation and balancing it against your goals and objectives. Finally, knowing your risk tolerance, and keeping to investments that fit within it, should keep you from complete financial ruin.

However, Israel has a presence at the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, as it is one of the 180 member states of IRENA whose headquarters are based in Abu Dhabi. \nTrump announced Wednesday his official recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and instructed moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a move that triggered wide criticism and concerns around the world. \nTrump said in a televised speech that his decision is based on The Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, a public law of the United States passed by the 104th Congress on October 23, 1995.

However, the downside of living in this hyper-connected society means that people are also extremely vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Harish Chib, Vice President -Middle East & Africa at Sophos discusses how malware is being weaved into this everyday technology, and how, year on year, we are seeing cybercriminals become more intelligent in their attacks, making it increasingly important for consumers to be wary of the dangers out there. Harish Chib, Vice President -Middle East & Africa at Sophos \nRansomware is on every platform \u2013 don\u2019t assume your mobile and tablets are safe \nThis year, WannaCry shook the world as the cyber hi-jack accounted for more than 45% of all ransomware tracked, closely followed by Cerber at 44.2%, according to Sophos\u2019 most recent Malware Report. \nIn September alone, 30.4 percent of malicious Android malware processed by SophosLabs was ransomware. Sophos expects this to jump to approximately 45 percent in October. The majority of these attacks have targeted Windows users, but the number of attacks on other platforms is increasing, including those targeting Android, Macs and Linux. \nRansomware attacks have shifted in focus in the past two years, towards industries which are most likely to pay up, such as healthcare, government, critical infrastructure, and small businesses. Due to it being one of the most lucrative industries from ransomware payments or selling medical records, Healthcare has been a big target in 2017 and will without a doubt continue that way into 2018. \nMalware is hiding in Android Apps \nWhen reviewing Google Play, Sophos found that the number of different threats had doubled since last year. One type of malware, dubbed \u2018GhostClicker\u2019, sat in Google Play for almost a year, disguising itself as part of the service library. It then request device administration permission, and actively simulated click-on advertisements as it delivered to earn revenue. \nOne of the more sobering finds was Lipizzan, spyware that infected up to 100 devices. Although this doesn\u2019t sound like a large number, it seems this was a targeted, precision malware, which was designed to monitor phone activity and extracting data from popular apps including email, SMS, location, and voice calls, and media. \nMalware such as this is showing no sign of reducing in the future, as cyber criminals know it works. Therefore, in order to combat being a victim of Android malware, Sophos would suggest consumers: Stick to Google Play \u2013 Although it isn\u2019t perfect, it puts plenty of effort into preventing malware arriving in the first place Avoid apps with a low reputation \u2013 Be especially wary of this when using a work phone Patch early, patch often \u2013 Check the vendors attitude to updates \nOnline gaming is being used to spread Ransomware and Malware \nIn terms of online gaming, fake copies of the popular game, \u2018King of Glory\u2019 were used to spread ransomware this year. The warning screen used mimicked the one used during the WannaCry outbreak, directing individual to pay the ransom through the China-based Wechat, Alipay and QQ payment methods. \nThe number of malicious apps has risen steadily in the last four years, peaking at nearly 3.5 million in 2017, therefore we are likely to see this rise further in 2018, including more deceptive online gaming traps. \nData breaches\u2013 they are not going away \nThe downside of living in this hyper-connected society means that people are extremely vulnerable to cyber-attacks, as shown in the past few weeks with the Uber Hack , which affected 2.7 million riders and drivers.

Nor was it something I ever thought I'd have to justify to other people or explain why I did what I did. James wasn't keen on having another dog; he wasn't exactly chuffed when he realised I had Custard when we first got together but luckily, the two of them are now inseparable and they love each other very much. We always joke that Custard is in fact James' dog and I'm just a third wheel within their crazy loved-up relationship. For reasons that will become obvious by the end of this post, I now feel able to talk about Vespa's story and how he came to be living with us and is now officially, part of the family. I met Vespa at my old job; the one I left earlier this year where I was a dog handler. I wasn't originally based with the Yorkshire Terrier's but after landing myself a permanent position, I was put with them to develop my skills further and learn about a different breed. Yorkie's are infamous for being quite tricky, especially to train and gain trust in. I was working in a research centre and before anyone goes off on one about the word 'research', it wasn't animals rigged up to machines or testing medicines or cosmetics. The dogs and cats were literally just testing out new pet foods and they lived within a kennel environment. We were allocated dogs for consistency, to help build a bond with them and we were responsible for their day to day care. I was given two dogs within my first week and Vespa was one of them. From the moment I met Vespa I knew he was going to be hard work. Very suspicious, fussy with food, lacking confidence and he had never learnt how to play. He never learnt how to interact with other dogs properly; he was confused, vulnerable and never 100% relaxed. I worked hard on building his confidence and his trust in me as his handler. I bought brand new toys into work to try and encourage him to play and have down time when he wasn't 'working' and I tried hundreds of different games with treats to try and stimulate his mind. I spent a lot of my own money bringing in new games and toys, all of which had to pass a test to make sure they were safe to use and each time, we failed at having fun with them. I put his name forward countless times for homing (basically if an animal didn't cope in the environment they could be homed) and each time I was told his case wasn't really bad enough. Months and months went by and despite my best efforts not to, I fell in love with him. We were always encouraged to not bond 'too' much with the dogs because after all, they weren't ours and could be reallocated at any time. My relationship with Vespa was never broken up and I was permitted to keep him each time a new allocation came around due to his reaction to a different routine with a new handler. We got on really well together and he built up a trust in me, a truly wonderful feeling when an animal feels they're safe with you. Then back in July 2016, I injured my hand which resulted in me having to have 3 months off work. This was obviously short notice and Vespa was given another handler temporarily until I returned. I worried about him endlessly but looked forward to seeing him again and continuing our work, knowing full well we'd probably have to go back a few squares due to his suspicious nature. When I finally returned to work, the little dog I had worked so hard to build up was gone and in his place was a more nervous, on edge, terrified version of the animal I had grown to know. I immediately took things back to square one and whilst he recognised me and understood who I was, he just wasn't the same so I took things slow and literally lay on the floor so he was able to sniff at will and get closer if he wanted to. By the end of the first half hour, he was laying by my side and I didn't want to move. I wanted to stay there for hours comforting him and promising that I could somehow make him happier. Then the bullying started. I say started, it increased as this 'lady' had already taken a dislike to me way before any of this with Vespa and she just so happened to be my senior who thought she was the queen of dog behaviour. She got repositioned onto my unit where I worked and it didn't take her long to notice Vespa's ways and blame me for the way he was. Anyway she could get me into trouble, she'd do it. I ended up having to be watched when training him, watched when interacting with him in anyway and I was forbidden to cuddle him anymore, to love him or enter his pen without a valid enough reason. I remember being told off just for entering his pen to say hello to him. It confused him too. My anxiety went through the roof and I became very ill and nobody believed just how bad things had got between me and this other lady. Some even found it funny that she hated me so much for no apparent reason. All I was told by my manager was confront her about it but as anyone with anxiety will know, this is literally impossible. I started to resent my manager for not having my back, almost blaming me too and making me feel incapable of dealing with a workplace bully and I was so frustrated that the lady in question had been reported for bullying many times and nothing had been done. With the last bit of fight I had left in me, I put Vespa forward again for homing. This time it was taken seriously, but again I was told off for not flagging his situation sooner. I was furious. Not flagging sooner? I could count 4 times over 3 years that I had asked them to reconsider and was told he wasn't bad enough. Mortified, embarrassed and clutching onto any hope I had of changing this dog's life, I went home sobbing to James, crying for hours and hours feeling heartbroken. He knew full well of course who Vespa was and how much I cared for him, what his story was, the bullying and where we currently stood. Luckily, he understood what we had to do; we had to get him a home. I was prepared to get him a home with anyone, providing it was the right one. Being his handler meant I had some say in whether or not I felt the home was right when my workplace had found one, but Vespa's nature and the relationship we had and how much I had grown to know and understand what he really needed, made it clearer and clearer that his true home, was with us. What made getting Vespa home so tough was the lady who was bullying me stood very firmly in between doing just that. She even put a huge programme forward for him meaning he had to be isolated and couldn't have any contact with any other dogs. I could go into his pen if I needed to do something with him like take him for a walk, groom him, health check or administer any medications he may have needed but nothing else. Some of the things she said to me were... 'you're no good for that dog' 'you've ruined him' 'I have never been more disappointed in anyone before you' 'he's a broken dog and it's your fault' 'he's bitten people and isn't safe' I did the only thing I felt I could - prove her wrong. I wrote a huge essay to the head of homing regarding my history with Vespa and why I felt the right home for him was with me and my family. I had to have an interview and explain I knew exactly what to do should a behavioural problem occur, since I already had Custard at home and there was no knowing whether the two dogs would get on. Custard I wasn't worried about, we've yet to find a dog she doesn't love but Vespa is totally the opposite and doesn't mix well. I had virtually the whole of December off last year and the first week of December consisted of me waiting anxiously on a phone call telling me whether I had won his case or not. And I did, I was able to home my little boy and give him a brand new life. Collecting him was bizarre and he was absolutely petrified. Everything he had ever known was changing and the poor little man didn't have a clue what was going on. Upon arriving back at Flat 4, I bought Custard outside to say hello whilst my Mum waited in the garden with him. I didn't want them meeting indoors because it was Custard's house and I had to consider how that might make her feel. But it was utter chaos. He barked non stop for ages and Custard didn't know what to do with herself. She kept looking at me then looking at him like 'what's his problem Mum?' and for a couple of weeks I barely left them alone together. Of course after the first day or so he mellowed down a bit, but he was still unsure of his new surroundings which I honestly couldn't blame him for but it was very unnerving as you wonder how long will it take for things to settle? Leaving the flat was hard for me and I had to separate them just in case anything happened whilst I wasn't there and one day I came home to find a note taped to my door from a neighbour saying he'd been barking non stop since I'd left. Vespa's first day at home The good news was that Vespa was home in time for Christmas. He got his own Christmas jumper and on Christmas day fell in the pond at my in-laws house (wearing the jumper I might add) which was bloody funny but it didn't seem to phase him too much. He had lots of nice treats and presents, met new family members which for him was a big deal and things started to improve. He was getting along with Custard, his confidence was visibly growing and before long the doubt I had in my mind disappeared. The reason I haven't disclosed Vespa's history before is until recently, he wasn't officially ours. He had problems with his legs that my old work place were paying for, so we were technically a foster family but he's now signed over and is an official member of the Woolley family. Sometimes I look into his eyes and I can still see the same little dog I met nearly four years ago and every moment we have spent together flashes by like those cringy bits in films. He's wound me up countless times, especially when it comes to peeing up the coffee table and don't even get me started on when I need to trim his nails. Family members fell out with me when I said I was bringing home a dog with behaviour issues, after all getting a dog is a very big thing and usually when someone looks for a dog they don't want one that has issues. I got told I was making a huge mistake and had pretty much no support from anyone around me but James. Luckily it didn't take long before my Mum understood why I did it but even on the way to collect him, I remember pleading with her to just trust me as she asked yet again whether I knew what I was doing. I knew he belonged with us. Had I lost my mind completely or was there method in my madness? I didn't care what they thought back then, I had to help him. Even now, family and friends comment on how much he's changed from the dog I bought home that day who seemed like nothing but a burden. A whole year later and this is where we're at. He's still not 100% confident with everything but then again there is something all dogs don't like. Custard for example isn't a fan of clattering cutlery but all you can do is try to help them become more comfortable. He's learnt to play, his manners are adorable, he loves cuddles and no, he's never bitten us and he's never bitten me in our whole time together. Custard really took Vespa under her wing and I don't think he'd have come so far without her teachings. You can see him watching her, assessing how she behaves and he will copy. It's a good job Custard is a positive role model and doesn't behave like an idiot because the last thing Vespa needed was to go even further backwards. She's been a real support to him and I don't believe he'd have come so far so fast without her by his side. We'd mentioned a couple of times before Vespa came home that Custard would really appreciate a friend yet we couldn't justify getting another dog. Funny how things turn out isn't it! Vespa has now got a family and I know I did the right thing by him the entire time.

He's been at home with us a whole year today and I'm very happy to be able to call him our dog.

have signed Tongan international Siliva Havili as they look to fix a hooking crisis.\nHavili has joined the Raiders on a one-year deal for the 2018 season as coach Ricky Stuart looks to fill the void left by starting rake Josh Hodgson.\nHodgson ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in England's World Cup campaign and Adam Clydsdale stunned the club when he announced his retirement aged just 24.\nTo make things tougher, the Raiders have been trying to offload Kurt Baptiste in a move that would make the club salary cap compliant.\nBut Havili's signing goes a long way to removing some of the headaches as he prepares to battle with Craig Garvey for the starting hooker role.\nRaiders recruitment manager Peter Mulholland says Havili adds much-needed depth to the Green Machine's hooking stocks as pre-season ramps up.\n\"Siliva had a wonderful World Cup tournament for Tonga and he joins the squad to give us some depth to cover the unfortunate loss of Josh Hodgson,\" Mulholland said.\n\"We're looking forward to him joining the squad and having a solid pre-season with his new club.\"\nThe 24-year-old played a role in Tonga's surge to the World Cup semi-final, having spent time with the New Zealand Warriors and St George Illawarra across 24 NRL appearances.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons":

I will now start referring to him as a she. She was so eloquent with her words and knew just the right things to say and she preyed on my sexuality and ego with a very subtle professional flirting way about her.What got me was the length of time (weeks) setting this up.It all started on LinkedIn with an interest in my business model and then grew rapidly from there. Here are some videos and correspondence between us. I AM SUCH A SUCKER!!!This is when it became blatantly obvious what was going on SO SO DUMB!!! Hello My dear, Thanks for your kind response and as a matter of fact, I am very happy to read your mail, I am Sgt Sherri Jo Gallagher, However, I really want to establish a true relationship that may lead into a business partner or something else. Certainly, This is to bring to your notice, here in the military zone we are not allow to make use of mobile phone, we only make use of radio message and email communication, Now, i have fully made up my mind to go into business partnership with you, as i don't know how long we are to remain in the war zone.My dear, i want you to know that we are being attacked by insurgents everyday and car bombs, During one of our rescue mission in Libya Northern Africa we came across a safe box that contain huge amount of money that belongs to the revolutionaries, which I believe they use it in buying weapons and ammunition, and it was agreed by all parties in present that the money will be shared among us. Out of the total fund my share was $3,560,000 (Three Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand united states Dollars) I am seeking your assistance to evacuate my share of the money, which is $3,560,000, as much as you can assure me that the consignment will be safe in your care until I complete my service here, This is not stolen money, and there are no dangers involved. My dear, I have made solid arrangements with a SECURITY COMPANY who promised to deliver the fund to any of my choosing destination, I shall be compensating you with 20% of the total fund on final conclusion of this project, while the rest balance shall be my investment capital in your country, One passionate appeal I will make to you not to discuss this matter to a third party, if you have reasons to reject this offer, please destroy this e-mail to avoid any leakage of this information and it will be dangerous to me based on my position. I have chosen to contact you after my prayers and I believe that you will not betray my trust nor thwart my dream,Though you may wonder why I am so soon revealing myself to you without formal introduction, well, I will say that my mind convinced me that you are the true person to help me receive and invest the fund. Note, I do not know how long we are going to remain here and my fate since I have survived two bomb attack here, which prompted me to search out for a reliable and trust worthy person to help me receive and invest the fund in his country, because I will be migrating to your home to invest and start a new life not as a soldier anymore. Conclusively,i wish you could send me a reply immediately in regards to this proposal,Your urgent reply will be highly appreciated. I hope my explanation is very clear but if you need further clarification,Wait to hear from you soon.Best regard.Sgt Sherri.
