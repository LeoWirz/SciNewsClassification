With this in mind, it's important to understand how Long Island SEO can be used for this particular benefit. Can the shows in question use search engines so that they can gain further visibility? This is entirely possible, provided you follow these 3 tips. Before long, you'll see just how much they pay off.\n\nWhen it comes to the benefits of Long Island SEO for trade shows, local results should be noted at the onset. It's important for any establishment, regardless of what it sells or offers, to show up in search engines based on geographic location. What this means is that, in addition to ranking nationally, shows should appear on local results as well. The likes of fishbat.com will agree, but this is just one of many strategies to make note of.\n\nContent creation is another part of the SEO puzzle, especially when it comes to work that trade show managers are responsible for. How can content be created for this purpose, you may wonder? It may be done by posting blogs months prior to the show, including links that are relevant to the event itself. Videos can be recorded hyping a company's presence at the show, too. The more content that's created, the more SEO value there is to gain.\n\nFinally, if you truly wish for your company to be successful at trade shows, web design should be a priority. One of the ways that this can be accomplished is by creating an entirely separate subpage dedicated to the event itself. On this page, information about topics to be covered, attendees that will appear, and the like should be displayed. SEO is an engine with many moving parts, and it's fair to say that web design is one of the most crucial.\n\nThese are just a few things to know about the relationship between trade shows and SEO. The benefits that search engine optimization provides are nothing short of invaluable, but only when the right steps are taken. Fortunately, these will go a long way in ensuring that these shows are as successful as they can be. Not only will attendees come away more well-versed, but the companies that are present will be more likely to attend as well.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nFor additional info related to Long Island SEO and digital marketing, visit fishbat today. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "arthur williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "long island", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:08:09.030+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "370853d586b6e444537a85eec5955eadc22336c8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ5vy3q3jf4pUXuk7XA7dCZsK1oT_oIDkd6Ay60oCLGDom.6kRIXTbdrgTeyNmTRj_Zv9XyywQwID42PN7DjYVZhXtuQJg6YFNfT7qYdC_MRrPKnO5t.HfzeENnGx3hEkNTXegN6ywzrFn9HUSMDUrk", "site_full": "www.americanbankingnews.com", "site": "americanbankingnews.com", "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/AmericanBankingNews", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "American Banking News", "title": "Orbotech Ltd.

This is especially true when you bring costs into the equation, as everything from food to grooming supplies must be accounted for. Did you know, though, that there are quite a few ways that pet owners can save money? Here are some of the best financial tips that the likes of Bob Jain will be able to provide, regardless of the beloved animals that people have at home.\n\nOne of the best ways for pet owners to cut costs is by shopping online. After all, there exists a bevy of deals and coupons that can be found online that may not be available at retail. It's in your best interest to take advantage of these opportunities so that you can save money on everything your pet needs, food included. The Internet is an invaluable money-saving tool and names such as Robert Jain would be hard-pressed to disagree.\n\nWhat about the high costs associated with medical bills? These can be reduced if you make it a point to get your dog the exercise they need. For dogs, this is relatively easy, as walks can be taken during days with nice weather. Cats aren't as likely to play outside, but they can still exercise indoors with the use of balls of yarn, feather wands, and the like. The more active your pets are, the less they will cost you when it comes to medical visits and procedures.\n\nYou should also consider toys and how many your pet actually needs. While you may think that more is better, your animal friend doesn't need more than a few, especially since pets are known to gravitate toward certain ones. With this in mind, make sure that you rotate your pet's toys on a routine basis. Not only will this keep them in good condition, but you won't have to spend more on them than what's absolutely necessary.\n\nAnother way to keep costs low is by assessing the need for pet clothing. While it might be cute to dress your dog or cat up, the truth is that they aren't necessary for comfort or health reasons. For example, if you live in a relatively warm area of the world, your pet may not need the small hoodie as much as you think. Every situation is different, but you shouldn't assume that your pet needs clothes right off the bat.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nIf you'd care to discover more about finance in general, kindly contact Bob Jain ..

The UN security council is expected to meet on Friday to discuss Donald Trump\u2019s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital, a decision against which condemnation continues to mount across the Middle East and internationally. \nEight countries on the 15-member council requested the meeting, including the UK, Italy and France, amid claims from Palestine and Turkey that Trump\u2019s recognition is in breach of both international law and UN resolutions. As Palestinians prepared to protest in several major cities across the West Bank, most key US allies in the Middle East joined criticism of the move. \nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, hailed Trump\u2019s recognition as \u201chistoric\u201d and a \u201ccourageous and just decision\u201d but was alone among regional leaders in praising the move. Saudi Arabia called it \u201cunjustified and irresponsible\u201d. The US president defied overwhelming global opposition by  recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel  and directing the state department to start making arrangements to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv. \n\u201cWhile previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering,\u201d he said in a short speech at the White House on Wednesday. \u201cMy announcement today marks the beginning of a new approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.\u201d It later emerged, in a memo leaked to Reuters news agency, that the US had privately asked Israel to temper its response to the announcement. The state department document, dated 6 December, stated in talking points for diplomats at the US embassy in Tel Aviv to convey to Israeli officials: \u201cWhile I recognize that you will publicly welcome this news, I ask that you restrain your official response.\u201d  It went on: \u201cWe expect there to be resistance to this news in the Middle East and around the world. We are still judging the impact this decision will have on US facilities and personnel overseas.\u201d \nA second state department memo seen by Reuters asked European officials to argue that Trump\u2019s decision did not prejudge the \u201cfinal status\u201d issue of Jerusalem\u2019s sovereignty, which needed to be resolved in any peace agreement between Israel and Palestine. \u201cYou are in a key position to influence international reaction to this announcement and we are asking you to amplify the reality that Jerusalem is still a final status issue between Israelis and Palestinians and that the parties must resolve the dimensions of Israel\u2019s sovereignty in Jerusalem during their negotiations,\u201d it said.  \n\u201cYou know that this is a unique administration. It makes bold moves. But it is bold moves that are going to be needed if peace efforts are finally going to be successful.\u201d  Details of the memos emerged as the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, was due to travel to Jordan on Thursday for talks with King Abdullah II, who has come out strongly against the move. The United Arab Emirates and Iraq also condemned the decision. In Iraq, a prominent militia backed by Iran, Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, said Trump\u2019s decision could be a \u201clegitimate reason\u201d to attack US forces in the country. \nThe European Union and UN also voiced alarm at Trump\u2019s decision, with France rejecting the \u201cunilateral\u201d decision and appealing for calm in the region. Britain said the move would not help peace efforts and Jerusalem should ultimately be shared by Israel and a future Palestinian state. Germany said Jerusalem\u2019s status could only be resolved on the basis of a two-state solution.  \nJerusalem is home to sites holy to the Muslim, Jewish and Christian faiths. Israel deems Jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital dating to antiquity, and its status is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. Its eastern side was captured by Israel in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem for the capital of a future independent state.

With this in mind, it's important to understand how Long Island SEO can be used for this particular benefit. Can the shows in question use search engines so that they can gain further visibility? This is entirely possible, provided you follow these 3 tips. Before long, you'll see just how much they pay off.\n\nWhen it comes to the benefits of Long Island SEO for trade shows, local results should be noted at the onset. It's important for any establishment, regardless of what it sells or offers, to show up in search engines based on geographic location. What this means is that, in addition to ranking nationally, shows should appear on local results as well. The likes of fishbat.com will agree, but this is just one of many strategies to make note of.\n\nContent creation is another part of the SEO puzzle, especially when it comes to work that trade show managers are responsible for. How can content be created for this purpose, you may wonder? It may be done by posting blogs months prior to the show, including links that are relevant to the event itself. Videos can be recorded hyping a company's presence at the show, too. The more content that's created, the more SEO value there is to gain.\n\nLastly, web design should be carried out prior to the trade show that a company is meant to appear at. It's important for a company to have a subpage on its site that details its presence at the show itself, not to mention the topics that it will cover. Furthermore, specifics like times for panels should be listed as clear as day. The more information that's available on a website, the more beneficial a trade show will prove to be.\n\nThese are just a few things to know about the relationship between trade shows and SEO. The benefits that search engine optimization provides are nothing short of invaluable, but only when the right steps are taken. Fortunately, these will go a long way in ensuring that these shows are as successful as they can be. Not only will attendees come away more well-versed, but the companies that are present will be more likely to attend as well.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nFor additional information related to Long Island SEO and digital marketing, go to fishbat today..

I imagined this resort would be on par with Sandals maybe slightly lesser but honestly our room looked like something you'd see at a 20 year old Super 8. They didn't even have an alarm clock in the room. As for charging our electronic devices , we basically had to take turns because there weren't enough outlets. Some sections of the hallways had a weird stale stench. I wanted to leave on day one. The shuttle ride to Baha Mar Casino next door only made me feel worse. Knowing we would only be there 4 nights after trying to see if I could recoup some money by staying just 2 nights we just made the best of it. We stayed in the room as little as possible. The common area where the pool tables and table tennis was had only 1 TV. By contrast the gym had 3 Tvs. What sense did that make? The padding on some of the gym equipment is worn. Did I even mention the cats that roam the premise?They even come into the building sometimes to lay on the couches. That really irked me. If you are all about an aesthetically pleasing resort, don't book this place. But I must say the resort did a good job entertaining us with shows every night. The hotel staff was very cordial and gave 1st class service. The food and drinks were readily accessisible and we enjoyed the couples massage and dinner on the beach.

For me, it was a live wire plugged right into a nerve that connects to the part of me that is employed. \nThe story goes like this: In the 1940s and \u201950s, my grandmother, Fleeta, who died before I was born, worked full time as a nurse on a military base. She opted for night shifts, when the foot traffic was slower, and she spent many nights talking with her patients \u2014 veterans wounded in World War II. When she came home in the morning, she went to bed, and stayed in bed most of the day, until she went back to work the following evening. \nBecause of her schedule, she didn\u2019t see much of her two children, so the story goes, to the extent that, sometime, when my father was about 5 years old, my dad asked my grandmother if she really was his mother. \n\u201cWell of course I am!\u201d she replied. \u201cWho did you think I was?\u201d \n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, some woman who just came to sleep here,\u201d my father said. \nMy grandmother laughed at the idea that some other woman would be visiting their house, and she thought the comment was so funny she told it for years as a punch line. She never took offense to his comment, and, as far as my uncle ever saw, she didn\u2019t bemoan the fact that she held a full-time job, when most other women didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t apologize for being gone. She found humor where I could find tears. \nI fit into a category of mothers who have young children who work outside of the home. I am home more than I am gone, and my children have priority on my time. I love my kids. And I love being part of a working community.

Azerbaijan, Dec. 7 \nBy Rufiz Hafizoglu \u2013 Trend: \nTurkey should strengthen its positions in the development of research and new technologies (AR-GE), Turkish Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Ozlu said in an exclusive article written for Trend. \n\u201cThe countries supporting these spheres have always ranked first in the world,\u201d the minister said. \u201cThis trend has been observed since the 1960s.\u201d \n\"The competition in the production of technologies with low financial costs intensified by the end of the 1970s, as far as the role of technologies increased,\u201d he said. \u201cThe technologies that meet the growing demands of consumers were developing as a result of the change in consumer needs in the 1980s.\u201d \n\u201cHowever, beginning from the 1990s, the growing demand forced the world's leading countries to increase production and bring high-tech products to the world markets, which gave an impetus to the world competition,\" the minister said. \nOzlu added that important steps were taken within \u2018Vision 2023\u2019 government program to transform Turkey into a country capable of competing in research and development of new technologies. \n\"The Turkish Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology together with the country\u2019s Scientific and Technological Research Council and the Small and Medium Industry Development Organization (KOSGEB) have developed a program to support and stimulate the development of high technologies to ensure successful competition in the world market,\" the minister said. \nThe minister stressed that \"Technology Development Zones\" have been established at Turkish universities within this program. \nCurrently, 69 Technology Development Zones operate in Turkey and 55 of them do important research work in connection with the development of perspective technologies. \n\"Currently, over 40,000 specialists work in those zones,\" the minister said. \n\u201cThe incentive centers have been created to strengthen the infrastructure and develop the AR-GE sphere,\u201d he said, adding that in general, over 30,000 employees work in those centers. \nThe minister added that Turkey has always paid special attention to the development of AR-GE technologies. \n\"So, the costs of the development of AR-GE technologies increased threefold and amounted to 21 billion Turkish liras from 2004 to 2015,\" the minister said. \u201cThe cost of the development of AR-GE reaches one percent of Turkey's GDP, while the number of employees and researchers who work in this sphere, exceeds 122,000 people.\" \nOzlu added that the share of the private sector in AR-GE sphere reached 24 percent in 2004, but by 2015 this figure increased to 50 percent. \nTwo percent of a total export volume accounts for the volume of Turkey\u2019s exports of high-tech goods, which is less than in some countries with relatively low volumes of economy, but with a higher share of export of high-tech goods. \n\"Turkey must become a strong and important country supporting the development of research and new technologies,\" he said. \u201cTaking into account this fact, we have started to take measures aimed at strengthening the AR-GE sphere.\" \n---", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ozlu", "sentiment":

webinar geared towards school nurses.\nSomerville, NJ, For the last 10 years, NJ Center for Tourette Syndrome and Associated Disorders (NJCTS) has provided free webinars to parents, medical professionals and educators about living with Tourette Syndrome (TS) or educating those affected by the disorder. On January 24, 2018, NJCTS will celebrate the 10th Anniversary milestone with a special webinar geared towards school nurses titled What a Difference a School Nurse Can Make: A Tourette Syndrome Guide for School Nurses.\n\u201cSchool Nurses play an essential and invaluable role in the lives of children with Tourette Syndrome and their families,\u201d said Faith Rice, executive director of NJCTS. \u201cServing as onsite medical practitioners and mediators between school personnel and families, school nurses are in a unique position to make a lasting positive impact on their students.\u201d\nTourette Syndrome is an inherited, neurological disorder characterized by repeated involuntary movements and uncontrollable vocal sounds called tics. Tourette is much more common than most people think - generally appearing in children at age 6 or 7 in all ethnic groups and affecting both males and females. It is estimated that as many as 1 in 100 people show a partial expression of this disorder.\nThe free webinar for school nurses will take place at 7:30 ET and feature Dr. Graham Hartke, a licensed psychologist in private practice and a certified school psychologist. Dr. Hartke will provide an overview of Tourette Syndrome and associated disorders along with specific tips and strategies for school nurses, families, and educators to best help students living with Tourette Syndrome and other associated disorders including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).\nNJCTS\u2019 Wednesday Webinar series was launched in 2008 and today draws an audience from across the United States and more than 15 countries. The series has featured online seminars for parents, educators and professionals on topics of interest to the TS and associated disorders community, such as anxiety, OCD, sensory issues, bullying, school accommodations, and much more. The 100th webinar, which takes place on February 21, goes back to basics with the topic Understanding Tourette Syndrome.\nTo learn more about the webinar series, to view upcoming webinars, or browse an archive of past webinars, visit njcts.org/webinars. A professional development certificate or a certificate of attendance for attending any of these live webinars is available for a nominal fee.\nAbout NJCTS: The NJ Center for Tourette Syndrome and Associated Disorders, the nation\u2019s first Center for Excellence, is a not-for-profit organization committed to the advocacy of children and families with Tourette Syndrome and its associated disorders.
