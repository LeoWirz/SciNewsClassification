The 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Based Violence is an international campaign set between these dates to challenge violence against women and girls on a global level.\nTaking forward the globally recognised civil movement, Department of Women and Child Welfare, Chhattisgarh has organised a month long drive across the state for thorough and all inclusive training of the members and officers of the Local Complaints Committees, created as per The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition & Redressal) Act, 2013 and the members of the One Stop \u2018Sakhi\u2019 Centers established in every district of the state to provide wholesome assistance to women in distress (implemented under the One Stop Sakhi Center Scheme of 2015 by the Central Government).\nThe first session in furtherance of this was held on December 4 at the New Circuit House, Raipur which was presided over by Padmini Bhoi, Additional Director, Department of Women and Child Development, Chhattisgarh, who addressed the need and importance of\nthese institutions for advancement of gender justice and\nequality in the society.\nPallavi Pareek and Advocate Esha Shekhar from IIF, co\nPallavi Pareek and Advocate Esha Shekhar from IIF, conducted the training sessions where the participants were engaged in different exercises involving different real life scenarios to develop proper understanding of implementation of these schemes.\nUnder this particular initiative of the State Government, training sessions are scheduled to be further held in Durg, Bilaspur, Surguja and Bastar zones over the course of the month of December.\n\u201cLaws are made for a reason and when not implemented and communicated to their target beneficiaries, they lose the meaning and essence of their existence. Chhattisgarh Government\u2019s initiative of implementing the important laws such as Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013 and establishment of One-Stop centers is an important step towards ending gender based violence in the society.\u201d says Pallavi, Managing Trustee of Initiatives for Inclusion Foundation (IIF).\nAdvocate Esha Shekhar, Managing Trustee of IIF said, \u201cOne Stop Centers are mandated for the purpose of facilitating justice for distressed women and it is critical that sufficient time is invested in their member training. Before these centers extend their facilitation to the larger segment of women in the society, it is important to ensure that they are well versed with the legal, technical and behavioral elements required for this role. We appreciate and feel proud to be part of this initiative of the Department of Women and Child development. \u201c\nIt is pertinent to note that Chhattisgarh is the first and currently the only State in the country to implement and form a Sakhi Centre for one-stop aid to distressed women in all its 27 districts.

(Snake Way was 1,000,000 KM. Goku traveled it in 177 days on his way to KK's planet, and 2 days on the return trip). In terms of fictional characters, this is... very slow. More recently Dypso was said to be light speed and he was far faster than SSB Goku, who said he was only able to keep up with Dypso's movements because to move so quickly he had to travel in predictable patterns.\nSSJ1 Vegeta (whose base form was significantly strengthened by God form), couldn't lift 1000 tons (Magnetta's stated weight in the U6 tournament). Again, we have aircraft in real life that almost weigh that much. For fictional characters, this is extremely weak. . For reference there, SSJ1 Vegeta's limit is <2,000,000 pounds while Superman was lifting slightly under 12,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 pounds. For five consecutive days.\nI don't know where people get the idea that Dragonball characters are top tier, but they're pretty firmly mid tier if that.

The 48 million gallon per year MAAPW facility began using Edeniq\u2019s Pathway technology this month. \n\u201cWe are thrilled that Mid America Agri Products has joined the growing list of ethanol plants that have received EPA approval to use our company\u2019s technology to produce cellulosic ethanol,\u201d said Brian Thome, president and chief executive officer of Edeniq. \u201cEdeniq\u2019s technology remains the lowest-cost solution for producing and measuring cellulosic ethanol and we remain committed to helping our customers add value to their platforms.\u201d \nEdeniq\u2019s technology enables co-production of starch ethanol and cellulosic ethanol at existing corn ethanol production facilities. The company\u2019s Pathway technology uses enzymes that maximize conversion of corn kernel fiber into fermentable sugar with a protocol to measure the output of cellulosic ethanol production. In order for an ethanol plant to generate cellulosic renewable identification numbers (RINs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), it must first receive registration approval from the EPA for its cellulosic production. \n\u201cNot only will Edeniq\u2019s Pathway technology increase our ethanol yield with the additional production of cellulosic ethanol, Edeniq was key in helping us get the proper approvals we needed from the EPA,\u201d said Robert Barnhouse, controller with MAAPW. \u201cWe are looking forward to being a part of the next generation of biofuels production.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jim lane", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert barnhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian thome", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edeniq", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. environmental protection agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wheatland llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mid america agri products", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america agri products", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edeniq", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neb.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edeniq\u2019s pathway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:46.104+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c253d5e5120b800df1c516dcb75cdb7f622b7735", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEGiA05GNw07DLy3JByRnNUu", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sci/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sci/ - Science &amp; Math - 4chan", "title": "What fields are currently pre-eminent and what fields are going to be in the near future?", "title_full": "/sci/ - What fields are currently pre-eminent and what fields are going to be in the near future? - Science & Math - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.486, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "89ed9bdd73fef5abdb384fedcd86e6e86c843f54", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEGiA05GNw07DKHnke5sWDhzCtihCqWpQs8-", "ord_in_thread": 1, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:15:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": "There must be something?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-12-07T11:06:46.110+02:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c253d5e5120b800df1c516dcb75cdb7f622b7735", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEGiA05GNw07DLy3JByRnNUu", "site_full": "boards.4chan.org", "site": "4chan.org", "site_section": "http://boards.4chan.org/sci/", "site_categories": ["adult", "non_standard_content"], "section_title": "/sci/ - Science &amp; Math - 4chan", "title": "What fields are currently pre-eminent and what fields are going to be in the near future?", "title_full": "/sci/ - What fields are currently pre-eminent and what fields are going to be in the near future? - Science & Math - 4chan", "published": "2017-12-07T10:40:00.000+02:00", "replies_count": 5, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.486, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 903, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a4b96479a607df37bc3a72412381d7b69707c5a5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCoF5VTZjCccpVxqD8CQYo1pfguUTHYhAEGiA05GNw07DKHnke5sWDhzNzsnvY1jYn8-", "ord_in_thread": 2, "author": "Anonymous", "published": "2017-12-07T12:17:00.000+02:00", "title": "", "text": ">>9348948\nMath, now and for ever.

National Rescue Party, after their meeting in the Senate headquarters in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

(AP Photo/Heng Sinith, File) A lawyer for Cambodia's military filed a lawsuit against former opposition leader Sam Rainsy on Thursday, a day after the prime minister said he should be charged with treason over a social media post. Lawyer Vong Pheakdey said the complaint filed Phnom Penh Municipal Court accuses Sam Rainsy of inciting the military to not follow orders, insulting military leaders and causing depression of the armed forces. He urged the court to \"strongly punish\" Sam Rainsy. \nIn a Facebook post on Tuesday, Sam Rainsy called on soldiers not to obey any \"dictators\" if they are ordered to shoot innocent people. He also mentioned that Egypt's former leader was thrown from power by the armed forces. Prime Minister Hun Sen , who has ruled for more than 30 years, took issue with the post and said his former political foe should be charged with treason. The move comes amid an intense push by Hun Sen's government to neutralize political opponents and silence critics ahead of an election next year, often through the country's pliant courts. A court last month ordered Sam Rainsy's former party, the country's only legitimate opposition, to be dissolved on the grounds that it was plotting to overthrow the government. Sam Rainsy has been in self-imposed exile since late 2015 to avoid a deferred two-year prison sentence for criminal defamation. He has been the target of several lawsuits by Hun Sen and his ruling party. Kem Sokha who took over the opposition party earlier of this year is now detained on treason charges and awaiting trial. The government has also intensified restrictions on civil society groups and independent media outlets. The campaign, which means Hun Sen will face no serious challengers in next year's vote, has prompted international condemnation. The U.S. announced Wednesday it will restrict visas for Cambodians \"undermining democracy.\" The State Department said it was a direct response to \"anti-democratic actions\" by the Cambodian government but did not disclose which individuals would be affected.

Forum News Service. \nGRAND FORKS \u2014 For just the second time in a decade, the University of North Dakota will not have a player at the World Junior Championship\u2014and that came as a surprise to head coach Brad Berry. \nBerry thought that freshman forward Grant Mismash, who is tied for the team lead in scoring with 14 points in 17 games, would make the U.S. roster after a strong start to the season. \nBut Mismash was not one of the 28 players announced on the preliminary squad by USA Hockey on Tuesday afternoon, Dec. 5. \n\"I was extremely surprised and very disappointed,\" Berry said. \"We talk about that you can control three things in your life. That's your work ethic, your attitude and the choices you make every day. And he's done a great job of doing that. Our message to him\u2014and his message back\u2014was: 'All right, no big deal. Let's keep moving forward here. Let's worry about our close family here at hand at North Dakota.' \n\"Again, I'm disappointed, but it is what it is. You can't do anything about it, but control the things in your life that you can control.\" \nMismash is still eligible for the under-20 team next year. \nThe 6-foot, 185-pound forward and second-round draft pick of the Nashville Predators has shown a lot of versatility and skill early in his freshman season. He has the ability to play both wing and center. He has the ability to play both a physical, grinding style as well as a highly dynamic game. \n\"I think it's everything that we could imagine that he could bring to us with the categories he leads us on the team as a young guy,\" Berry said. \"I think a lot of guys know that he plays through a lot of different things the way he plays the game. He's brought a lot to our group as a young guy. \n\"We don't get caught up on things other than what's currently going on in our family, and that's winning games with our North Dakota group.\" \nMismash has been the National Collegiate Hockey Conference's rookie of the week four times already this season. \nIronically, the U.S. World Junior team is coached by St. Cloud State's Bob Motzko, who will be on the opposite bench this weekend (7:37 p.m. Friday, Dec. 8, 7:07 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 9, St. Cloud's National Hockey Center). \nWorld Junior roster decisions are made largely by USA Hockey's executives and scouts with input from the head coach. \nMinnesota Duluth has five players on the preliminary roster\u2014forwards Joey Anderson and Riley Tufte and defensemen Mikey Anderson, Dylan Samberg and Scott Perunovich. \nOther NCHC players include Western Michigan's Hugh McGing and St. Cloud State's Ryan Poehling. \nIf there's a bright spot, it is that Mismash should be fresh and ready to play UND's series against Omaha on Jan. 5-6. He may have risked missing that series had he been at the World Juniors, which will be held in Buffalo, N.Y., beginning on Dec. 26. Olson back for UND \nUND senior forward Trevor Olson, who returned to practice last week, is expected to be back in the lineup for this weekend's series at St. Cloud State. \nOlson has missed the last 10 games due to an upper-body injury sustained Oct. 28 at Colorado College. Olson left that game in the second period and never returned. \nThe 6-foot-2, 200-pound winger from Duluth, who had two assists in his first seven games this season, adds a little bit of physicality and some underrated skill to UND's lineup. \nHe's one of four right-handed shot forwards on the team and was being used on the power play before he sustained his injury. \nOlson ended last season with nine points and three game-winning goals in the last seven games. He was the team's leading scorer in the month of March. Bowen still out \nUND will continue to be without forward Dixon Bowen, who injured his foot blocking a shot against the University of Denver. \nBowen has missed the last five games, and UND's penalty kill has sorely missed him. \nIn UND's 13 games with Bowen, the Fighting Hawks killed 92.3 percent of opponent power plays, ranking third nationally.

It is especially targeting female visitors. \nSitting in a chair that looks like it belongs in a space ship, a visitor can get a 360-degree panoramic view of the stars and space through special goggles. \nA Tokyo housewife in her 40s who visited in mid-November was among those smitten by the experience. \n\u201cThe stars looked so real and beautiful I wanted to gaze at them forever,\u201d she said. \nKonica Minolta Planetarium Co., which runs VirtuaLink, operates planetariums in the capital and uses images based on actual star data. Its new VR facility is open to those 12 and older for a fee of \u00a51,500, and includes an immersive 15-minute game in which participants team up to protect Earth from a meteor. It\u2019s unlike the ubiquitous shooting games where players must maneuver or navigate. \nA public relations official said they \u201crepackaged\u201d the VR experience to allow women who are not that skillful in maneuvering through games to enjoy it as well. \nThe VR space in Koto Ward opened in July. Combined with a similar VR facility in Sumida Ward, visitors had topped 50,000 by the end of October. \nJTB System Solution Inc., a Tokyo-based subsidiary of travel agency JTB Corp., has begun introducing VR technology to art galleries and museums. \nIts first project gives visitors a taste of VR while viewing French painter Claude Monet\u2019s 1899 work \u201cWater Lily Pond\u201d at the Pola Museum of Art in Hakone, Kanagawa Prefecture. The VR collaboration \u2014 held on weekends \u2014 runs until Sunday. \nThe JTB group, in collaboration with art galleries and museums in over 100 locations, is preparing similar exhibits in several places. \nIsao Sugimoto, executive officer of JTB System Solution, is keen to expand this service, expressing hope that the VR approach lures more visitors and contributes to revitalizing the local economy. \n\u201cThe aim is to (nudge people) to view the paintings from a different viewpoint,\u201d Takashi Matsui, assistant director of the Pola Museum at the popular hot springs resort said in a briefing in Tokyo in November. \nMatsui said he hopes visitors \u201calso take a good look\u201d at the painting itself.
