While a simple concept, the \"Battle Royale\" shooter has garnered a passionate following during its brief time on the market and current sits among the most played games on PC. \nBack in June at E3 2017 , Microsoft announced a partnership with the game's developer, Bluehole, which would see PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds hitting Xbox One ahead of other consoles. Since, Microsoft Studios has stepped onboard as the publisher on the platform, with a seemingly close relationship between the two firms in preparing a console debut. Now, according to a new report from Bloomberg , Microsoft and Bluehole are in talks to extend this exclusivity agreement, preventing expansions to further platforms over a longer period. \nAccording to Bloomberg, Bluehole met an agreement with Microsoft to produce the game first on Xbox One in 2017, however, talks are now underway to extend this period further into next year. Although Bloomberg expanded little on the deal and how long exclusivity may last, the report stated these types of deals typically last \"for about three months,\" prior to an extension. With Microsoft yet to clarify its agreement for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds outside of \"launch exclusivity,\" it's still hard to gauge an idea of how long such a deal may last. \nAs always, take this news with a pinch of salt until we have official word, although such an extension wouldn't be surprising. Being the hottest game of the year by far, it's in the best interests of Sony and Tecent to see this deal end as soon as possible. In previous interviews, the game's creator has reportedly been in talks with Sony about a PlayStation 4 release, though official details are yet to emerge.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft studios", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:17:47.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9dd73a1d682ce72a3bb836787cfceebf5f3ffcab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0U1ROzBMbF_5W2Xc2z65MoNRqKxrnu.GZ8cqizU_0pXY-", "site_full": "www.windowscentral.com", "site": "windowscentral.com", "site_section": "https://www.windowscentral.com/", "site_categories": ["windows", "hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Windows Central - News, Forums, Reviews, Help for Windows Phone", "title": "Forza Motorsport 7 shows how 'Games as a Service' can hurt a beloved franchise", "title_full": "Forza Motorsport 7 shows how 'Games as a Service' can hurt a beloved franchise", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3278, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9dd73a1d682ce72a3bb836787cfceebf5f3ffcab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0U1ROzBMbF_5W2Xc2z65MoNRqKxrnu.GZ8cqizU_0pXY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Brown", "published": "2017-10-03T15:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Forza Motorsport 7 shows how 'Games as a Service' can hurt a beloved franchise", "text": "\nForza Motorsport 7 might be a solid racer, but its ecosystem built for monetization only harms the franchise going forward.\nLate last week, Forza Motorsport 7 's \"Ultimate Edition\" hit store shelves on Xbox One and Windows 10 , ahead of the game's wider release.

He drinks a lot of tea, and I mean a lot . Follow on Twitter , Mixer and Instagram and SoundCloud . Xbox head Phil Spencer recently got promoted to Microsoft's executive leadership team, in a big show of confidence for gaming. But what does it mean? \nFor years, Xbox hasn't really been viewed as central to Microsoft's core operations, sitting underneath Windows in terms of corporate hierarchy. Commentators and speculators have called on Microsoft to spin off Xbox into its own entity or sell it on to another tech company, for some reason. But despite all the highs and lows, Xbox has soldiered on, leading us to today. \nNow, owing to the efforts of Spencer and his team, gaming has been elevated to the senior leadership table at Microsoft, sitting alongside Azure, Office, and Windows, rather than beneath them. Xbox head Phil Spencer will answer directly to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, cutting out Windows chief Terry Myerson as the middleman. And that's quite important. \nBut what does it all mean for Microsoft, and more important for us as gamers? Cutting out the middleman Phil Spencer (left), Terry Myerson (right). \nWith gaming having its own voice on the senior leadership team, essentially, Spencer will have a little more room to maneuver moving forward. \nPreviously, for larger projects and sign-offs, the Xbox team would've had to seek the blessing of both Windows chief Terry Myerson and, thus, CEO Satya Nadella before any action could be taken. Myerson likely sees everything through the lens of what benefits Windows, rather than gaming, not specializing in gaming himself. It's quite easy to imagine how he could've potentially hindered important decisions. \nOne of the reasons the Windows 10 Store is so atrocious for video game delivery is that it's handled by the Windows team, rather than the Xbox team. The Xbox Store has no issues delivering larger files, unlike the Windows Store, and it enjoys much better categorization and usability. There are multitudinous issues with the Windows Store for gaming, but as a quick example: Forza Horizon 3 last year suffered the same download issues that Forza Motorsport 7 suffered from these past weeks \u2013 a year on, and still no fix. It's a basic example, but it just doesn't feel like gaming is a priority for Myerson's Windows team, so it's easy to imagine how this attitude could've hurt Xbox. The Windows 10 Store. \nPhil Spencer will have one-to-one strategy sessions with CEO Satya Nadella on a more frequent basis, as a result of being part of the executive team. Spencer's passion for gaming and his intimate understanding of the industry, his team, and the platform itself will be far better placed to advocate for blessings that benefit us \u2013 as gamers \u2013 than it would've been coming to Nadella second hand via Terry Myerson. Gaming as core \nThe future of Windows is a little shaky at the moment, frankly, with assaults coming from all sides. ARM-based mobile devices have chewed into Windows as a casual computing solution for billions of people, eroding the necessity to own a PC at all for many. Cheaper browser-based Chromebooks have hurt Windows in education and other areas, and PC growth has essentially flatlined \u2013 in all but one area. \nGaming is the only PC sector that is experiencing any form of meaningful growth at the moment, as the hobby continues to expand at a rapid pace. The rise of eSports, service-driven PC games like League of Legends, and game streaming has led to a huge interest in PC gaming as a hobby, whether it's custom-built rigs that cost $3,000 or cheaper devices running budget GPUs. \nPC gaming is exciting right now, but ironically, despite owning Windows, Microsoft has almost completely alienated themselves from the sector. Between botched DRM like Games for Windows Live and the quality of the Windows 10 Store, Steam remains the de facto distribution method for PC games, but under Phil Spencer, the collaboration between Microsoft and Valve \u2013 who owns Steam \u2013 has ramped up. \nSpencer has been open with his admiration for Steam, and impressively, has worked to open up the wall between Steam and Microsoft's own PC distribution platform. Games can now fully function across the Windows 10 Store and Steam , including Rise of Nations and Killer Instinct. Valve's Steam platform is the largest for digital PC game distribution. \nValve's CEO Gabe Newell had plenty of negative commentary for the Windows Store when it opened up back in the Windows 8 days, calling it an attempt by Microsoft to grab a monopoly on software distribution. As time went by, though, it's quite clear that isn't really the case. \nWith Windows 10 as a service, i.e., free upgrades in perpetuity, some form of passive monetization is going to be necessary, outside of OEM license sales. As far as consumer PCs are concerned, that monetization has to come from the Windows Store, in the form of games, apps, and entertainment \u2013 at least in part. The biggest ticket items in the Windows Store right now are games ( with hardware soon to follow ). I noted earlier that the Windows Store isn't exactly in a great position right now, but with Phil Spencer leading the charge, there's a real chance this could change, at least when it comes to gaming. Phil Spencer at Build 2016. \nDisregarding monetization, Spencer should be able to advocate for a better Windows for developers and gamers alike, putting more effort into features like the Game DVR, Game Mode, the Windows 10 Xbox app, and streamlining the OS for future paradigms. I'm still not convinced VR is the future of gaming, but for Microsoft's own Mixed Reality platform, video games will form a large chunk of its marketability \u2013 especially considering SteamVR will be coming to the platform . Naturally, the Xbox division is far better suited to shore up this aspect of Windows, and Spencer will have the authority to see it through. Cash money \nWhile Xbox is still part of the Windows and Devices group, Spencer will have more leeway to discuss budgets with Microsoft CFO Amy Hood and Satya Nadella. More big-budget games? \nSome have accused Microsoft of underfunding Xbox, which doesn't seem to pump out big-budget \"AAA\" photo-realistic games as frequently as its chief competitor, PlayStation. A lot of Microsoft Studios' exclusive game efforts have revolved around lower-budget \"AA\" games like ReCore, or 2D titles like Ori and the Blind Forest, while others have suffered repeated delays (and even cancellations ). \nWhile simply throwing cash at Microsoft's oft-criticized first-party games effort probably isn't enough by itself to fix the situation, Spencer should have far more leverage to splash the cash on big projects than he did previously. It's all positive \nThere are no negatives here. Phil Spencer's promotion isn't just an acknowledgment of his efforts, but of the whole team that has made Xbox a staple in the industry. \nThe negativity surrounding the Xbox One's botched 2013 launch is still there in the background, and the shadow of Kinect, forced-online, and Games for Windows Live are ultimately ingrained in the consciousness of core gamers both on console and PC, but that needn't always be the case. \nPhil Spencer has heard the criticisms of Xbox and Windows as a gaming platform, and the team has worked hard and long to turn Xbox into something that is providing good value for gamers, a welcoming platform for developers, and ultimately, a service worthy of having fans \u2013 which is something Microsoft really struggles with. \nWhile the Xbox team's newfound authority might take a couple of years to manifest in any meaningful way, we already have the Xbox One X , the new 1710 update , and much more to look forward to in the near-term. \nXbox Live generates huge amounts of revenue, and shouldn't be seen as something Microsoft would cut on a whim, like say, Groove . The team is in it to win it, and from here, things can only get better. It will be really interesting to see what the Xbox team does now that it has a seat at the big boy table.

As part of the redesign, Dropbox has embraced a new, flatter logo that, while it still looks like the company's signature box, is a bit more abstract. That's in addition to a new typeface, called Sharp Grotesk, that will accompany branding. \nThe design refresh is largely a rebranding exercise that Dropbox plans to use to convey itself as a platform for creativity. The focus on creatives is overwhelmingly evident in Dropbox's explanation of the refresh , in which the company proclaims it wants to \"unleash the world's creative energy.\" \nAll of that said, Dropbox still remains relatively conservative once you sign in, sticking to its blue-and-white color scheme and blue logo when viewing your files. The new design elements will be much more prominent in advertising as it attempts to reel in new users. In an interview with AdWeek , Dropbox CMO Carolyn Feinstein hinted at how we'll likely see the new, more colorful Dropbox used: \nWhat this allows us to do is in different environments express ourselves in a way that makes sense for that situation. Sometimes, especially in products when we want to back up a little bit and put the showcase on the work and people using our products, we will stay really blue and white. In other cases, our palette is much richer and able to flex into different environments in the places we might show up while also giving a nod to the creativity of our users.

Playing as a young witch, you'll have to defeat magical monsters and solve lots of puzzles to save your school \u2013 and the world! It's a vibrant adventure with cute characters and impressive 16-bit artwork and effects. \nSee on Steam Avoiding a fate worse than detention \nOriginally released on Steam in 2015, Mystik Belle comes from one-man developer Andrew Bado, with music by Dan Rogers. On the surface, it's a charming small-scale Metroidvania platformer. But considering that the excellent Sega Saturn-like artwork, backgrounds with multiple layers of parallax scrolling and 3D floors, and modern-era lighting effects all come from one single programmer/artist, this game is quite an accomplishment. \nAs Mystik Belle begins, our young protagonist Belle is busy practicing magic in the dark halls of the Hagmore School of Witchcraft. An unknown fiend sabotages the school's all-important magical brew, leaving poor Belle to take the blame. Her only hope of avoiding expulsion (and death) is to restore the brew by finding three sacred relics before a dark entity destroys the school and everyone in it! Exploring the school and solving puzzles \nMystic Belle plays a lot like a typical Metroidvania-style game, although the large, stubby characters and meticulous old-school animation give it a feel all its own. Heroine Belle can run, jump, and shoot fireballs from her broom by default. There's no downside to jamming on the fire button to constantly shoot fireballs while you move about, which feels pretty good. Belle's jump is a bit slow and floaty, though, which takes some getting used to. \nTo aid Belle with navigation, she has a too-small minimap in the corner of the screen and a full-sized map that displays when she checks her inventory. I wish the map showed more details, as it's a bit hard to remember points you want to return to when everything looks the same on the map. That said, rooms with fast-travel mirrors show up in green. And the map is quite a bit smaller than many games in this genre anyway. \nBelle will do battle with over 60 distinctive foes like ghosts, haunted brooms and books, spiders, mandragoras, and more. As she gains XP from killing enemies, she'll eventually level up. Leveling up boosts her health and eventually improves her broom's fire attack. She'll also gain new powers like a charged electrical shot and dash by solving puzzles and defeating the game's eight bosses. \nPuzzles play a large part in Mystik Belle, so much that the developer considers it a hybrid Metroidvania/adventure game. Opening new paths tend to involve finding and using the appropriate item on a unique object, door, or switch, rather than just collecting a new ability as with most Metroidvanias. The puzzles are nearly always intuitive though, so don't fear an overabundance of adventure game-style headscratchers. \nOn normal difficulty, Mystik Belle leans fairly easy for this style of platformer. Enemies drop health so frequently that you should seldom die, especially if you stop to grind XP now and then. A harder difficulty ups the ante considerably though, with tougher enemies and no fast-traveling. There aren't any difficulty-based achievements, but it might still be a good idea to play on Hard \u2013 if you like a challenge. \nInventory management is another source of challenge in general, as Belle can only carry a few of the many unique items found throughout the school at one time. Storage chests located in fast-travel rooms and other locations work the same way as in Resident Evil games, though. You just need to remember to stash things until they're needed. Achievements \nThe Xbox One version of Mystik Belle features 14 achievements (one less than the Steam version , oddly) worth a total of 1,000 Gamerscore. Most of these will come through normal progression, though a few require some extra effort. There are two different endings, for instance \u2013 one for beating the game without finding all eight relics, and one for catching them all. \nThere are also Achievements for never leaving your hall pass behind and for completing the game in under an hour. Having beaten the game normally, the latter shouldn't be much trouble \u2013 especially if you follow this speedrun guide . On the whole, Mystik Belle will be a breezy completion. Overall impression \nMystik Belle is smaller in scale game than top-tier Metroidvanias like Ori and the Blind Forest and Axiom Verge . It falls more closely in line with the excellent Wonder Boy: The Dragon's Trap , albeit with a more pixelated look and a greater emphasis on story and puzzles. This is a tight platforming adventure that overflows with whimsy and charm, never overstaying its welcome. Fans of the genre (and Sega platformers of old) will find Belle and her world bewitching. Pros: A whimsical adventure with charming characters and a decent dose of humor. Solve puzzles using a variety of items found throughout the school. A great art style that evokes classic Sega platformers, with excellent sprites and background details. Cons: Belle's jump is too floaty. The game is a little on the short side (but at least there's no filler). \nGreat ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mystik belle", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T23:05:58.033+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6e92a7b10f97f344956e99c97286a251812a2cce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0Te45P39CzIJUheozIEKyvQKIpmTyF4Ye0eQeKuKv5Ov.EPsTRu8sj.cn.KccNhc_ScDYkEPQkzmrCco9kh5edmkScXlkWrq_I17n45UMaj8-", "site_full": "www.windowscentral.com", "site": "windowscentral.com", "site_section": "https://www.windowscentral.com/", "site_categories": ["windows", "hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Windows Central - News, Forums, Reviews, Help for Windows Phone", "title": "Skyrim Special Edition's survival mode available for free for a limited time", "title_full": "Skyrim Special Edition's survival mode available for free for a limited time", "published": "2017-10-03T23:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3278, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6e92a7b10f97f344956e99c97286a251812a2cce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0Te45P39CzIJUheozIEKyvQKIpmTyF4Ye0eQeKuKv5Ov.EPsTRu8sj.cn.KccNhc_ScDYkEPQkzmrCco9kh5edmkScXlkWrq_I17n45UMaj8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Thorp-Lancaster", "published": "2017-10-03T23:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Skyrim Special Edition's survival mode available for free for a limited time", "text": "3 Comments Bethesda is making its challenging new survival mode for Skyrim Special Edition free to try for a limited time. \nSkyrim developer Bethesda has launched its new Creation Club for Skyrim Special Edition on Xbox One , PS4, and PC. While the curated marketplace for add-on content has caused some backlash in the community, Bethesda is at least attempting to smooth things over for the launch by letting players try its new survival mode add-on for Skyrim Special Edition for free for a limited time. #SkyrimSpecialEdition Survival Mode is now available for PC, PS4 & Xbox One! - FREE for a limited time! \u2014 Bethesda (@bethesda) October 3, 2017 \nAs Bethesda describes , the new difficulty mode takes the challenge of Skyrim's gameplay and greatly multiplies it by adding elements from the survival genre. When playing in survival mode, you'll have to closely manage your hunger, fatigue, temperature, and more to avoid succumbing to the elements. Fast travel is also disabled, making moving from place to place more of a much greater challenge. Other tweaks, like a significant reduction in carry weight, along with diseases and afflictions, only increase the challenge further. survival mode definitely isn't for the light of heart. \nThere have been mods that add elements of survival games to Skyrim for some time, but Bethesda is hoping fans will be tempted by its official offering. Survival mode will remain free to try through October 10, after which it will be available as premium Creation Club content. Bethesda hasn't yet stated how much survival mode will cost after October 10.

That's probably because the file is locked. Here are the steps to unlock and delete it. \nWhen a file is open by another app or process, Windows 10 puts the file into a locked state, and you can't delete, modify, or move it to another location. Usually, after the file is no longer in use, the application will unlock it automatically, but that's not always the case. Sometimes, a file may not unlock successfully, and even if you try to take any action, you'll see a warning that the operation can't be completed because it's open by another program. \nIf you must delete or take different actions with a locked file, there are at least two methods you can use to unlock it, including using Microsoft's Process Explorer tool and Safe Mode. \nIn this Windows 10 guide , we walk you through the steps to get rid of files even if they're locked by an app or process. How to unlock files using Safe Mode How to unlock files using Process Explorer \nIf you need to unlock a file currently being used by a program or system process and you can't restart your device, you can use these steps: Download Process Explorer from this Microsoft website . Extract the content inside the ProcessExplorer.zip compressed folder. ( You can refer to these instructions if you need additional help on how to do this task.) \nDouble-click the procexp.exe if you're running a 32-bit version of Windows 10 or procexp64.exe if you're running a 64-bit version10 to launch the app. \nClick on File , and select the Show Details for All Processes option. \nClick on Find , and select the Find Handle or DLL option. \nType the name of the locked file in the field, and click the Search button. Select the file from the search result. \nBehind the search window, in \"Process Explorer,\" right-click the locked file, and select Close Handle to unlock it. Important: If the file is being used by more than one process, repeat the steps to close all handles. \nOnce you complete these steps, you can go ahead and safely delete or modify the unlocked file. How to unlock files using Safe Mode \nUsually, when you come across a locked file, you can simply restart your device to unlock it. However, if the application has a service that loads during startup, it might keep locking a file as soon as you sign in. You can either disable the app from loading at startup , or you can boot into Safe Mode to unlock and delete the file. Here's how: Open Settings .

Instead of coming packaged as two parts \u2014 stand and monitor \u2014 it comes as a single piece. The stand has a flattened M shape to it, with legs reaching almost to each edge and to the back for balance. \nIt's plenty sturdy, and there's no threat of this big monitor tipping, but it only allows for a bit of tilt forward and back. There's no changing the height or rotating the screen, something that, if you're used to is hard to let go of. The size of this monitor might be a problem for some, especially those with limited space on their desks. Luckily, for a bit more freedom, the monitor can be VESA mounted. \nThe majority of the chassis is just under an inch thick, with a wider portion near the middle for ports and for the stand attachment. You have decent connectivity options, with two HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, VGA, and a 3.5-mm audio jack. Ports are spaced properly, and connecting multiple devices simultaneously won't pose a problem. \nOn the front of the monitor is the Philips logo and a small LED to show power stages. Other than that, it's just shiny black bezel. To adjust settings, there is a single, flat joystick located on the back of the monitor which, after some getting used to, is much more intuitive than a usual multi-button menu setup. Big and beautiful Philips Momentum 326M display \nComing from a 27-inch setup, 31.5 inches seems initially like a big jump, but after using it for about two weeks, it's all I want to use. The IPS panel has the standard 178-degree viewing angle, which is what you want if you're using this in a multi-display setup where you aren't facing it head-on. \nThe 2,560 x 1,440 resolution looks fantastic at this size, and right out of the box, the color and contrast are pretty much spot on. Testing color accuracy, we saw 100 percent sRGB and 90 percent AdobeRGB. These are both excellent results, and they're evident in everyday use. Playing video games was very enjoyable \u2014 did we mention how big this monitor is? \u2014 and, if I had an AMD graphics card, I'd be able to take advantage of AMD FreeSync technology for an even smoother picture. \nThe five millisecond response time and 60Hz refresh rate aren't quite optimal if you're looking for a gaming monitor \u2014 typically a high-end gaming display has a one millisecond response time and a 144Hz refresh rate \u2014 but for pretty much any other task, these specs are not an issue. \nThe LED backlight is advertised as 250 nits bright, but, in reality, seems much brighter. You won't have problems using it in a well-lit room \u2014 also helped by the matte finish that cuts down glare \u2014 and a blue-light filter preset that toggles on and off with a couple of clicks takes care of working in the dark. Branding! Philips Momentum 326M extras \nPhilips included what it calls \"SmartImage,\" which provides six picture presets based on activities. An FPS preset gives you better dark contrast, Racing has the best response time and high saturation, RTS has user-selected highlighted portions, LowBlue cuts out blue light, and two gamer profiles are available for custom presets. The small joystick on the back of the monitor can be used to immediately switch between these presets. \nThe branded features continue with \"Ambiglow,\" which is essentially 10 lights built into the bottom edge of the monitor that project color based on whatever you're viewing on your display. There are three brightness settings, but you likely won't want to go above the lowest; otherwise, you'll see each individual light reflected rather than an ambient glow. If mounted on a wall, you'd no doubt get the same effect. \nFinally, there's a \"SmartContrast\" function that automatically adjusts the backlight and contrast of the display depending on the task at hand. Working on a Word document with a white background? The backlight dims. Playing DOOM? Contrast is upped so that you can see into dark corners. These extras are a nice addition to an already great monitor and are something you might not always find on a monitor at this price. TL;DR Philips Momentum 326M review conclusion \nThe response time and refresh rate could be better for dedicated gamers, and the wide stand doesn't allow for height adjustment or rotation. Other than that, it's hard to find faults in this monitor. \nWith plenty of customizable settings options in the on-screen display, a few extra features that help with the picture quality for gamers (including AMD FreeSync), and an outstanding picture with impressive contrast and color, the Philips Momentum 326M is a solid option when shopping for a big screen.

Here's what you need to know about the Star Wars Battlefront II beta before it drops on October 4.\nSee at Xbox Store See at Amazon \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "xbox store see", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T15:45:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "70e0396393ee6a3755f1c1907781ab7c08d82b2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj40q5UnRtt6PkKLbvh5lAXLrNCF8_zPbXZf_7mSrtpnRsBfIDGdrop4oU9Ht7Fuu7_UJdb8qMCAWNY.hF_6rYra48O_HVDAy8aonyhmKIEN45EddUOAI9cQt9HQmWxX2VqoaAs2o4iCikIGgfQTMiH23iRVQoP1MGg--", "site_full": "forums.windowscentral.com", "site": "windowscentral.com", "site_section": "https://forums.windowscentral.com/windows-central-news-discussion", "site_categories": ["windows", "tech"], "section_title": "Windows Central News Discussion", "title": "Windows 10 build 16299.15 is rolling out to Insiders in the Fast ring", "title_full": "Windows 10 build 16299.15 is rolling out to Insiders in the Fast ring - Windows Central Forums", "published": "2017-10-03T05:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "discussions", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.094, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3278, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "70e0396393ee6a3755f1c1907781ab7c08d82b2d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTmwnVQdhwjj40q5UnRtt6PkKLbvh5lAXLrNCF8_zPbXZf_7mSrtpnRsBfIDGdrop4oU9Ht7Fuu7_UJdb8qMCAWNY.hF_6rYra48O_HVDAy8aonyhmKIEN45EddUOAI9cQt9HQmWxX2VqoaAs2o4iCikIGgfQTMiH23iRVQoP1MGg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T05:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Windows 10 build 16299.15 is rolling out to Insiders in the Fast ring", "text": "The RTM build of the Fall Creators Update is now rolling out to Insiders in the Fast ring.

The Spectre x360, in particular, managed to snag a spot as our pick for the best convertible laptop for its build quality, looks, and usability. Now, HP is taking that a step further with updates to the Spectre x360 13 and its non-convertible sibling, the Spectre 13. A look at the updated Spectre 13 \nStarting with the Spectre 13, HP is claiming this second-generation machine is \"now the world's thinnest touch laptop\" at 0.41-inches thick. Otherwise, the Spectre 13 packs the same sleek design as before. The main upgrades come in the form of the system's internals, which now feature Intel's latest eighth-generation Core i5 and i7 processors. That's rounded out by up to 1TB of solid-state drive (SSD) storage and up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM. The thin-bezel 13.3-inch display comes in 1080p resolution with the base model with a 4K display available. HP is claiming up to 11.5 hours of battery life, and fast charging will allow you to go from zero to 50 percent battery life in 30 minutes. \nAs for ports, HP says the refreshed Spectre 13 includes two Thunderbolt 3 port and a single USB Type-C port. Windows Hello is also supported for secure logins via the Spectre 13's webcam. And now, the Spectre x360 13 ... \nThe convertible Spectre x360 13 is also seeing some beefed up internals. Inside, HP equipped the x360 13 with Intel's eighth-generation Core i5 and i7 processors, along with up to 1TB of SSD storage and up to 16GB of LPDDR3 RAM. In terms of security, the convertible packs support for Windows Hello via its webcam, as well as through a fingerprint reader on its side. The 13.3-inch display is available at up to 4K resolution. HP claims up to 10 hours of mixed use battery life, with the ability to top off quickly with fast charging. \nLike the Spectre 13, the x360 13 includes two Thunderbolt 3 ports and a single USB Type-A 3.1 port. A stylus is also available for digital inking with the x360 13's touch display. \nHP says that the Spectre x360 13 and Spectre 13 will be available on October 29 starting at $1,149 and $1,299, respectively.

There is a free version but to be able to store more than twenty recipes you have to opt for the Pro version, which is listed separately in the Windows Store. \nThe biggest drawback of Recipe Keeper Pro is that you'll have to purchase it on each of your devices, a rare occurrence in the Windows Store these days. Each version costs $4.99. \nIn addition to the Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile versions, you can also get it on iOS and Android . \nSee in the Windows Store Recipe Keeper Pro features \nThe app is well made and has many features that you'd want in a recipe app. You can add recipes manually, mark favorite meals, add all or parts of recipes to a shopping list, and add photos to your recipes. The app also has a timer, so you don't have to open another app in the kitchen. \nThe shopping list is intuitive and can be sorted by either recipe or food category, such as canned foods or baking, an especially handy feature to save time at the grocery store. \nIn addition to those relatively standard cooking-related features, Recipe Keeper Pro also lets you import recipes from websites. It does a good job of scanning through sites and adding ingredients, steps, and photos from a recipe page you find. You can edit the listings in case it makes a mistake or you just want to tweak it. \nThe app also has a meal planner that lets you see an easy to read summary of your week's meals. While the app can be used without any need for paper and pen, if you'd prefer to print things out it is easy to print your meal plan or shopping list. Cooking up a price \nAs mentioned earlier, pricing is the weak point of Recipe Keeper Pro. Most apps in the Windows Store let you purchase an app once and then access it on all your devices. This is up to the makers of the app, of course, and they're allowed to have each version priced separately but it's still a disappointing difference when compared to other apps. \nIf you read through the reviews of the app in the Windows Store you will see that the developer claims you can purchase the app once and have it work across the devices. This appears to be incorrect, as we purchased the app on a PC and were still asked to upgrade to premium and to pay again for the phone version. This was the case even after registering for an account. If there is a way to have a purchase work on all versions of the app, it's unclear how to do so. Wrapping up Recipe Keeper Pro \nPrice aside, Recipe Keeper Pro is a great app for anyone who wants to improve their cooking game. It makes it easy to import all of your favorite recipes, and features such as the meal planner and shopping list make preparing meals much simpler. \nThe fact that the service is also available on Android and iOS is a plus, because many Windows 10 users today use non-Windows phones. \nGreat ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T17:02:14.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3941b9392b849907048695b834e39f3dbc4d6083", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM08FisoB19OxH7x104HEfZiYbT2B3HXkwykOyCkg5tsIuRwlCefiHTXw--", "site_full": "www.windowscentral.com", "site": "windowscentral.com", "site_section": "https://www.windowscentral.com/", "site_categories": ["windows", "hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Windows Central - News, Forums, Reviews, Help for Windows Phone", "title": "Chuwi HiBox mini PC review: Dual-boot Windows and Android done (very) poorly", "title_full": "Chuwi HiBox mini PC review: Dual-boot Windows and Android done (very) poorly", "published": "2017-10-04T16:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3278, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3941b9392b849907048695b834e39f3dbc4d6083", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM08FisoB19OxH7x104HEfZiYbT2B3HXkwykOyCkg5tsIuRwlCefiHTXw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Phil Nickinson", "published": "2017-10-04T16:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Chuwi HiBox mini PC review: Dual-boot Windows and Android done (very) poorly", "text": "\nThere's nothing like a good dual-booting system ... but Chuwi's HiBox Mini PC is, unfortunately, not a good dual-booting system.\nA quality dual-boot system has forever been the holy grail of nerds.

Sometimes it's best to just enjoy our music without the interruption of notifications and alarms.

The laptop runs fine (fast, no weird noises, no system error).\nAny suggestion? Thanks a lot! First of all I presuming you are using windows 10?\nCan you access the hard drive easily?\nIf you can try plugging it into an external enclosure and checking on a seperate PC, if your data is there and pluggin in the external enclosure to your laptop still shows an empty D: drive then you will need to reinstall the o/s or refresh.\nHowever if your data is not visible using a external enclosure, get the free pro + winpe trial of the Easeus data recovery tool to recover your data.\nI would also recommend stop using the D drive immediately to prevent data loss through over writes until you check the drive with an enclosure.\nHowever if you cannot access the hard drive easily, although not recommended download the data recovery tool to C: and install to C:. Run a check your D drive and back up your data that way.\nOnce done, try refreshing the o/s without deleting your data option via the settings -> recovery -> reset this PC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:55:00.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "867b34fa2aeabfdf9fcff99f10779157ef42d2b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0hWDw38c863Nbi.6BBdv7sOkj2bR6diHXvlvzoyMX91yyD6KXoXyObNBWwTyhMQBijqthMHe6DDxDMlsQbL3Hfa1PLnR9b87c", "site_full": "www.windowscentral.com", "site": "windowscentral.com", "site_section": "https://www.windowscentral.com/", "site_categories": ["windows", "hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Windows Central - News, Forums, Reviews, Help for Windows Phone", "title": "Microsoft announces Xbox One S Assassin's Creed Origins bundles", "title_full": "Microsoft announces Xbox One S Assassin's Creed Origins bundles", "published": "2017-10-04T19:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3278, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "867b34fa2aeabfdf9fcff99f10779157ef42d2b9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0hWDw38c863Nbi.6BBdv7sOkj2bR6diHXvlvzoyMX91yyD6KXoXyObNBWwTyhMQBijqthMHe6DDxDMlsQbL3Hfa1PLnR9b87c", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dan Thorp-Lancaster", "published": "2017-10-04T19:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microsoft announces Xbox One S Assassin's Creed Origins bundles", "text": "\nMicrosoft is bringing together Assassin's Creed Origins and the Xbox One S in its latest console bundle.\nIf you're looking forward to Assassin's Creed Origins and have yet to pick up an Xbox One S , Microsoft's latest bundle will check both boxes. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "assassin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:46:25.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ad001e75265baab0eff013d767c4da57324649d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0L.tMUxddlMuYIsYb898Rb.tc5aoQiqvKzj6.A23FG8Q3V2_rqRUUvTUag99ezuPh2TairdKPvYzK3WevDsxV0iGgSb58WtkEZ_Fet4u5qL.K_E6X3qzBvw--", "site_full": "www.windowscentral.com", "site": "windowscentral.com", "site_section": "https://www.windowscentral.com/", "site_categories": ["windows", "hobbies_and_interests", "tech", "video_and_computer_games"], "section_title": "Windows Central - News, Forums, Reviews, Help for Windows Phone", "title": "Why a pen-focused cellular Surface Mini tablet would be awesome", "title_full": "Why a pen-focused cellular Surface Mini tablet would be awesome", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 3278, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ad001e75265baab0eff013d767c4da57324649d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTDmPV6aDP7LxjemC47zNM0L.tMUxddlMuYIsYb898Rb.tc5aoQiqvKzj6.A23FG8Q3V2_rqRUUvTUag99ezuPh2TairdKPvYzK3WevDsxV0iGgSb58WtkEZ_Fet4u5qL.K_E6X3qzBvw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jason Ward", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why a pen-focused cellular Surface Mini tablet would be awesome", "text": "\nWriting is a skill many of us begin learning even before we learn the alphabet.\nWe write, almost daily, throughout our professional and personal lives.

We often need to scribble some idea, epiphany or other valuable information onto a medium more enduring than our memories. Scrap paper, however, is often lost.

While the unit itself can spin up to some audible speeds, there's a handy dial on the chassis to control the fan itself, as well as a power toggle. What makes this cooler rather awesome, in particular, is the height-adjustable stand that supports four different configurations. At just shy of $55, it's not cheap, but the SF-17 is a killer cooler. \nBottom line: If you need to invest in a cooling solution for your laptop, look no further than the SF-17 by Cooler Master. \nOne more thing: There are four USB ports to expand connectivity capacity. Why the Cooler Master SF-17 is the best laptop cooler you can buy \nYou may be wondering why we're recommending a $55 laptop cooler as our best pick, but hear us out. This notebook cooler offers a powerful 180-mm fan. Sure, it's no five-fan configuration, but with the single blower, the pad is able to adequately cool a notebook of up to 19 inches. This allows for the one pad to be shared by multiple (and even seriously large) laptops. \nFour height adjustments can be configured for working, typing and viewing enhanced angles. This is matched by four USB ports to not only replace the port that is occupied but expand available options for more devices to be hooked up to the notebook. And when it's not in use, a rubber handle can be used for easy transport. And when you're set up to impress some fine folks at LAN events, there are red LEDs at hand to add a little ambiance. \nIt's a sturdy laptop cooler that offers impressive performance and will help keep laptops (up to 19 inches) cooler with the powerful 180-mm fan. Best slim \nSee at Amazon \nThe NotePal X-Slim ($16.88) offers a solid cooling solution with a massive 160-mm fan enclosed in a super slim profile. The blower can hit speeds of 1,500 RPM, and it's more than sturdy enough to withstand the weight of even larger gaming notebooks. The addition of a pass-through USB port ensures that connectivity isn't sacrificed, and two height settings can be selected depending on how the laptop is positioned. \nBottom line: This laptop cooler takes up very little space and is ideal for slim notebooks when you'd rather keep the overall footprint low. \nOne more thing: This thing is just 46 mm thick. Best smart \nSee at Amazon \nCouple dual 120-mm fans with temperature controls and automated speed adjustments and you have a cooler that will react to the amount of heat being dissipated from the notebook itself. As an added bonus, there's a neat multi-function display on the front of the Thermaltake Massive TM ($36.33), which includes manual fan control and a lock feature. It's slightly more expensive than other options on our list but is well worth the investment. \nBottom line: It's a sleek-looking, smart and slim laptop cooler with automated fan control. \nOne more thing: Four temperature sensors are installed in the cooler to better detect heat output. Best trio \nSee at Amazon \nAukey decided to include a total of three fans in the company's CP-R1 ($24.99) cooler, and three ultra-quiet fans at that. Having more than two fans allows for each individual unit to run at slower speeds while offering similar levels of airflow. Like other products available, the CP-R1 is height adjustable. \nBottom line: Aukey is a quality brand of accessories, and the company's CP-R1 laptop cooler is a solid solution. \nOne more thing: There is LED backlighting to offer a unique appearance. Best quad \nSee at Amazon \nWhen three fans just aren't enough, move it on up to four. This Tree New Bee ($21.49) laptop cooling pad has a quad setup inside a metal platform to draw heat away from the notebook. Two USB connections are required, one for the operation of the unit itself, as well as a second for the dual-USB pass-through. \nBottom line: Its a quality laptop cooler with enough fans to cool an entire town. \nOne more thing: Two separate fan controls are available too. Best quintuple \nSee at Amazon \nIt's possible to go all out with a total of five fans with the MECO Cooler ($24.64). One is a large central 120-mm blower, which is surrounded by a further four smaller 60-mm fans. In total, this cooler is able to achieve 70CFM, which is pretty respectable for a slim pad that supports fan speeds of up to 2,5000 RPM. A cool small display on the front allows for the change of fan modes, as well as the relay of information. \nBottom line: It's a solid option for those who need to take away some serious heat from notebooks under load. \nOne more thing: A total of five height adjustment settings are available to match the number of wind generators. Conclusion \nPicking up a laptop cooling pad is a great way to better protect your PC's internals from throttling under load and degrading due to heat. You really can't go wrong, but the Storm SF-17 by Cooler Master is a solid option, sporting a giant 180-mm fan with manual control and a height-adjustable stand.

Here's how to configure and customize those settings. \nFor a desktop PC, the sleep settings are less of an issue because you're not restricted by a battery. Notebooks and mobile devices are different, requiring conservative sleep settings to get as much juice from the battery as possible. You don't want your laptop draining power when you're not using it, so here's how you can easily configure sleep settings in Windows 10. Changing sleep times in Windows 10 \nYou can modify your Windows sleep settings with the following steps: Open up search by hitting the Windows Key + Q shortcut. \nType \"sleep\" and select \"Choose when the PC sleeps\" . You should see two options: Screen: Configure when the screen goes to sleep. Sleep: Configure when the PC will hibernate. Set the time for both using the drop-down menus . \nIf you're using a laptop, there are actually four options that fall into two categories: one for when you're on battery and the other for when you're plugged in.

Wanting a grittier and darker experience, the company sat down to craft a detailed account of the Covenant invasion that we see briefly in Halo 2. The result was Halo 3: ODST, an experience that, even despite its age, manages to stand out distinctly from the other games in the franchise.\nSee at the Xbox Store \nThe reality of war with the Covenant \nODST showcases the true horrors of the war with the Covenant Empire.\nTypically, Halo is a universe that centers itself around heroic, superhuman figures doing heroic, superhuman feats.
