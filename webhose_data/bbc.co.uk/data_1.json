Scotland and fracking: how did we get here? \nThe Scottish government has previously imposed a similar block on underground coal gasification (UCG) - a separate technique used to extract gas from coal seams deep underground - on environmental grounds. \nIt followed the introduction of a moratorium on both fracking and UCG in 2015, which saw a series of expert reports published on the potential health, environmental and economic impact of the controversial techniques, as well as a public consultation being carried out . \nMr Wheelhouse said the consultation came back with \"overwhelming\" opposition to fracking, with 99% of the 60,000 respondents supporting a ban. He said this showed that \"there is no social licence for unconventional oil and gas to be taken forward at this time\". Image caption Paul Wheelhouse said there was overwhelming public opposition to fracking \nThe move comes almost exactly a year on from the UK government giving the go-ahead to horizontal fracking in Lancashire. \nShale gas is currently processed in Scotland at a site in Grangemouth, having been shipped in from abroad , but cannot be extracted from beneath Scottish soil under the current moratorium, which is enforced through planning regulations. \nMr Wheelhouse said local authorities would be instructed to continue this moratorium \"indefinitely\" - calling this \"action sufficient to effectively ban the development of unconventional oil and gas extraction in Scotland\". \nHe said: \"The decision I am announcing today means that fracking cannot and will not take place in Scotland.\" Look back on the fracking statement on Holyrood Live \nMr Wheelhouse's announcement was welcomed by environmental groups, with Friends of the Earth Scotland and WWF Scotland both hailing a victory for campaigners. \nWWF Scotland official Sam Gardner said it was \"excellent news\", saying \"the climate science is clear\" that fossil fuels should be \"left in the ground\". \nMary Church from Friends of the Earth Scotland said it was a \"huge win for the anti-fracking movement\" which would be \"warmly welcomed across the country and around the world\". 'Poor decision' \nHowever Ineos said the move could see \"large numbers of Scottish workers leaving the country to find work\". \nTom Pickering, operations director of Ineos Shale, said: \"It is a sad day for those of us who believe in evidence-led decision making. The Scottish government has turned its back on a potential manufacturing and jobs renaissance and lessened Scottish academia's place in the world by ignoring its findings.\" \nKen Cronin of UK Onshore Oil and Gas also said it was a \"poor decision\", which ignored \"extensive independent research\" and was \"based on dogma not evidence or geopolitical reality\". \nAnd the GMB Scotland trade union said the move was \"mired in dishonesty\" and \"an abandonment of the national interest\", saying Scotland would now be dependent on gas shipped in from \"the likes of Qatar and Russia\". Image copyright BBC Sport Image caption The first shipment of shale gas from the US arrived at Grangemouth in September 2016 \nThe Scottish Conservatives also said Scotland would miss out on a \"much needed economic boost\" and high-skilled jobs as a result of the decision. \nTory MSP Dean Lockhart said ministers had ignored scientific and economic evidence to take a \"short-sighted and economically damaging decision which is nothing more than a bid to appease the green elements of the pro-independence movement\". \nHowever Labour MSP Claudia Beamish said the move did not go far enough, arguing that ministers were merely extending the existing moratorium which \"could be overturned at any point at the whim of a minister\". 'Legally shaky' \nMs Beamish has a member's bill tabled at Holyrood calling for a \"full legal ban\", but Mr Wheelhouse said this would not be needed until his proposals. \nThe Scottish Greens said the announcement was \"a step in the right direction\". However, they also wanted a more permanent ban, with MSP Mark Ruskell saying the moratorium was \"legally shaky\" and open to challenge. \nThis was also echoed by Friends of the Earth Scotland, with Ms Church saying ministers should \"go further than relying on planning powers\" and \"instead commit to passing a law to ban the fracking industry for good\". \nScottish Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur welcomed the decision, saying that ministers had taken the \"scenic route\" but had ultimately decided \"effectively to ban fracking\". \nMSPs have previously voted to support a ban on fracking, but SNP members abstained from that vote. What is fracking and why is it controversial? Image copyright Getty Images Fracking is the process of drilling down into the earth before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. The extensive use of fracking in the US, where it has revolutionised the energy industry, has prompted environmental concerns.

Steve Lee was appointed Nottingham Panthers captain at the start of the season Captain Steve Lee says Nottingham Panthers are on the verge of something special as they look to become the first UK team to reach the knockout stages of the Champions Hockey League. \nPanthers, the lowest-ranked team in the CHL, need one regulation-time win in their last two matches to guarantee qualification for the knockout stages. \nLee told BBC Nottingham Sport: \"It is special with the wins we already have. \n\"If we could get one more and put us through, that would be really special.\" \nPanthers are top of Group F with eight points from four matches, with both their remaining games against TPS Turku. \nThey host Turku at the Nottingham Arena on Tuesday before travelling to Finland next week. \nNottingham, the 32nd seed in the prestigious European tournament, have already beaten Swiss side Bern at home, who are the fourth-ranked team in the CHL, while they have also defeated Czech side Mountfield home and away. \n\"We have done really well in the CHL,\" added Lee. \"It's a massive stage and we have played against some of the best teams in Europe. \n\"I don't think anyone thought we would be where we are. We all hoped, we were all positive and believed we had a chance. \n\"When it came round to it we started building momentum.

When I watched them early on in some exhibition games, I thought they were really, really good. \nThey certainly have not looked back.

Ireland as having a \"frozen conflict\", and said the Good Friday Agreement must not be damaged by Brexit.\nHe suggested that the agreement could be attached to the Brexit withdrawal deal as a way of protecting it.\nMr Verhofstadt made the comments in a debate at the European Parliament.\nIt was voting on a resolution assesses the state of play in the Article 50 negotiations between the UK and the EU.\nMEPs backed a motion urging the EU not to open the next phase of the discussions until a \"major breakthrough\" has been made.\n'Taking sides' The resolution referred to Prime Minister Theresa May's recent statement about wanting no infrastructure on the Irish border after Brexit.\nIt stated that position \"presumes\" the UK will have to stay in the internal market and customs union, or that Northern Ireland will stay in some form of internal market and customs union.\nImage copyright PA Image caption Guy Verhofstadt visited Belfast and an area near the Irish border last month That part of the text has been welcomed by Sinn F\u00e9in but criticised by unionists.\nUlster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson said it showed that Mr Verhofstadt was \"taking sides\" in Northern Ireland.\n\"Mr Verhofstadt is essentially calling for an international border to be placed between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain,\" he said.\nMr Nicholson added that it would be a \"sad day\" if the parliament supported that text as it would be \"turning its back on decades of good relationships with all communities in Northern Ireland\".\n'Important step forward' That was echoed by the Democratic Unionist Party's Diane Dodds, who said \"there can be no question of a deal that cuts us adrift from our most important market and erects barriers in the UK single market\".\nSinn F\u00e9in's Martina Anderson said the resolution was \"an important step forward in recognising that the requirements of the north of Ireland are different from those in Britain\".\nShe also welcomed Mr Verhofstadt's comments on exploring how the Good Friday Agreement could be given legal protection as part of the withdrawal deal.\nMr Verhofstadt was in Belfast last month, and said during that visit it was up to the UK to find a way to avoid the imposition of new controls at the Irish border after Brexit.\nThe parliament's role in the Brexit process is to vote on the final deal.\nIts

'Out of the blue' \nHowever, despite his story, the condition remains largely unrecognised by most frontline medical staff. \nDavid told BBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme : \"For me it pretty much came out of the blue. \n\"I used to do white-water kayaking. I was kayaking one evening and I just didn't feel well. \n\"I had a shortness of breath and I had heart palpitations and I felt a little bit dizzy, but I couldn't really put my finger on it. \n\"I went home and went to sleep and didn't really think too much about it.\" \nDavid said that the next morning he had a terrible pain in head. \n\"It wasn't your normal sort of headache that you could take a paracetamol and forget about it,\" he said. \n\"It was a very prominent headache and it kept getting worse. \n\"As I was getting ready to go to work this headache was ramping up and by the end of the day I couldn't even stand. \n\"I couldn't walk between the bedroom and the bathroom. I had to crawl, it was that extreme.\" Image caption Doctors think David's leak is somewhere in his upper spine \nAs the days passed, David, who is 37, started to develop other symptoms. \nHis vision started to go blurry, his hearing began to go, he had tinnitus constantly and his concentration and memory were also affected. \nHe said: \"One of the very odd symptoms that people with CSF leak get is this odd feeling that your brain is being pulled down your spine. \n\"It's a very hard symptom to express to somebody that hasn't felt it. \n\"It's a kind of unrelenting pressure, as if there is bricks on your head, pushing your brain down.\" \nDoctors have since tried unsuccessfully to treat David's CSF leak, which is thought to be somewhere on his upper spine. \nHe has also been treated in Los Angeles by Dr Wouter Schievink, the same surgeon that successfully treated George Clooney's condition. 'Back with a vengeance' \nHowever, David is yet to resume his former life and says since developing CSF leak, he has lost his job and found that the only way he can get relief is by lying down. \n\"When you're lying down, you don't have [the symptoms] or they're much reduced,\" he said. \n\"But as soon as you sit up or stand up, they come back with a vengeance. \n\"It is that element that makes it such a disabling condition and you just can't live your life like that.\" \nDavid said that was one of the cruellest elements of CSF leak. \nHe said: \"You can feel like you can get up and go to work, you can live your life. \n\"But as soon as you sit up, it's like an egg timer, it's only a matter of time before these horrific symptoms come back and force you back to bed again. \n\"It's a very tough one to live with. It's very disabling for many people and for most it's certainly very life-changing.\" Image caption David was treated by Dr Wouter Schievink, who also treated George Clooney \nIn the past two and a half years, David has left home no more than 10 or 15 times and most of that has been on a stretcher or in an ambulance to go for treatment or scans. \nAfter first developing his life-changing headache, it took three months for David to be diagnosed. \nHowever, he was one of the lucky ones. On average Scots with CSF leak face a 13-month wait before they know what is wrong with them. \nJames Walkden, a neurosurgeon who is now helping to treat David, said there was much to be done to educate medical staff on CSF leak. 'Early stage' \nHe said: \"I have to say the teaching about this condition at medical school and even at post-graduate is zero. \n\"It's really only a small sub specialist area of neurosurgery or neurology that even recognises this condition and that's why unfortunately there's often multiple visits to medical professionals, multiple mis-diagnosis before they reach somebody who does understand this condition. \n\"But by then months have turned into years and your success rate of the investigations and the treatment diminishes as time goes on. \n\"So, it's not that we're stumped, it's unfortunately recognition of this condition at an early stage and getting the person to the right department with the right expertise.\" \nMore information about the condition is available at the CSF Leak Association .

He said: \"If you're going out for the wild night and you never know where the night is going to take you, we call it free falling. That's called Tom Pettying!

He'd be in our top five of influences for us as a band.\" \nBandmate Charles Kelley added: \"Tom Petty is probably even a bigger influence to our generation of country artists than even some of the traditional country artists, just because that's what we grew up on. Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw... I would say they would put him in their top 10 of artists that influenced them.\" Ryan Adams Image copyright Getty Images \nPetty and Adams both released albums in 2014.

Under the Help to Buy equity loan scheme, people in England trying to buy a new-build property who have a 5% deposit can take out a 20% loan from the government (40% in London) and cover the rest with a mortgage.\nIt is limited to properties costing up to \u00a3600,000, and it must be the only property you own.\nYou don't have to pay any fees for the first five years. After that, you start having to pay fees, which increase in line with inflation.\nAfter 25 years or when you sell the house, you have to repay the loan based not on the amount you borrowed but on how much it is currently worth.\nSo if the value of your home has doubled, then the amount you have to repay the government also doubles.\nThe chancellor will have been talking about only England because housing is a devolved issue.\nThere are similar schemes in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, but the chancellor is not responsible for them.\nWhat is the overall picture? A high proportion of Help to Buy equity loans went to first-time buyers - but what sort of proportion of first-time buyers is that overall?\nClick to see content: help_to_buy The housing charity Shelter has criticised the scheme, saying Help to Buy has \"barely helped the first-time buyers it is targeted at\".\nUK Finance (which used to be the Council of Mortgage Lenders) says that overall for the period 9.6% of first-time buyers used a Help to Buy equity loan.\nThat's an average figure - in the most recent quarter for which we have figures, it was almost 15%.\nAnd of course you need to bear in mind that the equity loans can be used to buy only new-build properties.\nEarlier this year, analysis by BBC News found one in three new-build properties outside London - but just one in 10 in the capital - had been bought through Help to Buy.\nRead more from Reality Check\nFollow us on Twitter", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "philip hammond", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council of mortgage lenders", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wales", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern ireland", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:04:23.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f094c47035d8732aee405d67510ffcd6195027d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vGYg.iMhCLYQ1U2jfI9AmFJmBtLY3qBh6x", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "UK construction activity shrinks on uncertainty - BBC News", "title_full": "UK construction activity shrinks on uncertainty - BBC News", "published": "2017-10-03T13:54:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.317, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/8612/production/_98122343_construction2.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 53, "comments": 0, "shares": 53}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 82}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f094c47035d8732aee405d67510ffcd6195027d1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vGYg.iMhCLYQ1U2jfI9AmFJmBtLY3qBh6x", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T13:54:00.000+03:00", "title": "UK construction activity shrinks on uncertainty - BBC News", "text": "UK construction activity contracts amid 'uncertainty' 3 October 2017   Image copyright Getty Images Activity in the UK construction sector contracted for the first time in 13 months in September, according to a closely watched survey. \nThe IHS Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI ) for the sector fell to 48.1, below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. \nThe survey found \"political and economic uncertainty\" had affected the commercial property industry. \nIt also reported a \"steep\" fall in civil engineering work. \nThe survey found that new construction work had fallen for the third month in a row, which it said was the longest period of decline since early 2013, excluding the drop-off in work following the EU referendum last June. \nSome companies said the fall in civil engineering work - the steepest for almost four-and-a-half years - was due to a lack of new infrastructure projects to replace completed contracts. 'Fragile confidence' \nIHS Markit said that house building was the only area of construction which showed a rise in activity last month, but added that momentum had eased because of \"worries about less favourable market conditions ahead\". \n\"Fragile client confidence and reduced tender opportunities meant that growth expectations across the UK construction sector are... among the weakest for four-and-a-half years,\" said IHS Markit's Tim Moore, the author of the report. \n\"At the same time, cost pressures have intensified, driven by supply bottlenecks and rising prices for imported materials.\" UK annual growth rate revised down \nHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: \"There is the particular concern that potential clients will be cautious over committing to major projects if economic, political and Brexit uncertainties remain elevated over the coming months. \n\"Construction companies will be hoping that recent government measures aimed at boosting infrastructure and housebuilding have a material beneficial impact.\" \nOn Monday, the PMI survey for manufacturing indicated that the pace of growth in the sector slowed slightly last month, with a reading of 55.9 compared with 56.7 in August. \nAs a consequence, Mr Archer said that \"much attention\" would now be focused on the PMI survey for the service sector, which is due to be released on Wednesday. The service sector accounts for about three quarters of the UK's economy.

Fees frozen \nThe reasons behind the gender difference in applications for university places are disputed - but for Maya, tuition fees were not going to be a deciding factor. \n\"If they had carried on increasing, I'd be thinking a bit harder. But I see it as an investment in what I want to do with my life,\" she said. Image caption Natalie is starting university as tuition fees in England are frozen \nMaya, a student from Hastings, is starting at Oxford University in the week when Theresa May announced a freeze in tuition fees at current levels of \u00a39,250. \nShe says she backs the cap and the prime minister's next step should be to cut the interest rate for student loan repayments, which has been increased this autumn to up to 6.1%. \nMaya was eligible for free meals while at school and was supported by a social mobility charity, the Villiers Park Educational Trust, which mentors potential university applicants. \nShe says that in applying to a university such as Oxford, it helped her to \"feel like a I have a right to be here\" and that \"this is not a closed world\". 'Good investment' \nNatalie Whitham, from Accrington, was also supported by Villiers Park. None of her family has previously been to university, but she is starting this week at Oxford. \nShe thought hard about the cost before applying and is glad the latest rise has been cancelled. \n\"The fees would have been a large aspect of why I wouldn't have gone,\" she says. \nBut like so many other female students, she decided that university was worth pursuing. \n\"I would definitely say it's a good investment.\" \nThe overall number of students has climbed consistently in recent decades - and is now within touching distance of the 50% target of young people set by Tony Blair when he was prime minister. \nNick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, has published a report saying that a changing economy needs even more graduates and in fact 70% of people should enter higher education. \nBut any further increase will depend on getting more boys into university. Why are there more women students? \nMary Curnock Cook, former head of the Ucas admissions service, believes the widening gender gap is becoming a bigger educational divide than between rich and poor. \nShe has warned that if current trends continue, the next generation of girls will be 75% more likely to go to university than their male peers. \nThere are many theories about what's behind the trend, including: Female students get better A-level results and so are likely to get more university places. Nursing has been made a graduate profession , and with its very high proportion of women entrants, this has pushed up overall female student numbers. An exam system based on coursework rather than final exams, which tended to favour more consistently conscientious girls. This is now being reversed in schools, but will take a number of years to show any impact.

Michael Carberry has played six Tests for England with a highest score of 60 Former England opener Michael Carberry will replace Mark Cosgrove as Leicestershire captain next summer, BBC Radio Leicester understands. \nLast week, Foxes chief executive Wasim Khan promised \"wholesale changes\" after a winless season in Division Two of the County Championship. \nCosgrove joined the Foxes ahead of the 2015 season and has been Championship captain for the last three seasons. \nCarberry arrived on loan in August and signed a two-year contract last month. \nLeicestershire finished bottom of Division Two with nine defeats in 14 matches. \nAustralian pace bowler Clint McKay, who has now left the club, was limited-overs captain in 2017, but they failed to reach the knockout stages in the One-Day Cup. \nHowever, they did qualify for the quarter-finals of the T20 Blast before losing to Glamorgan by nine wickets. Mark Cosgrove scored 1,112 runs in the Championship last season at an average of 48.35 Analysis \nBBC Radio Leicester's cricket commentator Richard Rae \nIt is an interesting decision. Cosgrove has been superb as a player in his time with Leicestershire and one hopes - although he has a contract for the next two years - it won't affect his view of coming back next season. \nI think he's committed, he's that sort of player. He had the support of the dressing room and many people will be slightly surprised at the decision. \nI think he will be a little bit hurt because Cosgrove himself can't be blamed for what happened this season and the players both liked and respected him - and obviously wanted him to stay on as captain. \nThis is no reflection on Michael Carberry, who is a very impressive man, but Carberry hasn't had a great time since he came to Leicestershire. \nHe hasn't impressed with the bat, but he thinks about the game a lot and perhaps the club want a really fresh start across the board.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Catalonia: Your questions answered What has happened recently in Catalonia? \nOn the 1st of October 2017 an unofficial vote took place in Catalonia over whether or not the region should break away from Spain and become an independent country. \nThe region currently has some powers to make decisions about how it is run, but it is still part of the country of Spain. This is called being an autonomous region of Spain . \nThis referendum vote was organised and supported by the region's government, of which Carles Puigdemont is in charge. Image copyright European Photopress Agency Image caption Many people gathered in support of Catalonia remaining as part of Spain \n2.2 million people were reported to have voted out of the 5.3 million people who could have voted. According to the Catalan authorities, just under 90% of those who voted backed independence. \nHowever, the national Spanish government said the vote over whether or not it should become fully independent was illegal and it sent police to try to prevent it from happening. \nThere were lots of protests after people disagreed with the violent way that the police tried to stop what was happening. Image copyright AFP Image caption Many people have protested both for and against independence for the region \nAfter the vote had happened, at one rally 350,000 people gathered in Barcelona - the capital of Catalonia - to protest against independence from Spain. They waved Spanish and Catalan flags and carried banners saying \"Together we are stronger\" and \"Catalonia is Spain\". \nAlthough reports say most people in the region didn't actually vote, the result backed independence. \nFollowing the vote, the leader of the Catalan region - Carles Puigdemont - said he does want Catalonia to be independent, but that he would put off making any big announcements until he could have talks with the government of Spain, to see if they could resolve the situation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption On Thursday, Carles Puigdemont gave a speech in which he said that there would not be early elections in the region \nFollowing this, Spain's Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said he would trigger Article 155 of the Spanish constitution. Doing this would allow the Spanish government based in the city of Madrid to take over from the leaders in Catalonia without their permission. \nBut before the Spanish Government could do this, the Catalonian parliament held a vote and declared independence. How did we get to this point? \nTo understand what is happening now in Catalonia, it is important to understand a bit about the history of the area. \nCatalonia is a wealthy region in the north-east of Spain, with a population of about 7.5 million people. That's almost as many as the number of people who live in country of Switzerland. \nCatalonia has its own language and culture, and Barcelona - a popular city for tourists to visit - is its capital city. \nThe region has a history which dates back almost 1,000 years. \nBefore the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), Catalonia was able to make some decisions about how it was run. This is called being autonomous. \nBut when the dictator General Francisco Franco ruled Spain from 1939 to 1975, it lost this autonomy. \nAfter Franco's death, how Spain is run was reorganised and the area was given its autonomy again. Why the referendum? Image copyright AFP \nSome people think that Catalonia still doesn't have enough freedom and power from the Spanish government and that it should be allowed to run itself completely. \nThey believe people who live there should get to vote on this issue - a bit like when Scotland voted over whether or not it wanted to be part of the UK. \nPressure has grown over the last five years for the Spanish government to allow this vote to happen, but the Spanish prime minister has refused, saying it goes against the constitution of Spain, which talks about the \"unity\" of the country. \nThere are also many people who do not agree with the idea of Catalonia becoming independent. \nThey say it already has lots of freedom to run itself, along with other areas of Spain, like the Basque country and Galicia. \nIn 2015, politicians who support independence won the regional election. They said they would work on ensuring an official referendum happened that Spain would have to act on. What happened after the vote? \nAfter the national Spanish courts banned the vote and the government sent national police and the Guardia Civil (military staff who do police duties) to the area to prevent it from happening, there was a lot of violence between those who wanted to vote and the authorities trying to stop it. \nThey arrested Catalan officials, blocked people from voting, took ballot papers and seized ballot boxes from polling stations, which had been set up for people to vote. \nThis led to fighting between the people voting and the police. Many people in Spain, and all over the world, were shocked by how violent things became, as it was really unexpected. Image copyright EPA \nTV reports showed people being kicked and aggressively dragged away from polling stations. Some police officers were seen firing rubber bullets, hitting people with batons and pulling women by their hair. \nMore than 900 people were hurt, including 33 police officers. \nThe violent methods used to stop people from voting made a lot of people very angry. Media playback is unsupported on your device Kids tell us what they think about Catalan independence \nThe national Spanish government's representative in Catalonia apologised to those who were injured. \nSince the vote on 1 October, there have been protests by people on both sides of the argument about what has happened. \nA little more than a week after the vote happened, Carles Puigdemont signed a declaration of independence but he paused it taking effect so he could talk to the Spanish government to try to sort out the situation. \nBut the Spanish government said it would trigger Article 155 of the constitution. Article 155 gives permission for the Spanish government to take over from the Catalan government. \nIn response, the Catalonian Parliament held a vote and declared independence. Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government has stripped Catalan over its powers after the region declared their independence \nThousands celebrated the declaration of independence on the streets of Barcelona, Catalonia's capital. \nThere were also demonstrations with protesters in Barcelona waving Spanish flags and saying that they wanted to stay part of Spain. \nOn 27 October, the Spanish government stripped Catalonia of its special powers and took charge of its government. \nThey fired Catalan leaders and also took control of Catalonia's police. \nThe Spanish Prime Minister, Mariano Rajoy, has said there will be regional elections in December.

It's not about Boris Johnson. He sucks the oxygen, grabs the attention, \"the blond one\" excites the Tory crowds, as well as driving his colleagues up the wall with his behaviour.\nToday in a speech about \"the lion that will roar\", (wonder what he's trying to say there?) activists may cheer him and colleagues will gnash their teeth as, in a way only he can, he tickles the party's tummy.\nThe fuss around Boris Johnson is the symptom not the cause. The problem that is increasingly on people's minds at this grisly conference is that the Tories might be only at the start of a decline, which becomes impossible to escape.\nOne former minister says, \"there is a smell of decay\", another, that it is \"hopeless, but we are resigned to the nightmare\".

Another says she looks \"bent and broken\".\nBut there is little evidence yet that there is anyone willing or brave enough to confront this publicly, the younger generations of Tory MPs are furious with the top brass, but none of them yet ready to step up to the plate.\nFor now, Mrs May's glum cabinet colleagues mostly believe the best option is to get behind her, to show loyalty with the hope of regaining authority to govern, the slow grind of government competence could restore credibility over time.\nThese are unpredictable times. One minister even told me they feel optimistic about the next election, believing the Corbyn phenomenon can't sustain for five years.\nBut in government and on the backbenches and in Manchester, optimism is a minority view. Stopping the slide the priority.\nThe fear here is not really that Boris Johnson is grabbing all the attention, it's that this party could be dying inside, and it finds itself with a leader who might struggle to stop the downward spiral.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "corbyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gordon brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mrs may", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "downing street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:38:44.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "37420f49d2a40a2b9c7f7bbe1c32e25b562384b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vGJr3nL1DV7Ewv5ixdO2CeH9sdAQ1tJqjZ87SewbMbAD0N6NO3JKONyeyOY6pKLNlGpNTxSCQEmQjHEdUnKr7q3VRu9XJHs.4LN3wSJycKslw-", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/education/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BBC News -

'I thought my whole family would die' \nThe family first met Barley after Mrs Wilkinson decided \"off-the-cuff\" to help him when she saw him trying to keep warm in a cardboard box while she was out shopping. \nShe helped him find accommodation and arranged daily meals for him, while her husband went on to employ him as a labourer in April last year. \nHe left the company on \"amicable terms\" last September after he began to take drugs. Image copyright West Midlands Police Image caption Aaron Barley admitted the two murders on what would have been the first day of his trial \nProsecutor Karim Khalil QC told the court Mr Wilkinson was \"naturally intent\" on trying to continue to support Barley and his work colleagues \"spent a huge amount of time and effort trying to find ways to support the defendant\". \nBut despite this he went on to attack the family just months later. 'Acting like a ninja' \nMr Khalil said Barley killed Mrs Wilkinson in her bed and attacked Pierce in his room while Mr Wilkinson was out walking the dog on the morning of 30 March. \nHe had hidden in the garden shed overnight after failing to gain entry to home he once shared with the family. \nCCTV played to the court showed him emerging from the shed with a hammer as Mr Wilkinson returned home. \nBrandishing a knife over his head, he shouted \"Die you bastard\" as he stabbed Mr Wilkinson a total of six times - twice in the face, twice in the abdomen and twice in the back, the court heard. \nBarley, described as a \"compulsive liar and manipulator\" with 21 previous convictions, wore a balaclava and was clad entirely in black, even covering his yellow trainers in black socks. \nMr Khalil said Mr Wilkinson described the defendant as \"acting like a ninja\". \n\"He realised immediately who his attacker was\", he said.

Pierce's sister Lydia was at university at the time \nThe couple's daughter Lydia, 19, was away at Bristol University at the time. \nShe said she was warned to expect the worst and when she saw her father hooked up to \"countless machines\" she doubted he would survive. \nWhen he did eventually regain consciousness, Mr Wilkinson did not know his wife was dead and was unaware his daughter had been to the mortuary to identify her mother and brother. \nBoth the family and police said they did not know what Barley's motive was. 'Mother I never had' \nMr Wilkinson said he had shared a \"curry and a couple of bottles of beer\" with Barley about a month before the attack. \n\"The next time I saw him he was sticking a knife into my shoulder,\" he said. \nHe said Barley had joined the family on Christmas Day last year and he wrote a card to his wife that said 'To the mother that I never had'. \n\"My wife was very caring and he treated her a bit like a second mother,\" he added. \nHe suggested that Barley, whose parents died when he was young, knew his life was \"going bad ways\" and wanted to take it out on the people that had \"cared and looked after him\".

We want to try to get to finals on a regular basis. \n\"It's really competitive to try to get into the national team now and that's what we want it to be. \n\"There should never be an assumption that you're going to be selected, you have to merit that. We've got a critical mass of players who are doing well. \n\"Every position is up for grabs, and it should be. We'll assess while we're away and see how they've been doing for their club prior to us going away.\" Scotland squad \nGoalkeepers: Lee Alexander (Glasgow City), Jenna Fife (Hibernian), Shannon Lynn (Vittsjo GIK) \nDefenders: Rachel Corsie (Seattle Reign), Chloe Arthur (Bristol City), Jennifer Beattie (Manchester City), Joelle Murray (Hibernian), Kirsty Smith (Hibernian), Sophie Howard (TSG 1899 Hoffenheim), Emma Mitchell (Arsenal), Rachael Small (Hibernian) \nMidfielders: Erin Cuthbert (Chelsea), Caroline Weir (Liverpool), Leanne Crichton (Glasgow City), Jo Love (Glasgow City), Hayley Lauder (Glasgow City), Lucy Graham (Hibernian) \nForwards: Lisa Evans (Arsenal), Jane Ross (Man City), Lana Clelland (UPC Tavagnacco Femminile), Claire Emslie (Man City), Fiona Brown (Eskilstuna United), Christie Murray (Doncaster Rovers Belles) Share this page ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "shelley kerr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lucy graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirsty smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane ross", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "signeul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenna fife", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachael small", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jenny beattie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chloe arthur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiona brown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jennifer beattie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma mitchell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kerr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lana clelland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joelle murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline weir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hayley lauder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leanne crichton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna signeul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shannon lynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoffenheim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erin cuthbert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jo love", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel corsie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophie howard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "claire emslie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee alexander", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christie murray", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "seattle reign", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liverpool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eskilstuna united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hibernian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arsenal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chelsea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doncaster rovers belles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upc tavagnacco femminile", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarus scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "man city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bristol city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:49:10.016+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "94e04825ab238468f9bc567cf06c9de7c9794e88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qTFKuotOyjUAkL_Vr.4xc66enZ73rf.DKT.UCxdKnmfC", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "BBC Radio 4 - World at One, 03/10/2017", "title_full": "BBC Radio 4 - World at One, 03/10/2017", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.017, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1200x675/p025k4wn.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "94e04825ab238468f9bc567cf06c9de7c9794e88", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qTFKuotOyjUAkL_Vr.4xc66enZ73rf.DKT.UCxdKnmfC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "BBC Radio 4 - World at One, 03/10/2017", "text": "What was the British PR firm's role in South African politics?

How did the attack unfold? \nThe final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. \nAccording to police, Paddock had booked into the hotel four days earlier, on 28 September, reportedly using some of Ms Danley's identity documents.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's David Shukman explains how fracking works Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a technique used to recover gas and oil from shale rock by drilling down into the earth before directing a high-pressure water mixture at the rock to release the gas inside.\nWater, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well, where it can be collected.\nFracking allows drilling firms to access difficult-to-reach resources of oil and gas, and has been credited with significantly boosting US oil production.\nBut opponents point to environmental concerns raised by the extensive use of fracking in the US.\nThey say potentially carcinogenic chemicals used in the process may escape and contaminate drinking water supplies around the fracking site, although the industry argues any pollution incidents are the results of bad practice, rather than an inherently risky technique.\nThere have also been concerns that the fracking process can cause small earth tremors.\nAnd campaigners say the transportation of the huge amounts of water needed for fracking comes at a significant environmental cost.\nHow much shale gas is there in Scotland? Image copyright PA According to a British Geological Survey report published in 2014 , there are \"modest\" shale reserves under east Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, Midlothian, north Edinburgh, East Lothian and Fife - many of which include some of Scotland's largest towns.\nThere was estimated to be about 80 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in central Scotland compared to 1,300 trillion cubic feet in the north of England.\nThe report also said the amount of oil and gas which could be commercially recovered was likely to be substantially lower.\nIneos, which operates the huge Grangemouth petrochemical plant in central Scotland, holds fracking exploration licences across 700 square miles of the country.\nThe company has also started shipping shale gas ethane to Grangemouth from the US.\nIts chairman, Jim Ratcliffe, has previously claimed a domestic shale gas industry could secure Scotland's energy supply in the future and revitalise the country's industrial heartlands , with Grangemouth becoming a \"new Aberdeen\".\nBut Prof John Underhill, an expert at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, published research in August which he said showed that the geology of the British Isles made large scale hydraulic fracking unviable.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john underhill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul wheelhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wheelhouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holyrood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim ratcliffe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david shukman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicola sturgeon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "heriot-watt university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "british geological survey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "snp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scottish parliament", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ineos", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "scotland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north lanarkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holyrood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west lothian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glasgow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edinburgh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east lothian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midlothian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south lanarkshire", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:54:46.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "bb2e79bd388ea9ede408ff71d2a7e1a3e42ecdf3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vG6J.KeLe8xezW4x7O1QXK0MuPaO2jyWqdkpyNP.1SRUM-", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/asia/india/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BBC News - India", "title": "Taj Mahal left out of an Indian tourism booklet", "title_full": "Taj Mahal left out of an Indian tourism booklet", "published": "2017-10-03T15:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/17A17/production/_98119769_hi029320149.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6387, "comments": 0, "shares": 6387}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "bb2e79bd388ea9ede408ff71d2a7e1a3e42ecdf3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vG6J.KeLe8xezW4x7O1QXK0MuPaO2jyWqdkpyNP.1SRUM-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T15:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Taj Mahal left out of an Indian tourism booklet", "text": "Taj Mahal left out of an Indian tourism booklet By Chris Bell BBC UGC and Social News 3 October 2017 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel The Taj Mahal has been controversially excluded from an Uttar Pradesh tourism booklet. \nThe booklet, issued by the tourism department, was not intended to be a promotional brochure, but the omission of one of the seven wonders of the modern world has nonetheless sparked anger and bemusement. \nJournalists, politicians and activists were among those who took to social media to decry the 17th Century mausoleum's absence. \nThe popular tourist attraction, located in the Agra district of Uttar Pradesh, has been mentioned on Twitter more than 12,000 times in the last 24 hours.

May: I don't want cabinet of 'yes men' \nThere are also concerns the UK's withdrawal from the EU in 2019 could put further pressure on numbers. \nMr Hunt told the Conservative Party conference in Manchester that staff numbers were one of his \"most important priorities\" and the government was committed to supporting what he said would be the \"biggest expansion\" of nursing training in the history of the NHS. \nAs well as increasing the number of places on full-time university courses, he said he wanted to triple the number of nursing associates - existing health service workers training as nurses - able to work on NHS wards.

Tory cuts to local authority budgets have led to falling care quality, cuts to care services and people stuck in hospitals because there is no care available for them in their community.\" Related Topics ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:17:56.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4e137ad04982c6978823c436aa20b2e12657cae2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vG8.mOzsYef_7GTEVBiMPHxF2puPlCGoyPFtv0.mUpvjzamYoY8ULyR1U7ZH0tASZUzx81rDTlI_RZUGqfRYtBu774h6..j5iR8u39PATtkLwCVC5pePQrZA--", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/politics/rss.xml?edition=uk", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BBC News - UK Politics", "title": "Rees-Mogg protest debate: Shabbir Lakha and Tim Stanley", "title_full": "Rees-Mogg protest debate: Shabbir Lakha and Tim Stanley", "published": "2017-10-03T16:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/164E2/production/_98126319_p05hyd2f.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 347, "comments": 0, "shares": 347}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4e137ad04982c6978823c436aa20b2e12657cae2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qUeg0cTQg9vG8.mOzsYef_7GTEVBiMPHxF2puPlCGoyPFtv0.mUpvjzamYoY8ULyR1U7ZH0tASZUzx81rDTlI_RZUGqfRYtBu774h6..j5iR8u39PATtkLwCVC5pePQrZA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "Rees-Mogg protest debate: Shabbir Lakha and Tim Stanley", "text": "  Rees-Mogg protest debate: Shabbir Lakha and Tim Stanley \nConservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg was confronted by protesters at an event outside the Manchester conference venue, and decided to debate with them. \nShabbir Lakha, from the People's Assembly Against Austerity who faced the MP, said it was not just a few people but the \"vast majority\" of the British public who were being hurt by \"evil\" Conservative policies. \nHe debated his claims with The Telegraph's Tim Stanley on the Daily Politics.

Fifa's disciplinary committee has been issuing sanctions and warnings for offences during 2018 World Cup qualifying Fifa has handed out punishments to eight African nations for various offences committed during September's 2018 World Cup qualifiers. \nGabon fielded an ineligible player - Merlin Tandjigora, who should have been suspended - in the 3-0 home defeat by Ivory Coast on 2 September. \nThe Panthers effectively escape with a fine as the main sanction for the error is to forfeit the match 3-0. \nSeveral teams suffered similar sanctions in 2014 World Cup qualifying. \nMeanwhile, the Nigeria Football Federation has been fined just over US$30,000 and issued with a warning after fans invaded the pitch when they beat Cameroon 4-0 on 1 September. \nDR Congo were also given a warning and also handed a major fine, forced to pay Fifa around US$20,000, for incidents during their match against Tunisia on 5 September. \nFifa ruled that there had been \"improper conduct among spectators - throwing objects [bottles] and letting off incendiary devices\" at the match, which ended 2-2, in Kinshasa. \nThe Congolese federation was also sanctioned for failing to fly national flags at the stadium and for not displaying a mandatory \"central advertising board\". \nThere was a US$15,000 fine and a warning for Mali after their home match against Morocco also suffered from \"improper conduct among spectators - throwing objects [bottles and chairs]\". \nElsewhere, Zambia must pay US$7,000 after their fans threw objects when they played Algeria in Lusaka. \nMorocco's punishment of US$3,000 and a warning was given after spectators whistled during the national anthem ahead of their match against Mali in Rabat. \nBoth Burkina Faso and Senegal were issued warnings for delayed kick-offs in their matches against each other on 2 and 5 September respectively. \nAnd South Africa's Erick Mulomowandau Mathoho had his suspension for a straight red card against Cape Verde increased from one match to two and also fined US$5,000. \nHe was dismissed in Praia for kicking out at an opponent after the ball had already gone into touch and missed the return match a few days later through suspension. \nThe increased ban means Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter had to drop him from his squad to face visiting Burkina Faso on Saturday. \nHe has been replaced by Cape Town City captain Robyn Johannes, who has earned his first call-up since 2008.

Image caption Ronald Kidd and Holly Alexander were found dead in their Dundee flat in December 2016 \nA year before he committed the murders the Home Office had served him with a deportation notice on the basis of his convictions. \nGadecki remained at liberty in Scotland after appealing against the move. \nThe High Court in Edinburgh heard that a decision had not been made in the appeal when Gadecki knifed his victims to death. Holly Alexander's mother: 'I hate Scotland' \nMr Kidd, who was 40, and Miss Alexander, 37, were found dead by police in a flat in the city's Rosefield Street on 11 December. \nThe court heard that the alarm was raised after Mr Kidd's electronic tag showed he had not left the property for three days. Image caption The murders took place in a flat in Rosefield Street, Dundee \nWhen officers arrived they found blood splatters in the property, before noticing Mr Kidd in a bedroom doorway. \nMiss Alexander, an American-born mother-of-three, was also found dead. Heroin addict \nPathologist Dr Matthew Lyall later told the court that Ms Alexander had suffered nine stab wounds to her chest and Mr Kidd was found to have been struck with a knife 23 times on his head, neck and torso. \nFollowing the attack, heroin addict Gadecki went back to the flat and took wallets, cash, watches and drugs. \nGadecki had claimed he carried out the killings in self defence after being attacked by the couple. \nHe said he had left a jacket at their flat, which had belonged to his late brother. \nThe killer claimed that Mr Kidd started calling him names and had presented a knife. Gadecki said he managed to get hold of the knife and began hitting his attacker. \nHe then claimed that Ms Alexander ran at him with a blade in her hand and had merely acted to protect himself. Image caption Ms Alexander had movbed to Dundee from New York to open a takeaway \nAdvocate depute Bill MacVicar, prosecuting, said after the verdicts that New York-born Ms Alexander had emigrated to Scotland in 2014 with her husband and children to open a takeaway business in Dundee. \nHe said: \"She was at that time recovering from heroin addiction but unfortunately relapsed and started to abuse heroin again.\" \nHer relationship with her husband broke down. 'Children have no mother' \nGadecki was subjected to abuse from the public benches of the court as he was led off to prison. Image caption Holly Alexander's mother, Lorraine DiPalermo, said she had tried to get her daughter sent home \nHolly Alexander's mother, Lorraine DiPalermo, told BBC Scotland she had begged the police to arrest her daughter to get her away from Ronnie Kidd. \nShe said he was a known drug dealer who was feeding her diamorphine to keep her with him. \nMs DiPalermo also said she had asked doctors to commit her daughter under the Mental Health Act because she had a drug-induced psychosis. \nShe said: \"The police would not arrest her and send her home so now she is dead because of a guy you let in from Poland who was a rapist. I hate Scotland.\" \nMs DiPalermo added: \"The children have no mother. Her husband is a broken lost man.

He's made a judgement call; I disagree with that of course. \n\"We're proud of the work that we'd done there,\" he continued. \"Keeping the club up was probably our biggest achievement, not winning the (League) cup. \n\"To follow that up the following season with a top-six finish was fantastic. That is over-achieving for Ross County. To win the cup was just an incredible journey for all of us.\" \nMcIntyre revealed he held talks over a new contract this summer, and despite a run of five defeats in six league games, felt he was only one result away from keeping County on track for the target set for him. \n\"I was set a target at the start of the season [of finishing] between seventh and ninth. Anything above that was ultra-success. From that side of things, we knew a result at Kilmarnock [where Ross County won 2-0 on Saturday] and you're where you should be. \n\"Roy gave me fantastic backing while I was at Dingwall but equally, we were good for him.

BBC News", "text": "Fresh twist in Facebook data transfer row By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter 3 October 2017 These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Max Schrems asked whether user data being transferred to the US was safe and protected from possible surveillance The Irish High Court has referred a case about the way Facebook transfers user data across the Atlantic to the US to the EU's highest court. \nThe outcome, which could take months to be resolved, could affect thousands of companies who use similar systems. \nIt is the latest twist in a long-running legal dispute between Austrian law student Max Schrems and the social-media giant. \nOne expert said that there was \"much at stake\" in the case. \nThis particular part of what has become the fiendishly complex case of Facebook v Schrems hinges on so-called standard contract clauses (SCCs) and how the social network uses them to transfer data between Europe and the US. \nTechnology companies, many of which have data centres dotted around the globe, need to transfer information between them in order to make sure services run efficiently. \nThe SCCs provide the legal foundation for millions of daily data transfers to the US, Japan, Brazil and many other countries, according to the Business Software Alliance, which acted as an expert in the case. \nIn response to the ruling, Facebook said: \"Standard contract clauses provide critical safeguards to ensure that Europeans' data is protected once transferred to companies that operate in the US or elsewhere around the globe, and are used by thousands of companies to do business. \n\"They are essential to companies of all sizes, and upholding them is critical to ensuring the economy can continue to grow without disruption.\" \nIt urged the European Court of Justice to consider \"the robust protections in place under standard contractual clauses and US law, before it makes any decision that may endanger the transfer of data across the Atlantic and around the globe\". Mass surveillance \nFor his part, Mr Schrems accused the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, Helen Dixon, of passing the buck, claiming that she had \"refused\" to use her power to suspend Facebook's data flows despite agreeing that there could be issues. \n\"It is still unclear to me why the DPC is taking the extreme position that the SCCs should be invalidated across the board, when a targeted solution is available,\" he said. \n\"The only explanation that I have is that that they want to shift the responsibility back to Luxembourg instead of deciding themselves.\" \nMr Schrems argued that Facebook's data transfers were invalid because such data could be read by US intelligence agencies. \n\"In simple terms, US law requires Facebook to help the NSA [National Security Agency] with mass surveillance and EU law prohibits just that,\" he said. \n\"As Facebook is subject to both jurisdictions, they got themselves in a legal dilemma that they cannot possibly solve in the long run.\" \nChief executive Mark Zuckerberg has gone on record to deny that Facebook had any involvement in Prism, a mass surveillance program described in a series of leaks from ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. \nThe Business Software Alliance said that it would argue that SCCs did protect user data. \n\"SCCs include important safeguards to protect users - among them, they grant national data protection authorities the power to review specific implementation of these clauses on a case by case basis,\" said director general of policy Thomas Boue. \n\"We will continue to advocate these perspectives before the Court of Justice of the EU.\" \nTrevor Hughes, president of the International Association of privacy professionals, said that the case was a clear example of privacy versus commercial need and that \"much is at stake\". \n\"The digital economy is based on the flow of data across borders,\" he said. \n\"Many are concerned that restrictions on these flows will limit the growth of economies around the world and create splintered islands for data-driven services. \n\"Others point to the primacy of privacy concerns and the urgent need to rein in data transfers that do not adhere to national expectations. \n\"All eyes are now on Luxembourg, where the court will hopefully decide soon to clear the legal uncertainty in this area.\" \nKevin Cahill, an investigative journalist who has written extensively on the case for Computer Weekly, believes there is much more at stake. \n\"This case completely misses the point, which is criminal and unlawful mass surveillance in the UK by the US internet giants including Facebook,\" he said. \n\"[Irish High Court Judge Caroline Costello] was critical of the situation, but her judgement will do nothing to end it.\" \n\"Judge Hogan, in the Irish High Court, already agreed with Max Schrems that what the US was doing, via the companies, was 'mass and indiscriminate surveillance'... and named Facebook.\" \n\"It is beyond understanding that none of those paid to protect us from an outrage like this have acted for us and our children.\" \nBrief history of Schrems v Facebook Mr Schrems initially filed a complaint against Facebook in 2012, stating that the amount of data being collected on him breached European law It was filed to the Irish regulator (the DPC) because that is where Facebook has its European headquarters The original complaint became more complex in 2013, following revelations from ex-National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about a program dubbed Prism Prism, according to a leaked presentation, was a mass surveillance program that allowed the NSA to receive emails, video clips, photos, voice and video calls, social networking details and other data held by Microsoft, Skype, Google, YouTube, Yahoo, Facebook, AOL, Apple and PalTalk. In October 2015 the European Court of Justice ruled that an EU-US data sharing system dubbed Safe Harbor was invalid and that all transfers of data must end It also ruled that the DPC must investigate Mr Schrems's original complaint Related Topics", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "thomas boue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward snowden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schrems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen dixon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline costello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark zuckerberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin cahill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trevor hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max schrems", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc news fresh", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jane wakefield technology", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "business software alliance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "computer weekly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish high court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ex-national security agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national security agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irish data protection commissioner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "security agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schrems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "skype", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook mr schrems", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dpc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images image", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "court of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nsa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the irish high court", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luxembourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brazil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:57:58.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c664033a3a25b1795700c42e11984ee95e5c6c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qXsKhPHdwxyOAkUTQqB0C95ORvdYtOZn7n8TFK3pFIMW", "site_full": "www.bbc.co.uk", "site": "bbc.co.uk", "site_section": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/sport/0/football/rss.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "BBC Sport - Football", "title": "Lazio: Part of Stadio Olimpico to be closed for two games after racist chanting", "title_full": "Lazio: Part of Stadio Olimpico to be closed for two games after racist chanting", "published": "2017-10-03T17:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/624/cpsprodpb/6C9A/production/_98120872_lazi.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 108, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 698, "comments": 0, "shares": 698}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c664033a3a25b1795700c42e11984ee95e5c6c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qXsKhPHdwxyOAkUTQqB0C95ORvdYtOZn7n8TFK3pFIMW", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T17:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lazio: Part of Stadio Olimpico to be closed for two games after racist chanting", "text": "Read more about sharing.

and reduce costs to the government by about \u00a30.3bn. Lower costs \nAlthough the IFS warns that freezing fees indefinitely is \"unsustainable\" as it would leave universities without adequate funding. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May has sought younger voters with promises over fees \nBut the think tank says that raising the point at which repayments are made will have much bigger savings for students and much bigger costs for the government. \nFor a typical graduate, it would mean graduates pay back \u00a315,700 less over 30 years, before any unpaid loans are written off. \nThis will also mean that 83% of graduates will not pay back all their debts, raising the long-term costs by 41% for the government. \nAccording to the IFS, it would mean that 45% of the value of loans to students would not be recovered. \nChris Belfield, research economist at IFS and author of the analysis, said altering the repayment threshold is a \"seemingly small change\" but it would save students up to \u00a315,700 \"at a considerable cost to the taxpayer\". \nReality Check analysis \nStudent loans are a tricky area for the government because what the IFS describes as \"a big and expensive give-away to graduates\" does not necessarily sound impressive. \nTheresa May's announcement on Sunday that the change in the threshold would be worth \u00a330 a month is correct for 2018. \nIf you're a graduate earning more than \u00a325,000 a year, there is a \u00a34,000 chunk of your income which will no longer be eligible for the 9% loan repayment - that's \u00a3360 a year or \u00a330 a month saved. \nBut on top of that, the threshold which was due to be frozen, is instead going to rise in line with earnings. \nTake the extra savings every month for the 30 years over which loans need to be repaid and you get to the IFS figure of a \u00a315,700 lifetime saving. \nThe government said these changes to the student loan regime would cost an extra \u00a31.2bn between 2018-19 and 2021-22, but it's only later that the costs really start to mount up. \nEach new cohort of students entering higher education each year will cost the government an extra \u00a32.3bn, according to the IFS. \nMore changes may be on the way - the government says it's looking at the entire student finance system over the coming months.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People all over the world have been shocked and saddened by what has happened in Las Vegas in America \nBut one thing that many people are talking about after this incident, is the gun rules in America. \nYou might have questions like, how was the man responsible for the incident able to have a gun to do this? Is it possible for someone to do the same thing in the UK? \nRead on to find out more about the gun laws in America. \nIf you find what happened in Las Vegas upsetting, or if anything else in the news is making you feel sad, click here for advice . What is the situation in America? \nIn America, it's not unusual for people to have a gun. Almost every adult can own or carry one. \nIt is seen as a person's basic right to be allowed to do this. \nThat's because when the USA was founded, the right to buy and carry a gun was written into the constitution - that's a list of basic rules that a country is based on. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In America, it's not unusual for people to own a gun. Almost every adult can own or carry one \nThe only reasons that someone might not be allowed to have a gun would be if they are a convicted criminal, have a mental health illness or if they are not a US citizen. \nThese rules have been in place since 1791, so buying and owning a gun is something that American people have been allowed to do for a very long time. America is divided up in to 50 different areas called states States are allowed to adapt some laws to suit their own residents views USA stands for the United States of America \nHowever rules on gun ownership do vary between different US states and there are special laws to prevent people from having guns in certain places like in, or near, schools. \nIn some states, the rules are less strict than in others. For example, in the state of Nevada, where the Las Vegas attack took place, people do not have to tell anyone that they own a gun. \nThere are also different rules for which different types of guns people are allowed to own and, again, these vary from state to state. How is it different to the UK? \nThe rules are very different in the UK. In fact, the UK has some of the strictest gun laws in the world. \nIn order to own a gun in the UK, a person needs to have a special certificate, called a licence, which is issued by the police. \nYou need one of these to buy ammunition too. \nCertain guns are completely against the law, and you could not buy or own them unless you had special permission from the government. Image copyright Christopher Furlong Image caption The rules for gun ownership in the UK are much stricter than they are in the US \nThe main difference between the rules in the US and in the UK is that people in the UK do not have a fundamental right to have a gun. \nA person has to have a very good reason to have one - and the police have to agree with it. \nThere are also much stricter checks done before a person is allowed to have a gun, which aim to make sure that individual is not dangerous. \nMany believe that strict rules like this are why mass shootings, like the one in Las Vegas, are extremely rare in the UK. What is the debate in America about? \nThere is a lot of disagreement in America about whether or not the current gun laws are right. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption People in America have protested for the gun laws to be changed \nThose who think the rules need to be changed say that shootings like the recent incident in Las Vegas could be prevented if the rules about owning guns were stricter. \nMany say there should be more rules about the type of guns that people are allowed to have and more strict background checks to make sure that dangerous people aren't able to get their hands on weapons. \nThey say that in countries where people aren't allowed to carry guns, fewer people are killed each year by these weapons - so, therefore, America should change its rules. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The right to bear arms in the US is enshrined in the constitution \nHowever, people who don't want stricter gun rules say that it is their right by law to be able to have one. \nThey say they want to be able to use them to protect themselves if they need to. \nThey also say that if guns were banned then criminals would still have them anyway and ordinary people wouldn't be able to defend themselves if they needed to. What will happen now? \nEvery time there is a serious attack involving guns like this, the arguments about the country's gun laws start again. \nEven if a president in America thought the rules should be changed and the gun laws needed to be made stricter, he or she can't just change the rules on their own but would need a lot of support from other politicians, who often don't agree. \nBarack Obama, who was president of the US before Donald Trump, said that not being able to deal with gun control was the greatest frustration of his time in the job. \nBut the current president Donald Trump says he supports gun owners' rights. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US president has said he will \"never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms\" \n\"Let me make a simple promise,\" Mr Trump said in April 2017. \"I will never, ever infringe on the right of the people to keep and bear arms.\" \nSo people right across America cannot agree about what should happen - and it doesn't look like they are going to agree any time soon.
