Please enjoy this virtual interview with Manu BN\n\nThanks for agreeing to this interview. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself? \nHi, I am Manu BN , 28 years old, from Bangalore, India. I work on Image Processing & Computer Vision as a Senior Image Processing Developer at Cocoslab Innovations which is also in Bangalore. MATLAB is my most preferred computing language for my work.\nIn your research on Image Processing & Computer Vision, how do you use MATLAB and how does it make your job easier? \nLet\u2019s say I come up with a new concept to solve a problem in Image Processing. I would like to quickly validate it to check if it works or not. MATLAB has an outstanding toolbox to make the implementation quicker.\nTell me about something interesting you have done with MATLAB? \nI have contributed the highest rated codes in the world to the Open Source Community. All those codes are written in MATLAB. The two papers which I published in IEEE are implemented using MATLAB. Facial features monitoring for real time drowsiness detection is about detection drowsiness of a driver to prevent accidents. Rain removal from still images using L0 gradient minimization technique is about removing rain while preserving the background details.\nWhen did you first get exposed to MATLAB and Simulink? \nI had used MATLAB earlier in my Engineering days. But an in depth use started in my first job, which was at an academic training institute. I was looking at some benchmark codes to teach my students. That is when I started to use File Exchange.\nYour most popular File on File Exchange is Plant Leaf Disease Detection . Can you tell us about this File? \nThis is my favorite submission. Plant Leaf Disease Detection deals with a semi automatic approach to detect disease affected leaves and classify them into the type of disease. The most awesome thing is I wrote it in just two days !!!\n\nWhy do you think this file is so popular? \nAutomatic crop disease detection using Machine Learning is the latest and the hottest research thing in AI based solutions. My code provides a detailed insight into it.\nWhat do you think motivates people to download this file? \nAcademic researchers, students and industry researchers are all into AI based disease identification as manual observations can be tedious and prone to errors. So my code servers to provide an insight into it.\nCan you also tell us about your Brain MRI Tumor Detection and Classification file? What is this File, and what does it do? \nWhen you have a large number of samples of brain tumors it becomes very difficult for a pathologist to examine each and every sample and classify them into the type of tumor. Hence a machine learning algorithm can be used to classify them. The code provides an insight into how a machine learning algorithm can be used, what set of features to choose and how to measure the accuracies.\n\nNot including your own submissions, What is your favorite submission on File Exchange? \nMRI Brain Segmentation by Robert Bemis is one of the all time best submissions which inspired me to work on brain tumors. I seriously appreciate the efforts by the author.\nWhat are the greatest benefits you get out of using MATLAB Central? \nIt\u2019s all about learning, sharing knowledge and helping others to learn. In the long run it benefits everyone.\nWhat\u2019s the most surprising thing you\u2019ve come across on MATLAB Central? \nA veteran named Image Analyst !! He answers almost every single question with a lot of patience and care. It was Image Analyst who inspired me to contribute code to File Exchange.\nImage Analyst has contributed a lot to MATLAB Answers. He also participates on File Exchange like yourself. When the time comes do you think you would try to participate on MATLAB Answers? \nYes. I will. Hopefully I will become as knowledgeable as Mr. Image Analyst.\nWhat\u2019s one of your favorite non-software non-mathematical things to do? \nI watch a lot of action movies in my free time.\nWhat\u2019s your favorite Action Movie? \nRambo: First Blood Part 2. Stallone is my favorite childhood action hero and South East Asia is my most preferred travel destination. This makes Rambo 2 which is shot in Vietnam my all time favorite movie. I am of the strong opinion that 80s action flicks had a lot of innovative action, plot and limited CGI. Which sets them apart from the present day cheesy, CGI filled movies.\nDid you see any Action movies this year? \nAlien Covenant. An average alien action flick. I prefer Alien 2 (1986) . Like I always say 80s had much better movies than now.\n\nThank you to Manu BN for taking the time to participate in this Q&A Blog.\nAlso be sure to check out my colleague Steve Eddins new Blog on MATLAB Central about Deep Learning .\n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-06T00:22:51.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ba38322df6edc42924a59bf1fe5ba86af0978e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ3zz1LJTOiXJMj11wyKrifto_aYfuLiSJ_YYFyju66Z5JtqOXybSFG1Sd7YJNa1Ag-", "site_full": "blogs.mathworks.com", "site": "mathworks.com", "site_section": "https://blogs.mathworks.com/pick", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "File Exchange Pick of the Week", "title": "MockObject", "title_full": "MockObject", "published": "2017-10-06T17:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2186, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ba38322df6edc42924a59bf1fe5ba86af0978e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ3zz1LJTOiXJMj11wyKrifto_aYfuLiSJ_YYFyju66Z5JtqOXybSFG1Sd7YJNa1Ag-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Sean de Wolski", "published": "2017-10-06T17:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "MockObject", "text": "Sean \u2018s pick this week is Mock Object by Paul Sexton . \n\nPaul has provided a mock object that is useful for mocking inaccessible or slow software or hardware while executing unit\ntests. Paul\u2019s MockObject allows for adding methods, and output assignment (based on a call stack), and stores how it was used for later qualification.\nI also like how he\u2019s provided an example that shows the real software he\u2019s testing and the mock object that mocks it. \nIn R2017a, MATLAB came out with a native mocking framework . It is used a little differently in that when you create a mock you get two objects back, a mock instance and a behavior\nobject for the mock. You then modify the behavior to tune how the mock object will behave. \nI\u2019ve recently been using the MATLAB mocking framework for the purpose of mocking a database connection. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve\ndone for one of the tests, albeit mine is inside of a unit test class that inherits from matlab.mock.TestCase .

No loop needed-- which, of course, simply reduces to D=[A1 A2 A3]; It seems way superfluous to return so many copies of the same data just differing by being subsets of the larger -- be far more efficient to just keep one copy and refer to what particular piece(s) are wanted/needed at a given time. -- What is a watch list? \nYou can think of your watch list as threads that you have bookmarked. \nYou can add tags, authors, threads, and even search results to your watch list.

Means that the input block doesn't support numeric datatypes other than those listed specifically. double() is numeric and supported; other numeric types such as signed/unsigned integers of which uint8() is one example, while numeric aren't listed and so can't be used. The solution is to just use variable a instead. -- What is a watch list? \nYou can think of your watch list as threads that you have bookmarked. \nYou can add tags, authors, threads, and even search results to your watch list.

Ultimately I would like a command line option for calling publish() from an m-script. This script will parse my top level m-function, locate all the functions called by the top level m-function and then publish all the lower level m-functions in one .doc or .html file along with the published output of the top level m-function. Hopefully my description is clear. It should be very simple to do.

I'd recommend to first not create so many related variable with similar names; particularly if (as I'll presume) you've got the same number of values in each vector. Use array (or maybe a table) instead; then it's _much_ easier to do things like you want to do here with array syntax. As you have it now, you'd need to write boxplot([MouldGrowthRateInsExt3y(:) MouldGrowthRateInsInt3y(:) ... to concatenate the four above; you mention five but don't give the other variable name, the pattern shouldn't be hard to discern what to do for yet another. :) NB: the (:) is syntax to force column vector so ensure the concatenation will work as given (again assuming lengths are all the same). How much easier it would be if your variable were just mouldGrowth=importdata('MouldDataFile.txt'); and you could get the desired particular type of data by indexing to the proper column instead of having to type such long names explicitly to do anything with any of it. -- Date: 8 Oct, 2017 14:13:49 Message: 3 of 4 On 07-Oct-17 3:13 PM, Kinga Erika Fodor wrote: ...> And, I would also like to ask how to make the lines of the boxplot thicker? Well, per usual, TMW didn't go out or their way to make things simple with some of these compound plots...it's not terribly complicated once one learns something about handle graphics, but it is certainly easy to spend boo-koos of hours fiddling with plots to get a specific effect. Start with the sample group boxplot of the documentation -- load carsmall % load sample dataset boxplot(MPG,Origin) % boxplot grouping on country of origin hAx=gca; % get handle current axes hCh=get(hAx,'children') % what objects were created on the axes? hCh = % turns out there its a bunch of lines <Group with properties:> Children: [42x1 Line] % were six countries (groups) so there Visible: 'on' % there are seven lines per box (which HitTest: 'on' % makes sense--4 box, median, 2 outlier) <Show all properties> >> hCh.Children % look at the properties of the children ans = Line (Outliers) % Ah!

Line (Outliers) % As can see, there are six (6) of each Line (Outliers) % type, one per group (box) Line (Outliers) ... % cut out the duplicates for brevity Line (Box) % of posting... OK, that exercise in \"handle-diving\" gives the information needed to know how to proceed -- presume you want the median line to make the line heavier -- >> hMdn=findobj(hAx,'tag','Median') % handles associated with median hMdn = >> set(hMdn,'linewidth',2) % set their linewidth property >> There's the outline of how to go about modifying the properties of the lines making up the boxplot objects. You can either just do what you want through the command line if it's just a one-time thing or build a function that lets you have a more convenient interface if going to be doing this a lot. You can, of course, also use the property editor on the figure interactively for just a \"one-off\"... -- Date: 9 Oct, 2017 21:07:11 Message: 4 of 4 On 07-Oct-17 3:59 PM, dpb wrote: ...> How much easier it would be if your variable were just>> and you could get the desired particular type of data by indexing to the> proper column instead of having to type such long names explicitly to do> anything with any of it. The above will leave you with just 1:N as xtick labels, though. You'll want to define a vector of titles corresponding to the N variables and then titles=char('Rate Mould A', 'Rate Mould B', ...); % etc., meaningfully set(gca,'xticklabel',titles) What is a watch list? \nYou can think of your watch list as threads that you have bookmarked. \nYou can add tags, authors, threads, and even search results to your watch list.

About Newsgroups, Newsreaders, and MATLAB Central What are newsgroups? \nThe newsgroups are a worldwide forum that is open to everyone. Newsgroups are used to discuss a huge range of topics, make announcements, and trade files. \nDiscussions are threaded, or grouped in a way that allows you to read a posted message and all of its replies in chronological order. This makes it easy to follow the thread of the conversation, and to see what\u2019s already been said before you post your own reply or make a new posting. \nNewsgroup content is distributed by servers hosted by various organizations on the Internet. Messages are exchanged and managed using open-standard protocols. No single entity \u201cowns\u201d the newsgroups. \nThere are thousands of newsgroups, each addressing a single topic or area of interest. The MATLAB Central Newsreader posts and displays messages in the comp.soft-sys.matlab newsgroup. How do I read or post to the newsgroups? \nMATLAB Central \nYou can use the integrated newsreader at the MATLAB Central website to read and post messages in this newsgroup. MATLAB Central is hosted by MathWorks. \nMessages posted through the MATLAB Central Newsreader are seen by everyone using the newsgroups, regardless of how they access the newsgroups. There are several advantages to using MATLAB Central. \nOne Account Your MATLAB Central account is tied to your MathWorks Account for easy access. \nUse the Email Address of Your Choice The MATLAB Central Newsreader allows you to define an alternative email address as your posting address, avoiding clutter in your primary mailbox and reducing spam. \nSpam Control Most newsgroup spam is filtered out by the MATLAB Central Newsreader. \nTagging Messages can be tagged with a relevant label by any signed-in user. Tags can be used as keywords to find particular files of interest, or as a way to categorize your bookmarked postings. You may choose to allow others to view your tags, and you can view or search others\u2019 tags as well as those of the community at large. Tagging provides a way to see both the big trends and the smaller, more obscure ideas and applications. \nWatch lists Setting up watch lists allows you to be notified of updates made to postings selected by author, thread, or any search variable. Your watch list notifications can be sent by email (daily digest or immediate), displayed in My Newsreader, or sent via RSS feed.

Thank you all. Interesting that the front page of the newsreader on matlab central is showing only three replies in this thread. Maybe the assassination has already started. My first reaction is disappointment. I quite like having all of the matlab related resources all in one site. Also, i find Answers somewhat limited in scope. It's marginally ok for how-to type questions, but I can't imagine threads like the speed of the new graphics engine taking place over there. However, it's true that this newsgroup has been withering. Maybe one or two new posts a day lately. I wonder if the reduction in news group activity correlates with when Answers started up.

Today's guest blogger, Matt Tearle, discovered a fun application of one of the many new features - solving a map-based puzzle.\nContents A traveling MathWorker problem Enter MATLAB Problem: who is my neighbor? Solution: the fat of the land Visualizing the results Where to next? A traveling MathWorker problem \"Car Talk\" recently featured a brain teaser submitted by a former MathWorker . The short, slightly modified version is: Loren has to drive from Delaware to every state in the contiguous US, visiting each state exactly once; Loren's boss - let's call him Jack - offers to meet her in the last state, which turns out to be his birthplace; but how can Jack know what the last state will be, without waiting to hear Loren's itinerary?\nI'm about to give away the answer, so if you want to figure it out yourself, do so now. It's OK, I'll wait.\nDone? Great. Hopefully you realized that there's one and only one state that borders only one other state. That state has to be the beginning or end of any path. (You can't visit any state more than once so once you enter from the single neighboring state, you're stuck.) The beginning is Delaware (which borders several other states), so this unique \"degree-one\" state must be the end of Loren's epic journey.\nEnter MATLAB As usual for me, the really interesting aspect of this problem is: can I solve it in MATLAB? This is a classic \"traveling salesman\" problem, so the graph capabilities recently added to MATLAB should be of use. But the first problem is how to build the graph that represents the connections between the states. It turns out that another new feature will help.\nA new variable type for representing 2-D polygons was introduced in R2017b. The polyshape function takes vectors representing x and y coordinates and returns a polygon with those points as its vertices. It so happens that Mapping Toolbox comes with a data file containing the latitudes and longitudes of the borders of the US states - just what I need. With the shaperead function I can import this data in the form of a structure array, with fields for the name of the state and the latitude/longitude of the border:\nstates = shaperead( 'usastatehi.shp' ); % Remove Alaska & Hawaii, and Washington DC states([2,11,51]) = []; \nFor a single state, it's straightforward to extract the arrays in the X (longitude) and Y (latitude) fields and use these as the inputs to polyshape :\nx = states(1).X; y = states(1).Y; p = polyshape(x,y) \np = polyshape with properties: Vertices: [518\u00d72 double] NumRegions: 2 NumHoles: 0 \nNow that the state is represented as a polygon, I can use the functions that can work with polygon, such as plotting:\nplot(p) \nBut to really get the benefit of working with polygons, I'd like to get an array of them, where each element is a polygon representing one state. I could extract the x and y components for each state in a loop, but any time I see myself about to apply an operation to each element of an array, I think \"time for arrayfun !\".\nstruct2poly = @(s) polyshape(s.X,s.Y); % define my struct -> polyshape operation p = arrayfun(struct2poly,states) % apply to all elements of the struct STATES \np = 48\u00d71 polyshape array with properties: Vertices NumRegions NumHoles \nBecause this is MATLAB, functions like plot should work on arrays of polygons, just as well as scalar polygons, right?\nplot(p) \nIsn't that nice? Each polygon is plotted as its own shaded shape. If we zoom in, we can see the solution to the puzzle.\naxis([-75 -66 42 48]) \nProblem: who is my neighbor? By eye we can see how states share borders, but how can we get MATLAB to determine this in an automated way? Let's start with the simplest problem: given two states (polygons), can we determine if they share a border or not?\nme = p(17); ma = p(19); nh = p(27); subplot(1,2,1) plot([ma nh]) title( 'Shared border' ) subplot(1,2,2) plot([ma me]) title( 'No shared border' ) \nThe polygons have a Vertices property that contains the border locations. So a simplistic approach would be to see if the two polygons have any vertices in common. However, this has a lot of potential problems. Firstly, two shapes can share a boundary without sharing vertices:\na = polyshape([0 1 1 0],[0 0 3 3]); b = polyshape([1 2 2 1],[1 1 2 2]); subplot(1,1,1) plot([a b]) intersect(a.Vertices,b.Vertices, 'rows' ) \nans = 0\u00d72 empty double matrix \nSecondly, even if the survey points all align, there's always the potential for floating-point precision issues: how is 31\u00b041'59\" represented?\nlat1 = 31.6997 lat2 = 31 + 41/60 + 59/3600 lat1 == lat2 lat1 - lat2 \nlat1 = 31.7 lat2 = 31.7 ans = logical 0 ans = -3.5527e-15 \nSo a better idea might be to think about it geometrically. Two areas in the plane share a border if their intersection is a line or curve. And the new polygons in MATLAB have an intersect functionality! However, unfortunately, from a programming perspective, the intersection of two polygons is another polygon. And a polygon with zero area (which you get when the intersection is a line) is empty, so there's no obvious way to distinguish between states that share a boundary or not.\nintersect(ma,nh) intersect(ma,me) \nans = polyshape with properties: Vertices: [0\u00d72 double] NumRegions: 0 NumHoles: 0 ans = polyshape with properties: Vertices: [0\u00d72 double] NumRegions: 0 NumHoles: 0 \nFurthermore, this approach would still have been vulnerable to the finite precision problem.\nSolution: the fat of the land The new MATLAB polygons have a polybuffer function that gives you a way to \"fatten up\" a polygon by pushing the border out a given amount. Here's Massachusetts with a 0.1-degree (approx. 7-mile) border:\nmafat = polybuffer(ma,0.1); plot([ma mafat]) \nThis gives a fairly simple, but robust, way to determine whether states are neighbors: put a small buffer around both and then see if there's any overlap.\npfat = polybuffer(p,1e-4); % add ~35 feet around every state me = pfat(17); ma = pfat(19); nh = pfat(27); intersect(ma,nh) intersect(ma,me) \nans = polyshape with properties: Vertices: [541\u00d72 double] NumRegions: 1 NumHoles: 0 ans = polyshape with properties: Vertices: [0\u00d72 double] NumRegions: 0 NumHoles: 0 \nAs you'd expect for a data type that represents polygons, there's an area function that does exactly what its name suggests:\narea(intersect(ma,nh)) area(intersect(ma,me)) \nans = 0.00035462 ans = 0 \nSo determining whether the padded states overlap should be simple: does the intersection have nonzero area? But the programmer in me was a bit worried: should I use a function, like area , that will come with some overhead? Would it be more efficient to directly query the properties of the polygon that results from the intersection?\nHowever, there's another slight wrinkle that needs to be considered before worrying about implementation details. The \"Four Corners\" area of the American Southwest is the one place where four states touch - Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. Does Colorado border Arizona? Does Utah border New Mexico? We can let philosophers and mathematicians argue over that. But unless an infinitely thin Loren is driving an infinitely thin car, the answer, for our purposes, is no. There's no way in reality to drive from Colorado to Arizona without going through Utah or New Mexico.\nplot(pfat, 'LineStyle' , 'none' ) axis([-109.055 -109.035 36.99 37.01]) \nBut if we look at the intersection between the \"fattened\" states, there will be a small overlap between Colorado and Arizona. Note that it will be very small - only slightly bigger than my apartment in graduate school, which should probably be considered a quantum amount of geographic area. Any real border between states will be at least an order of magnitude larger than this. So now we have a simple and robust way to determine whether or not states share a border:\nAdd a small border to all states Compute the area of the intersection of states States share a border if that intersection is greater than a threshold area(intersect(ma,nh)) > 1e-6 area(intersect(ma,me)) > 1e-6 \nans = logical 1 ans = logical 0 \nNow I just need to apply that to every pair of states. I could probably try to get fancy with arrayfun , but this is a case where the simple for -loop approach might be a better idea. In fact, loops can help me avoid redundant calculations. If State A borders State B, then State B borders State A and I don't have to check that.\nborder = zeros(48); for k = 1:48 for j = (k+1):48 % Only need j for ks we haven't checked yet border(j,k) = area(intersect(pfat(j),pfat(k))) > 1e-6; end end \nThe result of this is a lower-triangular matrix of connections. Now I can build a graph from the connectivity matrix and solve the problem. One of the neat graph functions is degree , which gives the number of connections to each node.\nG = graph(border, 'lower' ); histogram(degree(G)) \nSo there's one degree-one node in the graph. That's the one we want. But which state does that correspond to? The names are stored in the Name field of the original structure array. I'll extract them into a cell array by using one of my favorite MATLAB tricks. When indexing produces multiple results (not just an array with multiple elements), those results come back in the form of a comma-separated list. That is, if s is a structure array (for example), s.Thing is equivalent to s(1).Thing, s(2).Thing, ..., s(end).Thing . What's great about having a comma-separated list is that that's the form MATLAB uses for concatenating elements into an array (i.e., [a,b,c] or {a,b,c} ) and for passing inputs into a function (i.e., myfun(a,b,c) ). Hence, I can extract all the Name field elements of the structure array states and concatenate them into a cell array with one simple line of MATLAB:\nstnames = {states.Name}; \nAnd now, finally, I can find out which state borders only one other state:\nstnames{degree(G) == 1} \nans = 'Maine' \nVisualizing the results Having the state names, I can go a little further and visualize both the map and the connectivity graph. To start, it's possible to name the nodes in a graph:\nG = graph(border,stnames, 'lower' ); \nThis is useful when you visualize a graph because the nodes are automatically labeled:\nplot(G) \nBut this graph doesn't show the states in a physical layout. It's also possible to specify the locations of the nodes when plotting a graph, but for that I need a point in each state to use as the node location. Right in the middle of the state would be good... Guess what? There's a polygon function for that: centroid .\n[x,y] = centroid(p); plot(G, 'XData' ,x, 'YData' ,y) \nThat's looking pretty good. It would be nice to add the map for reference.\nplot(p) hold on plot(G, 'XData' ,x, 'YData' ,y) hold off \nNice! Something cool to notice about that code: two uses of plot , both of which were on \"exotic\", non-numeric data types (one polygon array and one graph). This is something that our management team work hard on - making sure functionality is consistent, so that, for example, plot works naturally on different kinds of data. It's a feature of MATLAB I greatly appreciate. It means that I, as a MATLAB user, don't have to expend brain energy on which plotting function, or even which variant of plot , I have to use. I can just use plot and get on with what I'm actually trying to do.\nWhere to next? I solved the brain teaser, and even went a bit further to make a nice visualization of the states and their connections. But there's one thing about my visualization that's still bugging me: the states are colored with seven unique colors in the order that the states appear in the polygon array (which happens to be alphabetical by name). This means that neighboring states are sometimes given the same color. For example, note that Nebraska and the Dakotas are elments 25, 32, and 39, which means they all end up the same color. I happen to recall that there's a mathematical theorem that says that any map can be colored with only four unique colors, such that no neighboring regions have the same color.\nTo me, that sounds like a second interesting task for polygons and graphs,... but a story for another time.

There are several advantages to using MATLAB Central. \nOne Account Your MATLAB Central account is tied to your MathWorks Account for easy access. \nUse the Email Address of Your Choice The MATLAB Central Newsreader allows you to define an alternative email address as your posting address, avoiding clutter in your primary mailbox and reducing spam. \nSpam Control Most newsgroup spam is filtered out by the MATLAB Central Newsreader. \nTagging Messages can be tagged with a relevant label by any signed-in user. Tags can be used as keywords to find particular files of interest, or as a way to categorize your bookmarked postings. You may choose to allow others to view your tags, and you can view or search others\u2019 tags as well as those of the community at large. Tagging provides a way to see both the big trends and the smaller, more obscure ideas and applications. \nWatch lists Setting up watch lists allows you to be notified of updates made to postings selected by author, thread, or any search variable. Your watch list notifications can be sent by email (daily digest or immediate), displayed in My Newsreader, or sent via RSS feed. Other ways to access the newsgroups Use a newsreader through your school, employer, or internet service provider Pay for newsgroup access from a commercial provider Use Google Groups Mathforum.org provides a newsreader with access to the comp.soft sys.matlab newsgroup Run your own server.

One is that this entry does the task that I usually dread doing, which is making finishing touches to my plots. When I want to label some data points, I use the text function. It gives me some control of how to align the text, but it is basically limited to the extent of the text. For example, I can do this\nx = [0 0 0]; y = [.8 .7 .6]; labels = { 'label 1' , 'label 2' , 'label 3' }; plot(x,y, 'o' ) text(x,y,labels, 'VerticalAlignment' , 'bottom' , 'HorizontalAlignment' , 'right' ) \nOr this.\nplot(x,y, 'o' ) text(x,y,labels, 'VerticalAlignment' , 'top' , 'HorizontalAlignment' , 'left' ) \nBut both of these aren\u2019t exactly what I want because the labels slightly overlap the data. Also in the second one, the label goes beyond the bounds of the axes.\nUsually at this point, I fiddle around with the coordinates of the text placements. Very doable, but tedious.\nThis is where Adam\u2019s entry comes into play.\nplot(x,y, 'o' ) labelpoints(x,y,labels, 'SE' ,0.2,1) \n'SE' means southeast placement, 0.2 refers to the offset for the labels, and 1 means \u201cadjust the x/y limits of the axes\u201d. Perfect!\nHe also includes a wealth of options, one of which I found interesting being the option to detect outliers and only placing labels on the outliers. By making user of the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox , he provides different methods for detecting outliers,\nx = 0:0.01:1; y = (0:0.01:1)+rand(1,101); labs = 1:101; plot(x,y, 'o' ) labelpoints(x,y,labs, 'outliers_lin' ,{ 'sd' , 1.5}) \nThe other reason this entry caught my attention was the amount of help and information included in the entry. The first 300 lines of his code are help comments!! He includes many examples to test out all the various options. As you can also see from the File Exchange page, he has been keeping the file up-to-date periodically. I can tell he has put a lot of time and effort into making and maintaining this code. And I\u2019m grateful that he has shared this with the community.

Add the appropriate directory to the MATLAB path and then generate your executable, and execute the script using its name NOT the RUN function.

That sounds like the MEX-file isn't being included in your application. Try explicitly adding it to the command that creates your executable. If that doesn't work, contact Technical Support. -- Date: 19 Sep, 2016 16:46:03 Message: 5 of 8 Flag as spam > Invalid Mex file ,' \\toolbox\\mex\\mex64\\vl_sift.mexw64': THe specified module could not be found. OK. Stuck with this error for three days on a windows 64 bit machine with VS2013 as compiler. I'm providing a solution now. The correct steps are as follows: 1. Run ...toolbox/vl_compile.m 2. Run ...toolbox/vl_setup.m 3. This is the tricky part. Run ...toolbox/mex/mexw64/vl_version.mexw64 (you need to right click this mex file then hit run in Matlab) 4. You are good to go. Feel free to try any demo in the package. Another thing is that this toolbox cannot be compiled in dropbox folder (maybe it only happens to me), so I'd suggest you put this folder on desktop or any local position on your computer. I hope this instruction can help save your time.

What determines the return type of a generated C- function? Example: function res=myfunc(in1, in2, in3) could generate something like (1) void myfunc(double in1, double in2, double in3, double res[]); or (2) double myfunc(double in1, double in2, double in3); If res is an array in the matlab world it looks like it will be returned as a pointer/array in the parameter list. If res is scalar the generated c-function will return that as a scalar. If there are two results, i.e. return parameters, and both scalar, what will happen? Is there a way to force the generation of a void() function in c, returning results as pointers/arrays in any case? Or, asking it differently: What do I have to do that MatlabCoder always generates void() c-functions?

As We know that whenever we specify xlswrite command it starts writing from cell A1 of the excel sheet. Now, my problem is I am carrying out a design calculation for a treatment works. At the end of the design calculation I am storing the variables in the excelsheet using xlswrite command. Now for a set of values of particular variable A , I want to do all the design calculations and then store them consecutively one calculation after the other in excel sheet in different rows. How can we do it. I tried to run for loop but it always stores the data in the first row of the excelsheet so only the last set of data is available through xlswrite statement. Program is a gui,the user will be prompted to enter values which will be calculated using different values of a and b and upon calculation the user will click a button to create an excel file and save the values for about 24 sessions a= handles.edit1; y = a^2 + b; then finally I use xls write to write all these variables in an excelsheet. Now for a range of values for variables and b I want y to be calculated 24 times and store them in the same excel sheet row wise. How can one do it .

About Newsgroups, Newsreaders, and MATLAB Central What are newsgroups? \nThe newsgroups are a worldwide forum that is open to everyone. Newsgroups are used to discuss a huge range of topics, make announcements, and trade files. \nDiscussions are threaded, or grouped in a way that allows you to read a posted message and all of its replies in chronological order. This makes it easy to follow the thread of the conversation, and to see what\u2019s already been said before you post your own reply or make a new posting. \nNewsgroup content is distributed by servers hosted by various organizations on the Internet. Messages are exchanged and managed using open-standard protocols. No single entity \u201cowns\u201d the newsgroups. \nThere are thousands of newsgroups, each addressing a single topic or area of interest. The MATLAB Central Newsreader posts and displays messages in the comp.soft-sys.matlab newsgroup. How do I read or post to the newsgroups? \nMATLAB Central \nYou can use the integrated newsreader at the MATLAB Central website to read and post messages in this newsgroup. MATLAB Central is hosted by MathWorks. \nMessages posted through the MATLAB Central Newsreader are seen by everyone using the newsgroups, regardless of how they access the newsgroups. There are several advantages to using MATLAB Central. \nOne Account Your MATLAB Central account is tied to your MathWorks Account for easy access. \nUse the Email Address of Your Choice The MATLAB Central Newsreader allows you to define an alternative email address as your posting address, avoiding clutter in your primary mailbox and reducing spam. \nSpam Control Most newsgroup spam is filtered out by the MATLAB Central Newsreader. \nTagging Messages can be tagged with a relevant label by any signed-in user. Tags can be used as keywords to find particular files of interest, or as a way to categorize your bookmarked postings.

However, keep in mind that 14 million years of nothingness followed by a particle emmission is still \"random\" over all of that 14 million years. In other words, you seldom want to test for \"randomness\": you usually want to test for a match against one or more distributions, which might not be Uniform or Normal. -- \"Okay, buzzwords only.

Sometimes it is possible to discover a pattern in the random sequence, like for example periodicity. You want to know if you got 50% 1\u00b4s ? But its unlikely that you got \"exact\" 50%! so you must specify some acceptance limit, like it is 95% likeley that we have a 50-50 distribution and so on. Next, there is a classical way of testing \"fake\" random numbers. In these you seldomly see \"unlikely\" sequences like 1 101011101010000100 . The chans that you get 8 0\u00b4s in a row is actually not so small. Its (1/2)^8 If you plot a distribution of connected equals as a function of how many they are \"n\" then the distribution should be roughly 1/2^n. I think you also have <n>=2 and std(n)=sqrt(2), something you could use in roulette red-black system. There is more as well. There are for example an infinite number of expactationvalues you could test for your sequence!

(I tried using NIST > randomness testing suite, but its implementation using > ANSI C is killing me!). Does MATLAB have any built-in > functions to test for randomness?? (I can have access to > any toolbox). You might try RUNSTEST from the Statistics Toolbox: >> help runstest RUNSTEST Runs test for randomness. H = RUNSTEST(X) performs a runs test on the sequence of observations in the vector X. This is a test of the hypothesis that the values in X come in a random order, against the alternative that the ordering is not random. The test is based on the number of runs of consecutive values above or below the mean of X. Too few runs is an indication of a tendency of high values to cluster together, and low values to cluster together. Too many runs is an indication of a tendency for high values and low values to alternate. The result is H=0 if the null hypothesis (\"sequence is random\") cannot be rejected at the 5% significance level, or H=1 if the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 5% level. Beyond that, you could try using one of the tests from Pierre L'Ecuyer's very nice and comprehensive TestU01 test suite which I believe has an option to read values from a file. Hope this helps.

You're doing the rounding at the command line and causing the difference there...with your original post-- >> a= (-z_arb+ sqrt(z_arb^2+ri^2))/2; >> format long So, when you round a to 0.289 and multiply by four, you've already rounded off to only three digits and subsequently the difference between internal an external representations are 4X what are to begin with. Why are you comparing this k1, and an external approximation k2 to begin with? Why not just keep the internal representation in its full precision and continue on your merry way?

About Newsgroups, Newsreaders, and MATLAB Central What are newsgroups? \nThe newsgroups are a worldwide forum that is open to everyone. Newsgroups are used to discuss a huge range of topics, make announcements, and trade files. \nDiscussions are threaded, or grouped in a way that allows you to read a posted message and all of its replies in chronological order. This makes it easy to follow the thread of the conversation, and to see what\u2019s already been said before you post your own reply or make a new posting. \nNewsgroup content is distributed by servers hosted by various organizations on the Internet. Messages are exchanged and managed using open-standard protocols. No single entity \u201cowns\u201d the newsgroups. \nThere are thousands of newsgroups, each addressing a single topic or area of interest. The MATLAB Central Newsreader posts and displays messages in the comp.soft-sys.matlab newsgroup. How do I read or post to the newsgroups? \nMATLAB Central \nYou can use the integrated newsreader at the MATLAB Central website to read and post messages in this newsgroup. MATLAB Central is hosted by MathWorks. \nMessages posted through the MATLAB Central Newsreader are seen by everyone using the newsgroups, regardless of how they access the newsgroups. There are several advantages to using MATLAB Central. \nOne Account Your MATLAB Central account is tied to your MathWorks Account for easy access. \nUse the Email Address of Your Choice The MATLAB Central Newsreader allows you to define an alternative email address as your posting address, avoiding clutter in your primary mailbox and reducing spam. \nSpam Control Most newsgroup spam is filtered out by the MATLAB Central Newsreader. \nTagging Messages can be tagged with a relevant label by any signed-in user. Tags can be used as keywords to find particular files of interest, or as a way to categorize your bookmarked postings. You may choose to allow others to view your tags, and you can view or search others\u2019 tags as well as those of the community at large. Tagging provides a way to see both the big trends and the smaller, more obscure ideas and applications. \nWatch lists Setting up watch lists allows you to be notified of updates made to postings selected by author, thread, or any search variable. Your watch list notifications can be sent by email (daily digest or immediate), displayed in My Newsreader, or sent via RSS feed.

It sounds like a standard sort of optimization problem. Likely, you can use fmincon from Optimization Toolbox. Formulate your problem with a 5-dimensional variable x, where, say, x(1) is the inner radius, x(2) is the inlet blade height, etc. You have to create an objective function f(x), where f is a real variable that measures the badness of your system with variables x, so you want to minimize the badness. In addition, you have some constraints on x, such as positivity, maybe being within certain ranges, and you have that +-10% constraint that I do not quite understand. Then fmincon can tell you the x that minimizes the badness of the system.

MEX function allow you to include C/C++ or Fortran code directly in MATLAB. \nSince I don\u2019t write very much C code myself (I usually cheat and use MATLAB Coder ) it\u2019s nice to see a simple example of how to accomplish a specific task in MEX. Dirk-Jan shows the header files to include (Windows only!) and the process for executing on multiple threads and using a mutex between them to update a percentage complete. \nBy using multiple threads, you can expedite the C code and not have to make memory copies like you would have to by using Parallel Computing . I do a lot of Parallel Computing but some times am asked how to do both multithreading AND parallel computing together. You might want to do both if you have fewer jobs to run than cores available or if memory requirements are high. This is a good example of one way to go about that. You could compile the MEX function and then call it inside of your favorite parallel construct. Of course, many MATLAB functions are already multithreaded so often it will happen implicitly. \nHere\u2019s a look at my Task Manager while running square so you can see the different threads in action. square is also updating the percentage to the command line as it goes. \ny = square(magic(500));\nfinished: 0 finished: 0 finished: 0 : //snip for brevity// : finished: 99 finished: 99 \n\nDo you write C/C++ and need to pull it into MATLAB?

With modern digital image resolutions, it's not hard to imagine having thousands of vertices and therefore millions of pairwise distances to compute.\nThere is a procedure for reducing the number of vertex pairs we can consider. It is based on this theorem:\nThe diameter of a convex figure is the greatest distance between parallel lines of support. [Theorem 4,18, Preparata and Shamos, Computational Geometry , 1985]\nA line of support for a polygon is a line that contains a vertex of the polygon, with the polygon lying entirely on one side of the line.\nLet me show you a picture using the convex hull points from last time.\nhull = [ 2.5000 5.5000 3.5000 4.5000 6.5000 2.5000 9.5000 1.5000 10.5000 1.5000 10.5000 3.5000 9.5000 5.5000 5.5000 7.5000 2.5000 7.5000 2.5000 5.5000 ]; plot(hull(:,1),hull(:,2), 'r' , 'LineWidth' ,2) hold on plot(hull(:,1),hull(:,2), 'r*' ) hold off axis equal axis ij axis([0 15 0 10]) for theta = -55:5:-35 drawFullLine(gca,[9.5 5.5],theta, 'Color' ,[.6 .6 .6]); end \nThe plot above shows five different lines of support drawn through the (9.5,5.5) vertex. Now I'll add some of the lines of support through the (2.5,7.5) vertex.\nfor theta = 10:10:80 drawFullLine(gca,[2.5 7.5],theta, 'Color' ,[.6 .6 .6]); end \nYou can see that there is no line of support for the (2.5,7.5) vertex that is parallel to a line of support for the (9.5,5.5) vertex. That rules out this pair of vertices for computing the maximum Feret diameter.\nNow I'll draw lines of support for a different pair of vertices.\nplot(hull(:,1),hull(:,2), 'r' , 'LineWidth' ,2) hold on plot(hull(:,1),hull(:,2), 'r*' ) hold off axis equal axis ij axis([0 15 0 10]) drawFullLine(gca,[6.5 2.5],-30, 'Color' ,[.6 .6 .6]); drawFullLine(gca,[9.5 5.5],-30, 'Color' ,[.6 .6 .6]); \nBecause the vertices (6.5,2.5) and (9.5,5.5) have parallel lines of support, they are called antipodal vertices . There is an algorithm in the Preparata and Shamos book (referenced above) that finds all the antipodal vertices for a convex polygon. There's an implementation of the algorithm in a function at the bottom of this post. I'll use it to find all the antipodal pairs of the convex hull vertices.\npq = antipodalPairs(hull); \nImportant note : the algorithm in antipodalPairs assumes that its input is convex. Further, it assumes that the input does not contain any vertices that are on the straight line between the two adjacent vertices. To satisfy this condition, compute the convex hull using the call: k = convhull(P,'Simplify',true) .\nNow let's plot the line segments joining each antipodal pair.\nplot(hull(:,1),hull(:,2), 'r' , 'LineWidth' ,2) hold on plot(hull(:,1),hull(:,2), 'r*' ) axis equal axis ij axis([0 15 0 10]) for k = 1:size(pq,1) x = [hull(pq(k,1),1) hull(pq(k,2),1)]; y = [hull(pq(k,1),2) hull(pq(k,2),2)]; plot(x,y, 'Color' ,[.6 .6 .6]); end hold off \nTo find the maximum Feret diameter, we only have to check the distances of these 10 segments, instead of 10*9 = 90 line segments as before.\np1 = hull(pq(:,1),:); p2 = hull(pq(:,2),:); v = p1 - p2; d = hypot(v(:,1),v(:,2)); [d_max,idx] = max(d); p1_max = p1(idx,:); p2_max = p2(idx,:); hold on plot([p1_max(1) p2_max(1)],[p1_max(2) p2_max(2)], 'b' , 'LineWidth' ,2) hold off \nd_max \nd_max = 10 \nAnd there is the maximum Feret distance.\nI am sure that, in many cases, it would be quicker to find the maximum distance by brute force comparison of all pairs off convex hull vertices. The computation of the antipodal pairs does take some time, after all. I have not done a performance study to investigate this question further. However, the antipodal pairs computation is useful for another measurement: the minimum Feret distance.\nI will look at that next time.\nEnd of post \nAlgorithm, visualization, and utility functions used by the code above \nfunction h = drawFullLine(ax,point,angle_degrees,varargin) %drawFullLine Draw a line that spans the entire plot % % drawFullLine(ax,point,angle_degrees) draws a line in the % specified axes that goes through the specified point at the % specified angle (in degrees).

Matlab with a capital \"M\" is a district in Bangladesh. \"matlab\" with a lower case \"m\" is a common word in the Hindi language. Contents matlab, in Hindi Matlab, in Bangladesh \nMatlab is the name of both a rural district in central Bangladesh and it largest city. The population of the district is only about a quarter of a million people, compared to over 160 million in all of Bangladesh. \nFor over 50 years, since the early 1960s, Matlab has served as important laboratory for the study of health issues in impoverished rural areas. The studies began with a hospital aboard a barge floating around the cholera-prone rivers of the district. The Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) was established in 1966. \nAlmost everyone in Matlab has a personal heath identification number and records are kept of births, deaths, marriages, and various illnesses. The relative isolation of the area makes it a nearly self-contained population. Dozens of studies and hundreds of reports and academic papers detail all aspects of public health, especially fertility, reproductive health, maternal and child health, cause of death and child morbidity, health equity, and effects of climate change. \nMatlab played a central role the development of ORS, oral rehydration salts, a home-made mixture of water, salt and molasses that prevents dehydration in children sick with cholera. The British medical journal The Lancet described ORS as \"potentially the most important medical advance of this century.\" \nphoto credit <http://ghes.berkeley.edu > matlab, in Hindi \nIn the Hindi language, the word \"matlab\" means \"means\", as in \"What do you mean ?\". With English characters the word is spelled matlab , but is pronounced a little bit like mutlub .

I though I'd share the one I've used. CANalyzer provides an 'Export' function and supports several data formats, one of which is MATLAB's .mat format. One way to export is to use CANalyzer in 'Offline' mode, open the required log file and run the data. Then, from the Trace window select the signals to export, right click and select \"Import/Export\" then \"Export..\". From the resulting export window click the \"...\" browse button and select \"MATLAB Files (*.mat)\" as the 'Save as type'. I have tended to export each signal individually (as I've only been interested in one or two signals). I didn't have much success with exporting lots of signals ... but I'm sure there will be a way. The result of exporting a single signal is a MAT file with time and value series of data. Once opened in the MATLAB workspace the data series can be manipulated as desired. So, not a slick process but there is definitely a way to get logged data into MATLAB without too much messing about. Hoe this helps someone ... regards ...

You're doing the rounding at the command line and causing the difference there...with your original post-- >> a= (-z_arb+ sqrt(z_arb^2+ri^2))/2; >> format long So, when you round a to 0.289 and multiply by four, you've already rounded off to only three digits and subsequently the difference between internal an external representations are 4X what are to begin with. Why are you comparing this k1, and an external approximation k2 to begin with? Why not just keep the internal representation in its full precision and continue on your merry way? It's introducing that rounded value and then trying to compute the difference that is resulting in the sqrt() of negative number. It's not clear from what you've posted what you're trying to accomplish in the end, but it appears another formulation would be the solution.

Start simple: a greedy coloring algorithm Greed is good? Adding a little intelligence (but with no guarantees) How far can this go? Where were we? In a previous post , I used the new polyshape variable type in MATLAB to determine connections between states. You can see the code in that post. I'll just load in the polygons and matrix of connections that came from that:\nload stateborders % Make a graph of state connections G = graph(border,stnames, 'lower' ); % Obtain centroid locations for states [x,y] = centroid(p); % Plot map and connections plot(p) hold on plot(G, 'XData' ,x, 'YData' ,y) hold off \nHaving made this nice visualization, it struck me that the colors from the default polygon plot weren't making a good map because neighboring states were often given the same color. The plot function, of course, doesn't know about the connections - it is just using a set of colors in the order of the polygons in the array. Using knowledge of the connections between states (stored in the matrix border and the graph G ), I should be able to recolor the states so that no neighboring states have the same color.\nStart simple: a greedy coloring algorithm Note that the actual color is arbitrary. The goal is actually to assign a number to each state. That number can then be used to index into a list of colors (or a colormap).\nA simple (\"greedy\") algorithm to assign colors would be:\nstate 1 is color 1 go through the states in order for each state, find all the neighboring states get the color values assigned to the neighboring states assign the current state the smallest unused value In the last step, if colors 1 through n are used by neighbors, then the number of colors used in the map will grow to n +1. This means that the number of colors used for the whole map will depend on the connections and the order of the states. Let's see what happens if I apply this algorithm to the states in default (alphabetical) order.\nn = length(p); color = zeros(n,1); % Initialize array to hold color numbering numcolors = 1; % Number of colors needed (so far) for k = 1:n idx = neighbors(G,k); % Get neighbors of the kth node idx = idx(idx < k); % But just those that have an assigned color neighborcolors = unique(color(idx)); % Get colors used by neighbors % Assign the smallest color value not used by the neighboring nodes thiscolor = min(setdiff(1:numcolors,neighborcolors)); % If there isn't one, add another color to the map if isempty(thiscolor) numcolors = numcolors + 1; thiscolor = numcolors; end color(k) = thiscolor; end disp([num2str(numcolors), ' colors needed' ]) \n5 colors needed \nFive colors is actually common for many maps.\npolygonplot(p,color) \nI'll be plotting the states with a custom color ordering a few times, so I figured it would make sense to make a short function to do that:\ntype( 'polygonplot' ) \nfunction polygonplot(p,color) % Get a list of colors (using the default plot colors) ax = gca; colors = ax.ColorOrder; % Plot the polygons and change their colors map = plot(p); for k = 1:length(p) map(k).FaceColor = colors(color(k),:); map(k).FaceAlpha = 0.8; % Make the shading darker end \nGreed is good? Five colors is pretty good, but the four color mapping theorem states that you need only four colors to color any map so that no neighboring regions have the same color. However, in true pure math style, the theorem only says it can be done, not how to do it.\nIs there an algorithm I can use to assign colors to the states to achieve a four-color map coloring? It turns out that this is a difficult problem in general. There are algorithms, but they are far more complicated than I want to deal with!\nSo instead, what about just shuffling the order of the states, then applying the greedy algorithm above? I took that code and turned it into a function that takes a graph as input and returns the color numbering and number of colors needed (equivalent to the max of the color numbering) as output.\nNow I just need to shuffle the states and apply the function. But first, the matrix of connections is currently just the lower-triangular part. That structure will be ruined by the shuffling, so I'll make the full matrix version:\nborder = border + border'; \nNow let's try shuffling and see how many colors we need:\nrng(123) % for reproducibility idx = randperm(48); Gperm = graph(border(idx,idx)); [~,nc] = greedycolor(Gperm) \nnc = 6 \nOK, it's working, but that particular shuffle didn't help. It actually was worse. Well, that's random numbers for you. Maybe it's a good idea to see how the number of colors needed are distributed. Let's run the algorithm a bunch of times and see:\nrng(123) nexp = 1000; numcolors = zeros(nexp,1); for k = 1:nexp idx = randperm(n); Gperm = graph(border(idx,idx)); [~,numcolors(k)] = greedycolor(Gperm); end histogram(numcolors) \nInteresting. Most of the time I get five, sometimes I need six, and about 5% of the time I do indeed get a valid 4-color mapping. So a simple way to get a 4-color mapping would be to try random permutations until only four colors were needed. A terrible algorithm? Perhaps. But I bet it works:\nnumcolors = Inf; while numcolors > 4 idx = randperm(n); Gperm = graph(border(idx,idx)); [color,numcolors] = greedycolor(Gperm); end polygonplot(p(idx),color) \nAdding a little intelligence (but with no guarantees) Surely there's a better way, though. Right...? Well, maybe. I did encounter an algorithm for generating 5-color mappings. Basically, remove nodes from the graph one by one, until the nodes of the remaining graph all have degree greater than five. Then... do more stuff, which will color the remaining graph. Then you add the nodes back, coloring them as you go. I didn't really pay attention to the details because it seemed like there was a very good chance that you'd never get nodes with degree greater than five. Every time you remove a node, the degree of every node it's attached to goes down by one. So it seems like you could just try to repeatedly remove the lowest-degree node. Keep the list of nodes in order that you removed them, then use that (or, more precisely, the reverse of it, from last to first) as the ordering in which to color the nodes. It's not guaranteed to work, but it's probably not a bad option to try (and surely more efficient than random permutations). Also, this was for 5-color mappings, not 4, but let's just see what we get...\nG = graph(border,stnames); idx = zeros(n,1); for j = 1:n [~,k] = min(degree(G)); idx(j) = find(strcmp(G.Nodes.Name{k},stnames)); G = rmnode(G,k); end idx = flipud(idx); Gperm = graph(border(idx,idx)); [color,numcolors] = greedycolor(Gperm); polygonplot(p(idx),color) \nAnd just like that, I have a 4-color mapping for the US! In fact, it's not far from being a 3-color mapping! Only three states needed the fourth color. In fact, notice that this approach tries to use the lowest numbers as much as possible\nhistogram(color) \nBut maybe I just got lucky. So let's try this on another map. Feeling brave, I found a world map shape file online. I applied the exact same approach: imported it with shaperead , converted the resulting structure array to a polygon array, used the \"pad-and-intersect\" method to build the graph of shared borders, sorted by iteratively removing the lowest-degree node, then applied the greedy coloring algorithm. The result...?\n\nA 4-color world map! Just like that.\nHow far can this go? As I undertand it, real cartographers wouldn't have much use for my algorithm. There's a definite skew in the colors (e.g., all islands are color #1 because they have no borders), so the result isn't particularly aesthetically pleasing. Are there any amateur (or professional!) cartographers out there who want to try applying a \"real\" map-coloring algorithm using polygons and graphs? I'd love to see your results. I also know there must be maps that break my algorithm, but how well will the algorithm hold up with actual maps in practice, rather than deliberately pathological examples? If anyone has other polygonal maps they want to try coloring with this approach, I'd love to hear how it works.\nAnd, of course, maps and graphs don't have to be just about physical geography - they can be abstractions of any number of things.

Historically there hasn\u2019t been much tooling in Simulink to manage model configurations, especially for variations between simulation runs. STOICAL provides the following features to help out with the configuration management.\nParameter values are available as part of model file Searching and retrieving parameter values Captures errors that occur in simulation runs Manages Simscape Powersystems solver configurations Providing a default choice for variant subsystems Easily enable logging signal lines from a script Use regular expressions to change parameters, signal logging, etc. Enable subsystem variant management using descriptive names Store results from multiple simulation runs in a consistent format Over the past couple of years, a number of features have been released with Simulink to address many of these issues.\nThe following are a couple of my personal favorites:\nData dictionary Model data table PARSIM and the associated SimulationInput object Variant manager Simulink Test I\u2019ll avoid diving into excruciating detail about these new features, sufficed to say that if you\u2019re interested it\u2019s worth checking out the documentation and release notes .\nSTOIOCAL is best suited when modeling system level dynamics. The STOICAL tool does a great job at making model configuration accessible. The methods it uses to achieve this excludes its use from many code generation applications. If you plan on using this for parameter tuning, I would recommend using this only on elements of system models that will not be the source of generated C-code. For example, plant models and environment models.\nAlso the use of regular expressions to quickly identify model elements from the MATLAB Command Line is quite nice. While some progress has been made in this area within Simulink, the command line interface for this type of activity is clunky (see find_system as an example).\nWhat do you think?

I want to creat and display a 3D shell in matlab.(for example a barrel with 100 element) and I have a thickness vector(100*1) that containes the thicknesses of 100 shell elements.so I have an array that containes coordinates of shell nodes and element and a vector that containes thickness of shell element. now how can I display this 3D shell that each element , depend on value of its thickness was different in colour(gray)?.or how can I joint coordinate array and thickness vector or map the thickness vector on the shape of 3D shell and display a gray 3D shell? thank you What is a watch list? \nYou can think of your watch list as threads that you have bookmarked. \nYou can add tags, authors, threads, and even search results to your watch list.
