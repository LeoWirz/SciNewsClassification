R.L. Adams - Guest Writer \nIn business, there are certain fundamentals that must exist for survival. Things like value, trust and company culture should be commonplace. But beyond those fundamental elements, there are five core principles that smart online marketers and seven-figure earners have been using for ages to make millions of dollars, both online and offline. They play into a consumer's psychology, impacting their desires to purchase just about anything. \nThese hypnotic sales strategies, which are often propelled by sizzling sales copy , help to embolden and empower marketers who are truly at the top of their games. And while seemingly incomprehensible at first, when you begin to understand the different levers that are pulled by each of these principles, you'll quickly see how they have a severe influence on the bottom line. The best part? \nIf you're looking to start a business , or you're currently knee-deep in the trenches, you can use these five core principles to market and clinch sales like clockwork. But before I talk about that, it's important to address the art of marketing itself, which dates back to the dawn of commerce. Think about this for a moment. What draws you to purchase something from someone? What compels you to act? \nZig Ziglar once said that, \"People don't buy for logical reasons. They buy for emotional reasons.\" Thus, your job as a marketer or business owner is to create that emotion for them. This happens through the vehicle of a story, authenticity, social proof and many other triggers that will help to influence and persuade a person to buy from you. That's the bigger picture when it comes to marketing. \nHowever, if we're talking about the particulars, there are five core principles that you can leverage to make that happen right now. These will provide the biggest impact on your results. When it comes to the 80-20 rule , you'll likely find these five core principles making up a large part of that 20 percemt of efforts that produces 80 percemt of the results. Study and wield these five principles widely if you're serious about propelling your sales into the stratosphere. 1. Principle of Urgency \nAccording to behavioral psychologists , deliberate thought is suspended when dealing with urgent situations, causing us to act quickly. When something demands your urgent attention, there's an emotional attachment that manifest. Your mind pauses and your heart takes over. Now, you're likely asking yourself how urgency is created online? Well, there are several ways it's done effectively. \nThe first is by using a countdown timer. Time is one primary way that we create urgency. \"Hurry, act now, because this sale expires soon!\" We see it all the time. Bright reds and oranges are used to attract our attention, along with large \"SALE\" letters to help depict that the situation is urgent and time-based. But time isn't the only way that you can use urgency to help sell just about anything online. \nOne primary way that online marketers also use urgency is through negativity. By illuminating an unpleasant situation or potential for pain, you can get people to act on their impulsive tendencies to buy now. Remember that we will do more to avoid pain than we will to gain pleasure. Simply taking away a sale isn't usually enough to cause pain. You have to create an offer so compelling that if the consumer fails to act, it's going to invoke a massive amount of pain. \nHow does this work? Take diet and weight loss for example. Urgency is used in diet and weight loss to signify that a person's life is on the line. Their lives are at peril because that excess weight could be fatal. So marketers highlight all types of pain that exists in the overweight realm and how that could lead to death. Other negative urgency invokes financial death, risk of prison by not getting someone to settle your tax bill, or loss of your home or car if you fail to grab a loan to consolidate your debt. \nRelated: Don't Lose That All-Important Sense of Urgency. Do It -- Now! 2. Principle of Scarcity \nThe smartest online marketers know exactly how to use scarcity. For example, when I was just a kid, I desperately wanted a new Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Remember those? I distinctly recall stories on the television of parents not getting an NES for their kids because their local store ran out. So I forced my parents to get one fast. Another example during the holidays were companies that produced the Cabbage Patch Kids or the Ty Beanie Babies, which always seemed to be in short supply. \nThis leverages one of the most important principles of economics -- the forces of supply and demand. As supplies dwindle, prices shoot up, especially if demand keeps pace. And as those supplies dwindle, demand often increases. We see this craze every single year on Black Friday as companies open their doors to blockbuster sales. These are often in very limited quantities, so you have consumers rushing to get in. \nOnline, you can create scarcity by showing that something is about to expire or all the spots are filled up or almost gone. You can use online tools for this such as Deadline Funnel , which allows you to expire an offer based on the consumer's IP address and cookies that are created. When the offer is expired, the consumer instantly salivates more towards it. Why? Because of scarcity. \nIf you feel like something is going to come to an end, you're far more likely to act on your impulse. The trick is creating that atmosphere. Now, some might consider this blurring the lines of fraud. But it's simply a strategy used in sales, marketing and even in employment positions. For example, the best companies will open up a few spots in a particular department, which usually sparks a massive rush of applications because of the limited number of positions available. \nThis also works with credit cards, home loans, automobile discounts, and so on. You name it, and scarcity has likely been implemented by a company that you very well know, love and trust. You might not have been consciously aware of the tactics, but ninja salespersons and marketers know that this creates the ultimate sense of needing to act, and ensuring that the action happens quickly and almost effortlessly. \nRelated: The Bootstrappers' Advantage: Scarcity Boosts Creativity 3. Principle of Exclusivity \nIf you've ever visited the city on a weekend and have seen some of the hottest nightclubs and bars around, you've likely noticed a massive line out front, and you've seen the concept of exclusivity in practice. This velvet-ropes technique is used quite often, not only offline, but very frequently online as well. If you've ever wanted to work with a coach or join a mastermind anywhere, you've almost always have had to go through these velvet ropes. \nVelvet ropes can be implemented in the digital world simply by placing an application up for people to work with you. You're not freely allowing just anyone to buy. Why do this? Because you turn the tables on the consumer. It's no longer a choice on their behalf to work with you but a choice on yours. That's a very powerful psychological switch. It makes the consumer longingly await the \"chance\" to work with you or join some exclusive group. \nThis can have serious benefits on the bottom line of any company looking to boost sales. By merely removing the ability for the consumer to decide, you're creating an instant air of exclusivity. It's no longer their choice anymore. This works especially well for high-ticket products and services. The important part? Place an input box that tells users why you should let them in or why you should work with them. \nNot only do you have exclusivity when you do this, but you then compel the consumer to convince you that they're worthy of their time, which is the ultimate affirmation. All you have to do is remove the element of choice. Don't allow them to buy on demand. Make them fill out a form. Better yet, add an application fee and you'll really weed out those that might want to waste your time and it'll help to illuminate the true buyers. \nRelated: Exclusivity Isn't the Only Marketing Strategy for Luxury Brands 4. Principle of Reciprocity \nIf you've ever gone to some of the biggest tourist destinations in the world and wondered why you find people attempting to give you roses and other trinkets for free, you'll see the principle of reciprocity in play in the real world. When you take someone from something for free, you're instantly inclined to give them something back. You feel like you owe them. And smart marketers love to play on this human \"flaw.\" \nAfter you're handed a rose on the Spanish Steps in Rome, for example, you'll be asked for a favor in the form of a donation. The hand will come out and since you just willingly accepted something from them for free, you're more inclined to actually give them something. This works remarkably better than simply pan handling. You'll pass up many people begging for money before you accept a small gift from someone else on the streets. \nYou also see this principle in play in supermarkets. When you get something for free in the form of a sample of food, and you really like it, you're more inclined to buy it. Clearly, supermarkets don't give things away altruistically. They're playing on this principle. Now, in the online world, you see this everywhere. Free lead magnets entice you to accept something in exchange for something else. Namely, your email address. \nYou might not realize it at first, but you've succumbed to the principle of reciprocity. That enables online marketers to send you offers. The smartest ones know that those offers can only come after you've received loads of value. So if that lead magnet is truly helpful to you, you're far more likely to now buy something from that person or business. Surely, you've found yourself in this situation before. \nRelated: Asking For A Favor: Apply Reciprocity As A Constant, Not An Anomaly 5. Principle of Commitment \nWhile there are plenty of other principles at play in the world of marketing, the last one part of the core 5 principles is the principle of commitment. When you're selling something online or offline, you have to get people to commit to you. How do you do that? There are numerous ways. But this principle of commitment helps create a mental switch in the consumer's mind. They've now agreed to something, which is not the offer, but it sets up a pattern. \nFor example, if you've ever seen world-class speakers like Dean Graziosi, Brendan Burchard or Joe Polish speak at a live event, what you'll notice is that they work on the principle of commitment early on. They get you to raise your hand or say yes or stand up if you agree to something. That sets up the principle of commitment for the oncoming offer. They build a pattern of getting you to commit before the actual pitch. \nWhen the pitch comes along, you've already agreed. In other examples, you'll see this occurring in webinars frequently as well. For example, if you've ever watched a webinar by webinar king, Jason Fladlien , you'll notice how frequently he uses the principle of commitment before the pitch. That's incredibly important to do, and very simple to achieve in a live webinar because you have an engaged audience. \nYou can also garner commitment by removing any other friction in sales such as price objections through a risk-free guarantee or strong refund and exchange policy. Other ways are through price-match policies and so on. The point? If you can get someone to commit strongly enough before the pitch, you'll substantially increase your chances of closing the sale by 50 to 75 percent.

John Rampton - Entrepreneur VIP \nRegardless of the size of your business, unpaid invoices aren\u2019t just an inconvenience. You need to have strategies in place so that invoicing won't threaten the very existence of your business. \nThat may sound a bit overdramatic . But, think about it for moment. Unpaid invoices impact everything which means if cash flow is interrupted you won\u2019t have the money to keep your business operational. This situation would mean you can\u2019t pay employees, suppliers, or vendors. As a result, you\u2019ll be slapped with late fees while damaging your reputation. \nSo, yeah. Unpaid invoices are a big deal that deserve your immediate attention. But, how can you go about in addressing these unpaid invoices? Try out these six strategies. 1. Make sure you followed procedure and then follow-up politely. \nDon\u2019t jump to conclusions and start emailing your client nasty or threatening messages. First, make make sure that you followed the correct procedures for getting paid. Did you actually send the invoice? Were payment terms clear? What is the amont due? Did you it send it to the right person? Is your address correct? \nIt would be extremely embarrassing for you to lose you cool with a client only to find out that it was your fault all along. \nAlso keep in mind that sometimes unpaid invoices slip through the cracks. A client may be out-of-town or dealing with an emergency. Before getting angry, send a polite follow up email to check in. More often than not a brief, \u201cJust checking in,\u201d email can get get the invoice paid. \nAt this point, you should avoid any \u201cpast due\u201d remarks. It will ensure that you\u2019ll have a good working relationship with the client in the future is the unpaid invoice was just an oversight. \nSpecial note: make sure you pick a top invoicing company to help you keep track of things. Nothing worse then emailing a client and then realizing that you didn't send them an invoice or it went to spam. \nRelated: 10 Expert Tips on Managing Cash Flow as a New Business 2. Give discounts and charge a penalty. \nIf you offer a discount for early payments , customers and clients are encouraged to pay ahead of the due date. It\u2019s not uncommon to offer a one percent or two percent discount on the total invoice amount if invoice is paid in full within 10 days. \nUnfortunately, not everyone is motivated by incentives. But, they may be motivated if their invoice has penalty fees. Not only will this push clients to pay faster, it will also help you cover the cost of any financing issues that you personally have. You don't want to not be able to pay your own bills that were incurred during that period of time in which your clients were late in paying you. 3. Abandon the stiff business approach. \nWhat if you followed procedure correctly and the the polite follow-up didn\u2019t work? I find that sometimes you have to be very stern in following up with them. I really like what Andy Clarke suggests. He says that you \u201cabandon a stiff business approach and instead write one email, carefully worded to express how you personally feel. \u201cAfter-all, business may be business, but people work with people.\u201d \nHere\u2019s email Andy composed: \nA quick note to say that I am really disappointed that you have still not paid me the [..] that I'm owed for the work I did for you. In the grand scheme of things, it's not a lot of money, but actually I think that this is more a matter of respect. \nI have always been there at the drop of a hat to sort out any problems you might have. I love working with you and have always taken our relationship as more than just client/supplier. But if I can't rely on you paying promptly or it takes several attempts and reminders to get my money, that's not good business. \nI'm not saying that I don't want to work with you, I do. But if I don't receive what I am owed within the next couple of days, I will have to think twice about helping you in the future. \nKind regards \nAndy Clarke \nAndy claims that this was the most effective debt collecting email he ever sent with every client paying him within two days. I've found as well that this is a very effective method. That being said, it tends to really hurt the relationship. So if you're using this method, I've never found that you end up working with the person in the future. \nRelated: 5 Ways to Keep Cash Flow Pumping 4. Collections, arbitration, mediation, court. \nIs this playing hard ball? Absolutely. But, when you have invoices that over 90 days past due, and you don\u2019t think they will be paid, you may be left with no other option. Just be aware that you\u2019ll receive pennies on the dollar, but something is better than nothing. However, I would also suggest that you do the following before getting involved with a collections agency. Contact someone else at the office, such as the accounting manager. Only do this after you\u2019ve made several fruitless attempts at contacting with your contact. If you have a contract, and you really should, review it carefully. The only way to resolve the nonpayment is by going through an arbitration board. Get in touch with the arbitration board to find out what you need to do to file a case. If your client is local, you can use a business mediation service. This process involved a trained, neutral mediator you works with both parties to resolve the dispute. What if the client wants to pay, but is having cash flow problems? Consider offering a short, three-to-six-month payment plan. It could be a risky move if they\u2019re going bankrupt, but it\u2019s worth a shot. Some deadbeat clients have been hoping for this all along; offering to settle for less than owed. It\u2019s not ideal, but sometimes it\u2019s better to just get what you can and move on. If you've met your client through an online ad or freelance website, contact the customer service department of the site to report the problem. They won\u2019t give the money owed, but they may intervene. If there are too many complaints, they\u2019ll stop running the ads for that person. All 50 states have small claims courts that are designed specifically for use by non-lawyers. If you\u2019re owed less than your state\u2019s small claims court maximum limit, usually between $2,500 to $15,000, you can bypass hiring a lawyer and represent yourself in court. There will be court fees, but you don\u2019t have those expensive attorney fees. If the amount you\u2019re owed exceeds the small claims court maximum limit, you\u2019ll have to go to a regular court to file a lawsuit. You can represent yourself, but it\u2019s not advised in this situation. This scenario can get expensive. \nRelated: The 5 Worst Cash-Flow Mistakes Small-Business Owners Make 5. Contact a Business Reporting Bureau. \nIf you\u2019re dealing with a client who is egregiously late, you can report them to a business reporting bureau and make the complaint public record. \nSince this complaint can threaten the client\u2019s reputation, and may limit them from getting credit in the future, it\u2019s almost a given that you\u2019ll be paid immediately. 6. Factor them. \nFinally, you can always sell any current outstanding invoices that are less than 90 days old to a factorer . The stipulation is that the clients who owe you the money are businesses or institutions and not individuals. \nWith invoice factoring, you basically receive a cash advance amount of 80 percent of the total receivable. As the borrower, you\u2019ll be responsible for the interest and fees on the advance. Avoid unpaid invoices in the first place. \nIf you want to prevent the hassle of unpaid invoices in the first place, make sure that you research new clients to make sure that they\u2019re legit and don\u2019t have any prior complaints. After that make sure that you have a signed contract, keep detailed records, and ask for a payment upfront. \nAlso, make the payment process as convenient as possible, set-up recurring invoices, and work on establishing strong client relationships. Most importantly, know when to stop chasing a late payment. It\u2019s not worth the time, energy and money to hunt down a $300 invoice.

You need more sleep and less social media. So why won't you shut off your phone and go to bed? Image credit: Adam Hester | Getty Images Jon Levy - Guest Writer \nEvery day there is another article, video or piece of content that tells us we need to do or not do something because science has proven it\u2019s \u201cbad for us.\u201d As a human behavior scientist, it drives me crazy that so many people are still surprised by these so-called discoveries. Did you really not know that sleep is important? Or that obsessing over your Instagram posts is unhealthy? This isn\u2019t new. \nWe need to stop regurgitating established facts, and start making the changes that will improve the quality of our lives. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what science has proven -- and what to do about it. \nRelated: 12 Unexpected Things That Are Stealing Your Sleep 1. Rest up. \nHumans are the only creatures that optionally reduce their amount of sleep. Numerous studies have shown this has negative consequences. It affects memory, weakens the immune system and lowers work performance. Everything from your ability to lose weight to your ability to fight off illness is diminished when you are tired. In fact, sleep may be the biggest predictor of happiness, health and mental acuity. \nWe don\u2019t need more articles telling us that we need it. Instead, use that reading time to get more rest. If you can\u2019t get yourself to sleep at a normal hour, stop scheduling morning meetings and go in later. \nIt is important to note that people are biologically wired to sleep at certain hours. There are morning people and night owls. Stop trying to convince yourself to wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning if you\u2019re not built for it. It\u2019s not going to teach you discipline. Instead, it will lead to burnout. 2. Stop multitasking. \nThe human brain isn\u2019t built for multitasking, so stop bragging about how good you are at it. According to neuroscience, we simply can\u2019t multitask . At best, we can rapidly switch between tasks, which often decreases productivity and performance. Each time you switch to a new task, you have to refocus your attention. Gaining your focus back could take up to 15 minutes, so stop trying to watch TV and answer emails. Put away your phone and smartwatch while you\u2019re in a meeting. Close all those browser tabs, shut off notifications, and focus on one task at a time. Be where you are at the moment and nowhere else. 3. Fear isn\u2019t an effective motivator. \nThose who manage through fear don\u2019t create successful work environments. At a certain point, people grow accustomed to threats, and fear no longer motivates them. \nBullying your employees or coworkers won\u2019t make you or them excited about the work you are doing. They won\u2019t work harder or put in extra hours. Instead of fear, focus on \u201cidea technology,\u201d a concept that Barry Schwartz talks about in his book Why We Work . Idea technology goes beyond intrinsic motivation. It\u2019s about changing the ideas our culture, organizations and individuals have about work and incentives in general. Instead of focusing on workplace efficiency and economic value, we need to think about well-being to find the meaningful and satisfying parts of work. \nRelated: 5 Ways to Build Resilience 4. Success takes hard work. \nBeing an entrepreneur requires effort, grit and patience. Internet entrepreneurs rarely have millions of users their first month or even the first year. I\u2019ve found that it takes 7-10 years to do anything really well. Achieving success often means clocking in the extra hours, giving up weekends out with friends and having a deep passion and commitment to the work you\u2019re doing. \nEven the overnight successes we hear about required years of unnoticed effort. Don\u2019t expect anything to go smoothly, and be prepared work at it for years. 5. You are never right. \nThroughout history, almost everything we thought was true has been replaced with a different paradigm or proven to be completely wrong. We once believed that Zeus would throw lightning at us or that crops wouldn\u2019t grow because we didn't pray. We believed that the Earth was flat and the center of the universe. \nEmbrace uncertainty. Being uncertain is healthier than assuming you are right. It keeps us honest and humble, and it motivates us to explore new ideas and learn. 6. Social media is not good for you. \nSocial media usage is often linked to unhappiness. Research from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine found that the more time a person spends on social media, the more likely they are to be depressed. \nThe problem is that most people filter out the mundane parts of their lives and only share posts that make them seem more interesting, exciting and successful than they are in real life. Even celebrities aren\u2019t always as glamorous and happy as they appear on Instagram. Still, we compare our own experiences to the unrealistic ones we see on social media, and it makes us feel inadequate, envious, isolated and depressed. \nIt is acceptable to occasionally check social media to get updates on friends and family. However, the moment it turns from joy for your friend to jealousy, you should probably take a break and enjoy some in-person social interaction. \nRelated: Science Explains Why You're Addicted to Social Media -- and How to Break That Addiction 7. We need social interaction. \nIn his TED Talk , Harvard researcher Robert Waldinger shared findings from a 75-year long study on happiness. According to the research, social interaction is one of the greatest influences on well-being and longevity. People who have formed strong communities of friends and family are significantly happier and healthier. \nLiking a post on Facebook is not social interaction. It does not make you feel significantly closer to someone like a hug does. Go out and make meaningful connections. Join a club, go to a meetup or take a class. \nWe already know that these seven factors influence the quality of our lives, so why do we insist on talking about them as if we don\u2019t? It is time to take action. Stop saying you are going to spend less time on Facebook or that you are going to make time to work on your side hustle. Do it.

John Boitnott - VIP Contributor \nInterviews can be fun. People who do them a lot know an interview really doesn't have to be a nerve-racking or difficult experience. The stigma that surrounds the interview is that you always think you have to project the best version of yourself. When you interview a lot you know that, more than anything else, you need to be real. \nBe objective about your experiences, skills and knowledge. Show your prospective employer your true self. Being honest is appreciated, and asking the right questions can do a lot for you. \nKeep the simple rule that you should be asking questions, but here are seven other rules you should break to nail the interview and get the job. Beware: Breaking some conventional rules won't be appropriate in some cases and may even go against the odds or popular beliefs in general. In other words, following these suggested actions is no guarantee of success. However, if breaking a few rules helps you be true to yourself, it may be exactly what your new boss is looking for. 1. Ask about salary. \nThe first interview rule I\u2019d like you to consider breaking is the outdated idea that you should never ask what the salary is going to be. To the contrary, asking about money is arguably the best thing you can do for yourself. These days, most companies are transparent about the salary even in the first interview. Regardless, even if the company isn't willing to be transparent, this is still a piece of information you want to know. By asking this question, you'll be showing that you value yourself and you're genuinely interested in doing a great job. What\u2019s more, if the company isn\u2019t willing to tell you salary info, it may be an indication that you aren\u2019t the right fit for that organization. \nRelated: Fixing the Pay Gap Starts With Your Salary Negotiation Skills 2. Talk about how you solved past work issues. \nThere\u2019s a longstanding line of thinking that\u2019s it\u2019s just bad news to go talking about problems you may have had in a prior workplace. Some professionals have begun to turn against this in more recent years though. If you honestly reveal what type of issues you had during your prior positions and how you resolved them, you may get bonus points in the eyes of many interviewers. After all, they need to see what you\u2019ve been through and know what you can really do for their company. The value you'll bring is an important consideration and even crucial in their decision-making process. 3. Tell the company your expectations. \nNot every job seeker feels enthusiastic about confidently professing their needs and wants to a prospective employer. The truth is, they need to know about your values and motivations. At the same time, you need to tell them what you realistically expect from their working environment , salary, bonus, and, yes, even politics. If your expectations don\u2019t match up with what they're offering, then they might give you more if they truly value you as a professional. Stay true to yourself. \nRelated: Hiring Tip: Ask About the Candidate, Don't Talk About the Position 4. Ask what resources are available for the position. \nYou don\u2019t want to be demanding about support you\u2019ll need for a role you haven\u2019t won yet, but it\u2019s more than reasonable to ask about the resources the position will need. It shows your possible future employer that you\u2019re ready to start work. You\u2019re already doing everything posssible to be successful, and have your head in the game. Drop any doubts about it and ask what you will have and how you can use it for the enhancement of the role. 5. Explain why you left your last job. \nThis is another one that goes against advice I\u2019ve been given in the past. Be honest about why you are leaving your current job. The story is often not a happy one, but you should consider telling the real reason. It means that you want your new employers to know about the things you're not willing to put up with in a working environment. All of the answers you give in an interview provide an assessment of your personality and the type of worker you are. You don\u2019t have to describe all the nasty details (if they exist), but you should speak about the root of whatever issues you were experiencing. \nRelated: Handling Employment Gaps on Your Resume 6. Describe a project you worked on that was a complete failure. \nIt\u2019s becoming more and more popular to speak about failures as a stepping stone to success, and this is part of that. Describing a previous failure shows that you have confidence, know how to handle tough situations and have experience. Don\u2019t hide your mistakes. Why? They help define you as a person and a professional. And, they can sometimes get you the job. Be bold with who you are as a worker. They'll appreciate it. \nRelated: The 25 Trickiest Questions Apple Will Ask in a Job Interview 7. Describe your personality. \nThere\u2019s no use in hiding now. Show them what they'll get from you. Talk about your habits, hobbies and even flaws. Show that you can use this unique mixture of traits to your advantage. Let them know how you can successfully handle tasks with all that you bring to the table. They\u2019re going to learn about you soon enough, so let your personality shine through.

Jason Fiefer - Magazine Contributor \nIntroducing our new podcast, Problem Solvers with Jason Feifer , which features business owners and CEOs who went through a crippling business problem and came out the other side happy, wealthy, and growing. Feifer, Entrepreneur's editor in chief, spotlights these stories so other business can avoid the same hardships. Listen below or click here to read more shownotes . \nHanson Grant was sitting in his dorm room at Babson College, trying to figure out how to write on the walls. \u201cI couldn\u2019t drill holes to set up a whiteboard, and I couldn\u2019t paint my walls with dry-erase paint,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I thought, What if I could peel and stick a whiteboard on the wall? \u201d That led him to develop a film that affixes to surfaces, turning almost anything, even his desk or closet, into a dry-erase board. He raised $10,100 on Kickstarter. A local NBC news story brought in 200 orders overnight through a website he set up. USA Today, the Today show,and others followed, fueling growth . \nRelated: How to Spin a Bad Online Review \nA year later, in 2015, Grant put his product on Amazon, hoping to keep the momentum going. Think Board quickly rose to the top five in multiple categories. But then the reviews poured in. They were bad. Really bad. And they slowed sales on his own site. By 2016, he\u2019d graduated, taken on Think Board full-time, and recruited a friend as COO. \u201cI looked at him and said, \u2018Well, things were really good. Now we\u2019re losing money every month, and we\u2019ve got to figure out how to turn this around.\u2019\u201d \nAt the time, Think Board\u2019s film would stick on only some surfaces. Very smooth walls, desks and doors? No problem. If those surfaces were painted? Not always. And although that sounds like a glaring problem, it hadn\u2019t tripped up customers before. The company had been explicit about the limitations on its website, and it built a customer service team to patiently explain how to use the film and promptly refund unsatisfied buyers. But on Amazon, with its strictly formatted sales page, buyers skipped over those caveats. And then, \u201cinstead of reaching out to us -- all our other customers know we\u2019re very easily accessible -- they would just leave a negative review and get all pissed off,\u201d Grant says. \nThat led Grant to two realizations. One: \u201cWe used customer service as a Band-Aid,\u201d he says. And two: That Band-Aid wouldn\u2019t work on Amazon. He had to listen to not only happy customers but unhappy ones, too -- even if their unhappiness was rooted in a misunderstanding of his product. Image Credit: Courtesy of Think Board \nIn 2016, Think Board spent six months developing a more versatile film that could affix to any smooth surface. Once Grant had a prototype, he began offering it for free to customers who were disappointed with the original version; it was a way to appease them and also test the new version in the real world. \nRelated: 6 Tips for Hearing Tough Feedback \nThen he refashioned his customer service. Now he includes a 100-day money-back guarantee. And when a customer buys the product, they\u2019re entered into a 200-day email schedule. The first email thanks the person for buying; a few days later, it introduces the company and provides Grant\u2019s cellphone number in case a customer needs help. Future emails give tips on how to use the product. They also ask for feedback , which serves two purposes: diverting people from leaving bad reviews online, and helping Think Board refine and develop new products. \nAt day 99, an email warns that the money-back guarantee is about to run out. If you want a refund, it says, you must act now. And how many do? \u201cVery, very few,\u201d Grant says. He finally built a product that stuck. \nTo hear more of his story, check out our latest podcast episode of Problem Solvers below.

Jonathan Small - Guest Writer \nAlex Rodriguez, aka A-Rod, knows a thing or two about keeping his eye on the ball. As a Major League Baseball player for 22 years, he was a 14-time All-Star and four-time MVP and holds the record for the most grand slams ever with 25. His approach to business has been very much the same. From the time he was 18 years old and a star prospect from New York City, he was planning his exit strategy. \n\u201cI looked at most athletes in major league baseball, and the average career is about five and a half years,\u201d he says. \u201cYou make probably 95 percent of your money from age 20 to 30. Then the question is, what happens 31 to 80? Less than 5 percent of our athletes have college degrees. I\u2019m not a stock broker, but if I had just that information alone, I would short the stock.\u201d \nRelated: The Biggest Risk 4 Judges on 'Shark Tank' Ever Took \nRather than become a statistic, he invested in his future outside of baseball. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be one of these guys that ran into financial trouble,\u201d he says. \nA wizard at strategizing both on and off the field, he made a plan. \u201cI figured if I played for five years and I bought five assets, and if I was 20, by the age of 35 with a 15-year mortgage on my loan, I would have five assets debt-free,\" Rodriguez says. \"That alone would be my insurance plan not to be part of the 70 percent of athletes that were bankrupt.\u201d \nIt paid off big time. Rodriguez, who made his debut as the first-ever Hispanic shark on Shark Tank on Sunday, is the CEO and founder of the AROD Corp, a business conglomeration that includes an auto dealership group, international and domestic fitness clubs and a real estate empire. He has more than 200 employees and more than 12,000 units in 13 states. \nAt a recent press junket in Beverly Hills, Rodriguez arrived with girlfriend Jennifer Lopez on his arm and a giant smile on his face. He seemed far removed from the doping scandals the plagued the latter part of his career, and happy to be in his new role as a businessman swimming with the Sharks. \n\u201cIt is a great thrill and privilege to be allowed to come to the Shark Tank platform and really do what I\u2019ve already been doing, which is collaborating, helping these young entrepreneurs meet their dreams, and to be able to mentor them and work with their management team and help them scale it,\u201d he says. \nWanna be in business with A-Rod? Here are four things you need to do: Be a leader, not a dreamer. \n\u201cI always bet on the jockey, not the horse. Because business, like sports, is just about people,\" he says. \"I want entrepreneurs and partners with a PhD. I don\u2019t mean from Harvard or Yale -- I mean Poor, Hungry and Driven. I want entrepreneurs that are gritty, that are scrappy and that can think outside the box and are winning players. Just like I want in the Yankee locker room.\u201d Swing for the fences. \n\u201cI always tell young entrepreneurs, don\u2019t be afraid to try. Failure is part of it,\" Rodriguez says. \"When people think about my career -- and I played for over 22 years -- they think about the 2009 championship, the home runs, the RBIs, 2000 this, 2000 that. But what they forget to tell you is I\u2019m also fifth all-time in strikeouts. That means I have a PhD in failing.\u201d Dust yourself off. \nA-Rod may have a Ph.D in failing, but he says he also has a \u201cmaster\u2019s at getting back up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what America is about, right?

Anthony Shriver, the CEO and founder of Best Buddies, shares his leadership secrets. Rose Leadem - Entrepreneur Staff \nIn this series, Leader Board , we speak with CEOs, managers, founders and others who lead organizations to learn what makes them tick, what they look for in new hires and even where they eat lunch. \nAnthony Shriver, the CEO and founder of Best Buddies International , doesn't have to look far for role models -- his mother is the brains behind the Special Olympics and his father is a founding director of the Peace Corps. Oh, and there's also his uncle, John F. Kennedy. \nAnytime he makes a decision , he follows the example of his mother, who always made sure that her decisions supported the mission of the organization. So Shriver asks himself questions such as: How is this decision going to benefit our program? How is this going to help us reach more people with intellectual disabilities? How is this going to create more opportunities and jobs? \nRelated: Why This Entrepreneur Who Leads More Than 1,000 Employees Prefers to Eat Lunch Alone \n\u201cI remember as a child -- whether we were doing an event at the White House with Clinton or Reagan or Bush, or she was doing the opening ceremonies and it was being broadcast on national TV -- to her, it always came back to the mission,\u201d Shriver shares with Entrepreneur . \u201cI never make a decision not thinking about that, even if it's indirectly supporting our mission.\u201d \nUsing his mother\u2019s approach has helped him to create one of the largest nonprofits in the U.S. Best Buddies focuses on creating opportunities for people with special disabilities and connecting them to students and adults in communities. Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Miami, the organization has more than 400 employees in the U.S. today, with offices across the country, along with hundreds of others working for the company\u2019s country programs in various cities throughout the world. \nShriver\u2019s 28 years leading Best Buddies has been a roller coaster of introspection, action and as he calls it, \u201cemotional intelligence.\u201d We caught up with Shriver to learn how he\u2019s successfully created and led one of the most influential nonprofits to date. On the most important leadership trait: \n\u201cFor me, it's what I call emotional intelligence. I think having a sense of the emotional state of your employees, the emotional culture of your company and being sensitive, patient and aware as you try to drive the business forward. Leaders that have a sense of the emotional state of their employees and their company make effective leaders.\u201d On leadership style: \n\u201cWhen I first started the organization I was very much 'my way or the highway\u2019 -- driving it, pushing it, working all the time every single day and having very little patience. I ran it in a way where I felt an enormous amount of fire in my belly and a lot of pressure and responsibility. \n\u201cMy style evolved into a calmer, emotional leader -- engaging in the lives [of] the people that work with me. I [take] more of an interest in their personal and professional lives, try to enhance their ability to contribute and feel important. The business is very much reliant on them as an individual and the role that they play, so moving the attention and responsibility away from myself and trying to make the team feel vitally important to our success as an organization [has] been my style over the past six to 10 years. \n\u201cI look for opportunities to demonstrate that. For example, with Hurricane Irma, I sent out an email to every [employee] in the state of Florida telling them I'm there for them, the company is there for them -- that they can count on us to support them financially, help them relocate, help them cover hotel bills or support their family in other ways; and if they could send me an email and explain to me what's happened, they can count on me to support them in that capacity. We're one family and we're going to make it through. So I find that those types of things are opportunities to show them that we care.\u201d On habits that help him lead: \n\u201cConsistency, [and] for employees to see me consistently doing the things that I say I'll do and that I actually do them is important. Whether it's returning emails within 24 hours [or] showing up to meetings on time, it's doing the things I ask them to do myself. So, if I ask them to travel, they see me traveling; if I ask them to work on weekends, they see me working on the weekends. I try to be consistent with my message out to them and then be consistent with myself and how I behave and operate.\u201d On challenges: \n\u201cKeeping the organization fresh and young and alive and innovative and creative and new and exciting and dynamic so that it doesn't get stale and dull and boring and slow.Constantly thinking how we can do something new and different, how we can come out with a new initiative, how we can make the organization fresh. \n\u201cLast year, we did a redo of our office. So, creat[ing] a different culture within the office just in the way the office is setup to bringing new events to the table to continually trying to reinvent the way we manage our donors.\u201d On the toughest business decision: \n\u201c2007, when we had to lay off a lot of people nationwide because of the financial crisis, was the first year we\u2019ve ever ended up in the red, and had to dip into our reserve to cover our payroll and expenses. [During] that time, we laid off a lot of staff because of the budget constrictions all over the country. That was the most challenging for the company and for me as a human being, because I'm big on paying attention to employees, taking an interest in [them] and making them feel like they're indispensable. We've got no business without our team.\u201d On the most important traits in a new hire: \n\u201cPassion for our mission. If you've got passion for the mission and you really care about a person with intellectual disability [or] have a family or personal connection to our mission, you're going to crush it. If your heart and soul is connected to what we're doing, you're indispensable to us.\u201d On recognizing employees: \n\u201cWe have an award dinner every year where we give out awards -- from rookie of the year to program manager of the year to international director of the year. We do a lot of things where we recognize [employees] with awards and plaques, [and] give out cash bonuses based on the awards they win. \n\u201cWe do things on an annual basis to recognize employees [and] a monthly basis. We recognize employees through a wellness program [like] who lost the most amount of weight on a monthly basis, who lost the most weight on an annual basis. We give them cash awards for that as well. We have a number of programs like that where we try to highlight the achievements of our staff whether it's personal or through their work.\u201d On team-building: \n\u201cWe do a big annual retreat, [and] we do getaways quarterly with senior VPs. A lot of times we're in the office but we break away. We bring in guest speakers to inspire and educate [employees] -- whether it's about finance or your personal development. \n\u201cWe do \u2018End of the Year\u2019 celebrations where we go out and [play] games together, [like] capture the flag or waterpolo. We do lunches here [at the headquarters] on a monthly basis after we do a fitness activity every month [that\u2019s] led by different teams in the organization.\u201d On managing meetings: \n\u201cI try to keep [them] as short as possible and on time. The older I'm getting and the longer I've been here, I keep shortening meetings because I find that the long ones are less effective and people talk in circles. I will never ever any longer have a meeting over an hour, and I generally try to keep them within 30 minutes. \n\u201cI [also] try to make sure everybody gets a word in -- I go around and make sure someone doesn't [just] sit through a meeting and never speak. And at the end, everyone knows exactly what the takeaway is, who is going to be responsible for each thing and how they are going to report back.\u201d \nRelated: Why the Entrepreneur Behind iRobot, Which Has Sold More Than 20 Million Robots, Burns Frustrating Documents at the End of Every Year On scheduling: \n\u201cI do it with my assistant. VPs [and] senior VPs can have meetings with me without asking, [which] they do through my assistant. \n\u201cI block out weeks where I travel to different parts of the United States. I have a system where staff from all over the world can put in when they want me to go to their city, state or country, what's going to happen [and] why I should go to that particular location. I review those things and work with my assistant in blocking out times. \n\u201cEvery day I go through a call list [and] a birthday list, and block out time [that] day to call people who have been supportive of us, whether it's donors, parents or students.\u201d On office setup: \n\u201cWe just changed the office about six months ago [to] an open office plan. We're trying to create a more open, inclusive space where there's glass everywhere, fun colors, blue carpeting, blue doors. Just trying to make it alive and energetic and inclusive and not stodgy and dark. \n\u201cDepartments are assigned offices but no individuals are assigned specific offices. Special events will have an office and then workstations that are outside that office, and every department rolls that way. \n\u201cWe have spaces where there are doors and glass so people can have meetings, and we have a lot of conference rooms [employees] can book. We have a lot of open space and lounge areas [with] couches and chairs where people can collaborate and hang out. We have a fuel stop where there\u2019s food all day [and] people [can] get snacks and coffee for free.\u201d On a strong company culture: \n\u201cAgain, consistency. Having the people at the top be consistent in the way they behave and the way they operate. If I'm talking about the importance of family, I'm actually showing how important my family is to me. \n\u201cSo me leading with that message and showing what I believe to be the values of this organization and culture consistently year to year. It's not some sort of new thing that I try to pull off this year [or] the next year, [it\u2019s] that I'm consistent throughout the course of my career. And I am very consistent. I've been in the same job for 27 years, I've had the same wife for 26 years, I've lived in the same house for 23 years, I've gone to the same place in the summer for 50 years. \n\u201cConsistency and steadiness creates calm and a sense of safety, ease and security in employees. When employees feel secure, safe and calm they do really well, they want to stay around and they want to work harder.\u201d On cultural mistakes: \n\u201cIn the beginning, not showing enough recognition, not giving people the opportunity to give input [and] not making people feel like what they said and their position in the organization was super valuable and important. My mistake was not recognizing people with awards and thinking that was stupid or a waste of time. Not giving people time off. Not having a great healthcare plan. Not having a 401(k) plan at all, thinking people should figure out their finances and save on their own. Being driven by a sense of self-importance [and] selfishness and that being part of [our] culture. \n\u201cIt was a lot about me driving the needle and the business, I think partially because I was more immature and much more driven by ego, work and just pure grit and grind. I never took the time to think [about] the way we were really going to be successful long term. \n\u201cWhat I really believe in at home is everybody counts -- I feel that way about my wife, I feel that way about my children and that [has] to carry over into my professional life so that they see that's the kind of human being I am. So I began to do that.\u201d On his biggest cultural win: \n\u201cTime off, video messages, communication from me to [employees] goes a really long way. I get a giant amount of feedback and input from staff when I give them a [surprise] day off, or days off around some holiday, or a week off around Christmas. To me, that's a big win -- it's not a huge expense on the organization and it goes a long way for making people feel like you really care about them and their personal lives. It's not about working like dogs and then sending [employees] a paycheck and expecting them to wake up Monday morning and do the same thing all over again. I care about them as human beings -- it's not just a person I'm paying.\u201d On his role models: \n\u201cMy mother. The thing that I admired the most about her, which I take to my business every day and focus on in every decision I make, was her relentless focus on the mission that she was working on. She was literally in her 80s and could barely walk, [and] was always focused most on the actual program of Special Olympics -- that the athletes were learning how to swim [or] how to run and that they had the proper equipment. \n\u201cI remember as a child -- whether we were doing an event at the White House with Clinton or Reagan or Bush, or whether she was doing the opening ceremonies and it was being broadcast on national TV -- to her, it always came back to the mission. I never make a decision not thinking about that even if it's indirectly supporting our mission. It's got to have some way to connect back to our program and our core principle of finding volunteers, finding jobs [and] creating leadership opportunities [for people] with intellectual disabilities. If it doesn't support that, I would never do it.\u201d \nRelated: Why the Leader of FreshDirect Has a 6-Foot-6-Inch, 260-Pound Assistant On where most leaders go wrong: \n\u201cIt's always about ego. Hubris, ego, titles, money, expense accounts, planes, hotel rooms -- all that becomes a distraction. A lot of leaders lose their focus and start thinking it's all about them and not about the mission. When it starts becoming all about you, that's the beginning of the end for your business. My big thing is, it's all for the buddies.\u201d A Note From The Editor ENTREPRENEUR LIVE - Nov 9th | Los Angeles, CA Join us for a day of inspiration, networking and keynotes from Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jon Taffer and more!

Linda Lacina - Entrepreneur Staff \nIf you just read the buzzwords -- \u201c 3-D printer \u201d\u201cmakerspace\u201d and \u201c Kickstarter \u201d -- Vlad Dragusin\u2019s company Candylab Toys could sound like a lot of Brooklyn startups. Except his company doesn\u2019t maintain an app or deliver laundry on demand -- it sells wooden toy cars. \nThat\u2019s right -- just wooden cars. No virtual reality. No augmented anything. Just simple, charming heirloom cars. To be fair, these are a step beyond what you might have had in your toy box as a child. Think: 1965 Land Rovers, Airstream trailers, \u201860s muscle cars and Mopar racers. \nRelated: The Most Popular Toys During the Holidays Since 1983 (Infographic) \nGrowing up in Romania, Dragusin developed a love for hot rods and classic American car design. Candylab\u2019s toys showcase that passion with cars designed to the smallest details -- from the placement of the headlights to the tread on the tires and choosing just right shades of blue or green. \nOf course, getting such high-design cars to market isn\u2019t as simple as you might think. Their precise angles and cross-grain cuts weren\u2019t always easy to support by traditional tools. \nRelated: Barbie Is a Hologram and Now Even Playtime Is Automated \nSo Candylab would use 3-D printing technology to create not just its prototypes but the tools and jigs that manufacturers would need to produce them, tinkering at New Lab, a Brooklyn makerspace for manufacturers with both large format 3-D printers and a woodshop. \u201cWe have to physically make our tools and jigs here, put them in our luggage and ship them out with us,\u201d says Dragusin, a trained architect.The result is a toy that stands apart -- one that\u2019s rugged enough for an 8-year-old to race and elegant enough for a car-loving grandfather to show off on his desk. This attention to design has helped Candylab find key retail placement in high-design spots like Colette in Paris and The Design Museum in London and raise approximately $700,000 through a series of Kickstarter campaigns. The company has been profitable from its start and has seen 40 percent year-over-year growth. \nMidcentury Americana - Awesome Wood Toys from Candylab Media on Vimeo . \nIn this interview, we talk to Dragusin and his industrial designer, Kaeo Helder ahead of the company\u2019s holiday toy launch . We chatted about the challenge of building an iconic product, why so many don\u2019t take on that challenge and how it can work as a business strategy. \nThis interview has been edited for clarity and condensed. \n--- Candylab industrial designer, Kaeo Helder and founder Vlad Dragusin. Image credit: Brent Brookfield \nEntrepreneur: What\u2019s important when you\u2019re designing a new car?Dragusin: The product on its own has to be appealing enough, has personality and attractiveness to that particularly fresh blank slate -- which is a child's mind -- so that they they feel attracted to it and then they create their own story. Creating their own story is critical to us. Everything that we're trying to do is geared towards that. Helder: It's finding that happy balance between something that is iconic while still being simple enough. That gives the product a certain longevity, because you're pulling from icons that are already established and have proved themselves to be long lasting. The design will last. It's already proven itself. So you have that foundation you can use that as a prototype. \nRelated: The Ken Doll Got a Makeover (and a Man Bun). Here's What it Teaches Us About Buzz. \nEntrepreneur: The toy business is fickle but iconic toys -- Barbie, LEGO -- have a chance at longevity. Still, new icons are hard to find. Why? Dragusin: Humanity has much more cultural angles these days and the landscape is much more crowded than it was back in the day. So, I don't think there's necessarily going to be a clear-cut icon for kids just because there's there's many more interpretations of what that is. Candylab's Outlaw collection features vintage police cars, roadsters and race cars. Image credit: Candylab \nEntrepreneur: Isn\u2019t manufacturing its own hurdle, though? You\u2019ve discovered that innovating using classic materials wasn\u2019t all that easy.Dragusin: Wood toys are pretty simple actually. They're mostly 2D stuff: sticks, flat surfaces, painted whatever, glued together. The manufacturing techniques never have to be upgraded. It\u2019s self-reinforcing, because the demand is not there. It takes a lot to shake manufacturing out of its inertia and say, \"But wait. We need this to be made.\" \nEntrepreneur: And some of your vendors aren\u2019t making dollhouses or little trains.Dragusin: Our silicon provider, does high-tech consumer products, like the buttons on a cell phone. Helder: In our new range of cars, Outlaws, we have an axle piece that's a bent metal tube that's actually really difficult to do. And that company manufactures car brake parts. Dragusin: They\u2019re an actual automotive supplier.In a more traditional manufacturer business, everything\u2019s plastic. You can mold anything in plastic. You don\u2019t have to go to a metal stamping factory that supplies General Motors. \nRelated: Lego's New Robotics Set Will Teach Your Child How to Code \nEntrepreneur: What else stands in the way?Dragusin: Design is just one piece. The landscape today is really crowded in terms of making your voice heard. So between the product itself and being able to actually sustain it -- and this is where the business part comes in -- can you deliver? Can you ship? Can you stay profitable? All this has to happen concurrently. And then wait for a few years and see if you're still around. Then maybe, hopefully, you\u2019ve designed something that lasts. \nEntrepreneur: Who is trying to make the iconic toy?Dragusin: Plenty of people are trying. We would like to, but it\u2019s really hard. An acquaintance of mine, someone that I respect, David Weeks is the designer and creator of the Cubebot . It\u2019s based on a very ingenious idea [the Japanese Kumiki puzzle]. That's iconic. It is a toy but it's also a collector item and it's pretty intense. But it\u2019s iconic. The Southern Belle racer, part of Candylab's new car line, is an homage to female race car drivers of the last century. here it sits atop a second car released this fall, the Bad Emergency Truck, inspired by the workhorse Ford trucks of the '20s and '30s. Image credit: Candylab \nEntrepreneur: Why are the details so important?Helder: The amount of time we put into considering these things, what the customer sees and the distributor sees. So when we\u2019re deciding for an hour between different shades of gray, a lot of people would be like \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of that?\u201d But it really makes a difference, because it affects shelf presence, it affects what people see in a catalog and how will it be represented online. Ultimately, those are the people who are paying for this product. That consideration goes a long way. It can feel nit-picky, but you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to grab someone -- maybe it\u2019s the lights or shape or the flag. Putting in the time with the design makes people want to come back and get the next toy. \nEntrepreneur: You\u2019ve placed your toys in high-design shops. Why is that important to building your business?Dragusin: Being in Colette gets you exposure, gets you validation. Being in The Design Museum in London. All these really well-curated places get you where you need to be. \nRelated: This Disney Princess Will Teach Your Child How to Code \nEntrepreneur: So many toys -- and new products in general -- seem to chase some idea that might not resonate in one year, never mind 50. With toys, something might have an adjacent an app that helps you learn code, for instance, might not be supported by a company in time for a younger sibling two years later to use it.Helder: I've given a lot of thought to sort of this topic, and I think there's a tendency for companies to latch on to whatever the big hit of the moment is and to try and copy it. When the iPhone first came out it seemed like touchscreens were everywhere. They put them on washing machines and stoves. A stove is the worst thing to put a touch screen on because you need to differentiate your surfaces from what's on fire and what's not on fire. That\u2019s why touch screens on cars are the worst thing because you need tactile feedback when you drive. There's a reason we're going to buttons and mechanical switches. The thing that lasts this is the thing that has been well thought and well considered. \nEntrepreneur: Is vision its own essential part of a strategy?Dragusin: We want to be the wooden toy company. There\u2019s a company that makes plastic bricks -- can you think of which company this is? Or wooden trains? Or affordable home furniture? When people do something well, you become known for that. \nWe know everyone is feeling those middle-of-the-week jitters, so we thought we would throw something exciting your way! Enjoy ? \nA post shared by Candylab Toys (@Candylabtoys) on Sep 27, 2017 at 3:04pm PDT \nEntrepreneur: Vlad, you\u2019re a parent as well, though.

That is such a simple experience that people can latch onto. But at the same time it's subtle -- the weight of it and the speed and bounciness and all that fun stuff. So, let's say five years from now, you fish it out of your toy chest and you can still do this. It's just play. It's just playing with the toy car. That experience never changes.

Besides doing your best to stand out and build something unique, you also have to constantly be pumping out new content and stay on top of the recent trends in the industry. You must have the passion and motivation to be recognized, and most of all, the drive to create. \nShira Lazar -- on-air personality, writer, vlogger and entrepreneur-- knows what it takes to create at a level that others have only dreamt about. Not only does she have a very successful personal digital brand with over 1 million across platforms, but also runs her own digital publisher and media brand What\u2019s Trending . She also recently partnered with Sinclair Broadcasting and their digital lifestyle brand Circa for a daily live Facebook show . Besides being a content machine, What\u2019s Trending has been nominated for an Emmy and won multiple awards. \nI sat down with Shira Lazar recently to get her advice for you about how to be a successful creator and entrepreneur. How did you build this successful brand andsuch a huge audience? \nI was first building my own brand as a creator and broadcaster, interviewer and host, specifically with the focus on digital. Because I wasn\u2019t getting jobs on TV, necessarily, and digital is where my homies and my family are at, I was really intrigued and curious about the digital movement. \nThis was even before YouTube. When YouTube and the influencer community came to play, I became one of the hosts and interviewers for that movement and community. From there, it became clear that I didn\u2019t just necessarily want to have a brand that was just about me, but a platform where I could spotlight other voices. \nRelated: Amanda De Cadenet Proves How Great Conversations Can Empower Brands and Viewers How did you make that move and how did you monetize that? \nAt that time I was working for CBS News as a blogger/vlogger, as an interviewer and freelancer. I had the idea of building something bigger than the column I had on that site. \nI think this is what a lot of people go through, they have an inkling of a passion or interest and want to blow it out of the water, and maybe they want to do it on their own and don\u2019t want to do it for a company. \nSo, I came up with the idea of What\u2019s Trending. We co-sold it together; it originally launched with CBS News . At some point, CBS and I did have to split and at that point, I had to make a big decision: do I let this go or do I continue to build this as an entrepreneur? \nI told myself, I\u2019m a creator, and it\u2019s now time to stand up and take a leadership role as an entrepreneur. That\u2019s when I really started building What\u2019s Trending as a brand and publisher, not just a show. My brand is not just me as a creator, host, and talent, but also as an entrepreneur and a founder of a company. \nRelated: Using Video Like the Big Brands You are very successful partnering with companies and other brands to get more distribution. How did you do that? \nWe never did an investment. A lot of our revenue comes from working closely with brands. It was about bridging the gap of what was happening in the digital space, and bringing all my knowledge of the traditional media system and best practices to the digital realm, and the creators and brands that I was working with. It was nice balance between the two. \nWe always figured out ways to use our content, and leverage that content to work with brands. It\u2019s not necessarily about creating content that will sell, but looking at the content from their perspective: what are they going to want to buy into? So, we were creating ad products out of our content that we felt made sense. \nIt\u2019s a balancing act. You want to work with your audience, but you also want to work on building something that you know that people will want to buy into. \nRelated: How to Use Video to Reach Customers How did you get distribution deals? \nFrom being around and building relevancy, credibility, and a loyal audience for our brand. We are a boutique publisher, not a huge company that raised a lot of money and scaled it. However, I must say that people recognize the brand. We add value to the audience, but also to the community of influencers, entertainers and people that have huge audiences, so there\u2019s a huge value to that. \nWhen an advertiser knows that we push something out, other people who have a huge influence see that and it makes a big impact. We have always looked at partnering with brands where we know it will be a win-win for both of us. There\u2019s a gap for them that we can fill and they can provide value for us. \nRelated: The Creator of Funny or Die's 'Drunk History' on Wacky Business Ideas That Work I saw your news channel playing on the TV at my local gas station. Tell us more about it. \nWe have a deal with Verifone and Gas Station TV, which reaches a huge amount of people. I mean, it\u2019s basically a billboard that we get for free to market ourselves, and it\u2019s an incredible partnership that I feel very grateful for. If people want to find you, where should they go? \n@ShiraLazar . I\u2019m still a creator and do a ton of stuff on my own, on What\u2019s Trending everywhere, Whatstrending.com and @WhatsTrending .

Inventor David Fedewa made money off that one. \nRelated: The 7 Steps of Effective Product Development \nWhy didn't the pitcher have a slat down its side? Fedewa recalls wondering. Wouldn't that prevent foam and free the bartender from having to hold the pitcher at an angle while he was filling it? Popular bars, after all, tap dozens of kegs a night. They'd be making a lot more money if their staff didn't have to stand there, Fedewa reasoned. \nAt the time, this Michigander -- a former student of mine -- was himself a bartender, but one with a different spin. He'd always had ideas for products -- which, until that moment, he hadn't taken action on. What did he know about bringing a product to market? Still, the idea of spending the rest of his life bartending filled him with dread. \nFor the next couple of months, Fedewa kept thinking about his idea but failed to do anything about it. He assumed he would need to build a prototype first, which he didn't know how to do. \n\"I thought I needed to pick up a set of new skills to bring my idea to life, like CAD and 3D printing,\" Fedewa told me. \"In fact, I really did not.\" That's how Fedewa became my student -- to fill in those information gaps. And that's how I came to advise him how to create a rough prototype , by making use of existing materials. \nSo, as a test, he inserted into a pitcher a cheap plastic folder that you can purchase at any office supply store -- and filled the pitcher. The test was enough to validate his initial concept. His theory proved true: A pitcher with a slanted wall does not foam when filled. \nBut when Fedewa, sell sheet in hand, began showing his concept to companies, he failed to get a single response. \n\"I thought it was so obvious: This is a beer pitcher that doesn't foam!\" Fedewa said. Yet, there was a problem: When he showed his sell sheet to a friend, the friend replied, \"What is this?\" Clearly, the inventor needed to convey the benefit of his concept much more clearly. These days, the solution is often video: Many of my students use videos to license their ideas for new products. So, Fedewa used his cell phone to film a soundless grainy video that compared a regular pitcher being filled with one being filled his way. And sure enough, that's what did the trick. \n\"To be honest, the quality was crap, but it conveyed the point and got people excited. That was the biggest turning point,\" Fedewa said. The very next day, he let the companies he had previously contacted know he had improved his product and asked them to please take another look. \nThis time around, six of the 10 companies he emailed sent a positive reply within 24 hours. \nRelated: 5 Tips for Outsourcing Product Development \nHaving so many companies get back to him in a single day was hugely reassuring. Now I get it, he thought. Not that his work was done -- far from it. Sure, he had interest. But at the time, he didn't know how to use it to secure a deal. (Fedewa has since licensed five other products and negotiated countless licensing agreements on behalf of InventRight students.) What he learned \n\"Inventors tend to put blinders on and see things one way,\" Fedewa told me of his experience. \"The truth is, if you know the right questions to ask, you can break a discussion loose and get it moving again.\" \nEventually, Fedewa got his pitcher idea in front of the food service industry products manufacturer San Jamar, which loved it. Together, the company and Fedewa developed several iterations of the product, and in August 2014, signed a deal. This past spring, Fedewa was delighted to receive his first royalty check. His invention exists in restaurants and bars throughout the country today. \n\"We loved David's idea right away because the advantages it offers are easily measurable and apparent,\" explained Jeff Lee, an associate product manager. \"Use this product, save money. It is simple, but its simplicity is what draws users to it in terms of innovation.\" \nBecause San Jamar focuses on helping operations maximize profitability and efficiency, and the Perfect Pitcher does both, it was a \"seamless fit,\" Lee said. \nAnd Fedewa? The fact that he can go on vacation and still be earning income thrills this inventor, who now has his own YouTube channel about product development and licensing. \"It's made me less worried about my finances,\" he's admitted. \"The passive aspect in particular... I just love it. And the fact that there's no ceiling to how much I can earn: That's the really exciting part.\" Tips for the would-be inventors out there \nMaybe you're working a job you hate, or maybe it's just that you want to use your creativity more. Either way, opportunities to innovate abound, Fedewa insists. \n\"Put your arms out and spin! There are so many different products being used on a daily basis that are not friendly or efficient,\" he told me. In his own words, he recommended the following steps to begin turning your day job into passive income: \n1. Get started today. This is the first step to breaking through the barrier of actually doing something about your ideas. If you decide you are going to do something, take action now . . . because if you keep thinking tomorrow , that day will never actually come. Buy a book, call a company, obtain supplies for the prototype you've been dreaming about in your head -- just start. \n2. Find someone who has brought a product to market before to help you and show you the path. This will save you years of frustration and thousands of dollars. There is a road map for everything, including proposing and licensing your ideas. \nRelated: To Sell Products to Millennials, First Invite Them To Help Develop It \n3. Commit to a small action every day. Product development takes time, but , like everything else, you must take it a step at a time. The more you do, the more you will learn. The good news is, you do not have to take on a lot of risk to bring your ideas to market. You also don't need to be an expert in engineering or design.

And when you receive reports about your website traffic, you focus on the chart that shows average rankings for your targeted keywords. \nWhen you\u2019re spending good money on SEO, it\u2019s common to obsess over your keyword rankings. You\u2019re competitive and, to you, winning online means claiming the top spot in Google results. The problem is keyword rankings are an irrelevant metric to gauge online success. To truly understand whether your SEO campaign is working, you need to learn which measurements deserve your attention. \nRelated: 10 Fundamentals to Understanding SEO Relevancy gets results. \nLong-tail keyword phrases are among the building blocks of an SEO strategy. They are used to optimize copywriting, metadata and link-building strategies. They serve to boost your website\u2019s relevancy so the right web pages appear among search results for the right people in the right places. \nBut it doesn\u2019t matter how your website ranks for each exact search phrase because there is wide variety in how people search -- especially with the growth of voice searches -- and the results Google shows each individual based on his or her history, location, device and other data. \nThere is no universal \"page 1.\" Google is customizing search results using RankBrain, artificial intelligence that analyzes search queries to provide better answers -- making results less predictable and giving websites less control over when and where they appear.

What will you do to get in on this trend? Pratik Dholakiya - Contributor \nWhen you\u2019re a startup, you\u2019re almost always worried about the overall growth of your business. While raising enough capital is a huge concern, other factors crucial to growth include research, marketing outreach and efforts to spread awareness about your product/service. \nRelated: Five Ways to Learn the Nuts and Bolts of Crowdfunding \nFor these growth purposes, crowdfunding can easily be one of your most powerful weapons for business growth. In fact, the World Bank has predicted that global investment in crowdfunding will hit $93 billion by 2025! \nApart from a monetary perspective, however, there are multiple reasons why crowdfunding is such a strong strategy for startup growth. Let\u2019s examine the significant ones: Holds an edge over traditional fund-raising methods \nCrowdfunding is a fund-raising tactic that has reaped significant benefits with the rapid sophistication of technology and the internet. Everyone is familiar with popular crowdfunding sites like Indiagogo, Crowdfunder and ,of course, Kickstarter. \nTraditional financing options come with their own set of stressful demands, such as loan applications and the search for credited investors. In comparison, setting up an effective crowdfunding campaign through modern-day platforms can go a long way toward helping you not only acquire capital, but also get your message out to your target audience and beyond. \nIf you\u2019ve browsed through Kickstarter, you\u2019ve certainly noticed that nearly all the campaign videos you see are of incredible quality. While video and other startup costs to getting your campaign on to these big-name sites will likely set you back, it\u2019s a necessary investment , because it can expose your product or service to vast audiences in a captivating fashion. The results can be momentous. \nRelated: How to Decide Whether to Crowdfund or Bootstrap Your Business Gets you much-needed social proof \nWhen using popular crowdfunding platforms, you are exposing your message to all kinds of new audiences. If done correctly , a crowdfunding campaign can result in solid validation and social proof that will be instrumental in facilitating your business\u2019s growth story. Social proof can be used as a powerful psychological trigger that motivates viewers to buy. \nThese days, social proof is an essential factor in gaining market traction. It ushers in opportunities to generate increased media attention, conversions and, eventually, the interest of potential investors. Earns you loyalty \nThe people who back your ideas or business usually go on to become your early adopters and potential brand advocates. This is because, through your crowdfunding efforts, you have managed to earn and maintain people\u2019s trust in your abilities to the extent that they\u2019re willing to put their money into your idea. \nBecause crowdfunding is typically done in the early stages of a business operation, it is a golden opportunity for you to earn loyalty before your official product release. Your early adopters will then keep the momentum going once your campaign winds up, by promoting/sharing your story with others, both in person and on the web. \nHowever, simply releasing a campaign does not earn loyalty. Your messaging must present a unique selling proposition that convinces viewers that your product or service will improve lives. \nTake Lifestraw , for example. Its Indiegogo campaign was able to present a clear emotional appeal, considering that the product would make contaminated water safe to drink for the victims of Typhoon Haiyan. It would solve all kinds of problems in struggling countries across the world that lack easy access to clean water. Is cost-effective \nCrowdfunding doesn\u2019t always have to be a huge initial investment. And while featuring your brand in a press release, blog or social media post are strategies that may be cheaper, they will take you longer to gain traction. Besides, crowdfunding will help you create long-term awareness for your startup. \nAnother way to get discovered (especially by millennials) is by featuring yourself on discovery apps such as Gadget Flow . These types of programs help users stay informed about the latest crowdfunding projects across the market. Gadget Flow, in fact, can work wonders for your venture, as it offers a simple, easy-to-navigate interface with support for high-resolution images, video, and even augmented reality! \nThis innovative (and affordable) crowdfunding technique can act as a fruitful marketplace for potential investors or backers to browse and try out your products before they offer support. Allows you to start pre-selling \nA well-thought-out crowdfunding campaign can generate all sorts of interest and enable you to pre-sell your product/service from the earliest stage of business. This is because (thanks to your campaign) your early adopters are already sold on your concept or business idea before it even hits the market. This is a very common practice seen in board-game campaigns on Kickstarter. \nCrowdfunding also gives you great market research. Interactions with your community can serve as valid indicators of the general demand your product is generating. Depending on the number of pre-orders/inquiries you get, you can gauge whether or not pursuing your idea further will be sustainable for your entrepreneurial ambitions. Helps you refine your Idea and gives you authentic feedback \nGot an idea that you\u2019re ready to implement, but feel unsure of the loopholes it may have? Put your crowdfunding campaign to use. These campaigns attract vocal feedback, allowing you to engage potential customers and receive comments and critiques about your ideas early on. \nThis type of input can shed light on aspects of your business plan that you never thought of, in turn helping you to refine your current idea in line with customer preferences. This \u201cFor the people, by the people\u201d mentality of business is becoming more commonplace. \nRelated: How to Launch a Successful Crowdfunding Project \nIn sum, crowdfunding is traditionally perceived as a means to raise the initial capital needed to get a new business off the ground. However, as described here, other benefits can be reaped from it, as well. In fact, crowdfunding has proven to be a smart way for entrepreneurs to authenticate their business, win early adopters and receive the kind of exposure they need to grow holistically.

Are you ready to seize it? Matthew Toren - Contributor \nSome companies pass every test with flying colors. Others fold. \nIn most cases, management makes the difference between those that make it and those that don't -- especially during times of crisis. Every crisis is a two-sided coin. One side is a destroyer and the other is a creator. In other words, there is both folly and opportunity in any crisis, and it's the focus of a company's leadership that makes all the difference. \nRelated: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You Successful 1. Crisis \nFirst, you have to recognize that there is, in fact, a crisis. The sooner you can identify a problem, the sooner you can begin working on solutions . In terms that make sense to most entrepreneurs, there are two potentially fatal mistakes that business owners can make: They never seeing it coming. Thinking that your company is immune from setbacks and roadblocks is the worst mistake you can make. If you prepare, and the crisis you were ready for never happens, you're no worse off (and will probably be better for going through the process). If it does happen, you'll be able to snap into action. They are blindly optimistic. News flash: If there were no problems, there would be no need for solutions. The smart approach is to recognize that challenges are bound to happen and to prepare for them. Sure, optimism and staying positive are important. You certainly don't want to go to the other extreme and constantly worry about what could happen. But, there's wisdom in the adage, \"Hope for the best and prepare for the worst.\" \nRelated: Habits of the World's Wealthiest People (Infographic) 2. Opportunity \nYou want optimism? Here's where it can play a big part. Optimism is seeing the crisis and making the most of it. One of the reasons some companies have thrived in tough times is because they remained flexible enough to take advantage of the opportunities the crisis created. \nRelated: 11 Habits of Truly Happy People \nIf you have a company culture that insists on doing things a certain way because that's how they've always done it,\" you'll be in trouble when rapid changes in the marketplace occur. On the other hand, if you're always on the lookout for the positive in any situation -- even when it means changing your original plan -- you'll find opportunity everywhere. \nSo, the bottom line: Be prepared, find the bright side and be flexible. Do those things, and you'll be able to make it through just about any crisis that comes your way. \nHave you successfully navigated your company through a crisis?

Image credit: Bloomberg | Getty Images Andrew Medal - Contributor \nLet\u2019s face it: every time Apple launches a new iPhone to the world (or any other product for that matter), people take immediate notice. \nIts most recent releases, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X, have many people talking about the future of augmented reality and the way it will change the world. \nAnd we\u2019re not just talking about consumers here. Brands big and small, spanning a variety of industries, must take notice of how these smartphones are changing the augmented reality game. \nRelated: The iPhone 8 Will Influence the Mobile Community for Years to Come \nWith the latest iPhones designed for augmented reality, brands must think about ways to develop augmented experiences. Those that do this with success will move to the front of their space. Those who ignore this will get left behind. This means one thing: the time for development is now. A (not so) long time coming \nApple introduced ARKit at WWDC earlier this year and it was one of the first indications that Cupertino would be putting a lot of time, money and resources into developing an \u201cout of this world\u201d augmented reality platform. \nAt the time, Apple described ARKit as follows: \u201cARKit provides a cutting-edge platform for developing augmented reality (AR) apps for iPhone and iPad.\u201d \nWhile waiting around for Apple to make its next move, many companies, including Google with its ARCore platform, jumped in on the action. \nOf course, Apple has long had something up its sleeve. And that something was the release of the newest iPhones. The company announced that all of its new iPhones -- with the assumption that this will include future releases beyond the iPhone 8 and iPhone X -- will be designed to be augmented reality ready. \nTo the average iPhone user, the thought of their device being augmented reality ready may not mean that much. However, to those who have been waiting on this, including brands that want to develop an augmented reality mobile or web platform , it\u2019s among the best things they could have heard. \nRelated: 10 Marketing Lessons From Apple (Infographic) \nAccording to Apple\u2019s Phil Schiller , the cameras in the new iPhones are calibrated for augmented reality, meaning that they are fully capable of handling 60 fps video, which is the perfect environment for an augmented reality application. \nJust as important is the implementation of a new accelerometer and gyroscope, which is key to accurate motion tracking. Its features such as this that can make or break a device in regards to the augmented reality experience it provides. Brands are already making major moves \nAugmented reality development isn't simple, but Apple has gone a long way in making this more accessible to a larger number of developers. For example, Major League Baseball (MLB) is getting in on the action . \nThe MLB at-bat app will now have augmented reality capabilities on the iPhone 8, giving baseball fans access to more action, data and stats than ever before. \nHere\u2019s how it will work: by pointing your iPhone 8 toward the field during an MLB game, users will be able to see information and stats for each player. Forget about searching online for how many homeruns Aaron Judge has hit this season. You can use the iPhone to collect this information in the fastest and most efficient manner possible. What are brands doing to prepare? \nAugmented reality is a trillion-dollar industry that has growth potential unlike anything we\u2019ve seen over the past several decades. Think about this in the same light as when televisions first made their way to the mass market. \nRelated: Why This Cybersecurity Expert Wants You to Rethink What You Keep Secret \nOver the next few years, thanks to companies such as Apple pushing augmented reality to the public, this technology will change the way that people shop, work and entertain themselves. \nBrands are looking for ways to use augmented reality to not only attract new consumers, but to also boost sales and profits. For some, this means adding something to the real world (see the MLB example above) that really doesn\u2019t exist. For others, this could also mean taking something away, such as allowing consumers to only see items in a store that suit their personal tastes. \nThe days of thinking of augmented reality as nothing more than a pipedream are gone. Apple, among many other companies, are making sure augmented reality technology continues to push forward, one big step at a time.

However, there\u2019s some advice you need to heed to in order to grasp the opportunity you have been given on stage. Needless to say, if you bomb, the result can have the opposite effect. \nTo help you out, I spoke with three professional speakers to gather hints about how you can stay front and center, not only on the stage, but in the hearts and minds of your audience. These professionals are Dennis Yu, Leonard Kim, and Jared Lafitte. They can open the door to your knowledge of the stage. Allow me to enlighten you on their four best public speaking tips. 1. Overcome your nerves. \nThere\u2019s no greater feeling than to have received word you\u2019re going to present at an event or conference. The excitement can be overwhelming because of the opportunity your business has been given your business. \nHowever, when the time comes to step on stage, your mind and body can overtake you. Especially if you\u2019re speaking for the first time. To be able to take control when the right time comes you need to have a couple of things in order. \nFirst, make sure you prepare a speech. This is a given, but don\u2019t forget to know it backwards and forwards. Once on stage, if you have not already repeated the speech 100 times in your office or in front of friends, you are not concentrating on the eyeballs in the room. \nMark Twain who didn\u2019t really enjoy impromptu speaking, always practiced over and over before he had to step in front of a crowd. \nPracticing is one of the greatest ways to combat your nerves when the time comes. Muscle memory takes over your brain, and you begin to deliver your message without flaw. Preparation is the key to steady nerves at kickoff time. 2. Break down your knowledge. \nDennis Yu , the chief technology officer of BlitzMetrics, has spoken in over 19 countries, creating knowledge and power for his audiences. One of the hardest parts about speaking is taking high-level subject matter and explaining it on a relatable level. \nThere are many ways to make your topic understandable to your audience, but one of the best ways to get your message across is to break down your topic in a step-by-step checklist. \nYu says, \u201cThe task-level how-to components are easy enough to assemble if you know the material well and have done it yourself many times. If I find that I'm not able to easily assemble this checklist, that's a signal I don't know the material as well I think. So it's time to study more and enlists others who have hands-on experience, then try again.\u201d \nHands-on knowledge and experience are key elements to creating a successful public speaking engagement. In order to capture the mind of your audience, you have to have been where they are, so you can share how your past experiences might solve their problem. No matter if you\u2019re speaking about marketing or about a life-altering change, when you have been there before and came out successfully, you understand the steps to overcome a problem. 3. Create confidence through content. \nWhile working with Fortune 500 organizations and speaking to many thousands of people since 2009, Jared Lafitte understands the meaning of confidence and the power it has over an audience. \nRelated: 4 Actions to Immediately Increase Your Confidence \nConfidence suggests expertise, especially when you are being relevant and useful to your audience. Lafitte explains \"the word confidence comes from two Latin words meaning \u201cfaith with.\u201d So, if you want to exude confidence, you need to have faith in your content. \nNo one wants to hear boring content. Giving a great speech not only gives you better results, it is also more persuasive. The confidence of your presentation depends on the type of content about which you have decided to speak. \nIn order to create confidence you need to know and understand your audience. Find out all you can about the event and the audience attending. Practice social listening to determine their problems and see how you can resolve them in a presentation that provides real answers to their questions. \nLafitte says to show everything you\u2019re feeling during your speech. When an audience listens to you they\u2019re judging the authenticity of what you say according to the body language and facial expressions you use, just like in everyday conversation. Take advantage of this and really dig into being expressive. 4. Craft an engaging speech. \nTo captivate your audience, one needs to win their hearts and minds by walking into the living room of their situation and proving you\u2019ve been where they are. \nThis is what Leonard Kim excels at. Working closely with Ryan Foland in the speaking arena, Leonard Kim has been recognized by Forbes as a Top Marketing Influencer, by Inc. Magazine as a Top Digital Marketer, and by Entrepreneur as a Top Branding Expert. To say Kim has been before is an understatement. He has worked his way from homelessness to being featured in huge publications like Mashable and Fortune Magazine. \nIf you want to impact the lives of your audience and have them walking away feeling like they could conquer anything, you have to create a speech which engages with them. \nKim suggests breaking your talk into segments. Don\u2019t overload the audience with too much information too quickly. Take your time and allow them to consume the content. \nRelated: No One Cares What You Do But Your Story Could Make Them Cry \nPeople are impacted by stories. Kim says make sure you\u2019re telling a story, not giving a speech. There\u2019s nothing more boring than a rehearsed talk. Rehearse your speech, but don\u2019t memorize it. Give allowances for improvisation to work its way organically into your talk, which gives it flow for your audience. \nAnother way to create an engaging speech is to be engaging yourself. While it can be easy to allow your nerves to take over, it\u2019s important to relax and have fun with it. You know your material, you have the experience, and you can tell some great stories, tying it all together.

Make sure you do it right. \nRelated: 7 Rules for Entrepreneurs to Delegate Effectively \nHowever, like most business owners, you probably started out making all the important decisions. How do you transition decision-making to others? It is a process. You will need to train others to take on more authority and make good decisions. We recommend the following five steps to build an organization where your employees can make decisions and operate independently. Step 1 -- Build the proper infrastructure. \nImportant: It isn\u2019t safe to delegate before you have done this. The proper infrastructure consists of three things: Hiring the right people -- You can\u2019t safely delegate if you don\u2019t have the right people to delegate to In most small organizations, this means hiring people with potential and spending the time to mentor and train them. Document processes -- When documenting your processes , you literally write down how you want things done. Yes, this is boring, mundane work and no one is going to pay you an extra nickel because your processes are well documented. However, documentation is the best means for communicating how you want things done when you can\u2019t be there. Skip this step and you will likely pay a price. Developing robust metrics -- You need to get regular reports that quantify the performance of your business. Financial statements are a necessary part of these metrics, but by themselves they are insufficient. You need operating metrics that tell you how things are going in almost real time. \nOnce the proper infrastructure is built, you are ready to delegate. However, your employees may not be ready to be thrown into the deep end. Follow the steps below to ensure they are ready for the new challenge. Step 2 -- Employees provide recommendations. \nIf your organization is typical, employees bring you problems and you solve them. As a first step toward independent decision-making, insist that your employees bring you a recommended solution with the problem. You still make the decision, but you have the opportunity to coach your employees whenever your decision is different from the recommendation they brought you. \nBy the way, we find that leading your employees to a different conclusion by asking a series of questions is a far more effective way to train them than by simply telling them they are wrong. Another useful way to train your employees is to give them rules of thumb to follow as they make decisions. For instance, we worked with a company that had a goal of being the easiest company in its industry category with which to do business. The rule of thumb was to find the solution that would make things easiest for the customer. \nRelated: Learn When to Delegate and When to Micromanage Step 3 -- Employees make the decision, informing you prior to implementation. \nYour employees are now making the decisions, but because they bring them to you before implementation, you can change any decision if it is going to run the train off the tracks. Here, we would caution that you do not countermand your employees' decisions except in the most dire of circumstances. \nAfter all, you delegated that decision-making authority, so don\u2019t take back that person's authority. If you have to change your employee\u2019s decisions with any frequency, you have moved to this step too quickly. Go back to Step 2 for a while to give the employee more practice. Step 4 -- Employees make the decision and implement it, and you're notified after the fact. \nDon\u2019t go here until you agree with essentially every decision your employees make. If at this step, they make a decision with which you disagree, it may be too late to recover. Our advice is that you not go to this step all at once. For example, you might say that the employee, without your approval, can implement any decision with less than a $10,000 impact. But you want to be involved in any larger decisions before implementation. Step 5 -- Employees operate independently, while you monitor the results. \nThe final step is that you don't require notification at all. You simply monitor results and ask questions based on the metrics you see. Again, you may want to set dollar limits to determine decisions in which you need to be involved prior to implementation. However, to give managers complete authority over a division or department, you will eventually need to get to this step. \nDelegating decision-making authority is a tricky business, but these five steps will help ensure that you \"let go\" as smoothly as possible.

His girlfriend, Michelle Krivo, meanwhile, looked on with nothing but love for her man (and perhaps the unspoken question: You're doing this, why? ). \nNot once did Barrett utter any death threats or take a swing at us.

Next week, he takes on his next risk: the Iron Man race (a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, 26.2-mile runners' marathon) in Cambridge, Md., having done a previous Iron Man in Boulder, Colo., last year.

Here's How to Help. Only 37 percent of employees in one survey were \"very happy\" with their career path. Employers should be worried. Heather R. Huhman - Contributor \nA May University of Phoenix survey of 1,019 American workers found that only 37 percent of employees are very happy with their career path. This should scare employers. \nLack of career satisfaction can dramatically impact employees' engagement, productivity, and motivation in their current role. They see no future for themselves -- finding little purpose in the present and making it highly likely that they\u2019ll look for opportunities elsewhere. \nRelated: Employee Retention : Why it Remains a Daunting Task at Startups \nIf employers want their top talent to stick around, they need to find ways to get these employees the skills they need to get on to the right career track. Wondering how to do that at your own company? To inspire some ideas, I can offer three real examples: The Navy Federal Credit Union \nCredit union for military members and veteransHeadquarters: Vienna, Va. \n\u201cCareer-planning is an essential part of employees\u2019 growth and development. Helping employees reach for their goals is impactful to career satisfaction, engagement, retention and productivity,\u201d Thomas Greek, told me in an email -- he's vice president of learning, development and communications. \nRelated: Expert Tips For Efficient Employee Retention Strategy \nRecognizing the importance of meeting these employee needs, the Navy Federal Credit Union has offered a wide variety of career-development tools since 2005. Employees can participate in job-shadowing, get assistance creating an individual development plan and access several online career tools and resources. \n\u201cWe continue to add new resources and explore new ways to support our employees' career development,\u201d Greek pointed out. \u201cAs a result, our engagement scores for career development are more than 20 percent higher than the industry benchmark.\u201d \nTakeaway: Even on a small budget, companies can offer employees a wide variety of career development opportunities. \nPrograms that provide job shadowing or career planning can be organized with minimal resources but create big ROI. The key is to discover what employees want to work on and then determine who or what in the company can help them achieve that goal. \nGet creative. Just keep track of what career development initiatives are working and which aren\u2019t. Workfront \nOnline project-management softwareHeadquarters: Lehi, Utah \n\u201cPeople shape the future of a company as much, or more, than the company shapes the future of the employee,\u201d Laura Butler, senior vice president of people and culture for Workfront, said via email. \u201cBy working with team members to understand their aspirations and helping them realize their potential, the company will better realize its potential.\u201d \nTo help employees down their career paths, WorkFront has made development an everyday focus. \nThe company created a Slack channel where employees can share career advice or ask questions. Employees can choose between clear career tracks so they know exactly what they need to do to reach the next level. And leadership training was designed around learning how to communicate with employees so managers can assist with personal goal setting. \nInternal mobility is also incredibly important at WorkFront. Butler went on to say that the company posts jobs internally and publishes metrics on internal promotions so talent can reach their career goals without leaving the company. \nTakeaway: Make sure there are opportunities at the company for employees to move up. Keep people up-to-date on open positions within the organization. This can be done by posting them in the office, in an internal newsletter or on the company intranet. It\u2019s also important to announce these opportunities to current employee before advertising them externally. \nKnowing what types of roles employees desire will motivate them to develop their careers in-house. They\u2019ll see a real position that will fulfill their professional needs and keep them at the same company. Manpower Group \nWorkforce solutions companyNorth American headquarters: Milwaukee, Wis. \n\u201cIn today\u2019s skills revolution, rapid technological disruption means new skills emerge as fast as others become obsolete,\u201d Michael Stull, senior vice president of North America, said in an email. \u201cHelping people up-skill to remain employable, get ahead and develop successful careers has never been more important.\u201d \nAside from offering career development services to other companies, ManpowerGroup also offers its employees full tuition coverage through the University of Phoenix. That way, if people want to go back to school to improve their skill set, they will experience no financial hurdles to doing so. \nRelated: 3 Ways Corporate Heavyweights Are Improving Employee Retention by Prioritizing Maternity Healthcare \n\u201cCareers today are ultra-marathons. Young people will have more jobs in their twenties than their parents may have had in a lifetime,\u201d said Stull. \u201cThey are looking to us to help them change roles, shift gears and learn new skills at different stages of their working life.\u201d \nTakeaway: If need be, use outside resources to educate and train employees. This is especially important if employees want to make a big career change. \nHelp them go back to or finish school with tuition assistance. It might seem like a big cost, but consider the skills the individual will contribute to the team once their education is complete. \nAlso, remember that employees who are juggling school and work will need flexibility. Offer them different scheduling options so they won\u2019t become overwhelmed.

But to do that, your company is going to have to be scrappy. Daniel Wesley - Guest Writer \nSince the 1970s, Silicon Valley has been a place of innovation and promise where driven individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit could realize their visions, even if those visions emerged from their parents' basement or humble garage. Apple and Microsoft were amng the earliest of these companies with humble beginnings. And, since then, giants like Google and Amazon have followed in their wake, also rising to global prominence. \nToday, however, startups seem to be in a slump. Although 558,000 new companies formed in 2006, only 414,000 businesses launched in 2015, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data. Since Facebook became an established tech power 13 years ago, it seems that the biggest companies have done an excellent job predicting threats to their dominance -- and quelling them early. \nRelated: 10 Ways to Fund Your Small Business \nAs a result, startups have greater hurdles than ever to overcome in their climb to relevance. Yet, pushing a startup to success isn't impossible: Business leaders just have to be quick to identify new opportunities and follow a few strategies to think -- and grow -- outside the box. Drought conditions \nIt's still possible to create a Silicon Valley success story; it's just that the enormous scale of the companies mentioned above hasn't happened since Facebook. Take Airbnb, for example: It's one of the most valuable tech startups in the world, but the company's $31 billion worth is a paltry 6 percent of Facebook's $500 billion market value. \nAnd consider Venmo's success in the person-to-person, or P2P, payment space: Since its pioneering development of that industry, Venmo has enjoyed a level of success not many startups achieve. But competitors are on the case: Since Venmo's purchase by Paypal in 2013, its P2P payments feature has been duplicated by Square and Snapcash, among others. \nAnd Apple will claim its own piece of the pie by incorporating P2P payments into iMessage . That adoption is a late one but nonetheless demonstrates the ability of large companies to incorporate features of their smaller competitors and make competition more difficult. \nEven if your own idea is promising, your startup likely won't stand up to much scrutiny from investors if they're comparing it to Facebook, Airbnb or even Venmo. It might be tempting to accept the first funding offer you receive, but if all you really need is money, you're better off just heading to the bank. Hold out for an investor who doesn't expect your startup to become the next Apple, and emphasize that you're willing to earn investment equity with your own sweat equity. \nFunding isn't the only means you'll have to compete with larger brands, and getting funding might feel downright easy when it's time to hire new employees. Competing for talent against Amazon, Facebook, Apple or Google is almost impossible. No matter how attractive tech graduates find your company culture, your salay scale will inevitably fall short of their expectations. \nTo acquire talent, you'll have to get to those talented people earlier and more creatively , using events such as hackathons and other competitions. Have your executives or other leaders reach out to promising candidates to make a better impression than the run-of-the-mill recruiters employed by the bigger companies. \nRelated: 6 Overlooked Ways Small Companies Can Compete for Big Talent Surviving the startup dry spell \nCompeting might be difficult, but there will always be entrepreneurial opportunities for those willing to dig for them. I'm a firm believer that the internet will continue to change the way we live, from helping us find instant answers to our questions, to making shopping or business operations ever more convenient. Artificial intelligence will also open doors, and despite a certain level of fear surrounding AI, there's nothing all that scary about computers unearthing deeply hidden patterns that humans themselves are unable to spot. \nNo matter what the market in which you hope to establish yourself, competing against major companies will always be an uphill battle. In addition to old-fashioned grit and determination, here are a few more strategies to help your startup gain a foothold: \n1. Be scrappy. Getting things done is easier -- and cheaper -- if you use some street smarts. We bought all our office furniture with rewards points from corporate credit cards, and we use deliveries from Amazon Prime Business so that valuable employee time isn't spent on an office paper towel run. Instead of an expensive coffee service, we bought a Keurig and stocked up on pods from Sam's Club. If yours too is a small business, try not to overpay when you can save with minimal effort. \nOf course you can't always avoid spending money, but you should explore all your options before you sign up for something big like a subscription to workflow management software. You can get most of the same features from an option such as Trello for free and then spend more down the road when you have the cash for it. Almost 30 percent of businesses will run out of spending money before they can generate a sufficient level of income, according to CB Insights. Don't let your business fall into that group. \n2. Seek out local talent. With any luck, you'll be able to find employees already living in your area who aren't willing to relocate, no matter what the salary. Not every person trained in technical industries, for example, wants to move to Silicon Valley or the East Coast just because the pay is right. Many people love where they live and will gladly accept positions they're qualified for that are located in their own backyards. \nFind these potential employees through advertisements posted to your industry's local message boards and free social media posts. You can even get creative: Zeefo CEO Alex Stepanov was the first business leader to start recruiting tech talent outside climbing gyms. Climbing gyms! What began as a somewhat unorthodox practice is now being imitated by recruiters from companies of all sizes. Don't hesitate to go outside the traditional avenues of LinkedIn and email listings. Creative efforts will yield better results. \n3. Listen to your employees. How do you react when an employee brings a great idea to the table that goes against your company's mission? Change is hard, but if you can identify a long-term value proposition in a controversial idea, it could be time to chart a new course. A willingness to listen signifies a critical shift in leadership , from directing to coaching, and demonstrates to employees that they're more than just bodies at desks. \nRelated: 14 Ways to Save Money When Starting or Growing a Business \nFar from frightening off enterprising entrepreneurs, the current climate of startup drought should instead inspire more intelligent innovation. Large companies might have seemingly endless resources at their disposal, but they don't have you. \nCombining thoughtful leadership with hard-won capital investment and enthusiastic employees is your recipe for achieving the next level of startup stardom that's overdue for the current decade.

Just check your workplace. Image credit: New Line Cinema Andre Lavoie - Contributor \nThings that go bump in the night, monsters hiding under the bed and terrifying clowns called \u201cIt\u201d: These are the things nightmares are made of. But for some employees, the scariest part of their day isn't a movie; it's dealing with bad managers. \nRelated: What Bad Managers, Good Managers and Great Managers Do \nWhile no one sets out to be a bad manager, this scenario happens and all too often. In fact, one in two employees surveyed by Gallup in 2015 said they had left jobs to get away from a bad manager. \nSince managers are the main sources for employee motivation, productivity, happiness and retention, one who's a \"nightmare\" can wreak more damage than just unhappy employees. Even with today\u2019s technology and resources, managers continue to make major mistakes -- and that can hurt the bottom line at the same time it costs companies quality employees. \nThe solution? Be aware of the habits that could make your managers a nightmare, and don\u2019t get tangled in that web to begin with. \nHere are four examples of managers who haunt employees long after the workday has ended -- and how to avoid becoming one: 1. The poor \"people\" person \nA manager who doesn\u2019t interact well with people sounds like an oxymoron, but these individuals exist. When someone who doesn\u2019t work well with others is in charge of a team, the entire company dynamic becomes derailed. \nOne of the biggest things that suffers is free-flowing communication. OfficeVibe\u2019s August State of Employee Engagement report found that 31 percent of employees polled wished their manager communicated with them more frequently. \nUnfortunately, however, a manager categorized as a \u201cpoor people person\u201d may actually be uncomfortable communicating and dealing with critical employee situations. \nFor some managers, this type of bad management style will be easy to avoid. However, others will have to overcome their natural tendencies to stray away from social situations. This means that leaders have to assess personality types and understand which people skills that certain managers lack may need improving. \nThe best place to get information is from your current team members. Because they may feel they're being put into an awkward situation, you might offer an anonymous survey. Ask how frequently your employees would like to speak with management and in what format, and whether they feel management is opening up and communicating with them on the level they need. 2. The self-involved manager \nQuality managers have a knack for motivating their entire team toward one end goal -- the company\u2019s mission. While this is accomplished by setting and pursuing personal and company goals, good team leaders know how to invoke passion from employees and help them succeed on every front. \nRelated: The 6 Most Familiar 'Bad Boss' Types and What to Do About Them \nThe self-involved manager, on the other hand, has no awareness of anyone\u2019s goals but his or her own. This is why the incidence of managers taking credit for their team\u2019s hard work and not empowering employees happens all too frequently. \nSelf-involved managers may seem successful due to their ability to hit goals and make the numbers move, but that\u2019s all they\u2019re interested in. \nFor managers who want to improve, a good place to focus on is the greater good of the company. In this regard, managers need to know exactly where employees stand with their individual goals, the nature of their personal missions and where they picture the company moving to. \nIgnoring this kind of detail about employees may make managers seem self-involved, and employees will quickly lose trust in their leadership. \nSit down for weekly meetings or create an online chat room where managers and employees can come together. Make this a safe place for all to share their personal goals or discuss where they hope to see the company in a few years. Offer advice, step-by-step guides or continuing education courses to help employees reach their greatest potential. 3. The overly involved manager \nThis type of manager often wears a mask of popularity and is frequently involved in a small company or startup. \u201cOverly involved\u201d doesn\u2019t simply refer to the micromanager who has to be in on every project, opinion and decision. Overly involved managers take things a step further and try to meddle in every aspect of their employees\u2019 lives. \nWhile it is important to care about team members as more than just employees, there is a fine line between being a caring manager and becoming a close friend. Going beyond that point can make employees uncomfortable and even make it difficult to manage them. \nEmployees, meanwhile, may appear to like this type of manager, but his or her inability to successfully lead and manage will eventually cause the team to feel stagnant. \nRather than focusing on getting employees to like them, managers should look at what boosts those employees' productivity, motivation and passion. Knowing what makes them tick inside and outside of work will help bosses lead their teams to victory. Remember to keep things professional in order to maintain employees\u2019 respect for management and the company. 4. The indecisive manager \nThese managers are infamous for being hard to please. From their perspective, they\u2019re simply putting the company\u2019s best foot forward and perfecting employees\u2019 projects and tasks. But being unpredictable makes for a scary workplace situation. Employees are left feeling uneasy, apt to second-guess themselves and overly critical of co-workers. \nOnce indecisive managers become known for their lack of predictability, morale and creativity get thrown out the window. Employees need to feel safe in their working environment, especially with the person who is reviewing and assessing their final products. \nSo, loosen the reins a bit and have employees take control of their projects. When necessary, post guidelines in a shared drive, like Google Docs, to offer direction when employees need it, and don\u2019t forget to always be available for questions. \nIt\u2019s okay to make small changes to these guidelines, but don\u2019t jump in and change them too frequently. Let team members know they can always expect a supportive and guiding hand from management when needed.

Researchers found nearly all of the cancer patients surveyed want information about medical cannabis but can't find much. dispensaries.com - Guest Writer \nA new study out of Washington shows that when cannabis is legal and available, cancer patients are using it to combat the side effects of chemotherapy and other cancer-related symptoms. \nThe majority use cannabis to combat pain, nausea and stress. A small percentage said they used cannabis for the pleasure of the euphoric feeling it can provide. \nThe study also found more than 90 percent of the patients wanted information about the potential of marijuana to treat cancer, but less than 15 percent got information on it from their own cancer doctor or nurse. \nResearchers affiliated with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and the University of Washington conducted the study . They had 926 cancer patients in the study. The average age of each patient was 58, with an age range of 46 to 66. \nMost importantly, they live in a state where marijuana is legal for both medical and recreational use. \nRelated: Polls Find Voters In Pennsylvania, New Jersey Support Legal Marijuana Shifting Attitudes \nThe researchers note that there are \u201cshifting political attitudes on cannabis\u201d even as interest from the public has increased. They also note a lack of research into the potential uses of medical marijuana, as well as uncertainty about legal marijuana\u2019s future under President Donald Trump. \nThe short term answer is legal marijuana will continue. Trump recently reached a budget compromise with Democrats that continues, at least through December, the federal prohibition against the Justice Department interfering in states where marijuana is legal. \nWhat happens then is anyone\u2019s guess. Attorney General Jeff Sessions continues to voice opposition to legalized marijuana and has criticized state programs. \nAgainst that backdrop, the new study offers a glimpse into how marijuana might be used for cancer treatment in a place where it is completely legal for both recreational and medical purposes. Study Findings \nThe study found that of the 926 patients, 66 percent had used cannabis at some point in their lives. Currently, 24 percent used marijuana. The type of cancer did not seem to affect the use. \nThe cancer patients who used marijuana tended to be younger and with a lower level of education, although about half of all the patients had at least a college degree. \nMore than half of those who use cannabis reported it as a \u201cmajor\u201d benefit to their treatment, while another 39 percent said it provide a \u201cmoderate\u201d benefit. \nRelated: 10 Ways the Cannabis Industry Is Rebranding to Meet Its Biggest Challenges \nInterest in marijuana as a potential treatment was extremely high. About 92 percent of those in the study said they wanted more information about the potential of marijuana to help them with their cancer treatment. \nHowever, less than 15 percent received any information from their cancer doctor or nurse. Rather, they heard about the potential of marijuana from news articles, internet sites, friends and family or other cancer patients. \nPatients were split evenly between those who smoked cannabis or used marijuana-infused edibles. About 40 percent did both. For those who smoked, a pipe was the first choice, followed by a vaporizer and rolling it with papers. \nAmong the edibles, the most popular were candy, oils and butter and homemade baked goods. \nFollow dispensaries.com on I nstagram to stay up to date on the latest cannabis news.

Jim Judy - Guest Writer \nFranchising is designed to help people make the jump from traditional employment to entrepreneurship. From proven models of success to unmatched support systems, franchise businesses can turn aspiring entrepreneurs into successful business owners. \nHowever, there are certain professional backgrounds that have an advantage when it comes to the franchise business. I\u2019m not talking about industry or sector experience. That\u2019s often irrelevant. However, there are specific skills acquired through decades of work in certain careers that give certain candidates an edge. \nThough there are more than 3,000 franchise brands available today, they all look for a similar set of developed skills from candidates before awarding them a franchise unit. Skills such as sales ability, employee relations, financial intelligence and ability to follow and execute a plan are all in high demand among franchisors. \nWhereas there are many different professions that allow a candidate to develop those skills, here are five that stand out. Sales executives. \nWhether they realize it or not, most salespeople are already small-business owners. That\u2019s because sales is more about selling yourself than selling a product, so they learn early in their careers that their personal brand is important. Not only that, but huge percentages of their income are determined by their sales output, so they are already familiar with the concept of being paid for production, not just for their time. \nSales executives aren\u2019t likely to cower when times get difficult because they already have experience working difficult jobs. They are good at planning their days in order to maximize their sales success and are comfortable working with a fluctuating income caused by the uneven nature of small business. \nMost of all, they relish the idea of unlimited earning potential and have already experienced the thrill of earning piles of money from their efforts while their colleagues in non-sales roles settled for merit raises and salary caps. Team leaders and managers. \nSure, there are franchise concepts that don\u2019t involve managing staff, but most brands will require owners to hire one or more employees in order to successfully run the business. People who have never managed others before will quickly learn that it\u2019s one of the most challenging aspects of running a business. Advertising for positions, reviewing applications, interviews, background checks, drug screenings, referral interviews, training and maintaining employees are just a few of the jobs that come with a franchise business and much of that responsibility is up to the franchisee. \nPeople with management skills are used to dealing with employee churn, managing different personalities and stepping in when staff is short. They excel at creating hierarchy, assigning responsibilities, identifying and cultivating talent so that favored employees will remain with their company, rise through the ranks and benefit the business. These skills are especially important for candidates who wish to own multiple franchise units, often run with the help of regional managers. Accountants . \nGood accountants are well-organized, and a franchise business has a lot of different departments to manage. Duties including advertising, human resources, ordering, community engagement, business networking, and yes, accounting. Knowing how to manage their time and prioritize tasks is critical to their success. \nRelated: 8 Steps to Finding the Right Franchise \nAccountants thrive when solving problems, and though franchise businesses do a great deal to offer solutions to problems that have already arisen, new problems, or problems unique to an area, will require new solutions. Obviously, their financial intelligence will benefit the business because they can manage the books themselves and decrease the risk of an outside bean-counter acting in a way that isn\u2019t consistent with how they\u2019d like their business finances handled. Athletes . \nNo, it\u2019s not just Peyton Manning or the other high-profile athletes who thrive as franchisees. Athletes, in general, do very well in franchising for several reasons. They are competitive by nature and know what it takes to perform at a high level. They are used to working very hard to achieve their goals, as anyone who has survived the rigor of a professional sports season can confirm. \nMoreover, they often have a high net worth and need to diversify their assets, but aren\u2019t necessarily interested in spending a lot of their time running a business. Franchise concepts like the semi-absentee model allow them to spend a limited amount of time working on their business while others work in their business. \nFinally, they are good at following a system. Professional athletes are used to lots of structure during their seasons, so following a franchise system successfully is second nature to them. Small-business owners. \nIt\u2019s true that what often leads aspiring entrepreneurs to start their own business is the excitement of complete freedom to do their own thing. For various reasons, many find after some time on their own that they\u2019re better suited owning a franchise business. Business ownership has myriad challenges, so having some help along the way is appealing. \nIt could be to mitigate risk, to have a better-established brand or a stronger support system in place to help them reach their goals. Assuming they can assimilate into a franchise system\u2019s way of doing things, they have a strong advantage over other candidates because they\u2019ve already experienced many of the ups and downs of business ownership and are comfortable dealing with them. They have good community ties and professional networks built up over the years, know those in the area who may make good employees or partners, and have some infrastructure in place to handle things like advertising, legal and financial services. \nRelated: What You Need To Know Before Starting A Franchise Business \nThis isn\u2019t to say that candidates lacking professional experience in any of these categories shouldn\u2019t explore franchising. However, for those who feature one or more of these professions on their resume and are looking for a change, a franchise business could be a perfect fit.

Nicole Leinbach Reyhle \u2022 Guest Writer Image credit: Shutterstock \nParcel management -- the shipping and delivery of packages -- has long been perceived as a \"necessary evil and not an opportunity to lower costs or even create opportunities for profit,\" Brian C. Gibbs, president and founder of Refund Retriever , a parcel audit recovery and parcel management company, recently told me. Gibbs explained that \"too often businesses overlook both the value and the need for a strong shipping strategy, something that is actually much easier to implement than businesses often realize.\" \nRelated: 6 Secret Tricks to Decrease Your Shipping Costs \nThere are a variety of reasons why parcel management is so important for businesses to strengthen, but among the most important is that customers nowadays expect their shipping needs to be met with ease, satisfaction and minimal to zero investment. This includes the demand for on-time deliveries and flexible shipping options, something that can be perceived as either a challenge or an opportunity for businesses. \nBut, to Gibbs' point, these situations don't have to be difficult to overcome. Instead, they should be managed with efficiency while also introducing opportunity for businesses to enhance not only their operations but also their profit. Fortunately, in today's rapidly growing marketplace these opportunities are becoming easier and easier for businesses large and small to implement into their parcel operations thanks to automated solutions, more streamlined shipping services and parcel tracking that can help businesses not only save time, but also save money. Opportunities and demands of shipping \nPitney Bowes, a global technology company, recently unveiled its second-ever Parcel Shipping Index , revealing a 48 percent growth in parcel volume over the past two years and estimating annual growth to continue to rise at a rate of 17 percent to 28 percent year-over-year between now and 2021. This brisk growth is significantly attributed to the increase in ecommerce activity, with study results suggesting that rising consumer expectations surrounding online shopping are putting pressure on retailers to deliver on convenience, price and the availability of products from around the world. When you factor in the importance of consumer expectations on a retailer's success -- or failure -- it's critical to factor in the realities of parcel management, as well. \nRelated: 4 Ways Omni-Channel Retailers Can Step Up Their Shipping Game \nJordan Sim, group product manager at BigCommerce , explained to me that \"shipping is a critical component in creating a positive customer experience, however many store owners either dismiss it as unimportant, don't spend enough time thinking through the strategy, or willfully avoid it altogether due to its complexity.\" \nTo help ease the complexity that parcel management often presents to merchants, it's important to recognize the various opportunities and demands that shipping introduces to commerce based businesses. Sim offers the following five points when aiming to streamline your shipping strategy. Identify serviceable markets : Commerce is global, with potential customers ordering from every corner of the planet. Knowing your customers -- both where existing customers are and where new customers are coming from -- is vital to answering this question and prioritizing your growth strategy. Determine pricing strategy : Setting shipping costs too high may improve your margins per order, but may negatively impact conversion rate . Alternately, setting shipping costs too low has the reverse effect. It's important to stay attentive to industry trends and carefully consider overall pricing strategy, as well as shipping fees and options to remain competitive. Communicate shipping costs at checkout: Customers value transparency, particularly in regards to any costs associated with a purchase, so don't make shipping information difficult to find. Organize fulfillment and label printing: At this stage, the focus is on picking the purchased items, packing and labeling the box, and sending it out for delivery. Don't rush this process. An error in any of the steps could result in your customer receiving the wrong item or not receiving the items at all. Prepare for returns : Roughly 30 percent of all ecommerce orders are returned, so you'll need to consider the fees associated with the returns process as well as your company's returns policy. By simplifying returns with a pre-paid shipping label, you are encouraging customer loyalty and positive word-of-mouth recommendations to new customers. \nRobert Gilbreath, VP of marketing at ShipStation , recently told me that to strengthen each stage of the parcel lifecycle mentioned above you should -- quite simply -- simplify it. \"It's all about finding ways to get your time back, so you can work on the core of your business,\" Gilbreath said. \nTo help achieve simplicity while still effectively accomplishing your parcel management goals, automation is an asset for businesses large and small to incorporate into their shipping strategies. Automation allows merchants to easily customize their shipping and order fulfillment processes while saving them time and strengthening their shipping procedures along the way. Fortunately, commerce oriented companies such as Square and BigCommerce , among many others, make shipping from various marketplaces with various shipping providers and solution companies practically turn-key thanks to their integrated and automated solutions. As a merchant, this integration is key -- particularly when you're trying to save both time and money. \nRelated: The Holy Grail of Profitable Shipping (Infographic) The final -- and often hidden stage -- of the parcel lifecycle \nAs the expectations of commerce continue to rise and consumer demands for stronger parcel expectations continue to increase, it's critical for companies to factor in the realities of parcel management and how these realities can impact -- in their favor or not -- their businesses. One thing businesses should not overlook, however, is the conclusion of the traditional shipping lifecycle. There is another stage that is important for businesses to factor into their parcel management strategy, with a core centration on increasing profit as their end goal. \n\"Businesses are quick in accepting the charges billed to them by carriers such as FedEx or UPS, yet often there are additional fees applied to these bills that are not accurate,\" said Gibbs, who founded parcel auditing company Refund Retriever in 2006 while running his first eBay based business and seeing the shortcomings of shipment auditing. \nThrough the automated services provided by shipment auditing companies, businesses can gain an accurate understanding of fees applied in addition to a package's base rate for shipping -- something that Gibbs said is confusing for most merchants. The clarity delivered by this service, however, is far from confusing when delivered via an automated software that identifies extra, incorrect or unforeseen charges that include fees applied to select residential addresses, Saturday delivery charges, fuel surcharges and more -- accounting for up to 40 percent of overall FedEx or UPS invoice costs. And just when you think these factors may not impact your shipping strategies, think again. UPS and FedEx collectively have recognized over 100 extra charges , with many varying in names and cost for a single service. Refund Retriever, however, shows nearly 300 additional fees that are not a part of the base shipping rates of these parcel providers. When these fees are unveiled by a parcel auditing company, businesses can gain refunds and hence, gain profit for their businesses. Because of this, this final stage of the parcel shipping lifecycle is one not to overlook. \nFinally, Gilbreath suggests that understanding the process is the first step in strengthening your shipping operations, while Sim encourages businesses to \"take the time to periodically review your parcel management process, which is not static.\" \nAs the consumer marketplace continues to evolve and online shopping continues to increase, parcel management will only become more and more important for businesses to prioritize. Make sure your business excels in this space to truly meet the demands not only of your consumers, but also of your business. \nRelated Video: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pitney bowes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gibbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicole leinbach reyhle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert gilbreath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian c. gibbs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gilbreath", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ways omni-channel retailers can", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bigcommerce", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T00:24:38.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4044583ff5a9e449380a6accfa2abc548dcde1d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbjTYgnYCitdW..bh4RmFISDYz6yQg1XzO6", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "http://www.entrepreneur.com/latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur: Latest Articles", "title": "It's Okay to Scream Sometimes: How to Release Your Anger Without Hurting Others", "title_full": "It's Okay to Scream Sometimes: How to Release Your Anger Without Hurting Others", "published": "2017-10-03T23:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20171002170146-GettyImages-575100551.jpeg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 307, "comments": 0, "shares": 307}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 152}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4044583ff5a9e449380a6accfa2abc548dcde1d3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbjTYgnYCitdW..bh4RmFISDYz6yQg1XzO6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ben Angel", "published": "2017-10-03T23:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "It's Okay to Scream Sometimes: How to Release Your Anger Without Hurting Others", "text": "October 3, 2017 It's Okay to Scream Sometimes: How to Release Your Anger Without Hurting Others Trying to hold your emotions inside at all times can crush you if you let it.

As a former military guy and a SEAL, I\u2019m a big fan of the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) rule when it comes to planning. The important thing is to have a plan that everyone knows and can follow. Establish a leader who makes the decisions in an emergency. Everyone knows to follow the leader: Dad, mom, your boss, whoever is most comfortable taking this role. Run like hell. It\u2019s extremely hard to hit a moving target. Snipers train hours to do this with skill. For someone who is nervous, or is an amateur, it will be very hard to hit a moving target, especially under stressful conditions. You need to create as much distance as possible between you and the shooter. Hide only as a last resort, and with the idea that you will eventually need to move. If it\u2019s a single shooter, listen for lulls in gunfire. This could indicate a weapon jamming or the shooter is reloading. Either one creates an opportunity to run and distance yourself from the shooter and escape with your life. Know the difference between cover and concealment. Cover is stuff like concrete, large planter beds and columns -- things that actually stop bullets. Concealment -- hiding behind tables, glass and curtains -- will not keep you safe. Have a communications plan (who is going to call or contact who) and a rallying point in case people are separated. This should be clear and simple: the entrance coffee shop down the block, the entrance to the parking lot, etc. A Note From The Editor ENTREPRENEUR LIVE - Nov 9th | Los Angeles, CA Join us for a day of inspiration, networking and keynotes from Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jon Taffer and more!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sarah michelle gellar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandon webb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "webb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jon taffer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris kyle", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "navy seal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cia", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T16:11:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4baff924300284a404a74be77c2b4fb3fa977c96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbjoSar9J7tS8vaiymy4QwjE0P6TMgpQC1B", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur: Latest Articles", "title": "The Couple Behind 'Dogs of Instagram' Started It as a Pet Project and Now Have 4 Million Followers and a Successful Ecommerce Business", "title_full": "The Couple Behind 'Dogs of Instagram' Started It as a Pet Project and Now Have 4 Million Followers and a Successful Ecommerce Business", "published": "2017-10-04T16:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20171003135008-Lucy--Co-Lifestyle-042.jpeg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 536, "comments": 0, "shares": 536}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 158}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4baff924300284a404a74be77c2b4fb3fa977c96", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbjoSar9J7tS8vaiymy4QwjE0P6TMgpQC1B", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lydia Belanger", "published": "2017-10-04T16:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Couple Behind 'Dogs of Instagram' Started It as a Pet Project and Now Have 4 Million Followers and a Successful Ecommerce Business", "text": "Social Media > Instagram Icon October 4, 2017 The Couple Behind 'Dogs of Instagram' Started It as a Pet Project and Now Have 4 Million Followers and a Successful Ecommerce Business The user-generated feed of dog photos has become a hashtag and, in a way, an online movement. Start Slideshow Lydia Belanger - Entrepreneur Staff \nIn this series, Instagram Icon , Entrepreneur speaks with the individuals behind popular Instagram accounts to find out the secrets of their success. \nWhen husband-and-wife duo Ahmed El Shourbagy and Ashley Paguyo El Shourbagy met in July 2011, Ahmed had been posting photos to his new Instagram account, @dogsofinstagram , for a week and a half. Ahmed worked in finance and didn\u2019t have a background in marketing when he started the account, which to this day remains dedicated to posting user-generated photos of dogs. But the day he met Ashley, he hit 1,000 followers. And in Instagram\u2019s early days, having 1,000 followers on the platform was extremely rare. \n\u201cAt the time, I was working in communications and PR for a startup, studying the mobile social media habits of millennials ,\u201d says Ashley, who had invited Ahmed to a focus group. \u201cThis guy just like, waltzes in, and I find out he has this passion project.\u201d \nAhmed had an interest in social media and an itch to do something entrepreneurial. When he posted a photo of his Boston terrier, Lucy, to Instagram, he noticed that it got a lot more likes and comments than some of his other early photos. This aligned with his observation that many of the most popular photos on the platform at any given time were photos of dogs. \nRelated: Social Media Tips From 4 Dogs With More Followers Than You \n\u201cI found myself following all these strangers because I liked their dogs,\u201d Ahmed recalls. \u201cSo here I am, following \u2018Mike\u2019 just to see a picture of his dog every once in a while, and I thought, \u2018Well, this is kind of getting out of hand. I wish I could just follow one account for a daily dose of dogs, being a dog lover myself.\u2019 And that's kind of when it hit me.\u201d \nAhmed and Ashley began dating, working on the project together and bonding over it. One of their first dates was a brainstorming session for the account. \u201cWe didn't have hopes or aspirations of it becoming our full-time job or monetization, but we knew that we were onto something,\u201d Ashley says. \u201cIt was really fun, in the very early days, to sit down and say, \u2018Where do we want to see this grow? What are our goals and our objectives? What are some of the values that @dogsofinstagram stands by?\u2019\u201d \nTwo years in, they started to get approached by advertisers and sponsors and people who wanted to partner with @dogsofinstagram and do campaigns. And now, more than six years in, @dogsofinstagram has 4 million followers. The couple is also behind the account @dogsofshelters, and they partner with animal rescue organizations. Plus, they\u2019ve spun off a ecommerce business that sells dog products, named Lucy & Co. after their terrier, and they\u2019ve produced a book and a daily calendar using photos from their account. \n@Dogsofinstagram is powered by followers submitting content. When Ahmed created the account, he was just posting generic dog pictures to the account to get it started, but from the outset, he specified an email address in the bio where people could submit their photos. He received his first submission when he had only 70 followers. Today, the Twin-Cities-based couple receives between 100 to 300 submissions per day. \nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity. \n1. How did you get your start with Instagram? Ahmed: At first I was like, it'd be really cool to have an Instagram page dedicated to dogs, and maybe with like a local spin, so I created Dogs of Minnesota first. For about 24 hours, that existed. And then I was like, \u201cWait a second. I shouldn't limit myself here.\u201d So, I started brainstorming how to make it bigger, and I came up with the phrase, \"Dogs of Instagram.\" I was playing around with \"Dogs of the World.\" I wanted a name that spelled out what the account was, because I thought that would be really important for growth. When people see the account, they quickly realize what it is and are more keen to follow along. I started @dogsofinstagram like, the next day, and I never looked back from there. It took off pretty much right off the bat. \n2. What other platforms do you use and what percentage of the time do you spend on them vs. Instagram? Ahmed: We do have a Facebook page. We do have a Twitter account. They're practically inactive. Another platform just never really made sense. It's so photo heavy, so visual, so perfect that, right or wrong, we just didn't bother to spend time nurturing the other platforms. \nAshley: And it's the perfect platform to showcase the beauty of dogs and the dog-human relationship. That comes through really clearly in photography, and with the introduction of Instagram video and stuff like that, it just breathes life into these pictures. \n3. How much of your time do you devote to Instagram? Ahmed: One thing we did three years ago was, we parlayed @dogsofinstagram into another project, called Lucy & Co. It\u2019s our ecommerce boutique, a dog apparel and accessories brand. We launched in August 2014, and I think we had about a million @dogsofinstagram followers when we started. It gave us the final kick to quit our day jobs and do @dogsofinstagram and Lucy & Co. full time. We were building our website for Lucy & Co., working on our initial products for launch, doing some photography while we had our full-time jobs, while we were doing @dogsofinstagram. \n4. How do you promote your account? What's your number-one way to gain followers? Ahmed: Same way we've always done it: Just put good content out there. We don't really promote it at all. We never have. I mean, it's Instagram's algorithm. When you have a post that goes viral on Instagram, people who don't follow you discover it. \nAshley: We really stand by the quality of our work and we try and curate stuff that is delightful for followers and hopefully it's stuff that they want to share. So it's not uncommon to go through our comments and see that people are tagging their friend during finals week, like, here's a cute dog picture to get you through your test. \nAhmed: When we're looking through all of those hundreds of submissions, the first thing we look at is photo quality. Is the photo blurry, or is it sharp? Are the colors right? From there we're looking for something unique and interesting and something that will resonate with our audience. That part is a little bit less tangible. I kind of categorize it in my mind, photos are either super beautiful, like an Australian Shepherd on a mountain with a sunset behind him. Then there's cute, like a French bulldog puppy in someone's palm. And then there's funny. \nAshley: And I'd also argue there's \u201cthe everyday,\u201d like a really cute dog snuggled up in its bed with a blanket over it because it doesn't want to get out of bed on Monday. That's a relatable thing. We also look for variation in dog. We're not Chihuahuas of Instagram. \nRelated: The Secrets of the Woman Who Quit Her Job and Made Her Pug an Instagram Celebrity \n5. How do you engage with others on the platform? Ahmed: The lowest-hanging fruit is just engaging with our followers through the comments on photos. It's hard to keep up with that, just because we get anywhere between 100 to 5,000 comments on a photo. But we also take somewhat of a proactive approach with the community of creators on Instagram. So, people who have devoted an account to their dog. Or photographers. \nSometimes, if we identify somebody who didn't even submit to @dogsofinstagram that we really want to work with and engage, we'll reach out to them and say, \"Hey, we really want to do a series about your photos, we think they're really special and we want to highlight you with a post and a dedicated feature in our Instagram story.\" That's also something that's a bit more recent. For so long, we were getting hit with so many -- it was all kind of incoming. So there wasn't really a need to be proactive and go out there, but now we have a little bit more bandwidth to be a little bit more proactive and engage our community in that way and be part of the content creation process rather just like, \"Oh, cool, we got a nice picture through email.\u201d That's still our bread and butter, but we're trying to be more involved up front. \n6. What's your content strategy? Ahmed: Weaving video into our feed has been really fun. We're just trying to find a way to do that in a way that aesthetically works with our feed. But when you do have a really good video clip, it has a lot more viral potential than a photo, the way Instagram's algorithm works now. \nAshley: We definitely have met a lot of dogs and humans by way of this project over the last six years. It's also been a unique vantage point into this phenomenon. There are dogs that are way more famous than any of us will ever be because we're not a specific dog account, we kind of get to be flies on the wall and watch all of this roll out. \nWe have the unique privilege of receiving all of these stories each and every day where people are telling us about the very intimate relationships that they have with their dog and it fuels us, it keeps us wanting to do this. Dogs are not terribly controversial. They're day-makers. Scrolling through @dogsofinstagram is a pretty wholesome experience. \n7. What's your best storytelling trick? Ashley: We get a lot of submissions in real time. The people who have followed for a long time know to anticipate a roundup of Fourth of July photos and things like that, so we might start getting them a few weeks in advance. but then, in real time, people are enjoying an afternoon Fourth of July with their dog at a backyard barbecue and they're snapping that and sending it to us immediately. \nAhmed: Over the years, we've had interns. We have an employee now. But we still do the vast majority of that piece of our business ourselves. When we've used help, it was really just to filter out all of the stuff that had no chance of getting posted and just having a lower number of pictures for us to choose from. \nAshley: When we post submissions, we're able to link back to the original creator in the comments or in the caption. So, if there is something that catches your eye and a photo you particularly love or a dog you just can't get enough of, you can figure out where to find more of their content. \nAhmed: It's hard to take credit for anybody's success, but there are a lot of dogs that are famous now got their start, especially early on, with a @dogsofinstagram feature. And that's exactly what we wanted. We wanted people to discover dogs to follow. \n8. How do you set yourself apart from others on the platform? Ahmed: We almost never post a photo that didn't come with a caption. And we always post the captions exactly as they were sent. We let the content creators themselves tell the story, because we think that's the purest and realest story that you're going to get about this dog. \nAshley: Though we have that editorial eye, we let the voice be true to the dog or the human or the dog-human connection. \nAhmed: There are a lot of accounts that popped up after @dogsofinstagram that were kind of trying to do the same thing. People were just screenshotting photos off of hashtags and then posting them. And that's fine, but we always wanted this to be a lot more intentional, so we only post photos that are submitted through email or our submission portal. We have terms and conditions that people have to read and check that they've read. We want to make sure we aren't posting things without people's permission. \n9. How do you leverage your Instagram and to what extent do you monetize it? Ahmed: Brands will often reach out to us and want to do a campaign. That's the way we started monetizing the feed early on and the way we were able to fund our own ecommerce business. One of the first brands we ever worked with was BarkBox. We've worked with movie studios -- Warner Bros., Universal, Sony. \nAshley: In the early days of our partnerships, the more obvious brands approached us -- dog products. \nAhmed: As it's evolved, it's become more brands that are using dogs in their marketing as a passion point. It\u2019s widened what we can do as far as sponsored posts. We've had brands that have come to us with everything in place, they even have the content ready, like a video featuring this really cute dog and telling the story of their brand. We look at it, and if it feels like something we would post anyway, then we're like, \"Great, easy breezy.\" We've also had brands come to us and are like, \u201cWe think you guys would be a great partner, based on the kind of work you do with other brands.\u201d So, we'll start brainstorming with them, like, all right, here are all of the different kinds of campaigns we can do, depending on the goals you have. From there, we'll help them create content, whether it's us hiring a photographer, or if I'm shooting something myself. \nWe did a campaign with West Elm recently talking about dog-friendly furniture. And I shot that campaign myself. It was the first time I did a full-on shoot. And that shoot became a blog post on West Elm's site. So it's really cool like in addition to posting on behalf of a brand, we sometimes will create content that will live on the brand's sites. \nGoPro is one of my favorite brands we\u2019ve worked with. I think they're very similar to us in that they focus on user-generated content. And we really actually took that learning, and not just from GoPro, because they're not the only ones doing that. But they have a real advantage because they sell cameras, so all their customers are doing is creating content. And so that takes the weight off of them to create content. At the same time, their followers and customers appreciate it, because they're highlighting their work. And so, when we started Lucy & Co, and we were thinking about our social media strategy, we thought, a big part of our social media content for Lucy & Co hopefully will be people buying our stuff, going home, taking a picture of it and then tagging us. And we'll highlight it. That's like 80 percent of the content on Lucy & Co is our customers. And for us it's great, because instead of going out and constantly doing photo shoots, we have all these customers sort of doing that work for us and they love it. They probably bought something from us, a lot of times, so they could take a picture of it. \n10. What advice do you have for other Instagram influencers or people who want to build brands? Ahmed: It wasn't like having a million followers on Instagram meant that we could just open any ecommerce company and make a ton of sales. That's what people think, but it couldn't be further from the truth. We really had to work hard at product. We had to do everything that any other ecommerce startup would have to do. We have to be very thoughtful about what we're making and we have to market it in a way that resonates with people. The only difference is, we had sort of this free and organic marketing channel to use. But if your stuff's not good, if it's not priced right, if you can't get it to the customer, you can't have good customer service, it still won't work. So, it's been a slow process growing Lucy & Co., but I think that's the right way to do it. \n11. What's a misconception many people have about Instagram? Ashley: I think one thing people don't realize about @dogsofinstagram, because they don't care about the humans behind it. It's all about the dogs, which is super cool. We were doing @dogsofinstagram for three years on nights and weekends and it was a true pet project, by definition. It was just something that our free time we were devoting toward not only growing the account but continually improving the content that we were sharing. \nAhmed: First of all, if you're going to do something, do it because you're passionate about it. Because it's hard, especially nowadays, to break through the clutter and noise. So I think that the right approach, if you want to do something, is to not worry so much about followers. A lot of people get too hung up on followers. Before they've even created any content, they're already thinking about how many followers they have. My advice is, spend the first few years just doing it. Do it not because you're going to make money off of it or because you're going to become famous. You've got to just do it. And that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to take off, but it won't take off unless you do that. You've got to put in the time and effort, be passionate about it and do the best work you can to give it a chance to become something. And then from there, it takes a bit of luck, for sure. \nSomething that I think helps is collaborating with other people. And not in a, \"Hey, will you post my stuff?\" I always advise people to start by doing things for other people. Have someone be a guest blogger on your feed or take over your story. Do stuff for other people first before you ask them for a quote-unquote \"shout-out. \u201c \nIn 2017, there's probably somebody out there doing something and just about every category and every interest.

Kristin Hunt - Magazine Contributor \nSince its launch in 2007, cloud-storage service Dropbox has made in-office collaboration a breeze for millions of businesses across the country, and that spirit of teamwork radiates throughout the 1,500-person company\u2019s San Francisco headquarters. The space, designed by Rapt Studio , features a chic library, designated brainstorm areas, a rec room full of musical instruments and a massive commissary serving up delicious food -- with an emphasis on cupcakes. In fact, \u201ccupcake\u201d doubles as an official company value, one that signifies a playful work culture. And they don\u2019t mess around: One quick tour through the ultra-collaborative space and you\u2019ll witness so much \u201ccupcake,\u201d you\u2019ll leave with a toothache. Mark Smith Site Reliability Engineer \n\u201cWhen I started, we were 350 people. Now we\u2019re north of 1,500. We\u2019ve had to scale how we communicate, and the way we work together has had to change. You think about, OK, what worked at 300 doesn\u2019t work at 1,000, but how do we still capture the culture we want? It\u2019s been really exciting and really difficult, but I like where we\u2019re going.\u201d Tanner Godarzi Web Developer \n\u201cI know there\u2019s that stereotype of toxic cultures at tech companies, but to be honest, I\u2019ve never run into that here. I came from the agency world, which mirrored the show Mad Men down to a T. So this has definitely been refreshing.\u201d Kelly Marren Product Manager \n\u201cI\u2019m a former professional athlete, so I love having a gym on-site. It\u2019s really nice that at any point in time, I can go down there. It\u2019s also great that it\u2019s OK to take 45 minutes and do what you need to do. Everyone knows you come back refreshed. No one is like, \u2018Oh, Kelly was gone for 45 minutes. She must not be focused.\u2019\u201d Rachel Hansen Analyst Relations \n\u201cOur desk pods are nicely removed from the walking space, so it\u2019s open but private enough that you can get work done. There is a space on the first level called Deep Focus that\u2019s intentionally isolated, for those times when you want to just put on headphones and crank through some work. But then there are open spaces, like the roof, or Little-R, which is our coffee shop.\u201d Kristen Ojeda Diversity and Inclusion Program Manager \n\u201cWe have VTO, or volunteer time off -- they give us days off to volunteer somewhere. It\u2019s probably my favorite perk because you get to not only take time off but also do some good in your community. My manager is always pushing us to do that. It\u2019s not just something you can do if you want. It\u2019s encouraged, which is nice.\u201d David Gainsboro People Data Analyst \n\u201cWe have unlimited PTO, which requires conversations with your manager about taking time off. I just went to Japan for a couple of weeks, and with my manager\u2019s support, I was able to unplug. There\u2019s an approach of \u2018Be here when you\u2019re here, and when you\u2019re not here, don\u2019t be.\u2019\u201d Anthony Kosner Editorial Strategist \n\u201cThe editorial team works on storytelling around Dropbox and our technology and innovation, so it gives me a good reason to talk to just about anyone in the company. It\u2019s a great opportunity to learn a lot about how a tech company works and have a role in helping shape that.\u201d Tian Kisch Privacy Program Manager \n\u201cThere are a bunch of different groups we can get involved in. There\u2019s a basketball group, yoga classes in the office -- even an a cappella group, Syncopation. And of course, we have a bunch of diversity and inclusion groups here.

Howard S. Dvorkin - Guest Writer Twenty years ago, the October 1997 issue of Entrepreneur magazine featured stories on: How to use \u201cyour in-store sound system to amplify your sales and image\u201d (since everyone knows up to \u201c70 percent of all buying decisions are made while a customer is in the store.\") Why you should consider cable TV commercials (because this type of advertising has \u201cthe ability to geographically and demographically target specific customer groups\u201d better than anything else available). How to deliver good customer service via \u201cletters,\u201d\u201cpostcards\u201d and \u201cphone calls\u201d to landlines. \nIt\u2019s quaint to look back now and see how times have changed. What we really mean, though, is the technology has changed. It\u2019s quaint to look back on stereo systems, after all. \nRelated: Redefining Technology With Innovation \nYet we seldom look at how we\u2019ve changed. Specifically, how our psychology and attitudes have evolved. That\u2019s not an academic pursuit. If you plan to be in business 15 years from now, not only will technology continue to evolve, so will its young inventors and innovators. Here are some predictions for getting along with them. Not so obsessed with social media. \nToday\u2019s entrepreneurs either have grown up with or grown accustomed to the profits and pitfalls of social media. We cultivate our images to such an extent that we hire professionals to manage individual platforms. That may change tomorrow. \nAlready, college graduates are less concerned with their online appearances. In a poll of more than 1,000 people between the ages of 20 and 25, a majority of respondents said they weren\u2019t going to do a damn thing to make their social media profiles more palatable for employers. Perhaps understandably, 86 percent had no interest in creating \u201cfake social media accounts to fool employers.\u201d Yet 68 percent said they \"would never try to hide their social media accounts from potential employers.\u201d \nRelated: 4 Social Media Trends You Need to Know About For Next Year \nHere\u2019s the most intriguing line from the poll, buried near the end of the report: \n\"Entrepreneurial graduates are confident that they can even turn party pictures into profit by promoting clubs, festivals, clothing, spirits and beverages. A new career asset, 'having a large following on social media,' didn't exist a decade ago. In 2017, 12 percent of respondents named this as a skill when asked what they had to offer employers.\" \nPrediction: The next generation of entrepreneurs will care less about image than business success. Less than any previous generation, they\u2019ll separate their own image from that of the company. At home/not at home. \nAre today\u2019s entrepreneurs neglecting brick-and-mortar businesses that tomorrow\u2019s customers will crave? Online shopping is now so easy, customers can enter the make and model of a car on sites like Amazon, then order everything from a new set of windshield wipers to new engine parts until the day they get rid of the vehicle. That\u2019s amazing -- but ho-hum to young people. They actually like to \u201cgo\u201d shopping. \nRelated: Retail: It's Personal \n\u201cFifty percent of millennials actually prefer shopping in-store,\u201d says a new report from SmarterHQ , \"meaning some retailers may be missing the mark in engaging this 80-million-strong demographic.\u201d \nOf course, millennials aren\u2019t logging off and tuning out when they walk into a store: \u201c95 percent of this demographic are doing other things while shopping, including working, watching TV or talking to friends.\u201d \nPrediction: The next generation will succeed when they stop thinking about shopping as either online or in store. It will be one continuous process that might start online and end in a store -- or toggle back and forth several times before the sale is made. \nThis means more innovation than enamors us today, as we marvel when Amazon opens a physical store . It might mean the opposite of what we think now: Scope out the product online and pick it up in the store. It could very well mean making the in-store experience an interactive distraction that results in the customer's journey home to actually make the purchase. Embracing entrepreneurs -- until they grow too big. \n\u201cMillennials' preferences are killing dozens of industries,\u201d Business Insider reported in August. These include business categories as diverse as yogurt and beer. Experts wring their hands and pose theories. \u201cWhile millennials have created new fitness crazes, like SoulCycle and barre classes, golf has failed to capture their interest in the same manner.\u201d \u201cMotorcycle sales at Harley-Davidson, which represents about half of the U.S. big-bike market, were down 1.6 percent overall in 2016 versus the year before.\u201d \u201cWhile millennials like to work out, they're ditching gyms in favor of boutique, class-centric centers.\u201d \nWhat do these all have in common? Millennials who grew up during the recession don\u2019t value obvious displays of wealth. They want to impress their friends by being the first to make fresh new discoveries. They don\u2019t want to spend their money on the same thing twice. Think about the explosion of craft breweries. How many millennials want to drink Budweiser? \nRelated: Dear Entrepreneurs: Small Is Still Beautiful \nPrediction: In 2030, it will become easier to launch a business-to-customer startup because the next generation -- unlike its predecessors -- won\u2019t be shy about the risk/reward aspect of trying new products. Once a brand or company becomes established, however, it might be ditched for the new \"new thing.\" \nNo one has a crystal ball, so I've no way to be certain my predictions will come true. I do know this: In 2030, everything will be different, and not in incremental ways.

Satya Nadella - Guest Writer \nExcerpted from Hit Refresh by Satya Nadella. Copyright \u00a9; 2017 by Satya Nadella. Published Sept. 26 by HarperBusiness, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. Reprinted by permission. \n\"To be a leader in this company, your job is to find the rose petals in a field of shit.\" \nPerhaps not my best line of poetry, but I wanted these people to stop seeing all the things that are hard and start seeing things that are great and helping others see them too. Constraints are real and will always be with us, but leaders are the champions of overcoming constraints. They make things happen. Every organization will say it differently, but for me there are three expectations -- three leadership principles -- for anyone leading others at Microsoft. \nRelated: 50 Rules for Being a Great Leader \nThe first is to bring clarity to those you work with. This is one of the foundational things leaders do every day, every minute. In order to bring clarity, you've got to synthesize the complex. Leaders take internal and external noise and synthesize a message from it, recognizing the true signal within a lot of noise. I don't want to hear that someone is the smartest person in the room. I want to hear them take their intelligence and use it to develop deep shared understanding within teams and define a course of action. \nSecond, leaders generate energy, not only on their own teams but across the company. It's insufficient to focus exclusively on your own unit. Leaders need to inspire optimism, creativity, shared commitment and growth through times good and bad. They create an environment where everyone can do his or her best work. And they build organizations and teams that are stronger tomorrow than today. \nRelated: 15 Ways to Lead With Effective Communication \nThird, and finally, they find a way to deliver success, to make things happen. This means driving innovations that people love and are inspired to work on; finding balance between long-term success and short-term wins; and being boundary-less and globally minded in seeking solutions. \nI love these three leadership principles. The heart of my message: Changing the culture at Microsoft doesn't depend on me, or even on the handful of top leaders I work most closely with. It depends on everyone in the company -- including our vast cadre of middle managers who must dedicate themselves to making everyone they work with better, every day. \nRelated: 10 Books Every Leader Should Read to Be Successful \nI totally empathize with other leaders, and see my job as helping them become even better. Leadership can be a lonely business. It can also be a noisy place. When a leader steps into the arena, especially in today's loud echo chamber of social media, he or she can be tempted to make decisions that will result in instant gratification. But, we have to look beyond the temporal, discounting what someone will write in this moment's tweet or tomorrow's news. Reasoned judgment and inner conviction are what I expect from myself and from the leaders around me. Make the call, but don't expect consensus.

Colin Darretta - Guest Writer \nWhen I launched WellPath and was starting out as a first-time entrepreneur seeking to get initial traction without the capital to pour into expensive channels like Facebook , I was faced with the harsh realization many aspiring entrepreneurs face: \"I built this awesome product, now what?\" \nRelated: The 5 Mistakes That Will Land Your Email in the Spam Folder \nWith few exceptions, the reality is that if you build it, they will not come. Great product does not automatically beget audience. This reality is even more pronounced at the beginning of a business when getting an initial foothold can be a daunting challenge. \nFrom the early days, we were big believers in Mary Meeker's 3C's -- specifically that you should leverage content to foster community and ultimately drive commerce . We were all-in on building great content through a newsletter, but how were we going to build an audience of readers? \nSurveying the landscape around us, we realized that there were many other brands with similar target audiences, similar demographics and a similar readership as ours but, importantly, with non-competitive products. What this meant is that we could barter our promotional efforts and eyeballs with these brands without fearing that we might be exposing our customers to the competition. This meant working with well-known brands like Reebok, Well & Good, Fabletics, Men's Health and myriad more. \nMarketing tactics that in the past might have been derided as low quality were significantly improved by our team becoming increasingly data-driven about the audiences we chose to work with and how that conformed to our own target audience. This ultimately enabled us to acquire tens of thousands (and later on, even hundreds of thousands) of newsletter subscribers a month while maintaining strong open and click-through rates. In shaping our own growth strategy, we've found a number of elements to be of important utility, the most crucial of which I break down below. 1. Incentive sharing through rewards, recognition and gamification \nWe all respond to different types of psychological motivators. Some people seek economic value, some people like the pure sense of achievement and others value public recognition. \nRelated: 5 Ways to Aggressively Grow Your Newsletter Subscribers \nWhen it comes to tapping into those different motivators to encourage readers to become evangelists, nobody has figured out the process better than theSkimm . TheSkimm creates status (you're a \"Skimmbassador\" upon sharing with 10 people), rewards systems (you can get a combination of money and prizes for sharing), recognition (the \"Skimmbassadors\" are recognized in the newsletter on their birthdays) and gamification (a graphic serves as a fun and easy way to track your success and progress). Every one of these tactics can be incorporated into your newsletter to drive significantly more virality than any one of them in isolation. 2. Contests and giveaways \nMany brands have used lightboxes on their own sites that may offer some prize to those who sign up for their newsletter. This is a fine tactic and can convert a modest percentage of existing visitors into readers. What you are really trying to achieve is finding new readers who most closely resemble your existing base. \nThe key here is in being data-driven with how you select partners to run these contests with. The potential scale here is significant, as a single giveaway can yield tens of thousands of entrants. The risk, however, is that if you are not highly disciplined in choosing the partners you work with on different campaigns, then engagement on those acquired emails will ultimately be poor. Of all the methods we've executed, this tactic has consistently driven the most significant growth but has also required the closest monitoring and management. \nRelated: Side Hustle Secret: Here's How to Get Your First 5,000 Email Subscribers 3. Content swaps \nWhile having a newsletter that only promotes your own content will ensure your readers never leave your ecosystem, it doesn't do much to expose a new audience to your content. We use six content \"blocks\" in our newsletters -- essentially summaries of articles that appear on our main content site. By swapping one of these six blocks with another publisher whose audience was a good one for us to reach out to, we bartered audience and grew our email list while actually decreasing the content production demands of our internal team and enabling them to focus on fewer, better pieces of content. 4. Cross newsletter mentions \nWhen Finimize was building its relatively nascent newsletter with the mission of helping people \"understand today's financial news within three minutes,\" it worked with other newsletters with similar audiences, like CB Insights , to cross-promote and mention one another's newsletter to each brand's respective audience. People who already subscribe to and read newsletters are far more likely to sign up for another newsletter that falls under their interests, which can make this a particularly effective tactic. \nRelated: 7 Newsletters Online Entrepreneurs Should Subscribe to \nAny one of these tactics used in isolation can drive growth, but the real power is unlocked when they are used together in concert. At WellPath, we started with a nearly 10,000-person email list acquired through our ecommerce business and prior to launching our newsletter. When we did finally build out our own newsletter, we did so with the tactics we learned from others in mind. \nFirst, we built features into our newsletter to incentivize sharing, akin to theSkimm, understanding that enabling our evangelists to create virality would be core to success. Then we ran content swaps with brands like Fatherly to get our voice out there and build the readership base. Next, our focus shifted to executing giveaways with brands like Women's Health , Bandier and MindBodyGreen to really pour the fuel on the fire. Finally, we were able to broker newsletter cross-promotional opportunities with many other brands across the wellness industry. Over the course of our first year after launching the newsletter, we executed partnerships with over 200 different companies and acquired 1 million subscribers. \nWhile all of that relationship-building may sound daunting, there are plenty of platforms that exist to facilitate the connection process. Linkedin , Levo , DojoMojo (which, in full transparency, I ultimately co-founded to facilitate the building of brand connections) all exist to help network-building. Even absent using a software solution, there are almost always preexisting relationships you or a team member already has that you can tap into. \nThere are few more cost-effective ways to build your brand, establish thought leadership and acquire customers than by building a direct relationship with them through an email newsletter. And building your list is not a black box but rather an achievable, repeatable and scalable process you can incorporate into your business strategy tomorrow.

I recommend you start now. \nRelated: 50 Rules for Being a Great Leader \nTrue leadership has three parts to it, and it begins with making the commitment to become a leader. For me, making the decision to become an effective leader helped me turn my struggling business into a thriving global franchise. I believe anyone can make this decision at any point in their lives to become a leader if they're serious about it. \nSpeaking of decision making ... 1. Be decisive. \nIndecision causes entrepreneurs more lost money, more stress, more anxiety and more loss of market share than making the wrong decision. That's why the key to success as an entrepreneur is to train yourself to make decisions fast, even when only a small amount of information is available to make your decision. \nThe reality is that you will only ever have 30 percent to 50 percent of the information you need to make the decision any given time. If you make the right call, great! Continue to dominate. If you make the wrong decision, you'll know it immediately because of lost money, lost time or lost opportunities. The second you notice that dip, you can be decisive again and course correct. \nLook, I know it's scary to make a decision, but as an entrepreneur the success of your business hinges on the decisions you make and the speed with which you make them. I once threw down $1 million to buy a new office building for my growing team . Unfortunately, that building was directly across the street from the local men's prison. Somehow, I had talked myself into thinking that wasn't a big deal. \nThen, I discovered our dream building up for sale in a much nicer part of town ... for $3 million. \nRelated: 10 Books Every Leader Should Read to Be Successful \nNow, was I trigger shy after making my first mistake? Yes, I was, but when I saw the new building I knew in my gut that it was the proper home for my business. So, I bought it and moved the team there instead. \nThat course correction paid off almost immediately. The second my team set foot in the new building, everyone started performing at a higher level. \nHere's how I trained myself to be more decisive: I started making all my small decisions faster. Which shirt to wear, where to take my wife on date night -- I've trained myself to make these decisions within five seconds. That means when I get to the big decisions , I can make them fast, usually within minutes. \nThat one-minute decision allows me to seize the opportunity before anyone else gets to it, or learn a valuable lesson and course correct. 2. Communicate clearly and openly. \nPoor top-down communication can kill any business. I've seen so many businesses full of well-meaning, talented people run into trouble because the leader is picturing a plan of \"X, Y, Z\" and the team is executing a plan of \"A, B, C.\" \nRelated: 15 Ways to Lead With Effective Communication \nThe most important thing to remember about communication is to be clear and never make assumptions. My favorite communication strategy is to start by first explaining the outcome for what I want. That's key. \nThen, once I've explained the outcome, I explain the action steps. Then, I ask the other person to repeat back to me what I just explained. If what they repeat back sounds like what I just said, then I know we're in good shape. If they say something different, then it's an opportunity to explain further and achieve clarity. 3. Respond instead of reacting. \nEvery business runs into problems. As an entrepreneur, you have to deal with team members quitting right when you need them most, bad employees trying to sabotage your business, servers going down, embezzlement, people getting injured -- you name it. \nAll those situations suck, but it's your call whether you react or respond. To react means letting your emotions take control, which means doing something you'll regret later. Forget who's \"right\" -- nobody walks away from a shouting match looking good, and that's certainly not effective leadership. \nThis is an embarrassing story, but way back when I was selling my first online product, I had a guy call in and ask me for a refund. He politely explained that the product was glitchy and he didn't see the value in it. \nRelated: 22 Qualities That Make a Great Leader \nIn hindsight, I know he was 100 percent correct. More importantly, I know the mature response would have been to take his feedback on board, give him the refund, promise to improve the product and reconnect with him later once I had the updated version live. That's not what I did. \nInstead, I reacted by trying to justify the problems and shortcomings of my product. You see, in my mind he was insulting my product, and I took that personally, which led to a shouting match -- and nobody won. \nSince then I've learned how to respond to problems with solutions, rather than reacting emotionally. We once had an employee effectively lose us $640,000. So, I pulled our team together, figured out who had the bandwidth the cover her projects and made a plan to move forward and recover the lost revenue. \nThat time, I didn't waste any energy sulking, reacting emotionally or getting angry. I just went into action, responded to the problem and focused on the desired outcome: building a successful business with a positive culture. \nThese days, my business empire is growing so rapidly that no setback can stop us. Whenever there's a problem, we respond with a plan and the team just keeps driving toward our ultimate goal: creating a world-class global franchise . \nIt all starts with leadership. Your business can grow into a thriving empire if you develop the leadership to take it there. Leadership is a decision, and you can make the decision to become a leader at any time. I recommend you start now.

Dekera Greene Rodriguez - Guest Writer \nFail fast. The refrain that echoes throughout Silicon Valley champions the idea of trying and failing -- quickly, in order to reiterate faster. Decision-makers in organizations face the pressure of choices that have real, and oftentimes, rapid consequences for them. Some have developed an intuition keen enough to forge ahead even in the face of naysayers and investors , while others become paralyzed by the fear of making the wrong choice. The hesitant actors fail to recognize that indecision itself is a decision. As the clock moves forward, failure to timely act on information removes the agency to influence an outcome. Hesitation is the proverbial nail in the coffin. \nRelated: Can a Business Plan Defeat the Fear of the Unknown? \nIn business, people make errors. Until things go wrong, sometimes companies cannot develop new insights. Deliberate practice and preparation do not always avoid unknowns. Uncertainty can be powerfully intimidating. The following three approaches are designed to help guide companies in their uncertainty by building intestinal fortitude, engaging in discovery while welcoming accidents and creating a framework for decision-making. 1. Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. \nIn 1926, Graham Wallas , cofounder of the London School of Economics , published The Art of Thought , where he outlined one of the earliest models of using the creative process to develop insights. He laid the foundation for deliberate practice as a method to cultivate perception. Almost a century later, his ideals predominate thinking on using discernment to make decisions. His formula -- preparation, incubation, illuminatiom and verification -- highlights the foundation of problem-solving. \nMihaly Csikszentmihalyi expanded on Wallas's work in Creativity , published 70 years later. Csikszentmihalyi developed illumination as insight, verification as evaluation and added the concept of elaboration. Their body of work provides the basis for connecting process to decision-making. Developing ideas through practice, which produces possible solutions, however, is a lot easier when solving for known problems. What happens when a company doesn't know its problem or how to solve it? \nWhen New Yorker editor-in-chief David Remnick interviewed Netflix CEO Reed Hastings in last year, he asked Hastings what kept him up at night. His response: \"Nothing.\" Hastings said that they had disrupted the Blockbuster model and would most likely face disruption themselves in another 10 to 15 years. For Hastings, the company's current concern as a network is to focus on converting their \"customers' dollars into joy\" -- not lamenting the unknown. \nHastings' comfort in uncertainty might also reflect his philosophy on strategy. Netflix decided not to pursue sports because they are a network, not a cable replacement. According to Hastings, \"strategy is all of the things you are not doing.\" Because of his firm conviction in their vision in one respect, Netflix can afford uncertainty in another. \nWhile Netflix\u2019s spending on original content has been much-debated , its coup in acquiring talent like Shonda Rhimes bolsters its commitment to customer joy. Rhimes\u2019 Shondaland production company will continue the shows she currently has with ABC -- Grey\u2019s Anatomy , Scandal , How to Get Away with Murder and the upcoming Grey\u2019s Anatomy spin-off. She ended her most recent contract early to start at Netflix. \nRelated: Netflix by the Numbers on Its 20th Birthday 2. Explore available options, but be open to unexpected insights. \nComfort with uncertainty can benefit decision-making because it builds intuition. Intuition in this sense is an assessment of approaches that might function and a framework for predicting probability. Some firms call them forecasting models and others call them tools. Tools are useful, but exhaustive predictions of scenarios leave little room to anticipate Eureka moments or increase the incidence of unintentional insights. Being comfortable with uncertainty lays the groundwork for being open to happenstance. \nMartin Chalfie won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008 . In Gary Klein 's 2014 work Seeing What Other's Don't , Chalfie recounts how he sat in on a lunch lecture in 1989 at Columbia , that serendipitously gave him a key piece of the insight he was missing in his methodology. At that time, he conducted research on worms' nervous systems, and his assistants killed them to study their tissue. When the speaker talked about the bioluminescence of jellyfish , Chalfie realized that the worms he used were translucent and that he could use the GFP protein and ultraviolet rays to make the worms produce light and better study their cells while they were living. The unintended consequence of being exposed to other ideas informed his imagination and changed his methodology. 3. Use decision rights. \nDecision rights allow companies to clarify who makes what decisions, thereby increasing economy and efficiency. Bain & Company in an Insights Management Tools guide that describes the decision rights framework as tools that help companies to organize their decision making and execution by setting clear roles and accountabilities and by giving all those involved a sense of ownership of decisions. It's basically an outline of when to provide input, who should follow through and what is beyond their scope. \nInstituting decision rights is important because it give ownership of tasks to the people within companies who are most capable of completing them. Ownership inspires confidence in team members and increases their accountability and interest. When the most-informed people use their insights and information and are unafraid to fail fast, companies win. \nRelated: This Founder Shares Why In Order To Learn Fast, You Need to Fail Fast \nAppropriate selection of people and departments is critical for organizations. In his Harvard Business Review article, Peter Jacobs interviewed Harvard Business School Professor Emeritus Michael C. Jensen , who noted that decision rights as a process that is too centralized could often fail to capture critical information. Jacobs also noted that where decision rights are too democratized, companies fail to make timely choices. The article further encourages teams to routinely revisit allocation of decisions to ensure that decision-placement makes sense, and to not conflate bad outcomes with a bad process. Teams are selected because they share the same vision, culture and values -- trust them to make the right decisions and know that when they are empowered, they can be accountable. \nInnovating in companies -- especially large ones -- is challenging enough. Having strong teams and leaders that focus, move tasks along in a work stream, deliver and win is essential to company growth. Their performance is contingent upon them being able to make decisions within their parameters. When they do, they can lead integrally within their groups and put products and services into the marketplace, even while uncertain.

Here are the words to the chorus: \n\"Elon\u2019s making me so sad cause I calculated the math of our birthdatesAnd I had a head start out of the start gate, 2 years plus 86 days, but that all went to wasteOh, Elon you\u2019re making me so sad cause the race that I wanted to have was not much of a raceAnd I tried, Love! And for a moment I thrived, Love!

ABC \nNearly a year ago, none of Carson Kropfl's skateboards would fit in his locker or backpack, so the 12-year-old entrepreneur and inventor decided to solve the problem himself. \nThat's when he came up with Locker Board , a startup that manufactures smaller skateboards made from recycled materials. \nNow, his business, which has sold 310 skateboards to date and made more than $18,000 in revenues, has a partnership with business magnate and serial entrepreneur Richard Branson . \nIn the season nine premiere of ABC's \" Shark Tank,\" which featured Branson as a guest judge, Kropfl pitched his startup \u2014 he practiced before bed for two months \u2014 and received offers from Branson, Mark Cuban , and Robert Herjavec. Ultimately, Kropfl accepted Branson's offer of $65,000 for 20% of his company. \n\"He had the higher offer and he also said that [I] reminded [him] of himself when he was younger,\" Kropfl tells Entrepreneur. \"I want this to become an international company that creates cool products and inspires people to shred hard, dream hard and work hard.\" \nAn entrepreneur at heart, Locker Board wasn't Kropfl's first business venture. At age 7, Kropfl, with help from his mother Carrie, created Street Tube, a skateboard accessory that gives riders the experience of surfing. It was both Street Tube and Carson's belief in always \"seizing the moment\" that led him to the stage of \" Shark Tank.\" \nDuring a family vacation, shortly after Carson had developed Street Tube, he and his family ran into a man wearing a \" Shark Tank\" emblem on his shirt in the hotel elevator. Carson and his mother immediately pitched Street Tube to the man, who turned out to be Max Swedlow, an executive producer of the show. Getting Swedlow's business card and keeping in contact, years later the producer reached out to Carson to apply for the show. \n\"If we hadn't seized the moment and had the nerve to strike up a conversation with him, I don't know that we'd be here today,\" Carrie Kropfl says. \nTo Carson, being a young entrepreneur has its advantages. \"I think the advantages are getting help from a lot of people and having the opportunity to just be mentored to do better,\" says the young entrepreneur, whose mentors include Nike sustainability leader Noah Reinhertz and Wahoo Fish Taco co-founder Wing Lam. \nOn top of seizing every moment, Carson says the other best advice he's ever received is, \"To always keep on dreaming and never give up.\" Read the original article on Entrepreneur .

Employers have bright lines on pot use for decades. This all gets more complicated when marijuana is legal. Andre Bourque - Contributor \nHuman Resources is really up against an ill-defined wall. For decades, they have been able to test job applicants and employees for the presence of marijuana in their systems. With a firm drug policy in place, they could \u2013 somewhat officiously \u2013 discipline or fire you. \nMarijuana is a controlled substance according to the FDA. The DEA, OSHA, and Workers\u2019 Comp underwriters all supported firm and consistent testing and regulation. But, it\u2019s all changed with the expanding legalization of medical cannabis and adult-use recreational marijuana. Now, the employer\u2019s problem is how to handle marijuana testing and use during work hours. \nRelated: The Wishful Outlook for Marijuana Jobs in 2017 The problem rolling into the future. \nWriting for SHRM (Society for Human Resource Management) , Joanne Deschenaux quoted attorneys Timothy P. Van Dyck and Nathaniel Nichols at Edward Wildman Palmer, \u201cThis uncertain regulatory scheme places employers in the delicate position of attempting to comply with divergent laws while maintaining order and safety in the workplace.\u201d \nSo far, everyone seems to agree that an employer has responsibility for those employed on its property and under its authority, so the employer has the right to install and administer a Drug-Free Workplace Policy. Writing for North Bay Business Journal, Cynthia Sweeney points out , employers who do not have a well-documented cannabis policy could expose themselves to allegations of discrimination. \nIt has the right and duty to protect its interests and employee safety with policy and practice that has a bona fide connection with business purpose and health and safety. Still, state-by-state legalization has complicated the understanding of what is and isn\u2019t bona fide. \nJust as a business might prohibit use of alcohol during work hours or appearance for work under the influence of alcohol, it may have a firm and consistent zero-based policy on marijuana. One problem is how that will roll out for employers with employees in different states. \nIn California, for example, a federal district court in California reaffirmed that an employer maintains the right to discipline employees even where the marijuana use is recommended by a physician: \u201cIt does not violate [California\u2019s laws against workplace discrimination] to terminate an employee based on their use of marijuana, regardless of why they use it,\u201da federal district court in California. \nThe other problem occurs when the business is a federal contractor when the employer must abide by the Federal Drug-free Workplace Act (FDW). Absent a firm and consistent drug policy, the employer can lose eligibility for federal contracts. \nHere\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s only right that a business pursues maximum productivity, and it\u2019s only necessary that it protect all workers\u2019 safety and rights. You can see where a best practice might accomplish all this for medical marijuana patients. How it can also respect or deal with the lifting of prohibitions against recreational use remains an open question. \nRelated: Where Marijuana Is Legal HR Policy Needs to Adjust Possible solutions \nAll businesses run scared of the law. But, even the law has limits. The smallest businesses and small family businesses, for example, fall under the thresholds for some compliance issues. Federal contractors and state contractors face obligations that other companies do not. \nSome employers see no problem with allowing marijuana use in the workplace. Businesses in creative businesses like gaming and app development. And, of course, an increasing number of businesses are directly involved with marijuana production, distribution, and sale. \nOregon has provided a partial solution to some medical marijuana cardholders. \u201cThe regulatory body governing Oregon\u2019s recreational marijuana program created a regulation specifically allowing employees of a licensed marijuana facility, who are medical marijuana cardholders, to consume marijuana within the facility,\u201d notes cannabis industry attorney Brad Blommer of Portland-based Green Light Law Group . \u201cThere are limitations, such as the employee must be alone, in a closed room not visible to others outside the room, and the employee may not smoke or vape or become intoxicated while on duty.\u201d \n\u201cAbout 9.74 percent of Americans have gone to work under the influence of marijuana, according to a survey conducted by Survey Monkey for Mashable .\u201d They go on to say, \u201cPrescription drug takers were much more common, with 28.28 percent of people saying they've gone to work after taking prescribed medication. However, about 7.28 percent say they took these drugs for recreational purposes, rather than medicinal purposes.\u201d \nConsidering these numbers and the complexity created with the passage of decriminalization, you should design a policy with the help of your HR attorney. Federal law on use and possession of controlled substance offers no safe harbor, so a business housed in a state that has not decriminalized marijuana can stick with a Zero-Tolerance standard. \nBut, if your business is headquartered in or has employees in states that have legalized possession and use of medical marijuana and/or adult-use marijuana, you may need a policy with some flexibility: \nDefine what policy means by \u201cmarijuana,\u201d\u201ccannabis,\u201d\u201cmedical marijuana,\u201d\u201crecreational use,\u201d\u201cafter hours,\u201d or any other term used in the policy. \nClarify what the business means by \u201cunder the influence.\u201d \nSpecify procedures and penalties. \nRequire employees to self-disclose if they want accommodation under ADA. \nProtect employees who self-disclose medical problem from discrimination. \nContract for testing that differentiates marijuana use from other drugs. \nEducate employees and managers in clinical issues relating to the nature of cannabis, its effects and their relationship to work, and the language of laws affecting drug use and abuse. \nRefer employees to resources for treatment of abuse of drugs. \nInclude policy in recruiting materials and new hire onboarding. \nRemain consistent in practice and application of policy. \nRelated: Why Your Company Needs an Up-to-Date Marijuana Policy Educate yourself \n\"We are not required by law to test our employees for cannabis, so we don't,\u201d says Jesse Peters, CEO at Eco Firma Farms in Oregon . Peters is a founding member of both the Oregon Cannabis PAC and the Oregon Cannabis Association, a leading lobby group instrumental in the advancement of legalization in the state, as well as guiding cannabis reform in Washington, D.C. \u201cEmployers in states where there\u2019s no precedent for cannabis testing may have the option of omitting it from their program\u201d says Peters. While Eco Firma Farms prioritizes compliance with state and local regulations, maintaining a safe and sober workplace is paramount. \u201cIt comes down to how one views their employees\u2014we firmly believe in the personal freedoms afforded every human. So long as their lifestyle choices don\u2019t undermine policy, we respect an employee's right to utilize cannabis.\u201d \nBusiness owners and management should stay informed on changes in the law. They must work with HR lawyers to remain current with and ahead of the curve on legal issues as well as the challenge presented by use. \nFor example, employees do not have to smoke to use cannabis. They can imbibe or consume cannabis discreetly in edibles or vaping. And, if you have employees in more than one state, even those where use has been legalized, you need a policy that can juggle the variations in the law. \nIt is likely that Colorado and its courts will define the best practice over time. It is also likely that California will draw the most employee-favorable policies. And, employers contracted with organized labor will face even more challenges.'As a result, cannabis advocates must continue their good fight for clarity and continuity. Employers can generally take refuge in conservative policies and procedures.

Buy it now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | iTunes | IndieBound \nLet's say the marketing department at Generico Housing Insurance, Inc. wants to build an ad campaign to promote its new insurance coverage for egg damage caused by bored teenagers. It's decided to use the Googl Display Network (GDN) method to test its campaign. It creates two display ads. The copy in both is identical and only the images are different. Ad 1 shows a house being egged by teenagers. Ad 2 shows a pretty home with a nicely dressed, attractive family standing out front. The call to action in both is to click through to the website and request an insurance quote. \nAt first, Generico has no way of knowing which ad will generate more quotes. It doesn't matter: Google will show the ads to a few thousand people, and within a week or two, there's a clear winner. Generico now knows which image to use as it invests more advertising dollars in its website, GDN, print ads, business cards and even TV commercials. \nThis works because we're measuring actual physical behavior in real time -- not just verbal opinions. People are clicking their mouse and filling out forms . . . or failing to. \nWhen they see the Generico ad online, they have no idea they're participating in a split test. They're simply responding based on whether the ad triggers them to want insurance or not. \nGDN is never a branding exercise, and it's never opinion polling. It's observing your target market making live decisions and learning what excites their interest or leaves them cold. \nDon't waste thousands of dollars creating huge portfolios of advertising and marketing collateral. Spend just a few hundred dollars up front testing ads, and you'll know which images, color schemes, headlines and calls to action give you the results you want. \nRelated: 10 Marketing Influencers That Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From \"Test the forest\" first \nOur colleague David Bullock has given us a great verbal rule of thumb for testing ads and marketing campaigns: First test forests, then test trees, then test branches, then test leaves. \nTest the big difference-making stuff first. Go after finer points later. How far down you drill will depend on your patience for this kind of work and, of course, your budget. \nIn this scenario, the \"forest\" is two things: Your headline, hook, call to action, offer or guarantee The overall aesthetic of your ad: color schemes, styles, layout and tone; bold versus subtle, traditional versus modern, serious versus comic, masculine versus feminine, young versus old and everything in between. \nRelated: Use These 5 Steps to Create a Marketing Plan \nLet's say you plan to test images of people in your ads. Try different ages as well as both genders. Right off the bat, that gives you four variations: older men, older women, younger women and younger men. Which one will your target market respond to? After a few thousand impressions, you'll know. \nThe one thing split testing teaches you above all else is that there is no predicting what will and will not make a drastic difference. \nThere are so many things you can test: Image style: hi-res color photo, black-and-white classic, hand-drawn picture or even no image at all. Text formatting: color, font, size, bold or italic. Dominant color: Different colors and different levels of light or dark will evoke wildly different moods. If you're carefully targeting sites on GDN to show your ads, think about what color schemes will make your ads stand out on the page rather than blending into the background. Call to action: Ideally, this should be prominent. Even better if it's in the form of a button. We're trained to click on buttons. Your entire ad may be clickable, but if you feature a boldly colored button, people will click there more than any place else on your image. \nRelated: This 14-Year-Old Founder Explains How to Market to Teenagers on Social Media Which type of ad should you start with? \nGoogle's Display Network gives you a wide variety of ad sizes, but you need to stick to just one size until you've identified your winning ad style. It's simple math. If you create ten different styles of image ads -- a good number to start with -- but you attempt to test each of these in eight possible image sizes, you'll end up creating 80 different ads. That's unwieldy and a waste of time. There's little point in creating image ads for every size unless you're attempting to completely max out your impressions. Otherwise, it's a law of diminishing returns. \nRelated: 10 Laws of Social Media Marketing \nThe first size to test is 300 x 250 pixels. (This is officially called a \"medium rectangle,\"\"med rec,\" or \"inline rectangle\"). It's one of the most common sizes supported by sites on GDN, so you'll be sure to get plenty of placement. Most importantly, in our experience, it's the size that draws the highest click-through-rate, which is the key factor at this stage. \nThe leaderboard size (728 x 90) also gets good impressions. Clicks and conversions won't be at quite the same level as the medium rectangle, but this is often the next best size to go after. Once you've tested those, try the large rectangle (336 x 280), wide skyscraper (160 x 600), half page (300 x 600) and billboard (970 x 250).", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "perry marshall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bryan todd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david bullock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "generico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike rhodes", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google display network", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "generico housing insurance, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "googl display network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon | barnes & noble", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T18:56:21.011+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c272a68dec6919670c03aa24ce8ae9324886c3d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0tDFO.jeT5wyfS9CM9soRPF", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/entrepreneur/latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur", "title": "What I Did on 'Shark Tank' When 2 Sharks Threw Water at Each Other and 1 Insulted Me", "title_full": "What I Did on 'Shark Tank' When 2 Sharks Threw Water at Each Other and 1 Insulted Me", "published": "2017-10-04T19:15:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20171003205148-branson-sharktank.jpeg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 588, "comments": 0, "shares": 588}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 240}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c272a68dec6919670c03aa24ce8ae9324886c3d2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0tDFO.jeT5wyfS9CM9soRPF", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Yunha Kim", "published": "2017-10-04T19:15:00.000+03:00", "title": "What I Did on 'Shark Tank' When 2 Sharks Threw Water at Each Other and 1 Insulted Me", "text": "October 4, 2017 How I Stayed Calm When Mark Cuban Called Me a 'Gold Digger' on 'Shark Tank' A \"Shark Tank\" contestant shares three ways to stay calm when a pitch turns heated and very, very personal.

What Kim did get was some sturm und drang between the sharks: When Mark Cuban dismissed Kim as a \"gold digger\" -- meaning a well-heeled entrepreneur who comes on the show purely for the publicity -- Branson took offense on Kim's behalf. He lobbed a glassful of water at Cuban, who was less than amused and angrily returned the insult. \nHere, Kim, who admitted she had previously raised $2.8 million from other investors, offers advice to other entrepreneurs pitching investors and describes what it feels like to be caught between two investor-sharks bloodying the waters. \nOn Sunday night, I turned down a $600,000 investment offer from Sir Richard Branson and Robert Herjavec on the season premiere of Shark Tank, which grew a bit heated compared to previous episodes of that popular show. Specifically: Richard Branson threw water on Mark Cuban, and Mark Cuban called me a \"gold digger.\" \nRelated: Richard Branson, Alex Rodriguez and More Will Guest Judge on Shark Tank Next Season \nAnd afterward, I had to ask myself the question, \"How did I stay calm?\" \nThe truth is, I didn't.

Rule 1: Prepare by knowing ahead of time your investment \"comfort zone.\" \nPrepare for every situation imaginable in the pitch room. This exercise will ultimately help determine the types of negotiations you're willing to make. During the week of t aping in June , I started to prepare for every fathomable scenario with the sharks: disinterest, skepticism, confusion, eagerness -- and the types of deals I would strive to cultivate from each situation. I asked myself: What is the worst deal I will accept? Knowing the answer to those questions was critical for me once the cameras began flashing and energy took over. \nRelated: Why I Chose Not to Go on 'Shark Tank' -- and Why It's Okay for You to Say No, Too \nWhen I received that first offer, from Richard Branson, whom I consider a role model, my excitement soared through the roof. This was a dream come true, and my reactive self was ready to exclaim, \"Hell, yes!\" But I knew Richard's offer was not the best deal for my company and company investors. I decided to practice discipline and respond rather than react. It took some courage, but I politely declined. \nDuring the months between my invitation to pitch on Shark Tank and the actual taping, I had been able to raise $2.8 million from Silicon Valley investors. So, when I went to the set prepared to pitch, I knew I would turn down any deal that put my company at a lower valuation (and that was my assessment of the offers I got separately from Branson and Robert Herjavec: $600,000 for 10 percent equity and a counter of $500,00 for 5 percent). \nOur current investors had taken a chance on us at a much higher valuation many months before the episode was filmed, and that mattered to me. I couldn't watch our valuation drop. \nIn short, set foot in the tank with the intention of securing an investment, but not at all costs. So, my advice here is, Always plan so that you know: 1) the worst deal you will accept; and 2) when you will ultimately (and responsibly) need to walk away. Rule 2: Expect naysayers, but don't be discouraged by them. \nAs you prepare for your own investment pitch, one of the scenarios you will likely rehearse for is being told \"no.\" I anticipated that the sharks would be surprised by my post-investment valuation, and I had a good answer: My company had strong recurring revenue and a strong growth rate -- and I shared this on stage. My company's growth and growth potential weren't enough to interest all the sharks, however, and I eventually received some pretty harsh \"no's.\" \nAs an entrepreneur, you too will get 100 \"no's\" before you get that one \"yes.\" You will always have skeptics who question your company. Being an entrepreneur means you will be told no from investors you want to secure, employees you want to recruit, customers you want to earn. The \"no's\" are frustrating, and over time, they can start to feel personal. \nThe first time I attempted to fund-raise, I remember, I felt as if I was on a roller coaster every time I pitched. But I learned to be resilient (and I credit this to meditation.) You will always have people who naysay your pitch. And the \"sharks\" in your business life will be no different. Remember, you're not building a company for the people who don't believe; you're building it for the people who do. \nMy advice: Instead of being discouraged, take these moments as an opportunity to practice resilience. This brings me to my next rule. Rule 3: Meditate to be resilient. \nMeditation is my number-one tool as an entrepreneur. Meditation helps clear the mind and slow down the nervous system so that we can think better on our feet. Now that I practice meditation daily, I am more alert, focused and equipped to handle the hundreds of unexpected incidents that happen at Simple Habit every day. \nA big one happened on Shark Tank : Mark Cuban called me a \"gold digger\" on national TV; and that proved to be the ultimate stress test. I was stunned; my face turned red; I felt attacked both personally and professionally. But I had meditated at least ten times before I entered the tank, and that helped me maintain a clear head so that I could respond with intent rather than react out of fear or the overwhelming sense of feeling flustered. \nOverall, meditation and mindfulness allow me to have a healthy relationship with tough conversations and experiences; it has taught me how to sit with an experience in a non-judgmental way. Other business leaders have said the same. When it came time during our taping to have a conversation on stage, I decided that I would not take Cuban's epithet personally; but I would take it seriously. I made a choice to not react to his comment, and, instead, respond to his remarks in a way that brought value to my pitch and my company. \nRelated: After Initially Missing Out on a 'Shark Tank' Offer, These Co-Founders Got a Second Chance With Kevin O'Leary \nMy goal in the tank was to prove to the sharks that my company was worthy of an investment. And I decided that that was what I would talk about. \nSo, I took in a few deep breaths, re-centered myself and reminded myself: I had been invited to pitch my company to these sharks and ask for the deal I wanted. And, like so many entrepreneurs in the tank and beyond, I knew that if the deal didn't go my way, I had a choice. Here, then, is my advice: I had a choice to walk away. And, with a calm, clear head, that is exactly what I did. \nYou can do the same.

Your employees will see through any form of pretense. \nEven if the ideas don't work, you have created an environment for freedom of expression, which encourages rapid growth and learning. \nLet the workplace be one of fun, creativity and variety. Track and time how they work and then use that to develop better solutions that will make them work more productively. \nAs much as is feasible, avoid monotony of tasks and schedules. \nOnce in a while, shuffle duties and departments.

In fact, studies consistently demonstrate that millennials prefer buying experiences to purchasing physical objects, and 72 percent plan to increase the amount of money they dedicate to the former in the next year. \nSimilar to their big brothers and sisters, members of Generation Z favor collecting memories over materials. However, it's also important for this generation to share experiences with peers . Exhibitions, concerts and sporting events are all potentially attractive ways for the two groups to spend their money, and members of Generation Z are especially likely to go out of their way to promote the events they attend. \nExperiential marketing allows consumers to engage with products or services and develop connections to them. As a CMO, it's critical to ensure your event leaves a positive impression on an impressionable group of consumers. If it's instilled at a young age, brand loyalty can last a lifetime. An experience they'll never forget \nThe events people attend often create powerful memories that stick with them for many years. Nearly 80 percent of millennials cite events or live experiences as some of the best memories of their lives, and almost 70 percent report that attending such events gives them a better sense of connectedness to those around them, their community and the world. \n\"The power of experiential marketing comes in its conversational nature, and this type of connection shouldn't just be another tool in brands' marketing tool kits,\" advises Jeff Snyder , founder of Inspira , which works with companies to build genuine relationships through client development and audience engagement. \"To reach customers in an unforgettable way, brands should make personal interaction a recurring and foundational element of their marketing strategies.\" \nYounger generations are focusing more on experiences than products, in part due to their disconnect with traditional advertising. Consumers have become fed up with the saturation of the marketing landscape. While browsing online, they rely on ad blockers, tune out television ads and turn their attention to their smartphones or watch their favorite shows ad-free via Netflix. \nThe beauty of experiential marketing is that, when done correctly, it provides these generations with an experience they actually want to take part in. \nRelated: This 14-Year-Old Founder Explains How to Market to Teenagers on Social Media 1. Segment your target market through psychographics \nPsychographics target an audience by examining its values, attitudes, and motivations. For example, members of Generation Z have different attitudes than their baby boomer parents -- and, unsurprisingly, they want different things than their parents wanted. \nDividing people into simple demographics is no longer enough. Awareness of psychographic differences allows for better targeting. One group can receive a message tailored to its thinking, while another group receives the message it relates to more strongly -- even if the two groups are part of the same demographic. \nRelated: Use These 5 Steps to Create a Marketing Plan 2. Focus campaigns on giving something to the customer \nA campaign designed to educate and share with your customers will go further with younger generations than one designed to get something out of them, such as an email sign-up. \nLean Cuisine started a #WeighThis campaign, which included the brand installing \"scales\" in Grand Central Station. Instead of measuring their body weight, participants were paired with boards to write down the merits they actually wanted to be weighed on. Whether it was time devoted to a volunteer effort or their dedication as parents, women actively participated without being asked, and nobody from Lean Cuisine made an effort to sell them anything. \nRelated: 4 Ways to Market Your Business for Free 3. Use contests or sweepstakes to attract people to an event \nGuinness ambassadors spent a couple weeks in bars around the U.K., wearing branded flight attendant uniforms and offering customers entry into a sweepstakes for ordering a pint of Guinness. Each night, a single player won the grand prize -- a flight to Dublin on a private jet with four friends. In this instance, the event had little to do with advertising the actual product and much more to do with an enchanting possibility. \nRelated: 10 Laws of Social Media Marketing 4. Hand out free merchandise \nNothing inspires envy like some free swag, so give Gen Zers a reason to show off their attendance at your event. Millennials are also reliable social media users: Adweek reported that 81 percent share photos on social media at branded events and 71 percent take advantage of event-specific hashtags, particularly if they have something to show off when doing so. \nRelated: 10 Marketing Influencers That Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From 5. Take videos and photos \nUse the content from the event on social media so Generation Z can share it. Instagram and Snapchat are especially near and dear to Generation Z's hearts because of their seemingly more authentic content. \nGeneration Z and millennials will value a memorable moment over a material object almost every time. Marketers who capitalize on this in an authentic way can make a true, lasting connection.

Adam Toren - VIP Contributor \nI'll admit it: I am not an innovator. Not an easy thing to confess these days, when innovators are the ones getting all the attention. Oh, I've had some great ideas and seen them through to fruition, and I've realized substantial success over my entrepreneurial career, so there's plenty to be proud of. But, if I'm honest, innovation has never been my focus. The word \"innovation\" is thrown around a lot, and a lot of entrepreneurs are called innovators or think of themselves as innovators. But, what does that really mean? Is anyone who comes up with a new idea an innovator? To some extent, every true entrepreneur has at least a touch of the \"innovation gene\" in them, but not everyone is what can be called a true innovator. \nAs an example, Motorola was the first mobile phone manufacturer to offer a color screen with the T720, way back in 2002. Did that make them innovators? Maybe, in the most basic sense of the word, but let's face it -- the color cell phone screen was coming with or without Motorola. \nOn the other hand, look at Apple and the first iPhone. When that device was launched five years after Motorola's color phone, it had every competing company scrambling to come up with something comparable. And now we can't imagine a phone that isn't in many ways similar to the line of iPhones since. That's when you know you've introduced a true innovation. \nRelated: The 100 Most Brilliant Business Ideas What is true innovation? \nSo, what's the difference? Both the T720 and the iPhone offered something no one else had before, and you could even say that both marked the start of a new era in cell phones. But, unless you used to own a T720 or worked for a company that carried them, you probably don't even remember ever hearing of them. Everyone knows what an iPhone is though, even if they've never owned one. That's because they didn't just introduce a tweek of an existing product or a cool feature; they revolutionized mobile interface technology and changed the lexicon of a generation in the process. That's true innovation. \nOf course, it's not just that everyone has heard of the iPhone -- a great marketing campaign might have accomplished that. It's that the introduction of the iPhone caused consumers and technology manufacturers to think of cell phones in a new way. \nThe same can be said of companies like Uber. If Travis Kalanick had invented a new type of meter for taxi cabs, that might have been cool for that industry. Instead, he came up with an industry disruptor , and paying for a ride somewhere will never be the same. True innovation doesn't just cause a buzz -- it initiates change. \nRelated: Amazon's Lesson About Disruption: Rattle Any Market You Can How to be an innovator \nIf you want to be a true innovator, there are a few traits that will define you as such. Here's what real innovators do. 1. They recognize market needs. \nInnovators are people who can identify a need within an industry, market segment or culture and spot opportunity in it. More importantly, top innovators identify needs before people even know they need them. No one wanted a service like Uber or a device like the iPhone before they came along. The need and the solution hit the market at the same time. 2. They develop and refine a solution. \nOnce an innovator recognizes a need and makes up their mind to fill it, they tend to work tirelessly on finding the most imaginative, practical solution possible. Then, they work to refine their solution to not only meet the need but anticipate future needs and advancements in order to give their solution longevity. You can be sure the iPhone that people bought in June of 2007 was not based on the first schematic proposed . . . and you can be just as sure that the features of the next three versions had already been worked out at that point. \nRelated: 5 Habits That Made Elon Musk an Innovator 3. They take chances. \nTrue innovators are great at identifying needs and developing solutions, but they know there's no guarantee their solution is going to be a winner. All entrepreneurs are willing to take risks, and innovators are willing to go even further and risk going where no one has gone before. 4. They push the envelope. \nThe very nature of innovation is that it is beyond the norm. True innovators understand that they need to think beyond what anyone has tried so far. They take things to the next level -- and then some. This is part of taking risks, but it's also about imagination and a willingness to try something completely new. \nRelated: Meet These 7 Innovative New Franchises for 2017 5. They create meaning. \nWhen we talk about true innovators, we're not talking about people who create a product for the sake of creating a product. These are people who are out to make an impact. They might not be trying to fix the world's ills, but they are at least trying to shake things up and get people thinking differently. True innovation often spawns entire industries -- and there's meaning in that. \nSo, what do you think? Are you a true innovator? What makes someone an innovator in your mind?

Stephen Constantine - Guest Writer \nIn an age where self-expression and acceptance are so highly prized, why do so many social media platforms promote individual censorship? No one signed up to Twitter or Facebook expecting them to shield us from the world. In fact, their \"lawlessness\" was part of what made them fun at first: access to the previously inaccessible and the promise of authenticity. \nWhat the hell happened? \nRelated: 5 Social Media Rules Every Entrepreneur Should Know \nThink back to the Arab Spring in 2009/10. For the first time, we saw how powerful social media could be as an agent for change. Twitter and Facebook did a great job of empowering users to share their individual stories and rally support. Fast forward to more recent political events -- namely Brexit and the Trump presidency -- and social media is coming under fire for doing exactly the same thing. \nWhy? Because a lot of people have realized that they're not getting a complete enough picture of what's happening from the channels they've come to trust. We could argue that these platforms aren't supposed to be credible news sources. But, the real issue is that to make data smarter, they continue to serve us the information they think we'll be most responsive to -- forsaking the things that don't match our \"user preferences.\" \nThat's right, algorithms are blinding us to opinions that differ from our own. And now social giants are seeing user numbers drop, with unique viewers to Snapchat Stories falling by 40 percent and a decline in active users at Facebook , so I ask, are user needs being met? Assumed dominance \nWe've known for some time that digital (not just social) media works by making assumptions about who we are and the kinds of things we like. While there may be some positives in this, looking at the bigger picture, the digital silos we create are a problem -- for those that truly value authenticity. \nRelated: 12 Social Media Mistakes That Entrepreneurs Make \nWhile vast user numbers guarantee the biggest platforms' dominance for now, unless they do something soon they're going to stagnate, as they're becoming two-dimensional feeds that don't evolve our knowledge beyond what we expect. They'll become places where bias is ingrained in everything -- from the way information iss curated to the continued social currency of \"likes,\" retweets and follower numbers that ensure that only popular opinions rise to the top. Anonymity vs. authenticity \nLike old Foursquare (before it tried to become Yelp), social media should thrive on immediacy, context and accessibility. It should fill the information gaps left open by conventional searches -- allowing someone with firsthand, real-time knowledge of a place or event to become the most valuable person to you. Someone who can tell you the mood of a particular place at a particular time. Someone you don't necessarily know. \nRelated: 10 Proven Ways to Make Millions on Social Media \nThere have been a slew of apps lately that seem to understand this challenge in part, like Snap Maps ( reported by TechCrunch to have been copied from French app maker, Zenly ) which allows users to see what's happening around them. While Snap Maps seems to have acknowledged that things like location and sentiment don't always translate with words alone, it fails to understand that these systems are only as valuable as the conversations they drive. Bringing back trust \nSo, if we don't need to know someone to have a meaningful exchange with them online, we need to trust the communication platform itself. This prevails with online marketplaces (eBay, Etsy and Amazon -- all going strong!) but we've lost this with social media -- almost. \nRelated: 10 Laws of Social Media Marketing \nThere are still some social platforms that establish trust through authenticity. Ad-free social network Ello , for example, began with the aim of being free from commercial interference, but has now become a service for artists and creative types. Now, its niche is driving its authenticity. Twitter-owned Periscope can also be singled out for its use of live video feeds as a true reflection of what's happening in the world. \nFor the big players to become trustworthy once again, they need to re-examine their revenue models in line with user needs and expectations. This means accepting that they're now media outlets with an obligation to report (or at least curate) impartially, promoting honesty while ensuring that controversy has its place. It might be a tough thing to admit, but that's the only way they can reclaim some modicum of authenticity. People do believe what they read, and if what's served to them has no opposing stance, they won't see the whole picture.

The person you are may have been determined originally by your childhood experiences, but the person you could be is completely under your control. The great principle, \"You become what you think about most of the time,\" refers to what you're thinking today, at this very moment. It is not your thinking of the past or your thinking in the future that determines the course of your destiny. Everything you are and everything you will be is determined by what you think at each moment. And you can take complete control of those thoughts at any time you decide to. \n\nYou become an optimist by taking control of your inner dialogue -- your self-talk. Resolve today to develop the habit of talking to yourself in a positive way. Say things to yourself such as \"I like myself!\" or \"I can do it!\" repeatedly. If someone asks you how you're feeling today, always reply \"I feel terrific!\" When you think about your job, repeat to yourself \"I love my work! I love my work!\" \n\nMost psychologists agree that fully 95 percent of your emotions are determined by the things you think and the words you say to yourself as you go through your day. Use your self-discipline and self-control to think and talk about the things you want, rather than allowing your mind to become preoccupied with the things you don't want or that you doubt and fear. \nWhat you see is what you will be \nThe most powerful affirmation or message you can send from your conscious mind to your subconscious mind is a visualization or mental image. Develop the habit of creating clear, positive, exciting pictures of yourself performing at your best and visions of your goals as if they were already achieved. \n\nEach time you create a mental image in your conscious mind, you send a message that activates your subconscious mind, triggers the law of attraction, stimulates your creativity and moves you toward the realization of that mental picture in your external world. \n\nPositive, successful people make a habit of continually visualizing the outcomes they desire, thereby programming their subconscious minds and shaping their self-image and external performance. \n\nBest of all is when you combine positive self-talk with positive mental imaging. You talk about the things you want, and you create exciting mental pictures of your goals and desires as if they already existed. Positive thoughts and words make you more optimistic, give you more energy, enable you to bounce back faster from disappointment and keep you moving forward throughout the day. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \nFeed your mind with mental protein \nDevelop the habit of feeding your mind with positive mental food. Remember, you're very sensitive to the influences in your environment, whether they're radio, television, newspapers, magazines, billboards or conversations with other people. Your mind is your most important and precious asset. You must protect it and keep it clean, clear and focused on what you want, rather than allowing it to be polluted by the negative influences around you. \n\nRefuse to watch terror or trash on television. Don't read about all the murders, robberies, rapes and tragedies in the newspapers. Turn off the endless hours of mindless radio commentary on all the problems in the world. Decline to engage in endless conversations with people about all the political and social problems in your nation or community. Keep your mind clean, clear, positive and free. \n\nNot only do you become what you think about, but you also become what you feed into your mind on a regular basis. If you want to be positive, optimistic and happy, continually feed your mind with positive books and articles, positive audio learning programs, positive input and information from other experts in your field and positive conversations with other optimistic, goal-oriented people who are going somewhere with their lives. \n\nGet around the right people \nMake it a habit to associate only with the kind of people you admire, respect and want to be like. Don't just drink coffee with whoever happens to be sitting in the break room. Don't go out for lunch with the person nearest the door. Don't socialize after work with anyone who invites you. Be thoughtful and clear about the kind of people you allow to influence your thinking and feelings with their conversations and opinions. \nDr. David McClelland of Harvard found that your \"reference group\" would determine as much as 95 percent of your success or failure in your career and personal life. Your reference group is defined as the people you habitually associate with and consider yourself to be one of. These can be members of your family; your coworkers; or members of your church or social organizations. The fact is, \"Birds of a feather flock together.\" Or as motivational speaker Zig Ziglar said, \"You can't fly with the eagles if you continue to scratch with the turkeys.\" \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brian tracy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david mcclelland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zig ziglar", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "harvard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barnes & noble", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T19:48:40.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "855b0b7a90310198ec89a3c035e915c45ea96260", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0vJ_Hd1PH3tYi7Cr5n6K_OM", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "http://entrepreneur.com/feeds/management.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur: Latest Leadership Articles", "title": "6 Challenges Awaiting You When Finally You Become CEO", "title_full": "6 Challenges Awaiting You When Finally You Become CEO", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20170927205810-GettyImages-691048293.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 63, "comments": 0, "shares": 63}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 265}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "855b0b7a90310198ec89a3c035e915c45ea96260", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0vJ_Hd1PH3tYi7Cr5n6K_OM", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Joel Trammell", "published": "2017-10-04T20:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "6 Challenges Awaiting You When Finally You Become CEO", "text": "6 Challenges Awaiting You When Finally You Become CEO There's no guidebook when you reach the top and not everybody succeeds. Joel Trammell - Guest Writer \nNew CEOs face a steep learning curve. There are many things I wish I had known going into my first CEO job. Together with the help of two experienced CEOs -- Seth Birnbaum, the CEO and cofounder of EverQuote , and Phil Friedman, founder, president, and CEO of Computer Generated Solutions (CGS) -- I\u2019ve put together six tips for anyone transitioning to the CEO role. 1. Understand the job responsibilities. \nThe CEO job is unique. There are five responsibilities of the CEO role that rest solely on the chief executive\u2019s shoulders. Entrepreneurs who know the duties of the position will understand where to spend their time and how to be most effective. \nRelated: Confidence, Humility and the Effective CEO 2. Realize you won\u2019t be prepared on day one. \nBecause the role is unique, very few are ready for it. Most people have risen to the top job because they had a stellar career in another area, such as sales, marketing, R&D, etc. Once they get to the CEO chair, they are bombarded with issues they have never had to confront. \n\u201cWhen I initially became a CEO, I felt a lot of internal pressure to know how to be a CEO out of the box,\u201d Birnbaum said. \u201cI think what I\u2019m learning, especially as we scale and grow, is that you shouldn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s an expectation that you are going to know how to be a CEO on day one. It requires a ton of learning.\u201d \nWhat kind of learning? I\u2019ve narrowed it down to 15 essential CEO skills , but CEOs should go into the job with a wide base of knowledge. 3. Cultivate a diverse educational background. \nWhile no one can be fully prepared to take on the CEO role, there are many areas that candidates should study and be proficient in before taking on the position. These include fields such as emotional intelligence, game theory, communications, history and organizational development. \nFriedman had this advice: \u201cIn today\u2019s world, the role of CEO is very demanding. You are required to start with a base of knowledge. I don\u2019t believe anyone is born to run a company. You have to have a good understanding of such things as the law (labor law in particular), finance, accounting and technology.\u201d \nRelated: This Is the Job That Best Prepares You for CEO Success 4. Resist the temptation to micromanage. \nMany new CEOs get caught up in the power of the top job -- or perhaps simply not knowing what to do -- and start trying to micromanage everyone\u2019s time. Others fall into the trap of trying to put out every fire personally. Knowing and fulfilling the true responsibilities of the CEO job should help avoid the tendency to micromanage. \nFriedman put it this way: \u201cWhen I started CGS in 1983, we had five employees. Like any entrepreneur, initially you think that you can do everything yourself, such as sales, delivery, quality control, HR, legal. It takes some time to realize as the business is growing that you cannot. So if there is one thing that an entrepreneur or businessperson needs to realize, it\u2019s to start delegating and surrounding himself or herself with a lot of smart people.\u201d 5. Realize it\u2019s all about people. \nWhen I first started out as a CEO, I thought I could solve every business problem logically using my engineering background. I soon learned the error of my management ways. It\u2019s all about your people. \n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking how much management of people and personality matters in terms of results and output,\" engineer-turned-CEO Birnbaum said. \"From an engineering role, we tend to approach everything by asking what the problem is and coming up with a solution in terms of bits and bytes and force pounds per square inch. It was very novel to me that this had nothing to do with success. It was all about the people.\u201d \nFriedman agreed. \u201cThe most important element for a CEO is having the skill to interact and manage people, especially in a larger company,\u201d he said. \nRelated: As the CEO, I Strive to Be the Dumbest Person in the Room 6. Ask for advice. \nOne trait of the best CEOs is humility. Humble CEOs don\u2019t believe they have to be the smartest person in every room. They aren\u2019t afraid to ask for feedback and advice. \n\u201cIt took me awhile to get comfortable with the notion that you can reach out to the cast of people around you and work with them to learn to be a better CEO and manager,\u201d said Birnbaum. \u201cThere are a lot of people around you who want you to succeed. If you reach out to them for help versus approaching them like \u2018I know what I\u2019m doing,\u2019 they\u2019ll give you more help than you have any right to expect.\u201d \nOne thing is certain. \u201cThe learning never stops,\u201d Friedman said. Great CEOs have a zest for learning, which is a necessity in today\u2019s world. He summed it up best: \u201cThere is no one single thing you have to do. You have to be well-rounded and keep up with things like the latest in technology. Things change very dramatically, very quickly. It takes time to be proficient at the CEO role.\u201d A Note From The Editor ENTREPRENEUR LIVE - Nov 9th | Los Angeles, CA Join us for a day of inspiration, networking and keynotes from Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jon Taffer and more!

Merch allows you to upload your t-shirt designs and sell them in the world's largest ecommerce marketplace. Are you listening, designers? Thomas Smale - Contributor \nAre you familiar with the Merch by Amazon platform? It allows you to upload your unique t-shirt designs and sell them in the world's largest ecommerce marketplace. Designers will find this prospect particularly appealing, since they may already have artwork concepts stored away in their archives, ready to be leveraged. \nRelated: Is Amazon's 'Merch' the Next Big Thing? \nYou may even already be selling your designs on other platforms. \nBut what about non-designer sellers who are interested in this opportunity? If you're one of them and don't know how to put together attractive t-shirt designs, you may be wondering if you'll be left in a lurch. \nFortunately, it is relatively straightforward to run an MBA (Merch, not master's) business with a team in place; the business can actually run itself. What's more, some sellers have reported making tens of thousands of dollars per month selling t-shirts (though this is certainly not the norm). \nHere are some of the pros and cons of starting a Merch by Amazon business, from the perspective of a designer and entrepreneur. The pros: \n1. Fulfillment by Amazon means no distribution hassles or shipping and storage. Whether you're a designer or seller, the fact that Amazon handles everything from production and manufacturing to logistics and customer service means you don't have to sweat the details. You won't need to purchase large amounts of stock and find a place to store it, nor will you have to pick, pack and ship products to your buyers. You won't have to deal with angry customers, either. \nYour primary concern will be creating designs consumers love and finding ways to stand out from the competition. Experienced sellers may already know how to do keyword research and optimize listings, but if you're a designer, this is a skill you may need to develop or potentially outsource. It's critical to your success. \n2. Amazon takes royalties only from shirt sales. This means there are no up-front costs associated with starting your Merch by Amazon business. Amazon charges you only when you sell an item, and pays you whatever is left over after its costs and fees. On a $20 t-shirt, for example, you can expect to make roughly $7. \nRelated: 'I'll Sleep When I'm Dead' and 4 Other T-Shirts Every Entrepreneurs Needs to Wear \nTherefore, your profit margin is relatively predictable. Since Amazon handles customer service and distribution, it's a pretty fair tradeoff. It frees you up to focus on designs and business development -- the more nuanced aspects of the operation. \nBy determining your profit margin ahead of time, you can also figure out how much you can put toward marketing and outsourcing; the numbers are relatively easy to crunch. Generating higher volumes of sales is the tough part. \n3. It's easy to maintain once you have a team in place. Sellers interested in taking advantage of this opportunity will need to put a team in place to get their business off the ground. If you currently have a site with merchandise that already has a proven track record of selling well, you might even consider raising funding to get a team in place right off the bat to build out and scale your designs right away. \nThis process may take some time. Finding a skilled designer isn't difficult. You can hire contractors using platforms like Upwork or Freelancer . But you should be aware that finding the perfect fit will take time. \nNot only do you need to find someone who can skillfully craft designs: You also need someone who is aligned with your overall vision. Don't be surprised if you end up going through multiple designers before settling on one that understands your stylistic requirements. To make the most of this opportunity, you will need multiple designs. This means you'll want to build a strong relationship with your designer. \nWhether you're a designer and your business is growing fast, or a seller who requires the help of a designer, outsourcing will become essential to scaling and maintaining your business. The cons \n1. There is heavy competition in the niches. It has often been said that the riches are in the niches. But when it comes to Merch by Amazon, there is already heavy competition, even in the niches. \nTo make matters more difficult, there are some things you need to watch out for, such as copyright laws and copycats. \nWhen putting designs together, you need to ensure they do not infringe on any existing trademarks. If Amazon finds issue with your designs more than once or twice, you will be banned from Merch by Amazon. Treatment for copycat or knock-off designs is equally harsh--if not harsher. \nIf you are persistent in your efforts to build your business, however, and work hard to diversify your profit streams, it's possible to build a five-figure per month business. The value of your MBA business will ultimately be determined by how streamlined your team is, how well your designs are selling, your marketing strategy, and cross-platform selling. \n2. You'll Need to do SEO research to get ahead. Optimizing your listings within Amazon will be key to your success, and where the bulk of the work lies. Failing to take this step could mean sabotaging your chances at creating the kind of income you're hoping to achieve. \nFortunately, there is no shortage of keyword tools you can use to conduct competitive analysis, such as Merch Informer . Finding a high-volume, low-competition keyword can take time, but it will give you a better chance at making a go at the Merch by Amazon opportunity. Research can make or break your business. \nAnother key piece of information you'll want to look at is a product's Best Sellers Rank. You can tell how well a product is selling by looking at this number. The lower the number, the better the product is doing in the marketplace overall. \nMerch by Amazon is a research-intensive business. If you want to generate higher levels of revenue, you'll want to take your time to find keywords worth targeting. The effort you put into this will pay off, but you must be willing to put time and energy into this aspect of the business. Final thoughts \nThere isn't necessarily a major advantage to being a designer in the Merch by Amazon business if you don't know how to do SEO research. Meanwhile, if you're a seller and don't know how to develop a design, you have no way to get your business off the ground without some help. Balancing these two roles is the key to success in an MBA business. \nHow well you do in this opportunity mostly comes down to whether it's something you want to pursue and if you have the patience to research and work with outsources.

He's not only a top Hollywood producer, he's a renowned preacher. He's a recognized authority on faith and the entertainment business, not necessarily two subjects that you'd expect to see together. He discusses the blending of the two in his first book, Produced By Faith and his recently released title, The Hollywood Commandments. \n\nFranklin seems to be winning everywhere: He's the successful CEO of Franklin Entertainment, a production company in conjunction with 20th Century Fox, a bestselling author, a TV personality, a producer and a sought-after speaker. Beliefnet called him one of the \"Most Influential Christians Under 40,\" Variety magazine named him one of the \"Top 10 Producers to Watch,\" and Ebony magazine has named him one of the \"Top 100 Influential African-Americans in America.\" \n\nSince so many beginner entrepreneurs, authors and speakers I work with struggle to combine multiple passions and messages into one brand, I could not wait to ask him how he does it all. Here are my top seven commandments on how the rest of us can follow his lead and weave together multiple passions into one successful business. \n\n\nThou shalt pay your dues \nSome may be tempted to say that Franklin is successful thanks to his proximity to Will Smith, because he started his career within the company that manages Smith. However, Franklin started there as an intern, waiting on the firm's assistants. In other words, he was at the very bottom of the bottom. It took years before he actually had a relationship with Smith himself. \nWhen I asked Franklin about his start, I love how he explained the phrase we've heard before about \"taking the stairs\" to success: \"I pray that people don't have overnight success, because if you get it overnight, you'll lose it overnight. Taking the elevator to the 20th floor takes no energy, takes no effort. However, if you need to manage life on the 20th floor and you haven't taken the steps, you might get here; but you're not going to know how to manage it.\" \n\nHe went on to explain that the process it takes to work your way up builds not only your character, but your actual capacity for managing life on that top level. Plus, getting there is not the goal, is it? It's staying there. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n\n\"Your ability to maintain what you obtain is critically dependent on the process you went through to get it,\" Franklin said. \"I would never be able to do and manage what I have now if I had tried to shortcut the process.\" \n\n\nThou shalt learn to be patient -- very patient \n\"It took over 150,000 hours, over 6,500 days from the day I set foot in Hollywood to finally getting my production company. That is 150,000 hours of showing up, serving,\" Franklin shared. \n\nHe understands the frustration of feeling stuck, and he offers a great solution for those moments. Realize that the frustration is wasted energy and wasted time. Shift your attention immediately onto what you can do right then and there to be productive and create results. \n\"If you really want to maximize your time, fix your focus. Think about this. Every time I'm frustrated, 'Okay, what can I focus on that can actually be productive?' If I can focus on something productive, what's going to happen? I'm going to feel better. Because what I focus on creates how I feel.\" \n\nThou shalt learn to let go \nIn the last few years, within the entrepreneurship and personal development space, there has been a growing focus on letting go: \"Let go and let God,\" \"the universe has your back,\" etc. I don't' know about you, but this can be a frustrating idea because I love to hustle. I love to solve problems and produce results -- when do we push and when do we release? \n\n\"Your prayers alone aren't enough. I talk about the concept of praying and preparing,\" Franklin said, explaining his mindset. \"I don't work to make things happen. I work because I believe things are already happening.\" \n\nHe explained if you start to think, If I don't land this sale, if I don't make this deal, everything will fall apart, you have a lack of belief, and belief is necessary for success. He reminded that desperation is like bad cologne. The moment you walk in the room everyone smells it and no one wants to go near it. \n\n\"[Think], What can I actually do today and am I maximizing where I am? Once I actually look at where I am and I say, 'Yeah, I'm maximizing where I am,' great. Then I've got to relax, to pray, to have faith and to trust. Am I doing the work? Yes, but am I doing the work to the point of losing my mind? No, because when I actually sit back and I rest in the confidence of who I am and what I'm doing, more opportunities come.\" ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \nThou shalt be your authentic self \nFranklin doesn't deny any part of himself in order to succeed and he says you shouldn't either because \"your difference is your destiny.\" \n\n\"Too often we try to become a version of what other people want us to be. As a result, we diminish the destiny we were created to achieve. For me, [it's] owning my authenticity, owning the fact that I am a Christian. I'm a person of faith. Owning the fact that I love Hollywood.\" \n\nHe went on to quote a phrase he'd once heard from another preacher. \"'When you are rare, you are rewarded.' It's important to hone that rarity, hone that difference -- it will lead you to your destiny.\" \n\nBut, thou shalt focus on one passion first \nHerein lies the rub, multi-passionate reader. Be authentic, yes, but build a foundation first. What do you want to be known for first that will set you up to explore all of your other passions? That is your tree trunk. \n\n\"We all have different gifts ... we're really broad and unfocused,\" Franklin explained. \"If you're unfocused, you're not going to be able to hone your energy, your time, and then zone in on what are the opportunities that are going to help you build who you are and become who you need to be. It's like the tree. If the tree does not have a trunk, there can be no branches.\" \nFranklin's trunk was entertainment. He knew at an early age that he wanted to be in the entertainment industry -- even though he also felt called to preach, write, etc. -- so he moved to Hollywood, started his film degree and got an internship in the industry. Later, an established influence in the industry, he began writing about his faith and making faith in entertainment part of his platform. \n\n\nThou shalt prepare for conflict \nEven though it seems like all Franklin does is win, win, win, no matter what , he said that is untrue. For example, a popular Bible app wouldn't work with him on a devotional series to go along with The Hollywood Commandments. His upcoming animated Christmas film, The Star, isn't supported in some Christian film festivals because of its celebrity cast members. Franklin asks, when have we ever seen someone operating in their destiny who did not receive conflict along the way? \n\n\"If I'm getting conflict, then that means I'm doing exactly what I'm supposed to do. It keeps me hungry. Oh, okay. Y'all don't get it yet. I'm going to keep going.\" ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n\nFranklin understands the temptation to obsess over likes and shares and follows, but believes using our gifts as a way to receive praise sets us up for \"massive disappointment.\" \n\n\"People are fickle. They are. Some days they love you, some days they don't. I have found that if you just stay consistent and you embrace the conflict, and you keep moving forward, the right things happen at the right time .... Too often, we get discouraged by a 'no.' A 'no' only sets you up for the right 'yes,' but you've got to remain persistent and consistent in order to get it.\" \n\nConsistent, he added, not for weeks or months but years . \n\nThou shalt focus on your intentions and your audience \nIt's not about followers, but at the same time, we need ears and eyeballs to pay attention to us in order to gain new clients, share our message, etc. I asked him, how do we focus on growth and success but keep our ego at bay? \n\n\"You've got to look at intention,\" he answered. \"Ask yourself, Why am I doing this? Why am I fighting for this piece of publicity? Why am I fighting for this notoriety? What is it actually here to do? \n\n\"If the answer is just, 'Hey, I want to be known,' that might be just ego. Everything I do is geared toward whoever is receiving what I'm doing, to help produce a moment, an urge, a desire to do something different and positive in their life that they otherwise may not have done had that they not had that moment. Everything I do is knit by that.\" \n\nHe broke down a lesson he'd heard in a sermon that explains this brilliantly. \n\n\"What do we do with the fruit tree? The tree produces a fruit. We go to the tree for the fruit. Now, does the tree say, 'Look at me. I'm the tree.' No. Nobody cares about the tree! \n\n\"Your [work, the gift you produce out of your talents] is really precious. The more that I just honor myself, the less the gift gets a chance to put front and center. The more I'm saying, Yes, this is the gift I've been given, and I want to give it, the better I feel; and the more I believe I can actually help people. \n\n\"It's not about me, the giver, it's about the gift.\" ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "franklin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roku", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beliefnet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "devon franklin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelsey humphreys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hollywood commandments", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon fire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ebony", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin entertainment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "variety", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple tv", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T20:37:00.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a637db3894c5eaa75a3c4d62b047b17b03f9325e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0uM1GF__r_zskVOW7wMsBHE", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "http://www.entrepreneur.com/latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur: Latest Articles", "title": "10 Essential Tools That Give Small Businesses a Big Edge", "title_full": "10 Essential Tools That Give Small Businesses a Big Edge", "published": "2017-10-04T20:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20171003185646-GettyImages-496745802.jpeg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 508, "comments": 0, "shares": 508}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 155}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a637db3894c5eaa75a3c4d62b047b17b03f9325e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0uM1GF__r_zskVOW7wMsBHE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Deep Patel", "published": "2017-10-04T20:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "10 Essential Tools That Give Small Businesses a Big Edge", "text": "10 Essential Tools That Give Small Businesses a Big Edge To succeed, a small business has to leverage every resource it has available. Deep Patel \u2022 Contributor Image credit: Bloomberg | Getty Images \nExistence and survival are the first two stages in the development of a small business, according to a five-stage model put forward by the Harvard Business Review . Small businesses are more likely than large ones to face threats from finances, innovation and barriers to market entry. \nTo survive and thrive in such an environment, small-business owners need to be frugal and calculating with their resources to fully harness the power of what\u2019s readily available to them. Here is a list of the latest tools that small businesses can use to maximize their profitability . 1. Due \nDespite consumer credit card dependency, card processing systems are (often) still slow and expensive. Due aims to solve business processing headaches with one streamlined solution. Due\u2019s payment solutions offers highly secure and expedited credit card processing at a rate of just 2.8 percent. Additionally, Due prides itself on transparency and users never face additional monthly or hidden fees. \nRelated: Looking for a New Payment Company? You're 'Due' for Some Good News. 2.

You Need A Budget (YNAB) \n\u201cYou Need A Budget\u201d sounds like a tagline, but it\u2019s actually the name of the service itself. YNAB helps businesses with their accounting and legal needs by offering a number of debt visualization and categorization techniques -- valuable software when you consider that one third of all small businesses fail within two years. The tool, which promises a 34-day free trial, has helped a number of entrepreneurs accurately calculate the scalability and profitability of their products, thus allowing them to weather the critical existence and survival phases mentioned above. \nRelated: 10 Tools to Help Automate Your Small Business Tasks 4.

Shopify offers an interface that allows your business to take advantage of this transitioning and globalizing market by giving you the ability to quickly assemble an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive ecommerce platform for your business. 9. Rapportive \nEmails are an often overlooked form of marketing. If used correctly, they can provide great results when it comes to driving leads, conversions and retention. Most people wouldn\u2019t expect email marketing to be one of the most effective marketing methods, but reports show that the average ROI for email marketing is much higher than that for other methods. \nIn fact, Delivra estimates ROI for email marketing to be $43 for every $1 spent . Rapportive is a handy plugin that works with Gmail to allow your business to keep better track of its email interactions and campaigns with its customers. 10. Google Docs or Dropbox \nGoogle\u2019s data centers are huge, taking up miles of space , and they have a global, interconnected fiber-optic cable network to service their data. When you\u2019re managing a group of people, communication and keeping tabs on the amount of work that is done is essential. Google Docs is omnipresent and comes with your Gmail account, so it\u2019s an easy way to link everyone up. If you\u2019re looking for a fancier solution that offers plenty of space, Dropbox is a good alternative.

That is how we keep evolving as a species. We've even evolved in how we stay connected with each other from mail to telephones to computers. This shift in how we stay connected took a fascinating turn with the widespread adoption of the internet and artificial intelligence. \nIn business, connectedness is everything. It is the basis for how sales are made, customers are satisfied, and how brands develop. \nIn 2017 , chatbots are poised to be the next big platform that connects people to businesses. A recent survey conducted by Oracle found that 80 percent of senior marketing and sales professionals expect to be using chatbots for customer interactions by 2020. \nAs wonderful as it sounds, implementing this channel into a business model is not apples to apples. That being said, let\u2019s talk about how entrepreneurs can craft their approach to successfully navigate this connectivity trend, as well as the ones in the future. \nRelated: Top 10 Best Chatbot Platform Tools to Build Chatbots for Your Business Understand the customer journey. \nImplementing chatbots -- or any customer touchpoint -- is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Every organization has a unique set of customers and discourse between parties. As effective as chatbots may be in terms of cost and interactions, they must be programmed in accordance with the customer journey . \nFor this to work, managers need to have an cognitive, data-backed understanding of the journey from A to Z. Even more, managers need to know the exact points for when and why customers reach out to the business. For instance, what are the types of content you produce that are meant to prompt interactions? What are the customers looking for? \nThis concept is nothing new. Knowing the finer details of the customer journey is the foundation for success in any capacity. As AI is taking a larger role in business operations, it\u2019s not just aboutunderstanding it, it\u2019s about having the accurate foresight and experience to program the robots to understand. \nRelated: Seven Ways Chatbots Can Benefit Your Marketing Strategy Design for customer success. \nOnce you\u2019ve pinpointed the areas in the customer journey where chatbots can be put to the best use, you need to grasp how they can advance customers down the sales funnel . Often times, this is the most difficult piece of the puzzle when incorporating an automated system. \nThis is where you need to be examining your customer service and sales data under a microscope. What are the patterns related to the questions people ask? \nWhich patterns and questions occur the most? Even more, how can you program responses to answer all of them? How can you provided all the necessary information to bring people from the awareness stage to a decision? \n1-800-Flowers.com does a fantastic job of nurturing customer success with a chatbot via Facebook Messenger . As soon as a customer starts a conversation, they are met with choices to view Best-Selling Items and Same-Delivery options. Once the customer makes their selection, the triggered response asks for a delivery address, name, and phone number. Then, the order can be paid for and finalized. \nIn addition to mapping the customer journey, the chatbot\u2019s triggers are designed step-by-step to seamlessly guide the customer through the sales funnel. \nUltimately, the primary objective with AI platforms is to bridge the gap between people and machines. To do this, you need to put yourself in the shoes of the average customer and develop your bots around their path to success. \nRelated: Enterprise Chatbots and the Conversational Commerce Revolutionizing Business Humanize it. \nThe \u201chuman\u201d element is crucial in business. People generally want to buy from other people, not robots. Using chatbots can quickly complicate this process. Throughout all your marketing and sales efforts, you\u2019ve worked hard to convey your unique brand persona in a way that relates to people on a personal level. Achieving the same effect with a bot can sound contradictory. \nRelated: The Smarter Way to Humanize Your Company \nKeeping this in mind. Programming responses needs to be done in a way that defines the character and personality of your brand. \nMailchimp is one of the best examples of this. Their chatbots are carefully programmed to understand the common pain points throughout an email campaign and present answers in an empathetic way. In turn, they are able to connect with users emotionally. \nFor chatbots to truly be effective in customer interactions, they need to be designed with the notion of a genuine human experience with your authentic brand voice.

The best thing you can do to navigate the trends and stay competitive is to consistently analyze your data and evolve your bots accordingly. \nAs your business grows, you need to be keeping an eye on how the flow of conversations are progressing and pinpoint the common threads. Even more, you should be looking at the big picture to understand the shifts in the users' intent. \nRemember, chatbots are still very much in the infancy stage. They don\u2019t (yet) have the same ability to adjust on the spot as humans do.

As advanced and cutting-edge as the means of communication seem, the core aspects have remained the same. \nThe key to these breakthroughs is staying one step ahead of the customer and knowing how to react appropriately in any given situation. Regardless of what the future holds in this category of chatbots, AI and communication -- the crucial point will be staying ahead of the next big platform. \nBuilding any new source of communication will need to incorporate the basic concept of how customer interactions have been handled in the past. Chatbots will need to use the past information for the new connectedness. The sweeping adoption and adaptation of Chatbots won't work unless businesses have programmed them to use the way people communicate. \nThis effort will take the Chatbot responding not only to the way people do now, the customer will expect the touchpoints and connections to be as they always have been for them. They likely will respond best to the up close and personal interaction. \nCustomers likely want to be treated by a Chatbot the way the average, real person believes they alway have been responded to, and the way they always should be.

Don't wait to live your truth. Dr. Patti Fletcher - VIP Contributor \nThroughout the movie Wonder Woman, Diana Prince finds herself in situations where the expectations of others are at odds with the mission driving her. From her mother's protests of Diana leaving Themyscara to her human companion to Steve Trevor's constant instructions to not take action, Prince considers what she hears but doesn't let it stop her from pursuing peace. \nManaging the expectations of others can be distracting when you are leading disruption. Everyone has an opinion about you, about the work you are doing and about how you are doing it. As you find your own way to navigate the murky and rough waters of other people's expectations, consider these three examples of turning someone else's opinions into the information you need to thrive. \nRelated: 10 Inspirational Quotes From Women Business Leaders Accept who you are and listen to what drives you. \nPenny Herscher, board director, is having the time of her life. Herscher's mission of giving love and seeking equality of opportunity for women in the workplace, particularly in the technology industry, drives her sense of adventure. After years of being a CEO in the tech male-dominated tech industry, Herscher is traveling the world in between board meetings. While I watch her adventures on social media , I can't help but be struck: This is what it looks like to live life on your own terms. \nHerscher faced years of adversity for one simple reason: She was a female CEO in the semi-conductor industry. \n\"The sheer challenge of it, the continuous underestimation and micro-aggressions toward me fueled me,\" says Herscher. While Herscher was aware of barriers facing her, she chose to ignore them as she navigated her way to be the first women to take a semiconductor company public. \nHerscher's advice to live a Wonder Woman life free of other's expectations: Accept who you are and take personal accountability to your personal development. \n\"I now accept that I am who I am, with my strengths and weaknesses and it's up to me to bridge the gap between my deficiencies and the needs of the people but I will probably not chance much now that I am over 50,\" says Herscher. \nRelated: These Female Entrepreneurs Created a Fake Male Co-Founder to Work Around Sexism.

She faced challenges in getting others to accept her mission. \"Technology is not necessarily seen as a vehicle for social impact\". \nIn fact, technology can work against a disruptor who wants to create positive change. \n\"Given that I had always studied STEM topics, I felt like an outside to real-life problems. The world didn't expect that a girl who liked math would end up doing something useful with it,\" says Fainguersch. The perception of others didn't stop her. \"I figured that I am who I am, and it got me this far.

As leaders, Wonder Women seek feedback and input. Feedback is meant to help give insight into perception: what is perceived as working and not working. \nWonder women are able to neutralize feedback instead of internalize it. They consider feedback and use empathy to understand why the person's opinion exists. Empathy does not mean you need to take on someone's feelings; Wonder Women use empathy to holistically look for the drivers of opinions of the stakeholders around them. These objective views give you power to turn the expectations of others into information you can use to find the most effective paths to achieve your mission. \nMy advice to live a Wonder Woman life free of other's expectations: Set clear expectations of your own. \nThe challenge for Wonder Women often arises when the deliverers of feedback feel slighted when their input is not visibly followed. If this happens to you, be upfront when soliciting feedback and employing empathy. It's okay to share how the feedback will be used (as input for consideration) and explain why you are asking questions (to understand the reasoning behind the feedback).

David Meltzer - VIP Contributor \nA recent study conducted by Microsoft found that the average human attention span is down to eight seconds from 12 when it was originally measured in 2000. The study's researchers also claim that the human attention span is now less than that of a goldfish, which is nine seconds. Many attribute this drop to the proliferation of technologies, specifically smartphones and video games. However, the decrease in attention span isn't the problem. It is the amount of information available that causes a problem. Due to technological advances, there is now more information available than ever before, which means there are more ways to access information as well. \nRelated: 7 Weird Things You Didn't Know About Millennials in the Workplace \nOne of the best quotes I've ever read on the subject came from Nobel Laureate Herbert A. Simon in 1969: \"In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: It consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.\" Millennial engagement within the workplace \nAlthough millennials may be physically present at work, many are not actually engaged within the workplace. According to gallup.com , only 29 percent of millennials are engaged at work, while the other 71 percent are either totally unengaged or actively disengaged. This lack of disengagement may also be the reasoning behind why more than half of all millennials are open to new jobs and don't plan on being with their current company a year from now. \nRelated: 5 Ways Millennials Built My Empire Engagement is the key. \nEverything starts with engagement. I ensure that my interns and employees are constantly engaged with our company's purpose and mission by holding meetings twice a week. By hearing each individual's feedback and reflection on what we've been doing well and what there is to improve upon, I am constantly providing my teams with opportunities to engage with me and observe how their opinions make a difference. The importance of accountability \nThe first step needed in order to engage millennials within the workplace is to understand how they differ from other employees from other generations. Many millennials differ from other employees in their needs and desires. They want to be held accountable for their actions. They want to get credit for the hard work that they contribute to a company. When a millennial feels as if his or her hard work goes unnoticed or is unappreciated, he or she becomes unhappy and begins seeking out new job opportunities to solve this problem. \nRelated: Millennials and Their Employers Want the Same Thing.

Jim Joseph - Contributor \nThere's a fundamental rule in marketing that takes some discipline and some getting used to, but it's undeniably true: You can't be everything for everybody. \nIt's impossible to build a business and market a brand in a way that serves everyone. First of all, you can't possibly please everyone all the time and, secondly, you can't possibly offer everything that everyone would want all the time either. It's simply impossible. \nBut, when running a business, we can't help but want to maximize our opportunities, so we avoid saying no to anything. We want to please everyone and we want to give people everything that they want, so we say yes all the time. \nWe want to give everything to everybody. \nAs a result, we try to go for the broadest range of product features and services in an attempt to get as close as we can to offering everything for everybody. We feel better doing that because it feels like we are reducing risk and keeping our options open. \nRelated: 10 Laws of Social Media Marketing \nIt's actually quite the opposite. \nWhen we try to be everything for everybody, we run the risk of being nothing for nobody. We end up watering down our business proposition and our brand promise in an attempt to be as broad as possible. We become so vague that no one knows what we are offering and our potential customers turn to other, more specific options. \nWe end up accomplishing far less than we had hoped, which is exhausting. \nAs entrepreneurs, we end up running ragged trying to get it all done with limited resources. It makes us feel busy and productive, but again it's actually quite the opposite. We are doing busy work that isn't generating the kind of results we were ultimately aiming for. \nSo, what's a small business owner or entrepreneur to do? \nGet specific about your business assets. Really hone in on the skills that you are best suited to offer your customers. Don't try to do everything; do what you are best at. Concentrate on offerings where you truly are better than your competitors. Focus on your competitive advantages and make those the core of your business. When you get specific about clearly defined offerings, you'll find you can make them even better and more innovative as you become an expert in your chosen field. Your goal is to be the best available at one or two things, rather than just average on a bunch. \nRelated: 10 Marketing Influencers That Every Entrepreneur Can Learn From \nPick your customer targets to match your skills. Once you know what you are best at, pick the customers who are most likely to appreciate them. Your goal should be to tightly define your customer target so that you can capture a large percentage of their business. While it might feel better going for a larger audience, your business may very well end up being smaller, since only a small percentage will be interested in your skills. \nStrive for loyalty. Once you've identified your ideal customer base, build a loyalty program that keeps them engaged and satisfied over and over again. It's much easier to get more business from a current customer than it is to obtain a brand new one, so leverage their positive experiences to create more interactions. \nAlso, ask them to share their experiences within their networks. Your goal should be to form a strong base of advocates who have fallen in love with your brand and can't live without your business services. \nRelated: 4 Ways to Market Your Business for Free \nDevelop an innovation pipeline. Now that you've established a specific expertise for a specific customer base, make sure you are continuing to evolve and improve your offering. Innovation will keep them interested and buying more, with each new iteration of your offering. \nTake a look at Apple . The company's pipeline keeps its loyalists standing in line and upgrading on a constant basis. Your goal should be to offer your loyalists continuous improvements in your business benefits, and you just might pick up some new customers with your innovations as well. \nTake a stand. This might be the hardest part yet, but it's becoming more and more important to keep loyal customers on your side. Get to know what's important in your customers' lives and take a stand with them. More and more, we are seeing brands take a stand on social, political and economic issues to show their customers that they are living alongside them as they go through their lives. \nWhile it may seem risky to alienate some, you'll actually be developing stronger loyalty among your customer base and that's much more important to your business. Your goal should be to understand what matters most to your customers so you can speak up and see how your business and brand can add value. By the way, your customers are increasing expecting you to take a stand and might very well walk away if you don't. \nRelated: Use These 5 Steps to Create a Marketing Plan \nIn the end, trying to be everything to everybody is a quick ticket to a brand that has no true meaning, a disengaged customer base and a business without a strong future. \nOn the contrary, focus, expertise and innovation will create exactly what you were striving for, which is a fulfilling brand experience, highly loyal customers and a future driven by your own thoughtful innovation.

Most companies understand the importance of customer data, but lack the analysis expertise to match their ecommerce competitors' level. Deren Baker - Guest Writer \nAmazon has cultivated a well-deserved reputation for owning the online shopping market; but contenders like Walmart are looking to gain competitive ground. The supermarket chain, for example, moved earlier this year to offer two-day shipping for no additional charge with any online order. Sound familiar? \nRelated: 5 Ways Startups Can Leverage Big Data for a Competitive Advantage \nBut, even with this change and the company\u2019s recent acquisitions of specialists like Jet.com, Shoebuy, Bonobos, ModCloth, Adchemy and OneOps, Walmart still has its work cut out. \nAfter all, super-powered companies such as Amazon don\u2019t emerge by chance. Over time, Amazon has mastered the art of conversion by developing strategies from the data it's collected on customer behavior. Which brings us back to Walmart: Without a stronger sense of how to diagnose its own market and pin down its customer intent online, even a company this powerful stands no chance of claiming a piece of Amazon\u2019s turf. \nAll that, in turn, brings us to your company: If a giant like Walmart is struggling, much smaller startups might consider it a hopeless task to even make a dent in the ecommerce space. But there are methods startups can employ to cover lost ground using data. According to a survey by Interana, 88 percent of companies polled reported that while they understood the value of data, most admitted they struggle to implement accurate, agile analytics solutions. Closing the consumer data gap \nOne way to solve this disconnect is to employ second-party data with publisher partners. OwnerIQ reports that 96 percent of companies incorporating second-party data into their marketing strategies acknowledge it as valuable to their strategic success. When campaigns are running, you too should work with publishers that effectively segment audiences and make in-flight adjustments to ensure campaign dollars are spent effectively. \nStartups can also exchange first-party data through a data onboarder such as LiveRamp, which has about 200 direct relationships with clients. Once the marketing team has developed a holistic view of first-, second- and third-party data, you can put all those types of data to work with platforms that help target, personalize and measure against all marketing efforts. \nRelated: 7 Startups That Are Owning the Data Game \nThen, once entrepreneurs have built up their startups\u2019 data sets, they'll hopefully see how vital it is to use that data to its full effect. Data is nothing if startups aren\u2019t drawing insights from it via analysis. Want to know more? Here are four ways startups can give themselves a boost up to their ecommerce competition\u2019s level, through an effective use of data. 1. Make data sets manageable. \nData analysis is time-consuming, but it's not impossible. In fact, a CMO Council survey found that 42 percent of marketers surveyed were seeking to analyze more connected marketing campaigns. A separate 30 percent of professionals who deal with data reported to Square Root that they were regularly interacting with an overload of data sources. \nTip: Consolidate your own data sources into one manageable environment instead of forcing your marketing team to hop from platform to platform. Pull all in-house, second-party and third-party data into one data warehouse before starting the analytics process. 2. Keep analysis goal-centric. \nAs with any efficient marketing strategy, data-analytics strategies should relate to relevant company goals and product development. Focus your resources on collecting data in areas that have the biggest influence on your company goals, and analyze the data accordingly. Data programs that work well and are efficient tend to focus on examining customer-behavior data and creating product iterations based on what that data reveals. \nHome security startup Vivint used customer usage data from its doorbell camera to determine that its product was used most by families with children on weekday afternoons. This insight led to the development of a new product entirely -- a two-way video chat product called Vivint Ping that allows working parents to stay in touch with their children who have arrived home from school. 3. Measure data that matters. \nKPIs are no good if they aren\u2019t measuring data points that are useful to your company. Ensure that the KPIs your marketing team tracks are optimized for the company\u2019s overall goals and its products or services. These KPIs can range from lifetime value to margin loss, but no matter what they are, they should be useful markers for the company. \nFor entrepreneurs struggling to determine which KPIs are most relevant for their companies, consider some options : Customer-acquisition cost (the cost spent on marketing efforts to gain a new customer), lifetime value (a customer\u2019s overall value to a company) and profit margin (how much is made from a sale of a product above its production cost) are good metrics to watch. 4. Examine data companywide. \nDon\u2019t keep data siloed in one department alone, because that just makes each department less likely to connect the dots. An ecommerce department, for example, might struggle to understand which campaign or platform first attracted a given customer, and marketing won\u2019t be able to optimize a campaign without knowing where people left the conversion funnel. \nRelated: 5 Misconceptions Small-Business Owners Have About Big Data \nCross-department collaboration also ensures that offers can be tailored to specific customer groups throughout the funnel. The Aberdeen Group found that not only does collaboration make decision-making 46 percent faster , but customers are treated to response times 42 percent better as well. \nDeveloping a successful data strategy can seem daunting, especially when companies as big as Walmart are struggling to keep up with Amazon\u2019s prowess.

Jason Saltzman - Guest Writer \nJoin Alley's efforts to support relief efforts in Puerto Rico here . \nOn Wednesday, Sept. 20, Hurricane Mar\u00eda hit Puerto Rico, destroying homes and communities. It has taken lives, contaminated water and destroyed many resources the island needs. It is important in times like these to mobilize our community and help support our friends and families. \nI truly believe that the entrepreneurial community is not just about making money. It is about helping others in times of need and contributing to the greater good. Alley is an asset for entrepreneurs, creators and tastemakers. We have office space that people pay to work out of to bear near like-minded, awesome people. Community has always been what matters to us, what always set us apart from other office spaces. \nAs many of you may know, from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, America celebrates Hispanic Heritage Month . We had planned to celebrate the multicultural roots of our team and of our community with a large party. This year, though, the party seemed frivolous and more than a little disrespectful in light of the slow and painful recovery the people of Puerto Rico have in front of them. \nRelated: Here's How Richard Branson Survived Hurricane Irma and How He's Helping Others \nOur community is international in many ways, and is not limited to the people we talk to and support every day. Members are connected to their families in Puerto Rico, people who are out of contact and perhaps out of resources. In the face of such difficulty, we felt that one of our most important company values -- to support our community any way we can -- was being tested. \nRelated: 6 Benefits of Joining a Professional Community \nWe will be canceling our Hispanic Heritage Month Celebration and focusing our efforts on raising money for Puerto Rico. Alley will donate $100,000 worth of office space memberships in order to raise money for Puerto Rico. We're offering deeply discounted daily, weekly and monthly passes, as well as a bunch of incredible one-on-one mentorship experiences, with the goal of raising $20,000. One hundred percent of all funds collected through this campaign will be donated to the Puerto Rico relief efforts. \nThe rewards are exclusively for our Chelsea location in New York City, but we hope those outside of the city are willing to donate to this important and meaningful cause. Community is not limited to who you know, who you admire or where you live. Community stretches to include people you will never meet, people who are working towards growth and opportunity.

This marks Altibbi\u2019s third round - its first round of $500,000 was in 2014 with DASH Ventures and MEVP, along with angel investors, followed by a second raise of $2 million in 2015 with DASH Ventures and MEVP too. In total, according to Jalil Allabadi, founder of Altibbi, the Jordan-based startup has raised $8.5 million in investments. \nFounded by Allabadi and Ayman Sharaiha in Amman in 2010, the startup\u2019s platform has more than 1.5 million pages of medical content in Arabic, with 12,000 registered doctors on the database available for online consultations. The app serves users in 10 Arab countries, as well as have offices in Amman, Dubai and Gaza.

Walid Mansour, Partner and Chief Investment Officer at MEVP, comments on a statement that Altibbi\u2019s growth last year was an influencing factor in their decision to continue investing. Omar J. Sati , Managing Director of DASH Ventures also discussed that their decision to invest in the startup was also due to their \u201cgenuine and authentic rapport\u201d with Jalil, who Sati says, showed his ability to bring the startup towards various evolving points to achieve product-market fit. Sati also adds that Altibbi stood out from startups with similar business models because of the platform\u2019s impressive statistics of web visitors and verified doctors. \u201cBusiness models are a dime-a-dozen,\u201d Sati says, but in particular, it was the execution and the team behind that motivated the investment. Jalil Allabadi, founder, AltibbiSource: Altibbi \nAs they were determining investors, Altibbi mentioned how a key factor was focusing on top investors from the start: \u201cWe targeted investors who have the stamina, and the heart to invest in new areas that require more patience than other sectors.\u201d As the startup continues to grow, to keep being a standout from the market, Allabadi says that a guiding factor is not only focusing on growing features, but \u201coverarching value\u201d for users, focusing on quality and accessibility of their services by working on the small details. As for the newly acquired capital, Allabadi says it would be on used on two fronts: content-wise, the startup plans to grow its presence and Arabic medical content, plus develop its free Q&A sessions answered by its verified Arab doctors; while on the telehealth side, the team is working towards making the platform more robust, with new features geared to turn it to a hub for family health.

Sherrie Campbell \u2022 Contributor Image credit: Hero Images | Getty Images \nCollaboration is a key factor in building a small business because it works. People thrive in environments which free them to communicate and work together. When the company environment is focused on collaboration, team members naturally feel a part of something bigger than themselves. The best way to transition from an individual to a collaborative mindset is to equip each team member for active participation in the group dynamic. \nHere are 10 simply ways to cultivate team cohesion: 1. Create a clear and compelling cause. \nTo create a cohesion, team members must be provided with a convincing reason to be a part of the company mission. The more compelling and exciting the mission, the easier it is to inspire team members to want to be a part of what the company aspires to accomplish. When they are given a clear and gripping cause to be involved with, team members naturally become as passionate about the goals and objectives as their leaders. If team members do not care or are unclear about the goals and objectives presented to them, they will find all kinds of reasons not to work together. For collaboration to work, the vision and purpose must be clear. \nRelated: 10 Elements Needed to Create Effective Collaboration Between Your Brand and Your Influencer 2. Communicate expectations. \nCollaboration must be communicated to team members as the minimum standard. To foster this, team members must be provided with defined individual and collective roles and responsibilities they will hold within the team. When they have a clear understanding of their position, each team member will work more effectively and without accidentally stepping on another person\u2019s toes creating unforeseen conflicts. In a collaborative environment, each team member experiences what it means to take part in the shared responsibility of results. With this type of focus, what starts out as a goal becomes a crusade with the experience of success changing from an individual achievement into a bonded group experience building comrade and morale. \nRelated: 4 Ways Co-Working Spaces Inspire Innovation and Collaboration 3. Establish team goals. \nTo drive success in team members it\u2019s important to set measurable goals for each on a quarterly basis. The purpose of these goals is to provide team members with achievable wins. These wins have a magical way of breaking down barriers and creating positive momentum individually and collectively. Further, it\u2019s imperative to re-evaluate goals and redirect whenever necessary. At each quarter\u2019s end, the outcomes of quarterly goals must be made available to the whole team as a way to measure and celebrate progress, and to determine where improvements need to be made. Working with this type of transparency decreases confusion, finger-pointing and the disintegration of team cohesion. \nRelated: Genius Loves Company: 4 Ways to Cultivate Creative Collaboration 4. Leverage team-member strengths. \nTo empower each team member, it is a great strategy to work with their strengths rather than working around their weaknesses. It is a good idea to have each member take a personality test such as the Myers-Briggs, and hold a team roundtable to share results. This is a great bonding exercise because the results allow each person to get to know themselves and their team members in a much deeper way. It also gives team members information about who to go to and for what based upon each person\u2019s individual strengths. When teams are connected in this way, each member is set up for success because they are each assigned tasks that play to their respective strengths. \nRelated: Build Your Business on Your Strengths, Hire Your Team to Cover Your Weaknesses 5. Foster cohesion between team members. \nCohesive teams are more successful. They are successful because each person on the team is included in as many large decisions as possible. When team members feel this type of inclusion, they feel the perceived significance of their role, causing them to naturally perform better. To be the most effective, teams should to participate in daily huddles where each member discusses their goals and objectives for day. This helps to avoid duplication of effort and competition between team members. These huddles keep everyone on the same playbook and enables team members to re-direct their efforts as needed. \nRelated: 6 Leadership Practices to Strengthen Virtual Team Cohesion 6. Encourage innovation. \nFor teams to grow they must be encouraged to brainstorm and question the status quo in an open and non-judgmental environment. Team members must be coached and led to believe the challenges and obstacles they face can and will be overcome. When a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude is instilled it motivates team members to live up to those \u201ccan-do\u201d expectations. It is also important to ask team members for their thoughts, their reasoning and ideas on a regular basis. The more connected and understood they feel to their manager or leader, the more motivated they will be to perform, impress, be creative and to exceed expectations. \nRelated: The Lifeblood of Success: How to Encourage Innovation at Your Company 7. Keep promises and honor requests. \nMost requests and promises are held sacred within a team, but considered optional between other company units or customers. Taking a request from a customer seriously and demonstrating that the team is working to do what they say they are going to do, goes a long way towards building trust and blurring boundaries. The question every customer and every business unit asks of another is, can I count on you? Will you be there when I need you? Do you care about this as much as we do? When team members and customers feel they can depend upon you and your team to deliver what they expect, business grows, relationships grow as does revenue. \nRelated: A Promise Is A Promise: Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew 9. Encourage people to socialize outside of work. \nWe all lead busy personal lives and the thought of having one more corporate event we are obligated to attend can add stress. However, socializing with co-workers outside the office is an effective way to open channels of communication, to create a better understanding and break down any walls of pre-judgemental or mistrust between team members. When team members learn they share common interests or wrestle with some of the same challenges outside of work as others, they experience their team members as more real, which helps to decrease individual bias, stereotyping and false objectifying. When we see our team members as human, it makes it more difficult to point the finger at them. \nRelated: 7 Ways to Create Harmony In the Office 10. Recognize, reward and celebrate collaborative behavior. \nThe legends of athletic dynasties or standout corporate successes consist of incredible collaborative efforts. Team members often sit in conversation reminiscing over how it all came together. Whether shared through video, newsletter, podcast, annual report or seminar, stories of great collaboration break down the walls of individualism and honor the collective accomplishment. Attaching performance rewards and bonuses to collaborative efforts sends the right message to team members about the values that are driving the business. \nEstablishing a collaborative environment is just the beginning of a more successful venture. For collaboration to work it must be consistent and purposeful, with resources and rewards dedicated to its success. You may have many standout successes in your company already; but you can increase your productivity exponentially by getting them to work as a collaborative team. When team members feel they are a part of something exceptional they are more than willing to work together to get the ball across the goal line. Collaboration works because there is nothing more meaningful, bonding or growth promoting than a shared win.

You aren\u2019t providing a service to anyone by selling, presenting, promoting, marketing or building trust.

Treat me like I won\u2019t buy, like I can\u2019t, and I will not buy. All your words, responses, facial expressions, and actions need to communicate that you\u2019re treating your buyer as somebody who is going to buy, can buy, will pay, will commit now, and will close now. \nThis is a discipline. Treat them like they have money and they\u2019ll create money they don\u2019t have. You create the buyer. When they lack confidence in themselves they won\u2019t buy.

If you don\u2019t acknowledge them you stop communication andwithout communication there is no close. \nIf you\u2019ve heard someone say, \u201care you listening to me?\u201d you haven\u2019t been acknowledging them. Remember when you acknowledge someone it doesn\u2019t mean you buy into what they are saying. \nRelated: 7 Tips for Getting More Sales Meetings With Prospects Always agree with the buyer. \nYou don\u2019t ever want to disagree with your buyer. There will come a time in the close where you might disagree, but before that, there will be a lot of agreement. If you violate agreement early on you will crush your negotiations. Always agree is different than the idea that the customer is always right. The customer is not always right. \nWhether the buyer is right or wrong is not the issue. In order to close, you have to resolve conflict and disagreement. That takes one person, not two. For disagreement to exist it takes two sides. Disagreement only results in not closing deals.

There is a handful of can-do people. These are the valuable people in society. Those that can't-do, don\u2019t do. Those that can do, do do. \nThose that believe the impossible make the impossible happen. Nobody cares what you can't do. I was once in an Italian restaurant and they said I couldn\u2019t sit where I was sitting if I was eating pizza. They had a policy that if you were ordering a pizza, you had to sit in the back. I didn\u2019t want to sit in the back. It was insanity. I don\u2019t care what they can\u2019t do, because people only care about what you can do. \nHaving a solution-oriented attitude is about having the right mental disposition. You need to ask this question, \u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Think about how things can work. People appreciate those who never give up. \nRemember, selling is critical, but you do it because you want to close. Closing is what ultimately lets you expand. This is why you should never get comfortable with just a handful of closes. Don\u2019t believe just three or four is great. Find 150 and build yourself into a strong salesperson. Know them all. I made my Closer\u2019s Survival Guide for this very purpose -- to make you a closer.

Entrepreneur Staff - Entrepreneur Staff \nOn the new streaming show Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch , founders step into the Entrepreneur Elevator and have just 60 seconds to present their idea, product or business to a panel of investors. Whether an entrepreneur gets invited into the boardroom or sent back to the ground floor depends on what our experts think in that first minute. Each week we\u2019ll dissect what any entrepreneur can learn from these contestants' winning -- or losing -- pitches. \nIt takes more than a heartwarming family story for a mother-daughter duo to win over the Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch investors. Brittany Evans, a college-age entrepreneur, shows off her smarts when selling her idea for a shareable in-ear audio device, called Sparkbudz. Her intimate knowledge of her market and competition earn her financial backing for her well-researched passion project. \nMany entrepreneurs find themselves unprepared to answer follow-up questions during pitch meetings. On Entrepreneur Elevator Pitch , we watch as these contestants shake their heads in disappointment when they\u2019re sent back downstairs. Evans, on the other hand, walks away with a deal in hand, thanks to careful research that demonstrates the promise of her product in the world of teen-oriented tech. By targeting a specific audience and articulating her plan for the future -- not just a dream or projection, but a logical roadmap backed by painstakingly gathered data -- Evans wins support for Sparkbudz. \nAspiring entrepreneurs, take note: You should always take the time to conduct research and gather statistics specific to your product or idea. Doing so will help you confidently persuade skeptics and construct a savvy pitch. Before seeking support for your next big idea, learn from Evans\u2019s example and do your homework. \nEntrepreneur Elevator Pitch streams Wednesdays on Entrepreneur.com starting September 20. Aspiring entrepreneurs, be sure to check back for details on applying to season 2. For those who think they\u2019ve seen the next million-dollar idea on the show, head to Indiegogo to become an early supporter and help the featured entrepreneurs bring their projects to life.

Jonathan Long - VIP Contributor \nThink and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill is one of my favorite books. It's a self-improvement and personal development book that I believe all entrepreneurs should read. In fact, I read it once a year, in part to keep one of his most famous quotes permanently engraved in my mind: \n\"Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, the mind can achieve.\" \nNo, simply \"thinking\" about success isn't going to cut it -- you have to put in the work -- and a lot of it. But, it serves a great reminder that we can achieve anything that we dream up. No idea is too crazy, and if you don't believe me, take a look at what Elon Musk has brewing . \nHenry Ford once said, \"Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it.\" \nIdeas are a dime a dozen, but that doesn't mean they're worthless -- every million-dollar success starts as an idea. This is why Think and Grow Rich is so immensely popular and why producers in Los Angeles brought the book to the big screen -- it serves as a major wake-up call for many. Here are three ways to leverage your mind to help you achieve your million-dollar dream. \nRelated: He Went From Dead Broke to Millionaire Because He Just Wouldn't Stop Trying 1. Have faith in your ability as an entrepreneur. \nThere are two things that get in the way of dreams -- self-doubt and fear. These are protection mechanisms that many use as safety nets and excuses. If someone doesn't truly believe they have what it takes to be successful or if they are scared of falling flat on their face they will revert back to these two roadblocks. \nIt's much easier to say, \"I knew it couldn't be done\" than to take it on the chin and try again. When you have faith in your ability, the fear is eliminated and the self-doubt doesn't surface. It's very hard to lose when your idea and execution plan is backed by confidence, drive and determination. \nI truly believe I can accomplish anything that I am willing to worker harder than anyone else at. It's not cockiness -- it's having complete faith in my ability to perform as an entrepreneur. \nRelated: 11 Habits of Truly Happy People 2. Remain in the correct mindset 24/7/365. \nSo much of the entrepreneurial journey is mental . If you are weak-minded, the smallest inconveniences or hurdles will stop your momentum and cause your goals to go up in smoke. You need to wake up every morning in a positive mindset, willing to do everything necessary to reach your goals. \nYou then have to maintain that mindset all day and then go to sleep with it as well. It's a non-stop cycle -- any pause will make you lose momentum. This is what makes this game difficult sometimes -- phone calls come in at all hours, emails go back and forth far beyond 5 p.m., and sometimes duty calls on the weekend. \nIf you have big dreams, then you need to go all-in and commit to maintaining the entrepreneurial mindset around the clock. There are several examples of entrepreneurs who went broke and then found success -- the accomplished this by staying in the correct mindset and becoming obsessed. \nRelated: Habits of the World's Wealthiest People (Infographic) 3. Never be afraid of dreaming too big. \nOne thing that pisses me off more than anything is hearing someone shut down an entrepreneur's dream or idea, deeming it impossible or unrealistic. Some of the luxuries and conveniences we all enjoy today started out as outrageous dreams, then became reality when we ignored the doubters and got to work. Not everyone is an entrepreneur and not everyone has the inner drive required to dream big, but don't ever let the opinion of another person crush your dreams. Dream big , dream often and never worry about what anyone else will think. I've been told I'm crazy several times, but I've never let it stop me.

Sometimes, you can actually be holding back your company from growth. So, what do you do if you're the problem? Six entrepreneurs chime in. 1. Trust your team. \n\u201cI used to review each line of copy we put out in the world -- then my team told me I was creating a large bottleneck. I had to learn to tolerate incongruities with the way I think our brand should come to life and the way it actually does. Today, I see most brand creative when our customers do. It\u2019s not easy, but empowering our team gives me space to think about the brand's evolution.\u201d -- Jeff Raider, co-founder and co-CEO, Harry\u2019s \nRelated: How This Founder Learned to Trust His Team 2. Listen to your spouse. \n\u201cA team and I worked tirelessly to develop a product that lets families securely store photos in the cloud. But when I talked about it, people kept saying they wanted photo books -- and I ignored them. Printed photos? So last century! But my wife, Vanessa, had an epiphany and gave me an ultimatum: Use technology to make creating photo books completely automatic, or pull the plug. The concept took off, and Vanessa officially joined us as co-founder.\u201d -- Nate Quigley, co-founder and CEO, Chatbooks 3. Accept your flaws. \n\u201cA former employee recently told me I was the most demanding person she ever worked for. I thought I was easygoing! I started thinking about the impact I have on others and realized I\u2019m a mix of chaos, compassion , perfectionism and inconsistency -- and I would hate to work for me. Now I employ people who are smarter than I am who can also be the buffer between me and the hard working teamswho make our vision a reality.\u201d -- David Wolfe, co-founder and CEO, Leesa \nRelated: Why Admitting Your Mistakes Will Make You a Better Leader 4. Forget what you know. \n\u201cI come from a B2B product-development background, and when we launched our consumer-\u00adfacing beer tap, I wanted to market it by relying heavily on the technical specs. I saw our product as a hardware solution to subpar beer. But when our creative team presented their vision -- including new packaging and brand guidelines -- I realized I had to get out of their way and let them hit that sweet spot. We\u2019re actually selling the experience of delicious drinking, not an answer to some problem on paper.\u201d -- Phil Petracca, co-founder and CEO, Fizzics 5. Loosen up. \n\u201cOf a Kind launched in 2010 selling only limited edition designer products. It gave us focus at first, but eventually we felt hemmed in. Our audience was telling us they were interested in nonlimited items and new product categories, but because it didn\u2019t fit the model my cofounder and I had created, we decided they were off-limits for too long. It wasn\u2019t until 2012 that we broke our own rule, but now our business has benefited.\u201d -- Erica Cerulo, co-founder, Of a Kind \nRelated: 6 Ways to Ask for Help Without Being Embarrassed 6. Ask for help. \n\u201cAfter 20 years in business, I still viewed our insurance company as my baby. As we tried to grow beyond $70 milion in revenue, I was so intent on being involved in everything, I actually slowed down operational efficiencies and business development. We needed people with more experience to help us scale, and in one year we hired three C-level executives and seven directors. Splitting responsibilities and accountability made scaling easier, and our online company ratings jumped 300 percent.\u201d -- Jim Krampen, co-founder, Seven Corners \nThis story appears in the October 2017 issue of Entrepreneur .

She also never thought she\u2019d build a rum distillery or get a doctorate at Harvard. \nShe did all these things in part, because of courage, a trait she started to develop at West Point, a school she attended after her godmother urged her to be part of an institution that was about \u201cwhat\u2019s real, what matters and what lasts.\u201d \nRelated: Kathryn Minshew of The Muse: Decide Who You Are, or Have it Decided for You (Podcast) \nWest Point transformed her in a number of ways, kicking off a 16-year career in the military as an army aviator and professor of leadership.

Steve Forbes says that leaders such as Hannibal and Alexander the Great have a lot to teach business owners of today. Nina Zipkin - Entrepreneur Staff \nIf you\u2019re looking for entrepreneurial role models, you could certainly turn to figures such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg or Oprah Winfrey. But Steve Forbes, the editor-in-chief of Forbes Magazine and the author of Power Ambition Glory , says that there is much today\u2019s entrepreneurs can learn by studying the triumphs and failures of the world\u2019s ancient leaders. \nForbes, who will discuss this topic at Synergy Global Forum 2017 , posits that the most effective leaders are the ones that build structures that outlast them and understand that \u201csuccess is ephemeral and you may achieve something great, but it doesn't mean that you're not going to suffer setbacks tomorrow,\" he says. \"As my father liked to say, if you think you've arrived, you're ready to be shown the door.\u201d \nThis year, Forbes Magazine celebrated the 30th anniversary of its yearly ranking of the World\u2019s Billionaires . Forbes tells Entrepreneur that he believes these billionaires all have one thing in common. \nRelated: 5 Nuggets of Advice Given to Me by Billionaires \n\u201cThey've identified a need that hadn't been met before or did it in a way that hadn't been done before,\u201d he says. \u201cSuccess in free markets comes from meeting the needs and wants of other people, even if they initially didn't know they needed what you are offering. It's not greed, it's not selfishness, it's making an offering and people responding positively to it.\u201d \nForbes says that to him, success simply means drawing on your strengths to make a positive and inspiring difference in the world. \nRead on for four leadership lessons from the past that never go out of style. \nRelated: 20 Truths About Billionaires That Nobody Understands \nGo your own way. \u201cYou have to be an innovator to be a truly effective leader. You can't do what everyone else does. [Ancient leaders] did things in a high risk way, [like famed Carthaginian general] Hannibal going over the Alps to invade Rome instead of from the south, as the Romans thought he would do.\u201d \nKeep the lines of communication open. \u201cAlexander the Great became very isolated. He began to think he was an actual god and began to brook no dissent and began to purge anyone who he thought wasn't 100 percent on board. As a result, he was poisoned by his own generals because they thought it was just a matter of time before he'd kill them.\u201d \nRelated: 5 Ways Billionaires Maximize Their Time \nLearn how to delegate. \u201cYou must keep track of things, but you must also give responsibility to others. You can't do it all yourself. Even if you know you can do a particular job better than someone else, you may let that someone else do it because your time is better spent on other things.\u201d \nBe prepared for things to go wrong. \u201cNo matter how smart you are, no matter how on top of the game you are, you will make mistakes. Events will sometimes overcome your own plans. So whether it's your fault or outside events or a combination, you have to be prepared to deal with situations that are crises and for which there may be no playbook. You have to truly respond in a way that you're going to be alone. And if it goes well you'll have plenty of others willing to take credit. And if that doesn't work well you will be very much alone. So that's why they call it loneliness at the top.\u201d A Note From The Editor Visit BNY Mellon Wealth Management for more thought leadership content.

Are you able to zero in on the essentials you must do for that day and delegate additional necessary tasks effectively? Next Slide Bryan Bedder | Getty Images \nTo effectively lead, you need to be able to have a clear understanding of what you, and you alone, must be in charge of doing. Not everything that demands your attention is important. \nTim Ferriss , the author of The 4-Hour Workweek , has mastered the art of human efficiency by zeroing in on the absolute essentials to achieve maximum results and delegating tasks that aren\u2019t exclusive to his decision-skills to others. \u201cTo be a good leader, you cannot major in minor things, and you must be less distracted than your competition,\u201d Ferriss said. \"To get the few critical things done, you must develop incredible selective ignorance. Otherwise, the trivial will drown you.\" \nLeadership is also about intelligently delegat ing . You can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, be doing it all, and you need to have a team of people who can make and carry out decisions using their own judgment. In The 4-Hour Work Week , Ferriss wrote how one of the ways he was able to focus on his goals for achieving the most income in the least amount of time in the drop-shipping business was by hiring an affordable virtual assistant.

Next Slide Drew Angerer | Getty Images \nBeing able to relate your vision and clearly explain what you would like done is crucial so that everyone is working toward the same goals. Also, articulating what success looks like to you in some well-defined, measurable ways (e.g. key performance indicators) is equally important. \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos is crystal clear about his company\u2019s directive: The customer comes first. And he\u2019s able to also use KPIs (metrics) to provide measurable goals for the abstract.

(Answers have been edited and condensed for clarity.) \nWho are you and what\u2019s your business? \nRobert Wessman, entrepreneur and creator of three global life science companies. Currently the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Alvogen , one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical generics companies in the world. Icelandic by birth, international in scope. \nWhat does the word \u201centrepreneur\u201d mean to you? \nCourage and persistence. Courage to dare to see and act when others do not; persistence to never quit or give up. \nWhat was your toughest challenge and how did you overcome it? \nA cycling accident in 2014, which resulted in a broken spine, multiple herniated discs in my back, and more than 150 stitches in my face and hands. I overcame with the support of my family and close colleagues, and the fact that I saw the recovery process as a challenge where there was only one option: to get back to where I was before the accident. I refused to dwell on it or feel sorry for myself. I went to extraordinary lengths to rebuild my body\u2019s functionality and strength. I kept my focus and I stayed positive -- remaining fully engaged in the business via an iPad that was attached above my hospital bed. \nRelated: 8 Reasons a Powerful Personal Brand Will Make You Successful \nWhat did you learn from that experience? \nThe power of positive thinking and clear focus. Never dwell on things that go wrong in your life. The past is the past. Everyone has their own challenges in life; our success is based on how we deal with them and move on. The key is to stay focused on what propels us forward -- concentrate only on that. Don\u2019t waste time or energy on the past or things you cannot change. Know where you are headed and identify ways to get there. Then simply get going and put all you\u2019ve got into your journey. No doubt. No fear. No hesitation. \nWhat trait do you depend on most when making decisions? \nKnowing your industry, your company and your people are critical for fast and effective decision-making . To achieve that, I rely on clarity of data, transparency of performance and close collaboration with colleagues, customers and strategic partners. In other words: keep things simple. Keep data and performance transparent and rely on your team. \nRelated: 11 Habits of Truly Happy People \nHow has your leadership style evolved? \nAs a competitive athlete and CEO, I have always stressed the importance of selecting the most talented and hardworking individuals, but more importantly the ones who strive to make the team more successful than themselves. This unleashes the enormous power of collaborative, performance-driven culture. Acting fast, keeping it simple and clear, making sure everyone understands how they contribute -- vigorously tracking and rewarding performance -- and focusing on a few select areas has become my mantra as my leadership style has evolved. \nRelated: Habits of the World's Wealthiest People (Infographic) \nIs there a particular quote or saying that you use as personal motivation? \nI am a very ambitious person and I rarely need any external motivation. I wake up each morning full of excitement to continue on the path I left the night before. I\u2019m driven by the challenge to show our competitors and myself that we can again build a leading global pharma company from a very small base. I like to compete and raise the bar every time. \nA Note From The Editor ENTREPRENEUR LIVE - Nov 9th | Los Angeles, CA Join us for a day of inspiration, networking and keynotes from Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jon Taffer and more!

'If we had accepted the no's, we would never have come as far as we have,' says Thrive Market Founder Gunnar Lovelace. Nina Zipkin - Entrepreneur Staff \nEditor's Note: Entrepreneur's \"20 Questions\" series features both established and up-and-coming entrepreneurs and asks them a number of questions about what makes them tick, their everyday success strategies and advice for aspiring founders. \nFor Gunnar Lovelace, the word \u201cno\u201d wasn\u2019t a deterrent to his dream; rather, it was a galvanizing force. \nThe founder and co-CEO of Thrive Market, a major ecommerce retailer of non-GMO, organic and natural groceries, was rejected by 50 venture capital firms before launching in 2013. But Lovelace and his team ended up raising more than $160 million by partnering with individuals who shared their vision. \nToday, for $60 annual membership, Thrive Market customers can purchase to a variety of natural foods, home and beauty products at 30 to 50 percent of the retail price shipped to them for free. For every paid membership, the platform sponsors a free membership for a low-income family. \nLovelace says the inspiration for Thrive Market -- his fourth company after two tech companies and a jewelry business called Love Heals -- stemmed from what he learned from his own upbringing. \n\u201c It just comes from a very personal place,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving grown up with a single mom and seeing how hard she worked to make healthy choices, it always seemed crazy to me that food with lots of chemicals and processing cost less food with no chemicals to process.\u201d \nIn four years, the company has grown from one employee to a staff of over 500. By its second year in business, the company was bringing in $100 million in sales, and to date, the company has launched over 200 of its own Thrive Market Collection branded products with an additional 200 items in the works. \n\u201cWhen we help people access healthy food we're empowering them, we're dealing with major macroeconomic issues,\u201d Lovelace explained about the company\u2019s mission. \u201cConventional agriculture is the second largest contributor of greenhouse gases, so it's incredibly impactful thing to shift from toxic, conventional food systems to organic and regenerative [ones].\u201d \nWe caught up with Lovelace to ask him 20 questions and figure out what makes him tick. \nRelated: This Successful Entrepreneur Explains Why Revenue Is Not the Most Important Thing (and What Is) \n1. How do you start your day? I jump on my rowing machine and I take a cold shower. Getting regular exercise and taking a cold shower just kind of makes me feel very clear, clean and stable. And it works out the stress I may be carrying. \n2. How do you end your day? I spend a lot of time rolling on my back on an extra-firm roller. I like it, because we spend so much time sitting, so there's a lot of compression and rolling around my back relaxes me. \n3. What\u2019s a book that changed your mind and why? Loving What Is: Four Questions That Can Change Your Life by Byron Katie. She has an interesting method for taking radical personal responsibility. I used to be a very judgmental person, so I really appreciate the way that she frames the opportunity of taking responsibility for our judgments and perceptions. \n4. What\u2019s a book you always recommend and why? The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey. Stephen Covey is just a master at articulating the ability to have an optimized managerial experience. Again, just kind of back to the theme of radical personal responsibility and understanding how to build a positive team culture. \n5. What\u2019s a strategy to keep focused? Staying positive and not dwelling on past regrets. It is really pretty simple. \nRelated: The Founder of Bumble Reveals How the 'Question of Nine' Can Help You Stay Focused \n6. When you were a kid what did you want to be when you grew up? I wanted to be a pirate. I've always been attracted to that and the Robin Hood narratives, probably because I was conditioned from my parents, who both come from activist backgrounds. \n7. What did you learn from the worst boss you ever had? I haven't really ever had a boss; I've always worked for myself. So, I learned from myself as my worst boss. I used to be a terrible micromanager in my first companies. We hopefully mature as we get older, and I wanted to be more successful, so it challenged me to look at why I wasn't succeeding the way I wanted to. \n8. Who has influenced you most when it comes to how you approach your work? It sounds clich\u00e9, but it's my mom. We immigrated here when I was 2, very poor Latino immigrants. She's just been incredibly courageous, creative and persistent in the face of very difficult challenges. \n9. What\u2019s a trip that changed you? I drove on back roads from L.A. to New York and spent a lot of time interviewing people about what they're motivated by, what makes them happy and just seeing seeing commonality between people from all different places. \n10. What inspires you? I'm inspired by the power of our species. I think that's a double-edged sword. On one hand it's incredibly destructive. But on the other hand, it's just remarkable how we're able to dream, have a vision and then bring it to life. \nRelated: Use This Founder's Top Tip To Make Your Meetings Work For You \n11. What was your first business idea and what did you do with it? It was a pizza restaurant and cultural center in college that I raised $250,000 for in the annual student elections. It operated as a business and an educational center. \n12. What was an early job that taught you something important or useful? My first job was when I started a desk-top publishing business when I was 15. It started my love of typography and graphics that would be essential in marketing and advertising successes [later on]. \n13. What\u2019s the best advice you ever took? Never accepting no. We were rejected by over 50 VC firms. We ended up raising our first $10 million from 150 mega-bloggers as a result. If we had accepted the no's, we would never have come as far as we have. \n14. What's the worst piece of advice you ever got? I feel like I give myself the worst advice and that's really just like personal insecurity and fear as opposed to classically interpreted bad advice. \n15. What\u2019s a productivity tip you swear by? A simple Google sheet with each person that I am working with that I use to track the major threads of the projects and themes we're managing together. \nRelated: This Introvert Founder Swears by This Management Tip \n16. Is there an app or tool you use in a surprising way to get things done or stay on track? I really like Wunderlist. I've used a lot of lists and to-do apps, and it's just super simple, lightweight. Also, it's stable and collaborative, so I can share. It's just a very effective way for me to keep myself organized. \n17. What does work-life balance mean to you? I am working that one out. I think I've probably suffered tremendously under my intense ambition, and I'm not sure I believe in balance in a classical way, but more the idea of equilibrium. \n18. How do you prevent burnout? Getting sleep, taking time for myself and being creative in nonlinear ways outside of the business. \n19. When you\u2019re faced with a creativity block, what\u2019s your strategy to get innovating? I will do some conscious breathing and move my body. \n20. What are you learning now? Being more authentically me. I grew up in a hippie commune in very kind of alternative circumstances, with a lot of survival trauma early on in my life. As I went through my entrepreneurial career early on, I thought I had to hide that, because it wasn't normal. Now I am really experimenting with allowing my freak flag fly.

An entrepreneur whose goal is to take his startup to the red planet discovers the virtue of thinking big. Tim Denning \u2022 Guest Writer Image credit: Nisian Hughes | Getty Images \n\u201cGo on, say the word Mars and be bold. Say it like you mean it and look them in the eye.\u201d That's what I told a very young entrepreneur recently. I\u2019ve been working with a few startups recently, this entrepreneur was part of one of them. \nSomeone had suggested he take his product to Mars, and he loved the idea. But at the same time, he wasn\u2019t sure if he should pursue that goal, so he asked me. What I said is now on the record, but another wordsmith put it this way: \u201cShoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you\u2019ll land among the stars.\u201d \nThere are many benefits to being bold. It separates you from the competition. \nEveryone else in this cohort of startups I\u2019m assisting is doing something interesting. The difference is that they are not intending on going to Mars. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that either. What\u2019s cool about the entrepreneur that wants to take his product to Mars is that he\u2019s different. \nIn the beginning, he\u2019s seen as a wacko; what I know for sure is that as he executes, these same critics will become raving fans. His vision is very different from his competitors'. When you hear all the pitches, you remember the young guy that talks about going to Mars -- you may not remember the others. It gives you a voice. \nEveryone wants to hand the microphone to the \u201cMars guy.\u2019 You know what comes out of his mouth is going to be interesting. Being bold is fascinating and so rare. When you\u2019re bold and say stuff like \u201cWe\u2019re going to Mars, baby!\u201d your voice gets heard. \nRelated: Achieve Self-Mastery and You Will Never Settle for Less in Business \nThe best marketing you can ever do is to be bold and tell people your grand plan. So make that plan so big that your voice becomes louder than everyone else's. Don\u2019t have the loudest voice to feed your ego. Have the loudest voice so you can change the world. Take us all to Mars with you. It builds your confidence. \nAs you begin to repeat phrases like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Mars,\u201d you start to feel different. You get chills down your spine because your brain begins to believe what you\u2019re saying. Having a grandiose vision changes the way you approach your day. \nYou play the game of life differently because you believe your purpose can empower the human race. It\u2019s for this reason I told this young entrepreneur to tell everybody he\u2019s going to Mars. I\u2019ve noticed in a short amount of time that his confidence is growing. He\u2019s beginning to believe he can be extraordinary. You have this same superpower. All you need to do is believe. It motivates you. \nDespite what all the self-help books tell you, motivation can be hard to come by. We\u2019re not all coached by Tony Robbins every day, telling us to get our ass into gear and to do 100 more push-ups before saying another 50 affirmations. \nHowever, being bold is itself motivating. Each time you do it and say things like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to Mars,\u201d you unlock your own innate motivation. Powerful ideas give us energy that we don\u2019t normally have access to. The cool thing is that as you become motivated, so to do those around you. It attracts game-changers. \nThe key problem for a startup with no brand, no revenue and no capital is finding a way to get to Mars (or whatever destination your personal boldness compels you to seek). \nThis young entrepreneur asked me about those too, but I told him in my usual hyperactive way, \u201cFigure out the details later.\u201d \nRelated: The Nitty-Gritty: Knowing The Details Of Your Business \nI meant what I said. When you act with enough boldness, the golden chunks of detail come to you one at a time. I told him that if he kept talking about Mars, between myself and a few others involved, we could find a way to partner with someone who can help their startup get there. \nWhen you\u2019re bold, someone like Elon Musk could get involved. Now most of us don\u2019t know Musk, but chances are we can get to him if we really want to. For example, I don\u2019t know him, but I know three people that could get me a meeting with him if I tried hard enough and was bold enough with my vision. \nBeing bold requires you to take action, regularly, without necessarily having a plan. Being bold will attract game-changers to your big vision. Then it\u2019s through their help, and partnering with others, that you can fill in the gaps with the very resources and knowledge you lack. \nI often say that life and business are just a series of partnerships. It makes people listen. \nWhen you\u2019re bold, people listen. When you don\u2019t sound like everyone else, you are able to capture people\u2019s attention. The challenge is that capturing attention nowadays doesn\u2019t last for long. \nBeing bold is not enough unless you can back it up with something. Still, having people listen to what you\u2019re saying is part of the jigsaw puzzle. It\u2019s exciting. \nImagine going to work every day and feeling excited. Think about that for a second. \nMost of us don\u2019t start our days like that because we don\u2019t decide to work on something that is bold. Being bold and having a vision to go to Mars is exciting. Feelings drive us to do so much in our lives. \nBeing excited about what you\u2019re working on will change the way you behave. I find that when I\u2019m excited about what I\u2019m doing, I don\u2019t focus on the negatives as much. Your goal in life should be to experience how great it is to live with positive feelings. Being bold helps you feel that way. \nRelated: Mastering Your Emotions and Using Your Most Valuable Asset \nIf you\u2019ve had a similar idea to do something crazy like going to Mars, then I encourage you to pursue it. \nDon\u2019t let critics rob you of all of the benefits you receive when you decide to be bold.

A Note From The Editor FLASH SALE: $99 Tickets to Entrepreneur LIVE Join us Nov 9th in Los Angeles for a day of inspiration, networking and hear from Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jon Taffer, Carmen Electra, Apolo Ohno and more. Buy your $99 tickets now \u00bb \nJumping into a new role is as challenging as it is exciting. There are new skill sets, new workflows and likely new key performance indicators (KPIs) to be measured against. Often, there's also a blueprint for how to execute your new role, and a training path to get you there. \nRelated: 8 Women Leaders Who Are Disrupting Entrepreneurship \nBut what happens when you find yourself taking on a new position (whether with a new company, or with your existing employer), with no clear blueprint? \nI found myself in this very scenario a few years back -- making the jump from my dream job as a partner at a law firm to a first-time CEO of a legal-tech startup. It all happened in the blink of an eye. And, at the time, I had limited insight into what I had to do, not only to get a startup up and running, but also to make the personnel hires that would allow us to excel -- all while keeping our early customers happy, and prospecting for more. \nFortunately, I've had excellent resources, like backing from a venture studio and the wisdom of other female leaders, at my disposal. But I've still had to learn (and I continue to learn) the leadership skills I needed for being a first-time female CEO, in a role predominantly held by males . \nI've compiled my own top six tips for women, like me, looking to take on the role of a female CEO for the very first-time. Here they are: Don't stop networking. \nThere's a reason you continue to see this recommendation from leaders: It's crucial to your success. In my own case, I resisted the urge to keep the idea for a legal tech company top secret. I shared my idea with trusted colleagues who ended up connecting me with a venture studio that helped bring my product idea, Doxly , to life. Then, through a networking event, I made a connection with a community leader who introduced us to one of our lead investors in our financing round. \nI encourage you, too, to explore a range of networking events not specific to your industry. The more networking you do, the easier it will be to create (and foster) your personal network of potential mentors, employees, business partners or simply like-minded professionals you can consult from time to time. And, to push myself at these events, I set a personal goal to meet one more person than I did at the previous event. \nSimilarly, I encourage you -- even if you're a CEO -- to seek out a mentor. The objective insight and advice generated from mentorship is impactful , not just in your career, but in your personal development as well. \nRelated: What Male and Female Leaders Can Learn From Each Other 2. Be laser-focused -- in threes. \nEver feel like you're wearing four different hats while juggling too many priorities to count? I have. And, it quickly became overwhelming. I suggest being hyper-focused on only three critical things that will move you forward on both a macro and micro level. Do this regularly, from each quarter, to each month, to each week. \nFor example, are you dealing with an above-average percentage of customer churn? For that quarter, one focus should be to evaluate your customer success strategies with the goal of lowering churn. \nIs your marketing team stretched a little too thin? If it is, focus on interviewing for a month, with the goal of landing on a specific number of viable candidates. What you focus on will vary, but staying laser-focused in threes will keep you accountable for big needs and give your juggling skills a much-needed break. 3. Always talk to customers. \nCustomers are the lifeblood of a business, so carve out time every single day to be in communication with them. This doesn't just have to be when you're putting out fires. A simple hello or check-in may also be highly beneficial. Not only will you continue to develop your communication skills, but you will make yourself accessible to those your team has worked so hard to win. \nAnd you will likely uncover a new selling point (or potential roadblock) that can be used in future prospecting. 4. Hire for opposite skill sets. \nIn my first year as CEO, I had no idea how to recruit or make the right hires, a challenge I hadn't anticipated. I quickly learned that, while I was more inclined to bring on people whose skill sets were similar to mine, that wasn't helpful for my company's growth. Instead, I learned how to identify those whose skill sets complemented my own: I did this by asking the right questions and being self-aware of where I lacked as a leader. 5. Communicate confidently. \nI believe that strong communication is a skill that can always be improved, no matter what your experience or title. As a CEO, you will be expected to communicate with a board, your employees, both angry and happy customers, tough prospects, local professionals, partners and more. In all situations, confidence will take you further than big words or highly researched talking points. \nIn the role of CEO, it's likely you'll be communicating regularly with more men (who communicate differently ) than women, so make the effort to hone those particular aspects of your verbal, written and body language communication-styles that may make you come off as anything but confident. Practicing how to speak confidently is an essential skill to shape at those networking events I mentioned. 6. Research regularly. \nNever stop learning about your industry and the competitive landscape. You will be expected to be at the forefront of major trends or shifts, and looked to when times are tough; so arm yourself with the research to make decisions. I like to set aside time every morning (blocked off on my calendar) to do nothing but read industry publications, and also take a look at what our direct competitors are up to. \nSure, meetings pop up here and there that take me away from my reading time, but I make a point to reschedule that time for later in the day, no matter what. \nRelated: 7 Ways Women Leaders Can Excel at Being Their Authentic Selves \nThese six leaderships tips have proven fundamental in my growth as a first-time female CEO.

Here's Why. Work-life \"integration\" is the way to go. But, first, leaders must first understand why a perfect work-life balance isn't even possible. \nRelated: The Truth About Work-Life Balance \nJennifer Moss from Waterloo, Ontario, author of Unlocking Happiness At Work: How a Data-driven Happiness Strategy Fuels Purpose, Passion and Performance , believes that the goal of work-life balance has actually decreased employee engagement. And, certainly, engagement is low: According to Gallup\u2019s U.S. Employee Engagement study of 3,500 employees, only 37 percent of those surveyed described themselves as engaged. \nAccording to Moss, that alarming statistic stems from the amplified negative public perception of work. \u201c[In the past], most people didn\u2019t associate work with their passion, but with a paycheck. This is still very true today,\u201d Moss explained to me via email. \u201cSince we spend up to 90,000 hours at work in our lifetime, don\u2019t we want that time to be spent well? Work-life balance means we must treat both as separate experiences.\u201d \nThe author continued that we can\u2019t ignore the fact that a person\u2019s work life and home life overlap. And, because our brains don\u2019t bifurcate well, she suggested work-life integration, as opposed to a continued search for balance, as the way to achieve the ultimate balance. \nBut, before any of them dive into integration, company leaders must first understand why a perfect work-life balance isn\u2019t attainable: Our brains are negatively wired. \nIt isn\u2019t a happy truth, but a truth nonetheless: We\u2019re naturally geared toward the negative aspects of life. \nHere, Moss cited researchers like social neuroscientist John Cacioppo : \"Negativity bias refers to the notion that, even when [different considerations are of] equal intensity, things of a more negative nature have a deeper impact on our psychological state and processes than do neutral or positive things,\u201d Moss explained. \nUnfortunately, negativity perpetuates stress, and this heavy burden requires an intentional effort to fight our biases. \u201cJust like it\u2019s easier to skip the gym when we\u2019re feeling lazy and tired, so is practicing mindfulness, empathy, gratitude, optimism, resiliency, hope -- all the traits that lead to a happier experience of life and work,\u201d Moss continued. \nRelated: 3 Aspects of Work-Life-Balance You Won't Find in Company Presentations \nTip: Focus on the positive traits each of your employees brings to the team. Show gratitude and optimism when they\u2019re doing well, but don\u2019t forget to place an importance on both empathy and resilience when moments of negativity and struggle appear. \nEmployees surrounded by company leaders practicing positivity have the ability to put those traits into practice and lead a happier life. We\u2019re looking at it all wrong. \nMany people define work-life balance as having the \"perfect job\" which transitions into the perfect personal life. This unrealistic definition leads to a great deal of disappointment. \nMarianne Clyde, from Warrenton, Va., author of Zentivity\u2122: How to Eliminate Chaos, Stress, and Discontent in Your Workplace , told me we need to look at work-life balance as a state of mind. \u201cIt's the ability to juggle all the varying responsibilities at home and work without losing your calm, centered place. I don't think it's a myth; it is a conscious balancing act that we must attend to every day,\u201d Clyde shared in an email. \nIn order to reach this balance, Clyde suggested establishing deeply rooted beliefs and coping mechanisms. \nCiting the findings of researchers at the University of Warwick who did work on the topic of happiness in the workplace, Clyde said, \"The driving force seems to be that happier workers use the time they have more effectively, increasing the pace at which they can work without sacrificing quality.\" \nIn short, employees who feel empowered to do their jobs will feel excited and motivated to move forward with even more quality work. \nTip: Put this positivity into motion with employees who are naturally good at what they do. Knowing their strengths and weaknesses enables leaders to place them in the best-fitting positions. On the other hand, knowing their weaknesses leads the way to learning and development opportunities. Employees are constantly connected. \nIf finding work-life balance wasn\u2019t already difficult enough, our inability to disconnect from work has made it arguably impossible. \n\u201cWe tell ourselves that if we just 'meet this deadline,' get through the busy period or reach that next goal, then we will pay attention to our health, well-being and family. Then , we will take care of ourselves. Then , we will have balance,\u201d Annie McKee of Elkins Park, Pa., and author of HOW TO BE HAPPY AT WORK: The Power of Purpose, Hope, and Friendship , told me via email. \nSo, how do we encourage employees to get out of this cycle? \nMcKee said she believes the key is making better choices about how we spend our time and mental energy. But all too often, that idyllic future never materializes. Instead, there\u2019s another goal, another deadline, another project. \n\u201cIt\u2019s important to take stock of what\u2019s important to us at work -- and in life. Then, we need to be honest with ourselves: Is how we are working and living in line with our passions and our hopes for the future? If not, why not?\u201d McKee added. \nRelated: Here's What Work-Life Balance Means to These 20 Founders \nTip: Reflecting on our personal and work lives takes a lot of courage and encouragement. Help employees figure out where their destructive or overworking behaviors stem from. Then, give them advice, resources or step-by-step guidelines to help them reach their goal habits and mindsets.

Mary Kay Ash Carolyn Sun \n\u201cIf you think you can, you can. If you think you can\u2019t, you\u2019re right.\u201d \nThe \u201csink or swim\u201d moment for Mary Kay Ash , who founded the Mary Kay Cosmetics empire, came after World War II. Her husband had run off with another woman, and she was left with three young children to support. Having a knack for sales, she was employed by various direct-sales companies. Always a top sales performer, she found herself undervalued and dismissed by her male colleagues. \nAsh quit her sales job in 1962 and began writing a guide for working women. In it, she described her ideal sort of company and soon realized that she could start her own. She simply had to find a product she believed in to sell to women. \nNow in her mid-40s and on her second husband, she took her life\u2019s savings and invested it in the production of a skin softener she\u2019d been using on herself.

Dan Bova - Entrepreneur Staff \nYou might think that a guy who spent a total of 143 minutes in the penalty box during one season of hockey might have somewhat less than a sparkling sense of humor, but you\u2019d be wrong. \nNHL Hall of Famer and President of the Boston Bruins Cam Neely not only appreciates a good joke, he and Denis Leary co-founded Comics Come Home , the longest-running comedy fundraiser in history. Since 1995, the annual event benefits The Cam Neely Foundation for Cancer Care , whose mission is\"to provide comfort, support and hope to cancer patients and their families.\" This year\u2019s show at the TD Garden in Boston on Nov. 18 boasts a mega lineup of stars includes Jimmy Fallon, Jim Gaffigan, Craig Ferguson and Jeff Ross, among many others. Tickets are on sale here . \nEntrepreneur sat down with the bruising Bruin to discuss his passion for helping others, leadership, and tips for building a team that hates to lose. \nThis is the 23rd year of Comics Come Home. What has driven you to do this year after year? \nBoth of my parents were diagnosed with cancer at a young age and passed away. Most professional athletes do a number of charitable things throughout their careers, and when cancer struck my family, I decided to start this foundation focused on areas of care that I saw was lacking. Families suffer so much when a loved one is sick. So we have two main parts: The Neely Cancer Fund which supports treatment and research efforts and The Neely House , built in memory of my parents, which gives families a convenient, comfortable place to live and relax and be around others while undergoing treatment. \nHow did Denis Leary get involved? \nDenis is from Worcester Mass. I first came to Boston in 1986, instead of going to movies I enjoyed going to comedy shows. Through some mutual friends, I met Denis and we became friends. I asked him if he would consider doing some standup for a benefit for our foundation, and he did so much more. Comics Come Home is really his brainchild, he pulled together his friends from the Boston clubs and it has grown so much from there. \nRelated: ( Survey) A Quarter of Cancer Patients Use Legal Medical Marijuana \nWhether it is running your foundation or your hockey team, how would you describe your decision-making style? \nIt's really all about having the right conversations with the right people to get the right information. You need to digest the facts and then ultimately not be afraid to make a decision. The toughest thing is understanding that your decisions could impact other people's lives, but you can't be afraid to do what you think it's right. You just have to believe it and move forward. \nWhat do you look for in new hires? \nOne of my favorite questions to ask people -- especially prospective players -- is, \u201cDo you love to win or do you hate to lose?\u201d There's a big difference. Everybody loves to win. I hate losing. And I love when great teamwork works. Sure, this guy might have scored three goals, but in order to do that, someone had to pass him the puck. \nRelated: 15 Motivational Quotes From Legends in Sports \nBesides hockey and charity, you are something of a notable film actor.

Every once in a while when I\u2019m walking down the street, I still get people shouting, \u201cKick his ass, Sea Bass!\u201d \nWhat was it like to have the Bruins win the Stanley Cup? \nFor me it was it was such a special moment because I truly love our fan base. It was 39 years between cups and so you have generations of passionate fans. I was excited for our fan base and the city of Boston. \nDo you plan on talking to the team about the ongoing controversy of players not standing for the National Anthem? \nYes, we\u2019ll be addressing that. You know, I believe everybody has a right to express their opinions and their values and beliefs and I don't necessarily think that a sporting event is a place to do that. Fans are there to watch the event. But I believe in people having the right to express themselves, absolutely. \nRelated: Which Tech Billionaires Donate the Most to Charity?

You know, we had an issue and we took care of it on the ice, over and done. \nIf only everything could be like that simple. \nI was joking the other day that when I got upset with someone back in the day, I used to get five minutes in the penalty box. Now I'd get handcuffs! \nAny chance people who go see Comics Come Home will see you do a set? \nHa, no I am not going anywhere near a microphone to tell jokes on stage.

Rose Leadem - Entrepreneur Staff \nNeed a quick mental boost? Be a jerk. At least, that\u2019s what one group of researchers has discovered. \nAccording to a recent study published in the Academy of Management Journal , when bosses bully or belittle their employees, they experience short-lived benefits such as improved well-being and replenished energy. \nRelated: The 6 Most Familiar 'Bad Boss' Types and What to Do About Them \nWhile research has repeatedly revealed the repercussions of abusive supervision, some bosses continue to act like jerks. So, there must be some benefits from abusive actions. To understand what these benefits are, researchers studied and collected data from employees and managers in a variety of industries, including manufacturing, education and service, in both China and the U.S. \nTurns out, managers who bullied and took out their frustrations on workers experienced a \u201csense of recovery\u201d because their abusive actions replenished their mental energy and resources. When managers -- or people, in general -- hold in their feelings and suppress certain behaviors, it takes a lot of mental energy, which leads to \u201cmental fatigue,\u201d says Russell Johnson, an associate professor at Michigan State University who co-authored the study, in a summary of the findings. \nRelated: Do You Have a Bad Boss? Here's What to Look For. (Infographic) \nTo the contrary, when bosses act on impulse, bullying and belittling employees, they save the mental energy they would have otherwise used to suppress their aggravation. However, don\u2019t let this fool you: This mental recovery period won\u2019t last long. According to the study, the benefits last for a week -- or less -- and that kind of behavior can have some serious side effects in the long-run. \n\u201cAlthough abuse may be helpful and even mentally restorative for supervisors in the short-term, over the long haul it will come back to haunt them,\u201d Johnson says. Abusive behavior can put a company and its culture at risk, potentially resulting in decreased trust, support and productivity from employees. It may even lead employees to quit. \nRather than taking your frustrations out on your employees, the researchers suggest that supervisors minimize their workloads and take breaks regularly to cool down. They also advise communicating more with employees as a healthy, social outlet for negative emotions.

And don't check your smartphone during a conversation By Jayson Demers | Oct 9, 2017 Shares Share Shutterstock \nThe millennial generation has faced a great deal of criticism, and in some cases, scorn from older generations. We millennials -- yes, I'm one of them -- are seen as selfish, entitled and demanding, not to mention addicted to technology. \n\nAre these stereotypes true? Certainly not for all millennials. But there are certain tendencies and habits that are associated with the millennial generation more than any other generation -- and they run both positive and negative. Here, let\u2019s focus on the negatives, setting aside the fact that you can\u2019t categorize an entire generation, and behavioral traits and stereotypes can\u2019t be empirically proven to exist. Instead, let\u2019s focus on the bad workplace habits that the older generations perceive millennials to have, and work on eliminating them. \nRegardless of how much of a stereotypical millennial you believe yourself to be, you\u2019ll make a better impression in your new work environment if you avoid these common bad habits: \n\n1. Making demands instead of requests \nMillennials do have a habit of making demands, and setting more rigid requirements for their workplaces. On some level, this is good; too many modern workers are afraid to voice their opinions, and would rather keep their heads down than verbally address something wrong with the organizations. \nHowever, when voicing your opinion, turn your demands into requests. Making a request of your employer shows more respect and subordination than making a demand, which is especially important if you\u2019re new to the organization. The more experience you earn, the more demanding you can afford to be, but start out by making requests instead. \n\n2. Exhibiting overconfidence \nConfidence is good, but overconfidence can ruin your reputation if it\u2019s perceived as arrogance. Millennials tend to overestimate their abilities and knowledge in the workplace, which is especially irritating to people from the older generations who have spent far more years on the job. \n\nRecognize that your superiors have been at this job longer than you have, and don\u2019t be afraid to exhibit confidence -- as long as you keep that confidence reasonably in check. It\u2019s better to perform well with a sense of humility than to boast about your abilities and fail to meet expectations. Just as happens with demands, you can demonstrate more confidence over time as your accomplishments start to speak for themselves. \n\n3. Relying only on certain forms of communication \nMost millennials prefer text-based forms of communication over voice-based forms. They\u2019re more comfortable with mediums like SMS text and email because they\u2019ve grown up with these formats, and recognize the fact that they give you more time to put your thoughts together (not to mention leaving a paper trail). ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \nHowever, it\u2019s important to recognize that not everyone prefers to communicate this way -- and that there are advantages to making a phone call rather than emailing. Showcase a degree of flexibility in the way you communicate, and you can eliminate this bad habit altogether. \n\n4. Talking more than listening \nThis is a bad habit for any generation, not just millennials; but for millennials, it\u2019s far more damning. Because millennials are seen as self-centered and overconfident, talking too much can be seen as an exacerbation of these qualities (even if it\u2019s just a result of this individual's extroverted personality). \n\nInstead, make a conscious effort to speak less and listen more, especially when you\u2019re in the company of someone more experienced or more authoritative than you are. You\u2019ll end up making a better impression, and more importantly, you\u2019ll learn more in the process. \n\n5. Assuming a certain behavior or action is okay \nOffice environments are becoming more relaxed. Work schedules are becoming more flexible, etiquette is becoming looser and dress codes are increasingly casual. These trends are facilitated by increasing technological sophistication and decreasing reliance on old-school business tropes. However, this isn\u2019t a free license to show up at the office whenever you want, wearing whatever you want. \nIn fact, doing so could mark you as both overconfident and disrespectful. Don\u2019t just assume a certain action or behavior is okay. If you\u2019re even slightly in doubt, ask someone. \n\n6. Multitasking \nMillennials grew up with technology that provided instantaneous information on demand. They work fast and think fast, which makes them highly productive and ingenious. Unfortunately, this high pace also lures them into the multitasking trap, tempting them to try to accomplish many things simultaneously in a bid to work as fast as possible. \n\nAs more people are beginning to realize, multitasking is ineffective, and engaging in multitasking could weaken your performance in multiple areas. \n\n7. Staying plugged in \nAgain, thanks to our natural history with technological devices, we millennials tend to be more reliant on them than our older-generation counterparts. There\u2019s a perception that weare addicted to technology, so if you're young and want to combat this stereotype and improve your reputation in the process, avoid staying \u201cplugged in\u201d for too long. \n\nWalk away from the computer every once in a while. Leave your tablet behind for that important meeting. Above all, don\u2019t check your smartphone when you\u2019re having a conversation. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n\nThe truth is, there are some differences that set millennials apart from other generations. This doesn\u2019t mean millennials are bad workers or good workers -- it just means they work differently. Acknowledging those differences, and compensating for them when they create workplace dissonance, can help you better adjust to your job, and make a better impression with the people in charge. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T19:16:37.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1fc10ed4a38266a4f4235eb76d52ce462e9fd5ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0tDFO.jeT5wyX7dAMmNp1hj", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur: Latest Articles", "title": "How to Outsource Your Way to a $10-Million Business", "title_full": "How to Outsource Your Way to a $10-Million Business", "published": "2017-10-05T19:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20160525134144-business-team-training-listening-meeting-speaker-leadership-teamwork.jpeg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 159, "comments": 0, "shares": 159}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 71}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1fc10ed4a38266a4f4235eb76d52ce462e9fd5ae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0tDFO.jeT5wyX7dAMmNp1hj", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Mitch Russo", "published": "2017-10-05T19:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "How to Outsource Your Way to a $10-Million Business", "text": "How to Outsource Your Way to a $10-Million Business Steal this strategy from Microsoft, Salesforce and Intuit.

That's what I discovered the hard way when I accidentally stumbled upon a way to rapidly grow cash flow while simultaneously decreasing costs, and I want to show you how you can, too. \nRelated: 9 Steps to Increase the Value of Your Business \nIn 1985, I had co-founded Timeslips Corp and within five years it had become one of the largest time tracking software companies at the time. We were doing so well that our success was starting to strangle us. Our client base was growing faster than our tech support center could support, and the rising costs of meeting our tech support demands required a continual influx of new customers that yet again swamped our already overtaxed tech support department. \nIt was then that I had an epiphany that changed not only the direction of our company but created a new profitability paradigm that other companies similarly drowning in their own success could leverage to grow their businesses exponentially. And it is the same paradigm that contributes to the success of companies such as Microsoft , Intuit and Salesforce . \nThe key is to educate and mobilize the top 2 percent to 5 percent of your customer base with high-level skills and then send them out into the world with your guidance to build their own small consulting company around your product. \nRelated: 7 Things to Outsource Immediately to Scale Your Business \nRather than do what most coach certification programs do, which is sell a training program and a certificate, set your top clients up in an actual business, providing them the training they need, the support of a community and most importantly, with active leads they're nearly guaranteed to close on. \nFor example, let's say you have a software company. You train your top customers to become certified consultants, who act like a service community to your client base. Your certified customers service your client base in custom installing, training and consulting on your software. And you can reactivate dead prospects with the offer of live assistance. \nThere are three key components you must set in place for this to work. First of all, you must provide the lead flow to your consultants. Second, and most important, you must provide a community designed to foster relationships between your certified consultants and the company itself. The culture of the community is designed to ensure that everybody gets what he or she needs from the community and from the company. Third, you must train your consultants in total mastery of your product or service. Tony Robbins showed me how while I assisted building his own virtual training environment. \nRelated: How to Grow Your Sales with These Top 5 Outsourcing-Sales Companies Your top 5 percent \nYou will need at least 200 customers to begin with, preferably more, so that your top 5 percent of your customers amounts to between 10 and 20. You must train these 10 to 20 clients on three crucial pieces -- on the product or service, on implementation and how to get others to implement, and on how to perform as professional consultants or coaches. This top 5 percent, in turn, pays you for the privilege of becoming certified and can be deputized to sell your product or service on commission. You ensure the success of this first cohort and they not only become your testimonials, but they become your community mentors. The culture \nThe culture is arguably the most overlooked component of your successful certification program. Without a carefully constructed culture, there will be infighting, arguing and jockeying for position that will cause resentment in others and disharmony in the group as a whole. Having done this for over 20 years, I have created a 38-point culture code which provides guidelines for every potential situation that could possibly come up in a culture of this sort. \nRelated: 5 Ways to Effectively Optimize Your Business Operations The training \nThe final ingredient in implementing a successful certification program is that your certified consultants obtain 100 percent comprehension of the material. If your certified consultants come out only 90 percent educated then there's going to be disastrous results in the fields. You can and you must use the tools of education to ensure that your certified consultants know 100 percent of the material on which they will be consulting. How to get started \nTo begin creating a certification program, first identify the top 5 percent of your client base. Second, ensure that what you do is duplicable. You need to be able to codify your entire process to be able to train and hand off to others. Most everything can be codified. Even the virtuoso pianist who plays with incredible ease and talent wasn't born that way. She went through a series of very structured steps to get to where she is. Those steps, all those years of piano lessons and exercises, can be codified. And, once your process is codified, you can hand it off to others. \nAs you train consultants, provide them with leads and focus on maintaining a healthy and viable culture, your consultants, in turn, become a sales channel that continues to bring in new customers that get serviced by your own vetted and highly trained customers. Your business that was once drowning in its own success, is no longer desperately seeking new customers, but making money by selling certification and renewals to an active customer base that brings in new customers for you. \nThis is exactly what InfusionSoft , Intuit, Microsoft and Salesforce do, and you can, too.

Forty-seven percent of employees are considered part of the sandwich generation, the segment of adults ages 40 to 59 with a minor child and a parent over age 65. Millennials now make up the largest demographic in the workforce and are starting families of their own. \nUnfortunately, for those in the workforce, many employee benefits plans haven't kept pace with these changing family dynamics. Employees with family caregiving needs often lack the financial safety net or ability to take time away from work. \nEmployees who need to take time away from work to provide care for loved ones often do so by piecing together paid time off, sick leave and short-term disability benefits. Without any federal program to support these workers, employers, individual states and some municipalities are starting to take matters into their own hands. A recent survey conducted by the Disability Management Employer Coalition (DMEC) and The Standard found that 32 percent of employers currently offer a paid family leave program. \nRelated: 4 Tips for a Stronger Employee Benefits Program in a Multigenerational Workplace \nCompanies recognized as early adopters in paid family leave and paid parental leave know that work-life balance is a key factor in employee recruitment and retention efforts. If you are considering whether a paid family leave program is right for your company, here are four questions to consider. How would a paid family leave program benefit our organization? \nAlthough it may seem counterintuitive to create a program for employees to take time away from work, paid family leave programs often boost employee productivity. Paid family leave policies demonstrate an organization's commitment to its employees and can help increase employees' overall engagement, morale and productivity. This can help a company stay competitive in today's tight talent market. What are the differences between a paid family leave and paid parental leave program? \nThese programs may sound similar, but there are unique differences between the two types. Paid family leave programs generally provide leave for: Bonding time with a newborn or newly adopted child Caring for a family member (typically a parent, spouse or child) with a serious health condition Relieving family pressures when a family member is called to active military service An employee's own serious illness \nA paid parental leave program only provides time for both men and women to bond with a newborn or newly adopted child. Of employers surveyed by DMEC and The Standard, 32 percent said they offer a paid family leave program, while 34 percent said they provide paid parental leave benefits. \nRelated: How to Create a Family Leave Policy That Works Is my state implementing legislation? \nWhile federal legislation has been proposed in the Senate, only five states (New Jersey, California, Rhode Island, New York and Washington) and the District of Columbia have passed or implemented statewide paid family leave benefits to date. Sixteen other states across the country have proposed legislation within the last year. \nIf you're in one of the states that currently doesn't have any paid family leave legislation passed, it's important to stay informed on the status of your state's legislation, as it may impact or change the design of your program. What if my organization has locations in multiple states? \nMultistate employers can be impacted by legislation even if you aren't located in a state with a mandatory paid family leave program. That's because you may be required to offer coverage to employees who reside in a state that does have a leave law. \nRelated: Businesses Shouldn't Underestimate the Real Benefits of Parental Leave \nFor example, New York's paid family leave program will be effective Jan. 1, 2018. The program requires private employers with New York-based employees that provide disability benefits coverage to also provide paid family leave coverage. This mandate also applies to employers that are not based in New York but have remote employees based in the state who are eligible for disability benefits. \nIf that weren't enough, the state-based programs that have been passed differ from state to state. It is important for employers to be aware of state and local regulations and consider how the programs, funding amounts and employee deductions differ between states. A 21st-century program \nThe battle among organizations for top talent is heating up, and many employers are considering paid family leave programs as a way to stay relevant and competitive. Evaluating if a proactive paid family leave program is right for your organization is one way to make sure your organization stands out from the rest.

Image credit: Panom | Shutterstock.com \nIf you think an awards dinner or a plaque is the best way to recognize your creative employees, well, maybe you\u2019re trying to be too creative in your approach. \nTurns out, monetary rewards are the best way to promote creative work. Shocked? It\u2019s true. While we often stereotype artists, musicians, designers and other creatives as people focused on fame and recognition, that thinking is far-off. Like the rest of us, these people are just as motivated by money. \nRelated: 4 Ways Employee Incentives Can Drive Engagement and Retention \nA recent study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that rewarding people for their imaginative, creative and original works through social recognition doesn\u2019t enhance creativity. Instead, cash rewards are more motivating to these creatives. \n\u201cThe general consensus in the research literature on creativity is that money hurts creativity,\u201d said Ravi Mehta, a University of Illinois professor who co-authored the study. He and his colleagues sought exceptions to this thinking. \u201cWhat is it about the contingency of rewards that impacts creativity, and would adults respond to all types of creativity-contingent rewards the same way?\u201d \nRelated: 5 Ways to Improve Your Entrepreneurial Creativity \nTo answer these questions, Mehta and other study co-authors conducted a series of five experiments examining the impacts that monetary and social recognition have on a person\u2019s creative performance. They found that money made people more creative, inducing a \u201cperformance focus\u201d which motivated people to be more original and inventive. Social recognition induced a \u201cnormative focus,\u201d which deterred creativity. \nIn other words, a desire to please others can stifle creative thinking. \u201cSocial recognition reward kills creativity, because it makes creators more risk-averse,\u201d Mehta said. \u201cIt appeals to conformity, to not standing out.\u201d Because people fear that being too radical and out-there will cause their peers to judge them, social recognition influences them to abide by social norms. \nRelated: You Can Boost Your Creativity by Imagining You're Someone Else \nWhile social recognition may result in a creative person getting more exposure for their work, Mehta points out that, \u201cPeople who value creativity value the bizarre, the stuff that\u2019s out there. Therefore, they\u2019re less likely to care about the approval of others, or a sense of belonging with their peers.\u201d That\u2019s why, when you offer a monetary reward rather than a social one, people are more motivated to outperform others and find ways to be original.

Murray Newlands - VIP Contributor \nYouTube started very small; in the beginning, it was not a big audience who visited YouTube and shared videos. Today, you can find everything on YouTube, from superstar music videos and celebrity gossip to videos showing you exactly how to set up your new stereo system. \nRelated: Here's How You Can Actually Make Money With YouTube \nCreative people of all types -- soon to be dubbed influencers -- found YouTube to be a new medium to reach a worldwide audience. YouTube continues to be a booming media mecca where everyone, including influencers, can share ideas, create art of all kinds and, of course, make money. \nWhile the number of viewers fluctuates and each influencer has his or her own widely varied story, it is possible to make serious money on YouTube. Of course, there are also bigger opportunities, such as being an influencer of a specific brand and recommending its product. \nTo get his take on how you can become a YouTube influencer, I spoke to Bart Baker: entertainer, web-based comedian, video producer, singer and parody artist. Best known for making parody videos of notable songs for his 9.6 million subscribers, Baker's channel is the perfect example of what is possible on YouTube. \nHow did you become famous and build a brand on YouTube? \nI started my channel in my backyard with a simple green screen. I went to film school, so I knew how and what I was doing, and wrote and filmed everything by myself. I was wearing latex bodysuits in my backyard, and my parents thought that I was crazy. Surprisingly, it started to work. I got views of my videos and found out that parody videos are a great way to garner a crazy amount of views through SEO. \nRelated: Here Are the Best Months, Days and Times to Publish YouTube Videos \nPeople already love music and comedy videos -- they are the two biggest things on YouTube -- and my videos are a combination of both. Put that together with SEO, and when you are searching for the new Taylor Swift video, you find mine, and that was the winning combination. \nI started off doing it differently: I dressed up 90-year-old men in the videos because I needed something that would stand out. Once that started to do well, I put myself in the videos and established my face as the brand, and it really took off. The videos turned into almost musicals with a beginning, middle and end, and they're twisty, so people stay. \nHow did you turn that from entertaining people to making money? \nWell, obviously, the No. 1 thing on YouTube is that you make money from the ads; you need to have a crap load of views to make a good amount of money on YouTube, especially right now, with the new ad apocalypse thing still going on. But, AdSense is the first thing you're going to start making money from on YouTube. Brand deals are big, but that comes when you get more established, I'd say. \nAlso, there are a ton of revenue outlets I use, like Merch by Amazon, and I sell all of the songs on iTunes. There are so many ways you can go about it, so it just depends on how crazy you want to get. \nRelated: 7 Tips for Entrepreneurs Looking to Build Their Brands on YouTube \nIf someone was starting out, what tips would you give them to get going? \nFirst, figure out exactly what you want to do and stick to it. You have to be consistent with that or else people will not know what the channel is about. \nThen, once you have that figured out, find every single website and blog that would feature your content, potentially. When you don't have any subscribers, It is near impossible for people to find you, especially now. Back then it was a little bit easier, but now every single person wants to be on YouTube. \nWhen you email your content to the right people, and if they start featuring that content, you're going to get the views from the embeds, and the videos will start to show up more on YouTube as suggested and recommended. That will help you build your subscriber base up. So, the best thing you can do is to spend time and invest in finding the right people to email your websites. \nRelated: Hannah Hart Shares the Secrets That Led Her to Go From Working Part Time to Running a YouTube Empire \nNow that you are successful, what are your future plans? \nYouTube is still my main focus, as it's really what has built my brand to where it is. I'm never going to step away from that. But, my main goal in the next few months is branching into more traditional stuff like television and movies. I want to sink my hands into every aspect of the entertainment business and really just develop a household name brand. \nIf people want to find you, how can they do that? \nOn every single platform you can find me as Bart Baker.

Shawn Pfunder - Guest Writer \nThe entrepreneurs on ABC's Funderdome are some of the most passionate, creative folks out there. I should know -- as part of my job at GoDaddy, I got to spend a few weeks with them while they were filming and competing against each other for funding. Thirteen inventors pitched their ideas to a studio audience, who voted on their favorites to provide a round of seed funding. \nRelated: 10 Simple Things Successful People Do Every Morning (Infographic) \nYou might think that passion, cash and an appearance on network television are all it takes to break through and turn your project into a successful business. But, it's not that simple. The entrepreneurs on Funderdome haven't become overnight success stories; for many of them, the real work is just beginning. It takes grit. \nFor example, Mark Kirkland's Candwich, a portable sandwich packaged in a can, sat on shelves at Walmart stores across the country before his business went belly up after legal issues brought on by a duplicitous investor. \"Walmart went crazy for it. But, I needed money to produce, because it wasn't like Walmart said, 'Here's an order for 10 million cans.' I had investors, but the legal problems scared people away. It was a huge missed opportunity,\" said Kirkland. \nEven when you think you've made it, there's always the potential for setbacks -- entrepreneurship isn't for those that give up easily. After his legal issues slowed things down, Kirkland picked himself up and tried again, relaunching Candwich with a crowdfunding campaign. Kirkland credits his tenacity with helping him push through obstacles: \"I'm resilient. I believe in my product. And I don't quit.\" \nRelated: 7 Steps to Developing the Habits of Success Tap into your network. \nBut, as the inventors of Funderdome roll up their sleeves and work on building their businesses, what else will help them succeed? Often, it's not what you know, but who you know. \nThe encouragement and support of family and friends is essential to anyone starting a business . But, more than that, our social networks and communities can bring big opportunities our way. \nTake Sherry Latham of Pound Poms: After searching for a trustworthy and capable manufacturer for years, Latham had begun manufacturing her own product in her garage. While she maintained the level of quality that she wanted, adding \"manufacturer\" to the long list of roles she'd already taken on as an entrepreneur meant she was spreading herself too thin. \nThen Latham met Grace Chang, founder of Soarigami, at an early Funderdome taping. Latham and Chang hit it off immediately, chatting and trading stories about running their own businesses. Not long after meeting, Chang and Latham had a conversation about manufacturing. \"Grace couldn't believe I didn't have a manufacturer, and connected me with her manufacturer right away,\" said Latham. Since handing assembly of the products over to someone else, Latham has been able to focus her attention on other aspects of the business -- and all because of a chance meeting and friendship with Chang. \nRelated: If You Want to Be Successful, You Need to Sweat the Small Stuff The hustle never stops. \nAs an entrepreneur, you can expect to think about your business day and night. But, are you ready to put that time in after your day job? \nMany of the small-business owners on Funderdome have kept their full-time jobs and work on their business during their free time. For instance, Shane Vermette invented Right Shears, a pair of ergonomically friendly scissors. For two years, Vermette spent nights and weekends working on Right Shears, while he spent his days working as a software engineer at a large corporation. \nThese entrepreneurs don't start their businesses as a way to get rich quick. They have what I call \"the artist's drive\" -- they have an idea, and can't imagine not executing it. Money isn't what motivates them to start their business -- it's the unassailable urge to bring their idea to life. And because they've kept their day job and aren't relying on their idea to support them, they have more runway to develop and grow their side hustle into a thriving business of its own. \nI learned a ton while hanging out on the Funderdome set for a few weeks. More than ever, I believe that each of us has an entrepreneur somewhere inside of us, and that with determination, community and a plan, we have the power to share our ideas with the world -- whatever those ideas may be.

Buy your ticket here \u00bb \nEveryone who works in digital advertising -- especially those with a focus on social media and influencer marketing -- knows there is a fierce battle going on between Snap Inc. (Snapchat) and Instagram. As the CEO of an influencer marketing company, I can tell you Instagram is winning that battle in a big way. \nInstagram stories launched in August of 2017 and their brands are already leveraging these stories far more than Snapchat stories. Of the campaigns we\u2019ve run here at Open Influence in 2017, we have found 22 percent leveraged Instagram stories compared to just five percent that leveraged Snapchat stories. \nRelated: Six Proven Ways to Empower Your Brand's Instagram Marketing \nThere are many reasons for Instagram\u2019s dominance from an influencer marketing perspective, but let\u2019s start with the fact that Instagram markets itself as a social platform while Snap Inc. describes itself as a \u201ccamera company.\u201d \nConsidering Snapchat itself is a social platform designed around ephemeral communication between users, it seems odd for Snap Inc. to brand itself as a camera company. That positioning doesn\u2019t signal to the market that social media marketing is a priority for the company. \nThat said, this battle is far from over. There are many ways for Snap to close the gap and better compete with Instagram in the world of influencer marketing. Here are three things Snap should do today: 1. Prioritize building a community to win back influencers . \nSnapchat has focused primarily on facilitating communication between users that already know each other. They are essentially neglecting influencers engaging with their platform in the process. In July of this year, Snapchat finally unveiled a few features designed to appease influencers, most notably, Paperclip. \nThis feature allows users to link to external websites in their Snapchat videos. This enables influencers to link-out to brand websites. It is this branded website traffic that demonstrates the value of their influence to advertisers. \nThis is a solid step for Snapchat. Score one for Snapchat since Instagram currently only allows verified accounts (brands and celebrities) to add links in their Instagram stories -- but it must do more. \nRelated: 11 Common Mistakes You're Making With Influencer \nAdditionally, Snapchat needs to give social influencers a little TLC. Unlike A-list celebrities, many influencers\u2019 livelihood depends on their ability to capitalize on their social followings, and posting on each platform is a full-time job. These small businesses or influencers aren\u2019t getting paid by advertisers with no expectation of returns. \nTreating them well and making it easier for them to make a living goes a long way to building loyality among the influencers. To start, Snapchat needs to offer better audience analytics tools, link attribution and verifiable metrics that they can share with potential brand partners. \nFor example, Snapchat could offer custom filters, audience demographics data, or early access to new features. Building a real community of influencers is like growing a garden, it requires a lot of care and attention. 2. Eliminate friction in the user experience. \nSnapchat needs to enhance its discovery capabilities. Currently, there is no way to search for other users within the app itself. That\u2019s a big problem for influencers who have now been forced to promote their Snapchat presence on other social networks -- especially Instagram. \nSnapchat has basically been relying on other social networks to grow its user base. This might not have been a huge issue for Snapchat when its functionality was unique enough for consumers to regularly use it along with other social networks. \nRelated: Delight Your Customers by Being Effortless \nNow, with Instagram (and other Facebook-owned platforms) continuing to replicate Snapchat\u2019s most popular features, it has certainly become a problem. \nSnapchat needs to simplify the user experience. As a millennial that has followed Snapchat since day one, many people -- including myself -- were initially drawn to Snap because of its simplicity. It was an app that allowed you to send photos to your friends -- then that photo would disappear after they viewed them. \nAdding the video function was cool, and the filters are fun, but some of Snapchat\u2019s more recent moves seem too far removed from the app\u2019s core purpose. I\u2019m going to Snapchat to send funny photos and videos to my friends -- not looking for the Daily Mail to pop up in my \u201cdiscover\u201d section. \nI would really rather not be notified that Kim Kardashian went to the beach today. Instead, I might want to follow Kim Kardashian -- and in that case, there should be an easy way for me to find her, and any other celebrity or influencer I\u2019m interested in. 3. Snapchat advertisers are flocking to Instagram . \nTo win back the trust of the advertisers, Snapchat absolutely needs to collect more data about its users. If there is one company that has nailed this, it\u2019s Facebook, and you\u2019d better believe Instagram benefits from that information. \nRelated: How to Win Back Lost Customers \nSnapchat needs to find better ways to collect user data on the backend. They should also consider third-party partnerships that would enhance its ability to gather the data and add it in a user friendly fashion. \nOnce Snapchat gets its data game up to par, it should focus on winning over direct response advertisers. Direct advertisers are the guys that will spend millions after seeing any kind of instant return. \nRelated: Six Illusions Execs Have About Big Data \nIt doesn\u2019t really matter how big or small, the direct advertisers just need some type of instant gratification. From there, Snapchat should adjust pricing and user acquisition funnels until it has the perfect mouse trap for these direct response advertisers. \nNext, it needs to build an arsenal of case studies around sales and brand lift. It should create case studies for virtually every brand category that demonstrate clear value in terms of awareness as well as conversions. \nInfluencers aren\u2019t going to bend over backwards to convince brands to spend money on Snapchat. It will clearly be up to Snapchat to prove to advertisers that it's a platform that is a valuable channel for engaging with consumers. \nRelated: Engage With Your Customers and Find Out Their Needs \nBumbling as it is, Snapchat isn\u2019t out for the count from an influencer marketing perspective. Influencers continue using both platforms. Whether Snapchat regains lost influencer marketing dollars is entirely up to the company itself. \nIf Snapchat takes action today to cozy up to influencers, simplify the user experience and win back the trust of advertisers, Snapchat will find itself closing in on Instagram and possibly start surpassing it before we know it.

Cannabis is a legal multi-billion dollar industry, yet someone in America is arrested every 48 seconds for a marijuana related crime. dispensaries.com - Guest Writer \nThough marijuana is now legal in 29 states for either medical or recreational use, the number of arrests involving marijuana have actually increased across the country. \nThose numbers come from the Uniformed Crime Report compiled by the FBI from data sent to the agency from law enforcement operations around the country. The information covers arrests for all of 2016. \nThe number of people arrested on marijuana-related charges jumped 12 percent from 2015 to 2016, with 75,000 more people arrested. Overall, the number of drug-related arrests reached 1.57 million, about 5.6 percent higher than in 2015. \nIt would seem endless movies and television shows about the futility of the War on Drugs -- not to mention surveys showing Americans are ready to end it -- have had little effect on law enforcement itself. \nRelated: Survey: A Quarter of Cancer Patients Use Legal Medical Marijuana Controversial Numbers \nThe FBI typically releases arrest numbers in the annual report broken down by the drug involved. However, they did not do so for 2016. Reporters had to return to the FBI and ask for the specific numbers on marijuana. \nAccording to the Marijuana Policy Project , a pro-legalization group, the numbers were as follows: There were 653,249 arrests involving cannabis That\u2019s about one arrest involving marijuana every 48 seconds Marijuana arrests made up more than 41 percent of all drug busts in the U.S. in 2016 \nNo matter how you look at it, those are very strange numbers in a country where marijuana is legal in so many places. Shameful Waste \nMorgan Fox, communications director of the Marijuana Policy Project, said in a prepared statement that the arrest numbers show marijuana users \u201ccontinue to be treated like criminals across the country.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cThis is a shameful waste of resources and can create lifelong consequences for the people arrested.\u201d \nRelated: How Will Businesses Handle Legalized Marijuana in the Workplace? \nIt\u2019s already been reported that marijuana-related arrests in Washington D.C. tripled between 2015 and 2016. They are on pace so far in 2017 to have a similarly high number of arrests. Arrests numbers are also up in many states in the Deep South. \nThe cost to taxpayers for arresting and processing that many people through the legal system is in the billions, according to Newsweek. \nAll of this seemingly runs contradictory to public sentiment, not only on the War on Drugs but on marijuana. Support for marijuana legalization reached a new high in a survey released earlier this year by CBS News. \nAbout 61 percent of those surveyed in the poll think marijuana should be legal, while 71 percent opposed federal intervention in states that have made marijuana legal. \nTo stay up to date on the latest marijuana related news make sure to like dispensaries.com on Facebook Company ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T21:31:00.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "852b077a99b0db904717bf03939750549c319ca8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0uoaYytDu6NKpkg.66cfrKp", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/entrepreneur/latest?format=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur", "title": "The Joy of Now", "title_full": "The Joy of Now", "published": "2017-10-05T21:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20171004200923-GettyImages-743747439.jpeg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 620, "comments": 0, "shares": 620}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 83}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "852b077a99b0db904717bf03939750549c319ca8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0uoaYytDu6NKpkg.66cfrKp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Kim Walsh Phillips", "published": "2017-10-05T21:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "The Joy of Now", "text": "October 5, 2017 The Joy of Now Among the fruits of success is the freedom to live one's highest values without fear or constraint. Kim Walsh Phillips - VIP Contributor \nI was supposed to wait. But, I couldn't. I squeezed my husband's hand as we watched them open the envelope . . . . My mom's eyes grew wide and she started to cry a little. My dad was shocked and then he got teary. \n\"Oh, Kim. Oh honey. You didn't, did you?\" \nI went and hugged my parents and simply told them how much I loved them. \nWhat I was supposed to do was wait until the last night of our trip to tell them. But, I couldn't. I was too excited. (I never did have any patience.) I surprised my parents with a cruise in a double-decker, three-bedroom suite on an upcoming sailing trip. (This means we will have a butler, our meals personally prepared, private entrance and departure in all ports, just to name some of the luxury perks.) And we will visit Puerto Rico, where my parents first went on their honeymoon. Why did I give them this trip? \nBecause now I can , and getting to do things for and with my loved ones is one of the greatest blessings of my life. Of course, things weren't always this way . . . \nRelated: Taking Care of Your Loved Ones When Your Business Can't \nGrowing up, my parents instilled in me a love of travel, for which I will always be grateful. We didn't have a lot of money, so we took car trips (flashback to the station wagon with the rear/death-trap seat that always made me feel like throwing up) when we would stay on Army bases or in discount hotels. My mom would exhaust herself for days beforehand, making lunches and breakfasts to bring on the road to save money. \nWe would always have a great time (our favorite thing was the hotel pool!), but I know the stress it put on my folks. When they spent money on these extra adventures, it would cause anxiety and worry for them for some time after. They didn't have extra money. They didn't have peace about it. But, they took us anyway, because they are incredible parents who wanted us to be happy. On my own. \nWhen I was out of the house and starting my firm at 26, I found myself worse off than they were. I was broker than broke-is-broke broke. There was no chance of a vacation. In fact, I didn't travel, unless it was for work, for 10 years. Ten years. \nI could neither afford the money nor the time to do it. Either would set me even farther back in the deep, dark hole of debt I had dug for myself. I was being tormented by clients who didn't pay us much, staff who wanted to get paid, and an internal tension of wanting it all to somehow, someway get magically better. \nYears after the Army base family trips, I would discover direct response marketing , apply it to social media and create a way to generate leads and sales without a marketing budget. I began to grow my business and then scale the growth profitably. In short, I was digging out of the hole of debt and starting to make real money. And doing the same for our clients. \nRelated: Why Split Testing Is the Best Way to Prevent Wasting Marketing Money \nI started to get requests from companies around the world to do business with us. They were ready and willing to pay top dollar, which they did and still do. Now we pick and choose who we want to do business with. As in, I haven't answered an RFP in more than seven years. I don't chase prospects. I don't cold call. \nI work with those who come wanting to hire us and to pay us handsomely to get measurable results. It is rewarding to work with these businesses and to help them achieve their mission through profitable marketing. It pays well. \nBut, financial freedom doesn't just mean less stress about money. It means having the freedom to spend more time and do more things for those you love. Without fear. Without stress. Without worry. Just with a lot of love. \nWhat brings me the most joy now . . . isn't the house at the shore. It was surprising my kids after we bought it, after moving from place to place for the previous several years, that this was ours. We were staying. \nIt is not merely the ability to do more: It was the reaction of my husband when I surprised him with tickets to the Army-Navy game so that he and my dad can go and do their \"man bonding\" and relive their military years. \nIt is not simply tithing: It is being able to support outreach initiatives at my church so we can get creative when it comes to finding those seeking to let them know they are welcome just as they are. \nIt is not having employees: It is surprising my staff with in-office massages, gym memberships, beach retreats, and plenty of Veuve. Because, c'mon: Veuve . \nIt is not just getting time away: It is spending long vacations with my family, and bringing my parents along to see my kids who get to spend more time with their MeMaw and PopPop. It is watching them have joy, creating memories that will last forever. \nRelated: Lori Greiner on How Entrepreneurs Can Avoid Alienating Loved Ones \nHaving an agency that can produce profitable marketing for ourselves and others is my game changer.

If So, Here's Why You Need to Stop Remember that you don't fail just because other people succeed By Jess Ekstrom | Oct 8, 2017 Shares Share Thomas Barwick | Getty Images \nI never thought of myself as an entrepreneur. Growing up, I always wanted to be a journalist or work for a magazine. But, then one summer in college, I interned at a wish-granting organization for kids with life-threatening illnesses. A lot of them would lose their hair during chemotherapy and they'd be offered a wig or a hat. However, a lot of the kids I saw loved to wear headbands instead of covering up their heads. I started to research organizations that give headbands to kids with cancer and couldn't find any. \n\nAt that moment, I (unknowingly) became an entrepreneur, because I wanted to solve this problem. I didn't really think about all the hardships that come with starting a business and everything that could go wrong. I just knew that a lot of these kids wanted to wear headbands and no one recognized that, or even if they were, no one did anything about it. \n\nAt the end of my junior year in April 2012, I launched HeadbandsofHope.com . For every headband sold, one is given to a child with cancer. Today, we're carried in over 2,000 stores and we've been on the TODAY Show , Good Morning America , The View , Vanity Fair , Women's Health and People Magazine . Plus, I get to travel to speak all around the world. \n\nBut, my biggest accomplishment is donating headbands to every children's hospital in the United States. \n\nSome moments, I'm euphoric with the movement I've created and the impact it's had on so many kids. But, in other moments (too many that I'd like to admit), I feel an anxiety that I'm not doing enough. I think when you're trying to make a change and do something big, it's hard to ever be truly satisfied with where you are, because there's always more that could be done. \nLast year, I met an astronaut, and he said that no matter how great of a career he'll have as an astronaut, he'll never truly make a dent on the galaxy. On the outside, I thought just being an astronaut was a huge accomplishment in and of itself. But, to him, he sees not what he's done , but what's left to be done . I realized, even though he and I live in totally different worlds (pun intended) we're both struggling with the same tension of never being satisfied. \n\nOn one hand, I credit a lot of the success of my career to the mentality that I can always be doing more, because it's fueled a lot of my hustle. On the other hand, it's robbed me of a lot of the enjoyment and satisfaction of the process. And if I can't enjoy the life I've created, that's a big problem to me. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n\nI found a lot of this anxiety stemmed from comparison. When you're trying to do something big, you meet a lot of other people trying to create something cool too. I've loved being a part of a growing community of entrepreneurs, activists and people who are going for it, but it's so easy to hold a ruler between yourself and someone else. I compare what I'm doing with what they're doing and start to doubt myself. It's embarrassing to admit that, because on the inside, I truly want more people to take action, start businesses and hold a level of responsibility for the world's issues and inspire solutions. But, then there's this insecurity that creeps in that makes you think you're not measuring up to everyone else trying to make an impact. \n\nThose moments of doubt give me no room for creativity or innovation. My mind is too cluttered with doubt, and I have nothing else to give to my business or even my relationships. \n\nOn the outside it seems the bigger Headbands of Hope gets, the more successful I should feel. But, really the more it develops; it presents more opportunity for me to develop with it. And each day I get closer to finding a balance of hustle for where I want to be and happiness for where I'm at now. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T21:34:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dce94510203f688c2ea4e742576f366edb24ddd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0tDFO.jeT5wyYNMFd0qrexT", "site_full": "www.entrepreneur.com", "site": "entrepreneur.com", "site_section": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Entrepreneur: Latest Articles", "title": "Top Workplace Issues for 2018 and How to Overcome Them", "title_full": "Top Workplace Issues for 2018 and How to Overcome Them", "published": "2017-10-05T22:30:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://assets.entrepreneur.com/content/3x2/1300/20170915183508-shutterstock-547750414.jpeg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 1160, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 77, "comments": 0, "shares": 77}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 116}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dce94510203f688c2ea4e742576f366edb24ddd4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRVXVaXCoGUyDy7UDyEKwbj76.iD0LQE0tDFO.jeT5wyYNMFd0qrexT", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Karen Lachtanski", "published": "2017-10-05T22:30:00.000+03:00", "title": "Top Workplace Issues for 2018 and How to Overcome Them", "text": "Top Workplace Issues for 2018 and How to Overcome Them Workplace transformation affects how we work and impacts employees of all ages.

Buy your $99 tickets now \u00bb \nWith 2018 just around the corner, it\u2019s not too early to think about how the workplace is being transformed and the potential issues involved. Business owners need to know how to adapt, to ensure their organizations keep humming. After all, retaining employees and recruiting the right mix of talent offers employers many benefits. \nRelated: 5 Workplace Trends That Will Impact Your Business in 2017 \nHow has the workplace changed? The answer includes how we work, whom we work with and where we work. Factors like these impact employees of all ages and their happiness levels. \nThose levels aren't always what owners would like. Human resources company Robert Half U.K. surveyed more than 2,000 U.K. employees and found that one in six of the British workers polled who were over the age of 35 said they were unhappy at work; that was more than double the number for those under 35. While many factors come into play here, it\u2019s important to note that the changing workplace affects all workers. \nHere are a few workplace transformations that could have a big impact on your business: The gig economy \nThe gig economy refers to workers of all ages who are either remote or transitory or provide their services as a contractor or freelancer. This growing segment provides employers many benefits but also a host of new problems, if not handled efficiently. For example, how well is your office environment set up to handle internal and external collaboration? Do you have document repositories that can be easily (and securely) accessed by on-premise employees as well as by those working from home or in other offices? \nFor many small businesses, where a culture of community and family is natural and desirable, how can this extended workforce feel that same sense of community? You might consider that some of the time and money saved by employing remote or transitory employees be used to unite and foster good working relations. This could occur in the form of company off-sites or regular time set aside for team-building within departments, even if that's done remotely. \nWhen companies hire workers on a seasonal or project basis, bringing these employees up to speed quickly is an important aspect of the business\u2019s success. In an age where every brand can be represented in social media by any employee, the ability to train employees about your brand, rules of conduct and processes can be challenging. \nStephen J Gill , who helps companies with training and development plans, suggests that ethical behavior cannot be learned in a training course but is instead something supported by a company\u2019s culture. With a remote or transitory workforce, however, that company culture cannot be observed as closely. \nRelated: Workplace Revolution: Key Trends Changing How Work Is Getting Done in 2017 \nTo help employees with their observations, assess your company's onboarding tools and processes and evaluate how quickly new employees can get onto a path of training with appropriate checks and balances so that managers can ensure that no one gets lost in the cracks. The emphasis should not always be about the quantity of work completed but the manner in which it gets done. Digital efficiency (technology) \nWhile most organizations are making their customer-facing interactions digital, there remain employees who have only antiquated processes for handling a variety of paperwork, whether it be HR-related forms, invoices and expense reports or other paperwork related to their individual jobs. \nIn a recent U.S. study , 52 percent of employees ages 18 to 44 thought their companies had too many paper-based processes, which could be digitized. No one likes being bogged down in bureaucratic paperwork, as it takes away from the enjoyment and pride in the job. Take a look at the many repetitive paper-based processes that exist in your organization and work with employees and available technology to turn those processes into digital workflows. \nOther types of technology are finding their way into the workplace. Unilever, for example, is using artificial intelligence in its recruitment efforts, to engage with candidates through a series of games and tests. The point is to analyze keywords, body language and intonation to see if the candidates match the desired profile. Only upon passing this initial screening are candidates moved through to meet with hiring managers. The results are impressive . \nIn a similar way, virtual reality technology is being used in recruitment and to enhance conference calls . While technology for technology\u2019s sake can be counter-productive, investment in digital technologies that keep employees inspired can help your bottom line. Digital privacy \nOngoing data hacks and breaches at large companies have made us aware of risks associated with sharing our personal information. The Equifax breach has shown us that we often lack a choice as to where our information is shared. Yet, as employees, sharing our personal information is a must, to be considered for employment, and again during the hiring process and post-hiring paperwork. \nAs an employer, you may need to revisit your own personnel processes to ensure employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 expectations of security around their personal identifiable data. You want to be sure that data can be deleted if requested and that it complies with state and federal guidelines. In fact, according to a PwC survey , 92 percent of U.S. companies said they were paying attention to and adhering to the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) that will start being enforced -- with fines -- in May 2018 in Europe. While GDPR is a European Union regulation, it applies to any company doing business in Europe or with European citizens. \nWhile most companies realize the seriousness of protecting customer data, employee information should have the same protection. Review your hiring processes to ensure that a candidate's personal information is not shared with the hiring team, that information is stored securely and that procedures allow for the deletion of personal data, according to GDPR and local U.S. laws. The workplace is constantly changing. Happy employees make for healthier and more productive employees, so the benefits of accessing your workplace for 2018 will be well worth the effort.
