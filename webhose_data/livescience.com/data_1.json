The other half will go jointly to Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of Caltech. All three were founders of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which detected gravitational waves for the first time in 2015. Moving masses generate waves of gravitational radiation that stretch and squeeze space-time. See how gravitational waves work in this Space.com infographic . Credit: By Karl Tate, Infographics Artist \nAlbert Einstein had theorized that space-time can be stretched and compressed by collisions of massive objects in the universe. However, experimental proof for such events eluded scientists for 100 years. [ The 18 Biggest Unsolved Mysteries in Physics ] \nOn Sept. 14, 2015, LIGO's two extremely sensitive instruments in Washington state and Louisiana simultaneously observed a faint gravitational-wave signal. The ripples in space-time came from a pair of two massive black holes that spiraled into each other 1.3 billion years ago. \nIt took scientists such a long time to arrive at the discovery because gravitational waves \u2014 even though they come from violent, powerful collisions \u2014 are extremely small once they reach Earth. \nDuring the event detected in September 2015, scientists think that about three times the mass of the sun was transformed into gravitational waves in less than a second. [ How Gravitational Waves Work (Infographic) ] \nThe L-shaped LIGO detectors have two arms, each 2.48 miles (4 kilometers) long, with identical laser beams inside. If a gravitational wave passes through Earth, the laser in one arm of the detector will be compressed and the other will expand. But the changes are tiny \u2014 as tiny as one-thousandth of a diameter of a nucleon, said Walter Winkler, a physicist with the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany. \n\"You have first to keep all the distortions out and then to increase the sensitivity of the measurement system,\" Winkler, who has worked on gravitational wave detection since the 1970s, told Live Science. \"It took thousands of people to come to this. It's really a new sort of astronomy.\" \nThe Nobel Committee acknowledged that the discovery was a huge collaborative effort. The paper announcing the September 2015 detection had more than 1,000 authors. But, according to the Nobel rules, the prize can be shared by no more than three scientists. \n\"Without them the discovery would not have happened,\" Nils M\u00e5rtensson, the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said of the three winners during a news conference in Stockholm. \nScientists here at the German Physical Society (DPG) cheered the results. \n\"I had really hoped for it because it's a fantastic discovery,\" DPG President Rolf-Dieter Heuer told Live Science. He added that the detection of gravitational waves opens \"a window into an unseen world that will bring us more information in the future about the universe.\" \nThe findings might seem esoteric, but Heuer said that it's difficult to predict when and in which field this research could have practical applications. He noted that it took more than 40 years for the discovery of antimatter to be used in positron emission tomography, or PET, scans common in hospitals today. \nSome had expected the LIGO team to win the prize last year . But Gunnar Ingelman, Secretary of the Nobel Committee and a professor of subatomic physics at Uppsala University in Sweden, said the detection of gravitational waves was not eligible last year. According to the rules of the committee, the discovery has to be published the year before the awards are announced. (The LIGO detection was published in February 2016.) \nThe LIGO team has made several additional discoveries . Just last week, LIGO scientists announced they had detected gravitational waves for the fourth time, on Aug. 14, 2017. The ripples were also detected by another instrument called VIRGO, near Pisa, Italy. \n\"In the early days, it was not clear if these gravitational waves were real or could be observed,\" Ingelman told reporters here by video. \"It was an enormous effort to reach the sensitivity to build a detector which could actually observe such tiny, tiny distortions.\" \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Credit: Monika Wieland Shields/Shutterstock \nHuman women typically go through menopause between ages 45 and 55, when they undergo hormonal changes that cause them to stop being able to reproduce. But they're not the only ones in the animal kingdom who live beyond their reproductive years. \nScientists have long known that animals' fertility and reproductive success slowly decline with increasing age \u2014 a phenomenon called reproductive senescence . But, for the most part, reproduction in animals seems to continue up to old age and death, though at a diminished capacity. \nIn a recent review of primate species, researchers found that humans are the only primates that don't die within a few years of \"fertility cessation.\" And this is true even when modern medicine and health care are taken out of the equation, as the study included data from the hunter-gatherer !Kung tribe in the Kalahari Desert. \nIn the past couple of decades, however, numerous studies have claimed that menopause, or \"post-reproductive life spans\"\u2014 a phrase that most often refers to the age of last reproduction, since changes in ovulation and hormones related to menopause are difficult to measure in wild animal populations \u2014 occurs in a wide range of species. Guppies, for instance, appear to go through a fish version of menopause , according to one study, which found that the fish spend an average of 13.6 percent of their total life spans in a post-reproductive stage. \nIn fact, such \"menopause\" appears somewhat common among fish, birds, mammals and invertebrates (animals without backbones), according to a recent review on the topic published in July 2015 in the journal Trends in Ecology & Evolution . Yet, there's a major caveat to this statement: For the vast majority of species, the animals don't live long after they stop reproducing, and menopause appears to be a circumstance related to captivity (such as in the guppies) that occurs only in some individuals, not the entire species. \nBut there are exceptions. Among vertebrates, two species of toothed whales live long lives after menopause. Female killer whales reproduce between the ages of 12 and 40 years but can survive into their 90s, while female short-finned pilot whales reproduce between the ages of 7 and 35 and live past 60. \nAlso in this select group are some insects, such as the gall-forming social aphid Quadrartus yoshinomiyai , in which adult females have extended post-reproductive lives defending the colony. \nFrom an evolutionary standpoint, menopause is an apparent oddity, given that you'd expect individuals to want to pass on their genes for as long as possible. So why did it develop at all? \nThe most prevalent theory behind menopause is called the grandmother hypothesis. In short, it suggests females may stop breeding early to help their children and grandchildren survive and reproduce. This certainly appears true in orca populations, in which older females are repositories of ecological knowledge , especially when it comes to finding food \u2014 researchers found mothers increase the survival rate of their adult sons , which have better reproductive success the older they get. \nInterestingly, matriarch elephants are also vital in the community, but they don't go through menopause. \nThe difference here lies in how the groups are made up. Killer whales' sons and daughters stay in the groups in which they were born. So, over time, the mothers become increasingly related to their neighbors, providing a motive to shift from reproducing to helping their descendants, thus further enhancing their genetic legacy. In elephant society, on the other hand, sons leave the birth group , so mothers don't become any more related to their group mates as they age. \nAnother key aspect of this is competition for resources. \nResearch in orcas shows that when two generations of killer whales in the same group breed simultaneously, calves from the older generation of females are 1.7 times more likely to die . This is possibly because younger females are focused only on their calves, whereas the older females may raise their own children and those of their adult daughters. \nIn ancestral humans, daughters would move out to join new families. A daughter would initially have no relation to the group until she had children, but as she got older, she would become increasingly related to her group. Eventually, helping her relatives raise their children would become more genetically beneficial to her, especially since having more children would put her new kids in direct competition for resources with her other descendants. \n   ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "joseph castro", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monika wieland", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trends in ecology & evolution", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kalahari desert", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:34:42.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b899584cc64a2677c13d8383ff41f3a7afd35821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmaFgo6qWXIYeaCsUqzixyaWhl37yseeyem3wcxayzW8UN4IroOOg6fE5sC_L7i7gdQbHn2I1nL90O7Ridzvsc7g--", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?pz=1&cf=all&ned=us&hl=en&topic=m&output=rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Health - Google News", "title": "Should People Who Can't Quit Smoking Switch to E-Cigarettes? - Live Science", "title_full": "Should People Who Can't Quit Smoking Switch to E-Cigarettes? - Live Science", "published": "2017-10-03T19:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA5NS84NDcvb3JpZ2luYWwvZS1jaWctb3ItY2lnYXJldHRlLmpwZw==", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b899584cc64a2677c13d8383ff41f3a7afd35821", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmaFgo6qWXIYeaCsUqzixyaWhl37yseeyem3wcxayzW8UN4IroOOg6fE5sC_L7i7gdQbHn2I1nL90O7Ridzvsc7g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Should People Who Can't Quit Smoking Switch to E-Cigarettes? - Live Science", "text": "Should People Who Can't Quit Smoking Switch to E-Cigarettes? By Dan Robitzski, Staff Writer | October 3, 2017 12:10pm ET MORE Credit: Andrey_Popov/Shutterstock.com \nSwitching to e-cigarettes won't solve all the health problems smokers face. For example, e-cigarettes are still addictive, and studies suggest that they may be bad for heart health . But compared with traditional tobacco cigarettes \u2014 which, in addition to nicotine, are full of tar and other toxins \u2014 e-cigarettes could be a less-risky option, a new study suggests. \nUsing mathematical models, researchers calculated how two possible scenarios of cigarette and e-cigarette use \u2014 one optimistic scenario and one pessimistic scenario \u2014 could impact public health if Americans who smoked cigarettes switched to e-cigarettes over the next 10 years. \nThe researchers noted that the study had several limitations. For example, the models are based on smoking uptake and quitting rates through 2012, but they do not account for the recent growth in e-cigarette use. In addition, the models included only cigarettes and e-cigarettes, and excluded other tobacco products, such as smokeless tobacco, according to the study. [ 4 Myths About E-Cigarettes ] \nThe optimistic and pessimistic scenarios were based on a status-quo rate up to 2012 of smokers either quitting smoking altogether or switching to vaping. In the study's \"optimistic\" model, the researchers assumed that more people stopped smoking tobacco cigarettes (primarily switching to e-cigarettes) and that the current scientific understanding that e-cigs aren't quite as bad as cigarettes holds true. In that optimistic model, the researchers found that 6.6 million premature deaths could be avoided in the U.S., according to the study, which was published yesterday (Oct. 2) in the journal Tobacco Control . \nThough one of the study authors has worked with both Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, two manufacturers of smoking-cessation medications, this particular study was funded by the National Institutes of Health and did not receive any industry money, according to a statement . \nIn the study's \"pessimistic\" model, the researchers assumed that fewer people gave up smoking than are doing so under the current rate and that the health risks of e-cigarettes turned out to be worse than scientists' current understanding. In this case, only 1.6 million premature deaths were avoided. \nThe findings \"support a policy strategy that encourages replacing cigarette smoking with vaping to yield substantial life-year gains\" compared with cigarette smoking, lead researcher David Levy, an oncologist at Georgetown University Medical Center, said in a statement. In other words, switching from cigarettes to e-cigarettes could extend the lives of smokers, compared with if they were to continue smoking traditional tobacco cigarettes. [ 10 Tips to Help You Quit Smoking] \nIn addition to living longer than they would if they continued smoking tobacco cigarettes, those who switched to e-cigarettes might see other health benefits, \"including reduced disease disability to smokers, reduced pain and suffering, and reduced exposure to secondhand smoke ,\" Levy said. \n\"Even the gloomiest analysis [the pessimistic model] shows a significant gain in years of life if nicotine is obtained from vaping instead of much more deadly amounts of toxicants inhaled with cigarette smoke,\" Levy said. \nWriting in an editorial that was published alongside the new study, Marita Hefler, a public health researcher at Menzies School of Health Research in Australia, said that \"the health gains modelled [in the new study] show that even in a pessimistic scenario,\" rapidly phasing out regular cigarettes could result in significant public health gains. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

(The BMJ)\nSurgeons removed more than 100 pieces of metal of various shapes and sizes from the stomach of a man in France, according to a new report of the man's case.\nThe 52-year-old had psychosis \u2014 meaning he had lost touch with reality \u2014 and despite receiving treatment for the condition, he had a tendency to intentionally swallow metal items. These items ranged from nails, knives and screws to spoon handles, nuts and coins, according to the case report, published Sept. 27 in the journal BMJ Case Reports.\nThe man ingested the metal objects so frequently that over time, clumps of partially digested or nondigested material would clump together in his stomach in masses known as \"bezoars.\" These metal bezoars would become so large that they would block the pylorus, the opening connecting the stomach and the small intestine, preventing his stomach from emptying, according to the case report.\nMetal bezoars are one of the rarest forms of bezoar, according to the case report. Other types of bezoars include those formed by clumps of undigested milk (seen in infants), hair (in people who ingest hair, a condition known as trichophagia), plant material (from fruit and vegetable fibers) and pills.\nIn the man's case, he went to the emergency room five times over a five-year period, complaining of stomach pain, nausea and vomiting up blood. In four of these instances, doctors had to operate to remove a massive metal bezoar from his stomach. Surgery was necessary because removing the metals by endoscopy \u2014 a procedure in which a thin, flexible tube is inserted into the stomach from the mouth so that doctors can retrieve the swallowed object \u2014 didn't work, according to the case report.\nIt was surprising that the man needed surgery on four separate occasions to remove these objects, said Dr. Steven Moss, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at Warren Alpert School of Medicine of Brown University. Usually, when people swallow sharp metal objects, they can often be taken out safely by endoscopy, Moss said.\nMoss was not involved in this man's case, but he has treated people who have swallowed massive amounts of metal, and was the co-author of a 2010 paper in the journal Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology on people who intentionally swallow objects not meant to be swallowed.\nMoss said he wondered if some of the man's operations could have been prevented, because surgery to remove these items is not normally the treatment of choice.\nIntentionally swallowing objects But there was one instance in the French man's case where surgery was necessary, Moss said.\nDuring the man's most recent visit to the emergency room, in December 2016, scans of the man's abdomen revealed that the metal objects had made a hole in his stomach, according to the report.\nMore on this... Here's a giant list of the strangest medical cases we've covered Good food gone bad 7 weirdest medical conditions This means that, essentially, the stomach has burst, and surgery is the only option to retrieve the swallowed objects, Moss told Live Science.\nIt may seem unusual that sharp items, such as a swallowed razor blade, could come into contact with the stomach and not cause holes all the time, Moss said. But the stomach has thick walls, and when cuts or scratches happen, the body can be amazingly resilient and heal, he said.\nAlthough the sheer quantity of metal swallowed by the man in this case was \"impressive\" and \"more than normal,\" Moss said he has retrieved metal objects ranging from bed springs and batteries to bits of CDs and hundreds of coins.\nAnother intriguing question is why people would deliberately and repeatedly swallow such large quantities of metals or other objects in the first place.\n\"No one really quite understands it,\" Moss said. This behavior is more commonly seen in people with psychiatric conditions and in prisoners who are seeking medical attention, he said.\nThere are two groups of psychiatric patients who may exhibit this strange behavior.\nOne group is people with psychosis, who may say they are hearing voices inside their head telling them to swallow these objects, Moss said. A bigger group is people who swallow these unusual items as a form of self-injury, as a way to relieve tension and an urge to harm themselves, he said.\nBoth groups can be very resistant to psychiatric treatment, Moss said. People who repeatedly swallow unusual objects will often do it again, even if these behaviors cause them pain and medical problems, and even if they are treated with the appropriate medications, he said.\nOriginally published on Live Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "cari nierenberg", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "moss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steven moss", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bmj case reports", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warren alpert school of medicine of brown university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:27:22.012+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f987b5237b532baa65e269f0367f06619b82ed4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmUuZo1rJaiv0YjZ0fsy5E7nvzjoDkRSvs5FcDrclUaNEPxMJP3llh1Q--", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://www.livescience.com/home/feed/site.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Live Science", "title": "Forget Me Not: History's 17 Most Bizarre Amnesia Cases", "title_full": "Forget Me Not: History's 17 Most Bizarre Amnesia Cases", "published": "2017-10-03T09:02:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA5NS83MzMvb3JpZ2luYWwvMDAxLWhlbnJ5LWd1c3Rhdi1tb2xhaXNvbi0tLVJhbmRvbS1Ib3VzZS5qcGc=", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f987b5237b532baa65e269f0367f06619b82ed4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmUuZo1rJaiv0YjZ0fsy5E7nvzjoDkRSvs5FcDrclUaNEPxMJP3llh1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T09:02:00.000+03:00", "title": "Forget Me Not: History's 17 Most Bizarre Amnesia Cases", "text": "Forget Me Not: History's 17 Most Bizarre Amnesia Cases By Mindy Weisberger, Senior Writer | October 3, 2017 02:02pm ET Photo Credit: Shutterstock Slide 1 of 35 Don't you forget about me Amnesia is a popular plot device in movies and television, but real-life instances of memory loss are arguably more bizarre than anything seen on the screen. \nFrom Agatha Christie's 11-day memory lapse, to Patient H.M. who forgot events as soon as they occurred, to a woman who collected memories as if they were being experienced by someone else, here's a look at history's most bizarre amnesia cases.

But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said residents of the island are safe from one potential threat: cholera.\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman tweeted on Saturday (Sept. 30) that cholera had been reported in the U.S. territory, but then walked back that claim. The CDC tweeted that same day that cholera is not a likely threat to the island, because there had been no reports of the bacterium that causes the disease before the hurricane.\n\"CDC does not anticipate cholera cases in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands b/c of #Maria,\" the agency tweeted, continuing in a second tweet: \"There was no evidence of cholera in Puerto Rico or the U.S. Virgin Islands before Hurricane #Maria made landfall.\"\nDiarrheal disease Cholera is a disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae . It spreads mostly through water contaminated by the feces of someone who harbors the illness, according to the CDC. It can also be found in brackish coastal waters and can hitch a ride into the human digestive system on contaminated shellfish from these waters.\nOnce in the body, V. cholera feeds off a sugar in the intestines called sialic acid, researchers reported in 2011 in the journal Microbiology. It then excretes a toxin that opens channels in the cells that make up the intestine wall, disrupting the electrolyte balance of the intestines and forcing water from the cells.\nFor many people, the disease causes either no symptoms or mild to moderate diarrhea, but for people severely infected, the dehydration from the excessive water loss can kill within hours. Firm mortality rates are hard to come by, given that most deaths happen in remote areas and the cases aren't reported, but the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that cholera kills up to 143,000 people worldwide each year.\nThe disease can be treated with antibiotics and intravenous rehydration, and fatality rates are highest where medical help is hard to reach, according to the CDC.\nPost-Maria Puerto Rico As Puerto Rico struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, sanitation is a concern. Fifty-five percent of the island lacks running water, according to the governor's office, and Bloomberg reported that residents are bathing and washing clothes in rivers. Many people are getting water from roadside springs, according to NPR, or hoping their hoarded supplies from before the storm don't run out before tap water is restored.\nMore on this... The 20 costliest, most destructive hurricanes to hit the US Tiny & nasty: Images of things that make us sick 27 devastating infectious diseases Even without cholera, if any of these ad hoc water sources become contaminated with feces, it could mean a major public health problem. According to the CDC, diseases such as hepatitis A can spread through contaminated drinking water. So can other diarrheal illnesses, including enteroviruses, Giardia and Campylobacter . Standing water after the hurricane may also become prime breeding ground for mosquitos. Zika virus, which causes mostly mild fever in adults but severe birth defects in developing fetuses, is already found in Puerto Rico and spreads via mosquito bites.\nThe aftermath of a natural disaster is a ripe time for epidemics. In 2010, 10 months after an earthquake devastated Haiti, the country experienced a massive cholera outbreak. By 2014, at least 8,534 people had died in Haiti from the disease. Like Puerto Rico, Haiti did not have endemic cholera bacteria before the quake; the disease arrived with Nepalese peacekeepers who came to the island as part of the United Nations' relief effort (cholera is endemic, or consistently present, in Nepal). Poor sanitation at the peacekeepers' camp sent the disease into waterways, while the widespread lack of clean water and sanitation after the earthquake transmitted the bacteria rapidly.\nOriginal article on Live Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stephanie pappas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "paul krugman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hector retamal/afp/getty  two", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zika", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haiti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico or the u.s. virgin islands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toa alta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post-maria puerto rico  as puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nepal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:45:12.022+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e7b68e3292666ffc880c4f0349bfaf2a7732a97b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmTkTNlPQi9HlaDmgMYl0JBT._5pMqBRCfdxI8_lj2wqyvnurUTfjE8hNnnRE6q12oJzMyzFFiblw-", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://www.livescience.com/home/feed/site.xml\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Live Science", "title": "Diet of Lamb and Cheerios Leads to Boy's Vision Loss", "title_full": "Diet of Lamb and Cheerios Leads to Boy's Vision Loss", "published": "2017-10-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA5NS84NTEvb3JpZ2luYWwvdml0YW1pbi1hLWRlZmljaWVuY3kuanBn", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e7b68e3292666ffc880c4f0349bfaf2a7732a97b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmTkTNlPQi9HlaDmgMYl0JBT._5pMqBRCfdxI8_lj2wqyvnurUTfjE8hNnnRE6q12oJzMyzFFiblw-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T12:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Diet of Lamb and Cheerios Leads to Boy's Vision Loss", "text": "Diet of lamb and Cheerios leads to boy's vision loss By Sara G.

(American Medical Association ) One boy's vision problems and odd changes to his eyes turned out to be caused by a highly restrictive diet, according to a new report of the boy's case from Canada. The 11-year-old boy's parents took him to the hospital after 8 months of progressively worsening vision, according to the case report, published Oct. 2 in the journal JAMA Pediatrics . \nWhen doctors examined the boy, they found his vision was severely impaired: He could see hand motions only when they were within 12 inches (30 centimeters) of his face, said senior author of the case report Dr. Eyal Cohen, a pediatrician at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto who treated the boy. \nThe outer layer of the boy's eyes were also severely dry, Cohen told Live Science. This severe dryness can lead to a buildup of material in the cornea (the transparent outer covering of the eye), called Bitot spots, Cohen said. \nThe boy had multiple food allergies and eczema, according to the report. Because of concerns that certain foods could possibly trigger eczema outbreaks, the boy's diet was limited to potatoes, pork, lamb, apples, cucumbers and Cheerios. \nOne thing those foods have in common? None are a good source of vitamin A. \nIndeed, when the doctors measured the levels of vitamin A in the boy's blood, they found that he had a vitamin A deficiency. The boy's blood levels of vitamin A were 14.3 micrograms per deciliter (ug/dL); the normal range for this vitamin is 25.8 to 48.7 ug/dL, according to the report. Cohen said the boy's deficiency was severe. \n\"Vitamin A deficiency is very common in poorer parts of the world, where it is a leading cause of blindness,\" Cohen said. But in more developed parts of the world, it is rarer, he said. Still, \"people who have highly restricted diets like the child in this case report are at higher risk of [vitamin A deficiency] and other nutritional deficiencies.\" \nVitamin A is essential for vision, as it helps certain cells in the eyes function properly, according to the case report. Not getting enough of the vitamin can lead to abnormalities in the retina, Cohen said. The retina, found at the back of the eye, is home to light-sensing cells that make vision possible. \nTo treat the boy's vitamin deficiency, he was given intravenous \"megadoses\" of vitamin A daily for two days, consisting of 200,000 IU, followed by a third dose 2 weeks later. (A normal dose of vitamin A for an 11-year-old boy is 2,000 IU daily, according to the Mayo Clinic.) \nSix weeks later, the appearance of the boy's eyes had significantly improved, according to the report.

Credit: Fraunhoffer IFAM \nIs there any element that calls to mind the notion of strength quite like titanium? Named after the Titans, Greek gods of myth, the 22nd element on the Periodic Table appears in airliners and lacrosse sticks, body piercings and medical equipment and even sunscreen. \nTitanium resists corrosion and is particularly strong and lightweight. It's as strong as steel, but only 45 percent the weight, according to Los Alamos National Laboratory . And it's twice as strong as aluminum, but only 60 percent heavier. Just the facts Atomic number (number of protons in the nucleus): 22 Atomic symbol (on the Periodic Table of Elements): Ti Atomic weight (average mass of the atom): 47.867 Density: 4.5 grams per cubic centimeter Phase at room temperature: Solid Melting point: 3,034.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1,668 degrees Celsius) Boiling point: 5,948.6 F (3,287 C) Number of isotopes: 18; five are stable Most common isotopes: Titanium-46, Titanium-47, Titanium-48, Titanium-49 and Titanium-50 Superhero element \nFor an element with superpowers, titanium has a fitting origin story: It is forged in the depths of supernovas, or collapsing stars. A 2012 study of a particular dying star, Supernova 1987A, found that a single supernova can create 100 Earths worth of titanium-44, a radioactive isotope of titanium, by mass. \nTitanium is the ninth most abundant metal in Earth's crust, according to Chemicool , but it wasn't discovered until 1791. English amateur geologist Rev. William Gregor discovered some black, metallic sand in a creek bed, analyzed it and discovered it to be a mixture of magnetite, a common form of iron oxide, and a new metal. Gregor called it manaccanite for the parish in which he'd discovered the sand. \nFour years later, a German scientist named Martin Heinrich Klaproth was studying an ore from Hungary when he realized it contained a never-before-described chemical element. He called it titanium, and later confirmed that Gregor's manaccanite contained titanium, too. \nThe first person to distill titanium into its pure form was M.A. Hunter, an employee of General Electric, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC). It wasn't until the 1930s, however, that William J. Kroll invented a process that made extracting titanium possible on an industrial scale. The so-called Kroll process first treats titanium oxide ore with chlorine, producing titanium chloride. Next, magnesium or sodium are mixed with the titanium chloride in argon gas (allowing oxygen into the proceedings would be quite explosive, indeed, given that titanium is highly reactive to oxygen , according to the RSC). Under temperatures of 2,192 F (1,200 C), the magnesium or sodium reduces the titanium chloride to pure titanium. This process is about 10,000 times less efficient as the process used to make iron, according to the RSC, which helps explain why titanium is the more expensive metal. \nTitanium is a transition metal , meaning it can form bonds using electrons from more than one of its shells, or energy levels. It shares this feature with other transition metals, including gold, copper and mercury. Who knew? Almost every igneous rock \u2014 rocks formed from the solidification of molten rock \u2014 contains titanium, according to the RSC. A Boeing 737 Dreamliner is made of 15 percent titanium, according to the company. Titanium is orbiting the planet right now: The International Space Station (ISS) has a number of titanium parts, including pipes, according to NASA. The Rosetta Project, a research and archiving venture with the goal of preserving human languages and thought, has also flown an etched piece of pure titanium outside the ISS, to see how it stands up to radiation and the harsh environment of space. Earth isn't the only place to find titanium. In 2011, a satellite map of the moon's surface revealed clusters of titanium-rich rock . These rocks often contained up to 10 percent titanium, compared to the 1 percent or so typically seen in Earth rocks. Titanium can be used as a raw material in 3D printing . In 2013, researchers at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization 3D-printed a pair of lightweight titanium horseshoes for racehorses. The shoes were a stylish hot pink . Titanium dioxide \nTitanium dioxide (TiO 2 ), also called titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is the naturally occurring oxide of titanium. A white pigment, titanium dioxide is used in paints (as titanium white or pigment white 6), and sunscreen because of its ability to refract light and absorb ultraviolet rays. According to the U.S. Geological Survey , 95 percent of titanium mined is turned into titanium dioxide pigments, with the remaining 5 percent going into manufacturing chemicals, metal, carbides and coatings. \nTitanium dioxide is also commonly used in medicine, cosmetics and toothpaste, and is increasingly being used as a food additive (as E171) to whiten products or make them look more opaque. Some of the more common food products with added E171 include frosting, chewing gum, marshmallows and supplements. \nThere are no restrictions on the use of titanium dioxide in food products. However, a new study on mice, published in the journal Gut , shows that titanium dioxide particles may be very damaging to the intestines of those with certain inflammatory bowel diseases. \nResearchers at the University of Zurich in Switzerland found that when intestinal cells absorb titanium dioxide particles, the intestinal mucosa of mice that had colitis became inflamed and damaged, according to the study news release . \nInflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis have been on the rise in Western countries for many years. These conditions are characterized by an extreme autoimmune reaction to intestinal flora. Several factors play a role in the development of the disease, including genetics and environmental triggers such as lifestyle and nutrition. Now the Swiss researchers have found that titanium dioxide nanoparticles, commonly found in toothpaste and many food products, can exacerbate this inflammatory reaction to an even greater degree. \nIn addition, higher concentrations of titanium dioxide particles can be found in the blood of patients with ulcerative colitis. This means that these particles can be absorbed from food under certain disease conditions, explain the researchers in the news release. \nThough the findings have not been confirmed in humans yet, the researchers suggest that patients with colitis should avoid ingesting titanium dioxide particles. Titanium is a light and strong metal, often used in machinery, tools, sports gear and jewelry. Credit: Christian Lagerek Shutterstock Current research \nTitanium dioxide had a dizzying array of functions in the tech world, from solar cell applications to biocompatible sensors, said Jay Narayan, a materials scientist at North Carolina State University. \nIn 2012, Narayan and his colleagues reported a way to \"tune\" titanium dioxide, customizing it for particular applications. This material comes in two crystalline structures, called \"rutile\" and \"anatase,\" each of which has its own properties and functions. Usually, titanium dioxide likes to be in the anatase phase below 932 F (500 C), and transforms to the rutile phase at hotter temperatures. \nBy growing titanium dioxide crystal-by-crystal and lining them up on a template made of titanium trioxide, Narayan and his colleagues were able to set the material's phase as either rutile or anatase at room temperature, they reported in June 2012 in the journal Applied Physics Letters. In an even bigger leap, the researchers were able to integrate this titanium dioxide into computer chips. \n\"Titanium oxide is also a very good sensor material, so if it is integrated with a computer chip then it acts like a smart sensor,\" Narayan told Live Science. As the sensor is part of the chip, the device can respond more rapidly and efficiently than if the sensor were separate and had to be hard-wired to the computing portion of the device. \nGetting the product to market will require manufacturing costs to come down, Narayan said, but the \"tunable\" titanium dioxide has other promise, as well. By zapping the material with high-powered laser pulses, researchers can create small defects, called oxygen vacancies, where the material is missing oxygen molecules. The material can then be used to split water (H2O) by stealing the oxygen and leaving hydrogen, which can then be used to make hydrogen fuel. \n\"This is a cheap source of energy \u2014 and clean,\" Narayan said.New manufacturing and engineering methods are expanding titanium's uses. The Office of Naval Research announced in 2012 that a new method of welding titanium would be used to produce a full-sized ship hull; the construction is a breakthrough, according to the Navy, because titanium is typically too expensive and difficult to manufacture for shipbuilding. The new method, called friction stir welding, uses a rotating metal pin to partially melt the edges of two pieces of titanium together. \nIn medicine, titanium implants are used to replace or stabilize broken bone. Tiny titanium implants are even used to improve hearing in people with some types of deafness. A screw-like titanium rod is drilled into the skull behind the ear and attached to an external sound-processing unit. The external unit picks up sounds and transmits the vibration through the titanium implant to the inner ear, bypassing any problems in the middle ear. \nIn 2010, researchers announced the development of \"Tifoam\" a structure of polyurethane foam saturated with titanium powder. The porous structure mimics human bone and allows human bone cells to penetrate and meld with the implant as the person heals, according to a 2013 study on the material in the journal Acta Biomaterialia. \nAdditional reporting by Traci Pedersen, Live Science contributor. \nFollow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter Google+ .

Raise my hand!\" \nThat's an old joke, but there are several claimed types of psychic powers, including precognition (knowing the future) and telepathy (describing things at a remote location). But for sheer impressiveness it's hard to beat psychokinesis, the ability to move objects through mind power. The word is derived from the Greek words for \"mind\" and \"motion\" and is also called PK or telekinesis. \nFictional psychokinetics are easy to find: The popular X-Men comic and film franchise includes the character Jean Grey, whose powers include extrasensory perception and psychokinesis. The 2009 movie \"Push\" is about a group of young Americans with various psychic abilities who team up and use their paranormal powers against a shadowy U.S. government agency. \nThough many Americans believe in psychic ability (about 15 percent of us, according to a 2005 Baylor Religion Survey), scientific evidence for its existence remains elusive. Some people even link psychokinesis to the spiritual world, suggesting for example that some reports of ghosts \u2014 such as poltergeists \u2014 are not manifestations of the undead at all, but instead the unconscious releases of a person's psychic anger or angst. \nIf people could move everyday objects with nothing more than their thoughts, this should be quite easy to demonstrate: Who wouldn't like their latte delivered by a psychic barista from across the counter, floating it right to your hand with a mere gesture? \nThis doesn't happen, of course. Instead researchers have focused on what they term \"micro-PK,\" or the manipulation of very small objects. The idea is that if the ability exists, its force is obviously very weak. Therefore, the less physical energy that would have to be exerted on an object to physically move it, the more obvious the effect should be. For this reason, laboratory experiments often focus on rather mundane feats such as trying to make dice land on a certain number at an above-chance rate, or influencing a computerized random number generator. \nBecause of this change in methodologies, psychokinesis experiments rely more heavily on complex statistical analyses; the issue was not whether a person could bend a spoon or knock a glass over with their minds, for example, but whether they could make a coin come up heads significantly above 50 percent of the time over the course of 1,000 trials. Spiritualism and mediums \nThe idea of people being able to move objects through mind power alone has intrigued people for centuries, though only in the late 1800s was it seen as an ability that might be scientifically demonstrated. This occurred during the heyday of the early religion Spiritualism, when psychic mediums claimed to contact the dead during s\u00e9ances, and objects would suddenly and mysteriously move, float, or fly by themselves across the darkened room, seemingly untouched by human hands. Though many people were convinced \u2014 including, ironically, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes \u2014 it was all a hoax. Fraudulent psychics resorted to trickery, using everything from hidden wires to black-clad accomplices to make objects appear to move untouched. \nAs the public slowly grew wise to the faked psychokinesis, the phenomenon faded from view. It was revived again in the 1930s and 1940s, when a researcher at Duke University named J.B. Rhine became interested in the idea that people could affect the outcome of random events using their minds. Rhine began with tests of dice rolls, asking subjects to influence the outcome through the power of their minds. Though his results were mixed and the effects were small, they were enough to convince him that there was something mysterious going on. Unfortunately for Rhine, other researchers failed to duplicate his findings, and many errors were found in his methods. Uri Geller, shown speaking at a press event in Moscow in 2009, made millions in the 1970s by claiming he could bend spoons with his mind. Credit: Milarka / Shutterstock.com \nIn the 1970s, Uri Geller became the world's best-known psychic and made millions traveling the world demonstrating his claimed psychokinetic abilities, including starting broken watches and bending spoons. Though he denied using magic tricks, many skeptical researchers observed that all of Geller's amazing feats could be \u2014 and have been \u2014 duplicated by magicians. \nPublic interest in psychokinesis returned in the 1980s. One person nationally known for claimed psychokinetic ability, James Hydrick, tried to demonstrate his powers on the television show \"That's My Line\" in 1981, following several successful television appearances. He claimed to move small objects, such as a pencil or the pages of a telephone book, with his mind. Host Bob Barker consulted with skeptic James Randi, who suspected that Hydrick was merely discreetly blowing on the pages to make them move. \nTo prevent this method of trickery Randi placed styrofoam bits around the open book, as the lightweight pieces would clearly be disturbed if the pages were moving because of Hydrick's breath instead of his mind. After many awkward minutes in front of Barker, Randi, a panel of judges, and the live studio audience, a flustered Hydrick finally said that his powers weren't cooperating. Hydrick later admitted that his psychokinetic powers had been faked, and marveled at how easy it had been to fool the public. Frauds and fakery \nThe history of psychokinesisis a history of frauds and fakery, both proven and suspected. \nEven many researchers admit that the data fall far short of scientific standards of proof; researcher Russell Targ, in his book \"The Reality of ESP\" (2012, Quest Books) acknowledges that \"the evidence for laboratory psychokinesis is quite weak.\" \nRecent advances in virtual reality technology may, however, be the next best thing. In 2017, a company called Neurable announced plans to develop psychokinesis \u2014 or at least a virtual reality form of it \u2014 for a game called Awakening. Using a combination of eye movement tracking technology and electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors in a headset, the game allows a player to move and manipulate objects in a virtual world merely by looking and thinking. After an initial calibration process that takes several minutes, the players can select and move computer-generated images. \nPerhaps one day technology will allow us to actually move objects with our thoughts, but until then we must be satisfied with the power depicted in fiction and fantasy.

By Mindy Weisberger, Senior Writer | October 4, 2017 07:27am ET MORE In the 2017 movie \"Flatliners,\" Courtney (Ellen Page) experiences death. But then she gets better. Credit: Sony Pictures \nDriven by ambition and curiosity to learn what lies on the other side of death, five medical students deliberately stop their hearts in order to experience \"the afterlife\" in the new thriller \"Flatliners\" (Sony Pictures), which opened in U.S. theaters on Sept. 29. \nThey quickly discover that there are unexpected and terrible consequences of dallying with death \u2014 but not everything they experience after \"dying\" is in the realm of science fiction. A growing body of research is charting the processes that occur after death, suggesting that human consciousness doesn't immediately wink out after the heart stops, experts say. \nBut what really happens in the body and brain in the moments after cardiac arrest? [ The Science of Death: 10 Tales from the Crypt & Beyond ] \nThe terms \"cardiac arrest\" and \"heart attack\" are frequently used interchangeably, but they are not identical conditions, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). During a heart attack, a blocked artery prevents blood from reaching a portion of the heart, which can cause that section to die \u2014 though the heart continues to beat, the AHA explained. \nDuring cardiac arrest, the electrical signals driving the heart's pumping action are disrupted, the heart ceases beating and death shortly follows , the AHA said. \nIn the vast majority of terminal cases, physicians medically define death based on when the heart no longer beats, said Dr. Sam Parnia, director of critical care and resuscitation research at NYU Langone School of Medicine in New York City. \n\"Technically speaking, that's how you get the time of death \u2014 it's all based on the moment when the heart stops,\" he told Live Science. \nOnce that happens, blood no longer circulates to the brain, which means brain function halts \"almost instantaneously,\" Parnia said. \"You lose all your brain stem reflexes \u2014 your gag reflex, your pupil reflex, all that is gone.\" A trajectory of cell death \nThe brain's cerebral cortex \u2014 the so-called \"thinking part\" of the brain \u2014 also slows down instantly, and flatlines, meaning that no brainwaves are visible on an electric monitor, within 2 to 20 seconds. This initiates a chain reaction of cellular processes that eventually result in the death of brain cells , but that can take hours after the heart has stopped, Parnia said. \nPerforming cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) does send some blood to the brain \u2014 about 15 percent of what it requires to function normally, according to Parnia. This is enough to slow the brain cells' death trajectory, but it isn't enough to kick-start the brain into working again, which is why reflexes don't resume during CPR, he said. \n\"If you manage to restart the heart, which is what CPR attempts to do, you'll gradually start to get the brain functioning again. The longer you're doing CPR, those brain cell death pathways are still happening \u2014 they're just happening at a slightly slower rate,\" he told Live Science. \nRecent studies have shown that animals experience a surge in brain activity in the minutes after death. And people in the first phase of death may still experience some form of consciousness, Parnia said. Substantial anecdotal evidence reveals that people whose hearts stopped and then restarted were able to describe accurate, verified accounts of what was going on around them, he added. \n\"They'll describe watching doctors and nurses working; they'll describe having awareness of full conversations, of visual things that were going on, that would otherwise not be known to them,\" he explained. According to Parnia, these recollections were then verified by medical and nursing staff who were present at the time and were stunned to hear that their patients, who were technically dead, could remember all those details. [ Heart of the Matter: 7 Things to Know About Your Ticker ] Death and beyond \nParnia and his colleagues are currently investigating the pervasiveness of consciousness after death. They're looking at large numbers of people in Europe and the United States who have suffered cardiac arrest, in the largest study of its kind, he said. \n\"In the same way that a group of researchers might be studying the qualitative nature of the human experience of 'love,' for instance, we're trying to understand the exact features that people experience when they go through death, because we understand that this is going to reflect the universal experience we're all going to have when we die,\" he said. \nThe study researchers are also observing the brain in detail during the period of cardiac arrest, death and revival to understand how much oxygen is reaching the brain, when exactly the cortex comes \"back online\" and how these experiences relate to brain activity itself, Parnia added. \nFor these scientists, the most important next steps are finding more accurate methods of monitoring the brain from beyond the threshold of death and improving the quality of resuscitation, to do a better job of preventing brain injuries while restarting the heart, Parnia said. \n\"At the same time, we also study the human mind and consciousness in the context of death, to understand whether consciousness becomes annihilated or whether it continues after you've died for some period of time \u2014 and how that relates to what's happening inside the brain in real time,\" Parnia said. \"Flatliners\" characters discover that consciousness can persist after death. Credit: Sony Pictures \n\nThe \"Flatliners\" movie also suggests that death and resuscitation could enhance normal brain activity after revival, as the students who \"died\" and woke up can suddenly remember obscure passages in long-forgotten books. However, in the real world, a return ticket from death doesn't include newly acquired cerebral superpowers \u2014 though it does frequently provide a new perspective on life, Parnia noted. \n\"What tends to happen is that people who've had these very profound experiences may come back positively transformed \u2014 they become more altruistic, more engaged with helping others. They find a new meaning to life having had an encounter with death,\" Parnia said. \n\"But there isn't like a sudden magical enhancement of their memories,\" he added. \"That's just Hollywood jazz.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: NOAA \nSeptember was a doozy for hurricanes. By one measure, it was the most active month on record for the Atlantic Ocean, thanks, in particular, to two Category 5 monsters. But as the calendar has turned over into October, the Atlantic has gone quiet. \nThis welcome respite from the tropical onslaught comes courtesy of a shift to less favorable conditions for storm formation, several experts said. But hurricane season is far from over, and the Atlantic Ocean is sure to see more activity, they warned. \n\"We're not done yet,\" Phil Klotzbach, a hurricane researcher at Colorado State University, told Live Science. \nAugust, September and October mark the climatological peak of the Atlantic hurricane season, which stretches from the beginning of June to the end of November. That means those months, particularly September, tend to be when most of the hurricane action happens. This September \"was like peak season on steroids,\" Klotzbach said. [ Hurricane Maria's Aftermath: Photos Reveal Devastation on Caribbean Islands ] \nAll four tropical storms that formed during the month \u2014 Irma , Jose, Katia and Maria \u2014 became hurricanes , and three stepped it up a notch to become major hurricanes of Category 4 or greater. (Katia was the exception.) Irma and Maria reached Category 5 strength , the highest possible rung. It's a fairly rare feat for a hurricane to reach Category 5 strength, and even rarer for a storm to hit the blistering 185 mph (298 km/h) sustained wind speeds achieved by Irma. In fact, only four other known Atlantic storms have ever done so. \nMoreover, Irma and Maria moved a combined 1,500 miles (2,400 kilometers) as Category 5 storms, according to The Washington Post's Capital Weather Gang. That incredible longevity, combined with the storms' bruising power, gave September the highest accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) of any month on record for the Atlantic, according to the National Hurricane Center (NHC). That energy is a measure of the combined intensity and duration of tropical storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \n\"September 2017 was an amazingly active month,\" Jeff Weber, a hurricane researcher at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, told Live Science. \nThat record-breaking activity was the result of a near-perfect alignment of conditions, with abundant, abnormally warm ocean water and almost none of the wind shear that can tear storms apart, Klotzbach said. \nFor several consecutive days, Irma faced little wind shear, which is the change in wind speed or direction with altitude. \"That's insane,\" Klotzbach said. \"That just doesn't happen very often.\" \nBut it's not unusual for an active season to have down periods, said Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane forecaster for NOAA, which is what happened as September came to a close. [ The 20 Costliest, Most Destructive Hurricanes to Hit the US ] \nOver the past week or so, conditions have shifted, Klotzbach said. There's still plenty of warm water, but shear has ticked upward. Air pressure has also been higher over the tropics and more dry air has been brought into the basin by prevailing winds, Bell told Live Science. \nOn Sept. 30, the NHC issued its last advisory for Maria, which had by then lost its tropical character and was slowly dying in the North Atlantic, marking the first time since Aug. 23 that the NHC didn't have an active storm to forecast. \n\"September came in like a lion with #Irma and now out like a lamb for October with nada. Hope this break lasts!,\" NHC forecaster Eric Blake tweeted. \nBut it's unlikely to, all three experts said. Though we're moving away from the peak of the season and storm activity is expected to taper off, nearly two months of hurricane season remain. (And the dates of the season are artificial; they're meant to encompass the bulk of activity. Storms can still form outside of the official season.) \nFurther storms could be bad news for areas already pummeled and struggling to recover, especially Puerto Rico , Bell said, which is still in dire straits two weeks after Hurricane Maria swept through. More than 90 percent of the island is without power; there are shortages of food and fuel; and debris and damage to roads have made it difficult to access more isolated areas, according to news reports. \nOne of the main areas to watch for storm development in the coming weeks is the western Caribbean, \"where we have extremely warm water,\" Weber said, \"and the shear is not quite as dramatic.\" In fact, NHC forecasters are watching an area in the southwestern Caribbean that could develop into a more organized tropical system in the coming week. \n\"There's a long way to go\" in the season, and \"people should not let their guard down\" Bell said. \"I'm not letting my guard down; that's for sure.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: Drew Angerer/Getty \nAn open letter signed by 147 criminologists, sociologists, psychologists and other human-behavior experts asks that the media stop publishing the names and photographs of mass killers. \nResearch has found that fame is a major motivation for many mass shooters . \n\"They want to be celebrities,\" said Adam Lankford, one of the lead drafters of the letter and a criminologist at the University of Alabama. \"We know that some of these offenders have said things like, 'The more you kill, the more you'll be known,' and 'Someone who is known by no one will be known by everyone.'\" [ The Science of Mass Shooters: What Drives a Person to Kill? ] No notoriety \nAfter a mass killing like the one in Las Vegas on Sunday night (Oct. 1), when a shooter sprayed bullets into a music-festival crowd from a hotel window above, the identity of the perpetrator is often the first question. But \"the particular sequence of letters that make up offenders' names, and the particular configuration of bones, cartilage and flesh that make up offenders' faces are among the least newsworthy details about them,\" Lankford and the other signatories argue in the letter. The plea is based on a proposal published in September in the journal American Behavioral Scientist by Lankford and Eric Madfis, a sociologist at the University of Washington, Tacoma. \nThe researchers propose that media outlets avoid naming the perpetrator or using the perpetrator's photograph. Reporters should also avoid naming past killers in articles about more recent killers, they wrote. All other details \u2014 including possible motives, where such killers got their weaponry, the criminal's past and interviews with friends and family \u2014 are fair game, they said. \nThese guidelines would be similar to existing policies against showing fans who run out on fields during televised events or publishing the names of sexual assault victims . In Canada, juvenile offenders' identities are not released, Lankford and Madfis wrote in their American Behavioral Scientist article. That policy covered a 17-year-old who killed four in La Loche, Saskatchewan, in 2016. Everyone in the small town knew who the killer was, Lankford said. He posted his intentions before the crime on Facebook and survived after to appear in court. But the newspapers still didn't run his name. Copycats and fame-seekers \nAfter data emerged that suicides can be contagious through the media and that reporting on one suicide was linked to a spike in later suicides, most reputable media outlets began changing the way they reported on suicide. For example, guidelines from the American Foundation to Prevent Suicide include avoiding sensationalistic headlines, downplaying focus on the method of death and including information on how to get help for suicidal impulses. \nThe letter's signatories are asking for a similar voluntary effort. Some prominent academics who backed the request include Harvard cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker and Katherine Newman, an expert on school violence at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. \n\"As scholars, professors and law enforcement professionals, we do not agree on everything,\" the letter reads. \"Some of us believe that by denying mass shooters fame, we would deter some future fame-seekers from attacking. Some of us believe that by no longer creating de facto celebrities out of killers, we would reduce contagion and copycat effects. Some of us believe that by no longer rewarding the deadliest offenders with the most personal attention, we would reduce the competition among them to maximize victim fatalities.\" \nThere is at least some evidence for all these positions. Lankford has found that killers often reference one another. The shooter at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in October 2015 mentioned as an inspiration the man who killed a television reporter and cameraman in Roanoke, Virginia, and posted the video to Facebook in August of that year. That Roanoke killer mentioned the white supremacist shooter who killed congregants at an African-American church in Charleston, South Carolina, two months before. \nShooters also compete for the most attention by killing the most people, Lankford said. In a 2016 study in the journal Aggression and Violent Behavior, he found that mass killers who expressed a celebrity-seeking motive killed twice as many people as those who did not. There is also a direct correlation between the death toll of a shooting and the news coverage received, Lankford told Live Science. [ The History of Human Aggression: 10 Innovations That Changed How We Fight ] \nThere is also statistical evidence that mass shootings inspire copycats. A 2015 study found that every school shooting inspires 0.22 more school shootings, and every mass shooting inspires 0.3 more mass shootings. The decimals reflect that not every inspiration is one-to-one; rather, shootings tend to cluster so that when you have four school shootings, you're ripe for a fifth. \nThere are times when a name will have to be released, Lankford and his colleagues wrote, such as when a suspect is at large. And the full details of mass shootings should be publicized, so that family and friends know the kinds of behaviors to look for before an attack. But after the fact, leaving out a name and picture doesn't have to be a sacrifice, Lankford said. In his papers, he refers to dates and locations rather than killers. \n\"I'm someone who publishes about the lives of these people in-depth for my career,\" Lankford said. \"I've probably written more about public mass shooters than the vast majority of the media, and I'm saying I can do this, and our 147 signatories are saying they can do this, without the names.\" \nOriginally published on Live Science.

Credit: molekuul_be/Shutterstock \nThe 2017 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to three scientists for their work in producing 3D images of life's molecular machinery. \nBecause of the achievements of this year's laureates, Jacques Dubochet, Joachim Frank and Richard Henderson, scientists can now freeze biomolecules (such as proteins) mid-movement and image them at an atomic resolution, according to Nobelprize.org. \nWith this cryo-electron microscopy , researchers can \"visualize processes they have never previously seen, which is decisive for both the basic understanding of life's chemistry and for the development of pharmaceuticals,\" according to Nobelprize.org. \nBefore work by this trio, scientists thought that electron microscopes could be used only on dead material, as the strong electron beams destroy biological samples. But in 1990, Henderson, of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, did just that when he produced a 3D image of a protein using an electron microscope. \nColumbia University's Frank took this technology a step further between 1975 and 1986; he was able to take the two-dimensional images generated by an electron microscope and merge them to create a sharp, 3D structure. \nDubochet, a professor at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, added water to the mix. Typically, in an electron microscope, water will cause biomolecules to collapse. But in the early 1980s, Dubochet cooled water so quickly that it solidified around a biological molecule. In that way, the molecule retained its natural shape. \nAccording to Nobelprize.org, after presenting his new strategy, in 1975 Frank said, \"If such methods were to be perfected, then, in the words of one scientist, the sky would be the limit.\" \nFollowing their achievements, electron microscopy has taken off, with images of everything from proteins linked to antibiotic resistance to the surface of the Zika virus , according to Nobelprize.org. \nThe three scientists will share the 9 million Swedish krona ($1.1 million) award. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

What will they find? pic.twitter.com/1rBgv7hAL5 \u2014 Doug Cope (@dcopewbz) September 26, 2017 \nPaul Revere is famous for his midnight ride, but now he might be celebrated \u2014 at least among archaeologists \u2014 for the contents of his outhouse, according to news sources. \nOn Sept. 26, archaeologists began excavating what appears to be a Colonial privy just outside the house of Nathaniel Hichborn, a cousin and next-door neighbor of Revere , according to a podcast produced by Boston's Museum of Science, the Smithsonian reported . \nThe house, known as the Pierce-Hichborn house, dates to 1711, and is one of the oldest brick structures still standing in Boston, according to the Paul Revere Memorial Association . But it has never been archaeologically excavated, the Smithsonian found. [ Photos: Time Capsule from 1795 Reveals Pieces of American History ] \nThe likely outhouse has a rectangular shape, measuring about 4 feet by 6 feet (1.2 by 1.8 meters), Joe Bagley, city archaeologist of Boston, said on the podcast. In addition to using privies for, ahem, answering the call of nature, Colonial Americans also used them as trash cans, often throwing out papers and broken household goods, the Smithsonian reported. \n\"You'd fill it up with you-know-what, and then also your household waste, because everyone threw their trash out into that,\" Bagley told CBS . \"We're hoping to find the individuals' waste themselves, which we can get seeds from what they were eating; we can find parasites, find out what their health was.\" \nThe excavation of the clay-lined toilet has already revealed some treasures, including the handle of a beer stein and pieces of coal, according to CBS. Doug Cope, a CBS reporter at the dig, snapped photos of the finds, tweeting, \"Piece of beer stein from the 1700's found at archaeological dig outside Revere family property in the North End\" and \"pieces of coal found.\" Piece of beer stein from the 1700's found at archeological dig outside Revere family property in the North End. pic.twitter.com/JN1tOhnvDB \u2014 Doug Cope (@dcopewbz) September 26, 2017 Digging in what might have been Revere family privy outside Paul Revere house in the North End.

The only way to find out is to dig down into it and see if it has that night soil \u2013 that kind of smelly, dark soils which are now composted and not that bad, but they might have a stench still , a little bit.\" \nIn 1650, Boston passed a law mandating that privies extend down at least 6 feet (1.8 m). But it's still unclear whether this one is that deep, although Bagely hopes it is: \"I hope it's six feet deep, because that gives us the best opportunity to find a lot of things from multiple families,\" he told CBS. \nOuthouses are a boon to archaeologists the world over. For instance, an ancient Jerusalem latrine contained the remains of Crusader excrement, which was infested with parasitic eggs, including those of whipworms ( Trichuris trichiura ) and giant roundworms ( Ascaris lumbricoides ). The finds showed that health conditions were wanting back then, Live Science previously reported . \nHuman parasites also infested the Roman Empire, according to a study of latrine soil, coprolites (fossilized excrement), burial dirt and textiles, Live Science reported in 2016 . \nOriginal article on Live Science .

It can be reached from the Guernsey mainland by an isthmus most of the time, but it is cut off for a few hours each day at high tide, De Jersey said. \nBased on the name of the islet and fragments of pottery found during the excavation, the researchers said they think that a stone building that once stood on the island may have been used as a religious retreat or shrine by Christian monks during the 14th century. \nThe dolphin bones are the only remains, animal or human, that were found during the excavations, De Jersey said. \n\"The thing that I have a problem with is why they've gone to so much care to cut this pit or grave, because it has been cut right down into the bedrock,\" he said. \"And they've done it carefully \u2014 the pit has a nice, flat base to it, and it's taken really considerable effort to cut this pit into the ground. But then why put a [dolphin] into it, when you could just dump those sort of remains in the sea?\" Salted dolphin \nAlthough dolphins often appear in historical sources as a Christian symbol, De Jersey said he has not learned of any other cases in which dolphins were buried in Christian graves . \n\"I don't know any parallels to this in the study of medieval cemeteries,\" he said. \"Putting an animal like this in there is just unheard of really, so perhaps that all points to it not being a grave.\" \nAnother possibility is that the animal was butchered for food, then packed with salt as a form of preservation and buried in the pit, he said. \n\n\"There is literary evidence from the 13th and 14th centuries which mentions that porpoise was definitely eaten at that time,\" De Jersey said. \n\"And the implication is that it wasn't eaten fresh, so there must have been some way to preserve it, by drying it or salting it in some way,\" he added. \"So, we've wondered whether this was a pit filled with salt, and they've put the animal in, and for whatever reason, it was never retrieved.\" \nDe Jersey said it's possible that an analysis of the soil surrounding the dolphin remains may reveal additional clues. \nThe arrangement of bones in the grave also suggested that the animal may have been butchered before it was placed in the pit, he said. \nNow that the excavations on Chapelle Dom Hue have come to an end, the next stage in solving the mystery will be to determine the age of the bones with radiocarbon dating, to test the soil it was found in and to verify the species of the animal, De Jersey said. \n\"We will get expert advice when we've got the bones cleaned up, and I hope someone will be able to say exactly what it is,\" he said. \nOriginal article on Live Science.

The discovery has major implications for science.  (MPI for Gravitational Physics/W.Benger-Zib) \n \nBERLIN\u2014As expected by many, the 2017 Nobel Prize for physics went to three scientists who helped detect gravitational waves, ripples in space-time predicted by Einstein.\n\"This year's prize is about a discovery that shook the world,\" said physicist Thors Hans Hansson, announcing the winners from Stockholm.\nHalf of the 9 million Swedish krona ($1.1 million) award will go to Rainer Weiss of MIT. The other half will go jointly to Barry Barish and Kip Thorne of Caltech. All three were founders of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO, which detected gravitational waves for the first time in 2015.\nMore From LiveScience Interstellar Space Travel: 7 Futuristic Spacecraft To Explore the Cosmos 6 Weird Facts About Gravity 7 Everyday Things that Happen Strangely In Space Albert Einstein had theorized that space-time can be stretched and compressed by collisions of massive objects in the universe. However, experimental proof for such events eluded scientists for 100 years. [ The 18 Biggest Unsolved Mysteries in Physics ]\nOn Sept. 14, 2015, LIGO's two extremely sensitive instruments in Washington state and Louisiana simultaneously observed a faint gravitational-wave signal. The ripples in space-time came from a pair of two massive black holes that spiraled into each other 1.3 billion years ago.\nIt took scientists such a long time to arrive at the discovery because gravitational waves \u2014 even though they come from violent, powerful collisions \u2014 are extremely small once they reach Earth.\nDuring the event detected in September 2015, scientists think that about three times the mass of the sun was transformed into gravitational waves in less than a second. [ How Gravitational Waves Work (Infographic) ]\nThe L-shaped LIGO detectors have two arms, each 2.48 miles (4 kilometers) long, with identical laser beams inside. If a gravitational wave passes through Earth, the laser in one arm of the detector will be compressed and the other will expand. But the changes are tiny \u2014 as tiny as one-thousandth of a diameter of a nucleon, said Walter Winkler, a physicist with the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Hannover, Germany.\n\"You have first to keep all the distortions out and then to increase the sensitivity of the measurement system,\" Winkler, who has worked on gravitational wave detection since the 1970s, told Live Science. \"It took thousands of people to come to this. It's really a new sort of astronomy.\"\nThe Nobel Committee acknowledged that the discovery was a huge collaborative effort. The paper announcing the September 2015 detection had more than 1,000 authors. But, according to the Nobel rules, the prize can be shared by no more than three scientists.\n\"Without them the discovery would not have happened,\" Nils M\u00e5rtensson, the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said of the three winners during a news conference in Stockholm.\nScientists here at the German Physical Society (DPG) cheered the results.\n\"I had really hoped for it because it's a fantastic discovery,\" DPG President Rolf-Dieter Heuer told Live Science. He added that the detection of gravitational waves opens \"a window into an unseen world that will bring us more information in the future about the universe.\"\nThe findings might seem esoteric, but Heuer said that it's difficult to predict when and in which field this research could have practical applications. He noted that it took more than 40 years for the discovery of antimatter to be used in positron emission tomography, or PET, scans common in hospitals today.\nSome had expected the LIGO team to win the prize last year . But Gunnar Ingelman, Secretary of the Nobel Committee and a professor of subatomic physics at Uppsala University in Sweden, said the detection of gravitational waves was not eligible last year. According to the rules of the committee, the discovery has to be published the year before the awards are announced. (The LIGO detection was published in February 2016.)\nThe LIGO team has made several additional discoveries . Just last week, LIGO scientists announced they had detected gravitational waves for the fourth time, on Aug. 14, 2017. The ripples were also detected by another instrument called VIRGO, near Pisa, Italy.\n\"In the early days, it was not clear if these gravitational waves were real or could be observed,\" Ingelman told reporters here by video. \"It was an enormous effort to reach the sensitivity to build a detector which could actually observe such tiny, tiny distortions.\"\nOriginally published on Live Science.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "megan gannon", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "einstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "winkler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nils m\u00e5rtensson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heuer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thors hans hansson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolf-dieter heuer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry barish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter winkler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kip thorne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gunnar ingelman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingelman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rainer weiss", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albert einstein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nobel committee for physics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uppsala university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ligo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mpi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatory", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max planck institute for gravitational physics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dpg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nobel committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pisa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caltech", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-04T17:24:22.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1353ba665cdda53631895d19bc663a2b1db16dab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmh3n5TDN6qdjVH4juvxsQpK5aFKqwK0TEyBinY79DrQQXXip7eAQh2p7IGxE6gBUa", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://www.livescience.com/home/feed/site.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Live Science", "title": "Nobel Prize in Chemistry: 1901-Present", "title_full": "Nobel Prize in Chemistry: 1901-Present", "published": "2017-10-04T18:22:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA5NS84NTYvb3JpZ2luYWwvemlrYS12aXJ1cy5qcGc=", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1353ba665cdda53631895d19bc663a2b1db16dab", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmh3n5TDN6qdjVH4juvxsQpK5aFKqwK0TEyBinY79DrQQXXip7eAQh2p7IGxE6gBUa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-04T18:22:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nobel Prize in Chemistry: 1901-Present", "text": "Nobel Prize in Chemistry: 1901-Present By Live Science Staff | October 4, 2017 11:22am ET MORE Cryo-electron microscopy produced this 3D image of the Zika virus.

Samantha Mathewson, Live Science Contributor | October 4, 2017 03:13pm ET MORE The crew trains for a \"Marswalk\" at the simulated Martian terrain of the Mars500 experiment. Credit: ESA/IPMB \nWhen humans finally journey to Mars, they won't be the only living things on board the spacecraft; millions upon millions of microbes that live on and in these pioneering astronauts' bodies will also be along for the ride. \nUnderstanding how these microbes can grow, spread and adapt in the spacecraft's confined conditions is important for ensuring the health of the astronauts who participate in such future long-term space missions. And a new study offers insight into how these bacteria might behave in such an environment. \nSix men who lived as \"Marsonauts\" for more than a year inside a mock spacecraft in Moscow have revealed how the multitude of microbes that live on astronauts' bodies can adapt and spread throughout a confined environment, according to the study. [ The 7 Most Mars-Like Places on Earth ] \n\"In addition to potential health risks for the crew, some of these microorganisms could have a negative impact on spacecraft, as they grow on and might damage spacecraft material,\" co-researcher Petra Schwendner, from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said in a statement . \nFor 520 days (the approximate time it would take to reach Mars), a crew of six male Marsonauts lived and worked in a mock spacecraft in Moscow, which was designed to simulate conditions that astronauts would experience during missions to Mars . Specifically, the crew studied how microorganisms such as bacteria adapted to the confined conditions and spread throughout the spacecraft. \n\"Until now, little was known about the influence of long-term confinement on the microorganisms that live inside habitats that may one day be used to travel to other planets, and whether the structure of the microbiota changes with time,\" Schwendner said in the statement. \nOver the course of the study \u2014 which lasted from June 3, 2010, to Nov. 5, 2011 \u2014 the Marsonauts followed a strict diet and schedule, all while remaining completely isolated in the mock habitat , called Mars500 . Using air filters and swabs, the crew collected 360 microbial samples from the air and different surfaces inside the spacecraft. \nThe researchers found that, in addition to human habitation \u2014 each person has his or her own microbiota, or population of microbes \u2014 confinement largely contributed to the type of bacteria present. \nThe study found that microbes associated with humans, including Bacillusand Staphylococcus , were the most prevalent throughout the habitat, suggesting that the crew was the main source of the microbial dispersal. For example, Staphylococcus \u2014 a type of bacteria commonly found in the nose and respiratory tract and on the skin, and some strains of which are known to cause skin infections \u2014 was likely dispersed via skin flakes shed by the crew, according to the statement. \nIn addition, the crew also detected unique bacterial signatures in different areas of the spacecraft. Communal areas, sleep areas, the gym and the bathroom, for example, had the highest numbers and greatest diversity of bacteria; the lowest levels of bacteria were found inside the medical module (where medical and psychological experiments took place and sanitary conditions were required), according to the study. \nThe researchers also saw the effect of cleaning agents on the bacteria. \"Although we located some microbial hotspots, where the number of bacteria was much higher than in other areas, we were quite relieved to find that the overall bacterial counts were within the acceptable limits,\" Schwendner said. \"Due to appropriate cleaning measures, the microbial community inside the habitat was under control at all times with no or little risk for the crew.\" \nA high level of bacterial diversity is generally considered healthy. However, the study also showed that over time, bacterial diversity dropped, and certain opportunistic, stress-tolerant pathogens became more prevalent. Such a scenario could create a problem for astronauts enduring long-duration isolation, because these types of bacteria could make the astronauts sick, according to the researchers. \n\"Countermeasures may be required to avoid development of highly resistant, adapted microorganisms and a complete loss of microbial diversity,\" Schwendner said. \nTheir findings were published Oct. 4 in the journal Microbiome. \nOriginal article on Live Science.

Credit: Copernicus Sentinel-1/BAS \nA giant iceberg that broke away from an ice shelf in the Antarctic Peninsula in July is slowly revealing a vast undersea ecosystem that has been hidden for thousands of years, researchers say. \nAs the iceberg, known as A-68, moves away from the Larsen C ice shelf and into the Weddell Sea, it will eventually expose 2,240 square miles (5,800 square kilometers) of seafloor that has been buried under the ice for up to 120,000 years, without light and linked to the open ocean only by minimal currents, according to scientists with the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). \nNow, scientists are keen to begin exploring the newly exposed area as soon as possible, to conduct research on the hidden ecosystem that can be used to make comparisons with any changes that occur over the years to come. [ In Photos: Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf Through Time ] \n\"It's just a fantastic, unknown area for scientific research,\" said Susan Grant, a marine biologist with the BAS. \"We know very little about what might or might not be living in these types of areas, and especially how they might change over time.\" \nGrant is one of two BAS scientists who led a successful proposal for international protection of areas on the Antarctic Peninsula that are exposed when floating icebergs break away from the coast-bound ice shelves. \nThe Larsen C area will be the first to benefit from a 2016 agreement by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), an international conservation agency, following the proposal by Grant and her colleague Phil Trathan, head of conservation ecology for the BAS. \nThe designation of the newly exposed region as a special area for scientific study will prohibit commercial activities like fishing and tourism for an initial period of two years, with an option to extend the protection for another 10 years after that, and potentially indefinitely, according to the BAS . Hidden seafloor \nStudying the area exposed as the A-68 iceberg floats away from the coast will let scientists learn more about such events, which are expected to become more common, including how wildlife responds as the ecosystem changes, Grant said. \n\"There's this vast area which has been covered for thousands of years,\" Grant told Live Science. \"We know the physical changes are likely to be huge when the ice moves away, and the ecosystem is likely to change along with that.\" \nGrant added that there is no evidence that this event is a direct result of climate change , but \"we do expect that these sorts of things may happen more frequently in the future, so understanding how things respond to this kind of change is really important\" The area exposed by the iceberg is now protected from fishing and tourism activities by an international conservation agreement. Credit: British Antarctic Survey \nScientific knowledge of the ecosystems below Antarctic ice shelves is mainly limited to the results of two German expeditions to the Larsen A and Larsen B areas, located north of Larsen C on the Antarctic Peninsula, where sections of the ice shelf broke away in 1995 and 2002, Trathan said. \n\"It took 5 years and 12 years for scientists to actually get into Larsen A and B, and by that time, there was already a lot of colonization [by new species] going on,\" Trathan told Live Science. \nThe regions covered by ice shelves were entirely without sunlight, and there was no \"marine snow\" of dead phytoplankton and feces of zooplankton and fish \u2014 a crucial food resource in other parts of the ocean, Trathan said.

You'll probably also get seabirds and marine mammals are going to begin to forage in that area,\" he said. \"So, it will be sort of a chain reaction \u2014 as you get productivity happening then you'll get more species coming in, and so there will be quite significant changes over relatively short time scales.\" The A-68 iceberg separated from the Larsen C ice shelf in July 2017. Credit: Nathan Kurtz/NASA Ecological change \nOne of the first challenges for scientists will be to find the funding and resources needed for expeditions into the area, hopefully before any significant changes have taken hold in the hidden ecosystem, mainly as a result of exposure to sunlight and ocean currents, Grant said. \nAccording to the new study, published online Sept. 28 in the journal Nature , a South Korean expedition could be diverted to the area in early 2018, and a German expedition will conduct a biodiversity survey there in 2019. The BAS is also considering sending a research vessel in early 2018. \n\"It's very difficult to mobilize research efforts \u2014 it takes a lot of money, and ship time is not an easy thing to arrange, especially at short notice,\" Grant said. \"But the fact that a lot of groups are trying really hard to get something down there demonstrates that this is a really unique opportunity.\" \nJulian Gutt, a marine biologist with Germany's Alfred Wegener Institute, led two scientific expeditions to the Larsen A and B ice shelves in 2007 and 2012, a few years after parts of both ice shelves had broken away and exposed large areas of the seafloor. \nAt that time, the exposed seafloor areas were still mainly populated by deep-sea animals: \"sea cucumbers, brittle stars, sea stars, deep sea sponges, things like that,\" Gutt told Live Science. \nSimilar deep-sea species were also found on continental shelf regions in Antarctica and the Arctic, he said, but the abundance of such species was much higher under the ice shelves, especially under Larsen B. \nOne of the earliest changes was the development of phytoplankton blooms in the open water when such areas were exposed to sunlight, which led in turn to the development of populations of zooplankton and small crustaceans known as krill, he said. \nMinke whales, a krill-feeding species, were the first marine mammals seen to take advantage of the new food resources in the exposed areas, while also evading orcas, their most common predator. Orcas are found in higher latitudes and seemed slower to adapt to a more southern habitat, Gutt said. \nThe newly exposed areas may follow a similar pattern of colonization by wildlife species as Larsen A and B, but Larsen C might also prove to be entirely different, Gutt said. \n\"This is quite an interesting challenge in this kind of marine ecology \u2014 how an ecosystem develops can be very important, and the results will [let scientists] assess how fast they can respond to any environmental changes, including climate change and anthropogenic changes,\" he said. \"So, this can be seen as a big experiment carried out by nature, and we can learn from this big experiment how marine systems develop under the pressure of environmental change.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science .

According to a new study from Ireland, both materials can generate electricity, thanks to an enzyme they contain. \nThe enzyme, called lysozyme, is also found in saliva and mammalian milk, according to the study, which was published Oct. 2 in the Journal of Applied Physics . The enzyme is anti-bacterial; it attacks the cell walls of bacteria, weakening them. \nWhen lysozyme is in a crystalized form, it also appears to have a property called piezoelectricity, meaning the enzyme can convert mechanical energy (when pressure is applied to it) into electrical energy, the researchers wrote. [ 7 Biggest Mysteries of the Human Body ] \nThough the name may sound foreign, \"piezoelectricity is used all around us,\" lead study author Aimee Stapleton, a postgraduate fellow studying physics at the University of Limerick in Ireland, said in statement. For example, piezoelectric materials such as quartz crystals are used in mobile phones (as the vibrating component) and deep-ocean sonar, according to the statement. \nIndeed, materials such as bone, wood, tendons and proteins (including collagen and keratin) have piezoelectric properties, according to the study. \nBut \"the capacity to generate electricity from this particular protein [lysozyme] has not been explored,\" Stapleton said. \nTo study the piezoelectric properties of lysozymes, the scientists applied a crystalized form of the enzyme to films. Researchers then applied mechanical force to these films and recorded the amount of electricity generated. \nThe scientists found that lysozyme could generate electricity just as well as quartz could. But lysozyme is a biological material, so it could have medical applications. Lysozymes are \"nontoxic, so [they] could have many innovative applications, such as electroactive, anti-microbial coatings for medical implants,\" Stapleton said. \nThe researchers think that, in the future, lysozymes could be used to power biomedical devices that are used in people's bodies, the scientists wrote in the study. The enzymes could also be used to power and control the release of drugs in the body, the study said. \nMore research is needed, however, before the enzyme can be used for these purposes, the researchers said. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

But the critter was far from a medical marvel \u2014 rather, the crab-shaped parasite was a lowly pubic louse. \nThe doctors spotted the pubic louse ( Phthirus pubis) when they were examining a 65-year-old man who said he'd had severe itching in his groin area for the past six weeks, according to a brief report of the man's case, published today (Oct. 4) in The New England Journal of Medicine . \nIn addition to the acrobatic louse, doctors found a louse nit, or egg, firmly attached to a pubic hair, according to the case report. The man had no lesions on his skin, the doctors wrote. [ 27 Oddest Medical Cases ] \nPubic pediculosis, or an infestation of pubic lice , is usually transmitted through sexual contact, but it can also be spread via clothing, bedding and towels, according to the report. The man in this case told doctors that he'd had no recent sexual contact. \nThe lice can be found on coarse hair anywhere on the body, such as on the chest, armpit or leg; in the man's case, the infestation was limited to his pubic region. \nThe man was treated with an oral anti-parasite medicine called ivermectin. He was examined and treated in Mexico; in the U.S., oral ivermectin isn't approved for the treatment of lice, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Instead, special lotions and shampoos are recommended. \nTwo weeks after his treatment, the man's itching had stopped, and at a follow-up exam two weeks after that, doctors found no signs of lice. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Original Image Credit: ESA/IPMB \nWhen humans finally journey to Mars, they won't be the only living things on board the spacecraft; millions upon millions of microbes that live on and in these pioneering astronauts' bodies will also be along for the ride. \nUnderstanding how these microbes can grow, spread and adapt in the spacecraft's confined conditions is important for ensuring the health of the astronauts who participate in such future long-term space missions. And a new study offers insight into how these bacteria might behave in such an environment. \nSix men who lived as \"Marsonauts\" for more than a year inside a mock spacecraft in Moscow have revealed how the multitude of microbes that live on astronauts' bodies can adapt and spread throughout a confined environment, according to the study. [ The 7 Most Mars-Like Places on Earth ] \n\"In addition to potential health risks for the crew, some of these microorganisms could have a negative impact on spacecraft, as they grow on and might damage spacecraft material,\" co-researcher Petra Schwendner, from the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said in a statement . \nFor 520 days (the approximate time it would take to reach Mars), a crew of six male Marsonauts lived and worked in a mock spacecraft in Moscow, which was designed to simulate conditions that astronauts would experience during missions to Mars . Specifically, the crew studied how microorganisms such as bacteria adapted to the confined conditions and spread throughout the spacecraft. \n\"Until now, little was known about the influence of long-term confinement on the microorganisms that live inside habitats that may one day be used to travel to other planets, and whether the structure of the microbiota changes with time,\" Schwendner said in the statement. \nOver the course of the study \u2014 which lasted from June 3, 2010, to Nov. 5, 2011 \u2014 the Marsonauts followed a strict diet and schedule, all while remaining completely isolated in the mock habitat , called Mars500 . Using air filters and swabs, the crew collected 360 microbial samples from the air and different surfaces inside the spacecraft. \nThe researchers found that, in addition to human habitation \u2014 each person has his or her own microbiota, or population of microbes \u2014 confinement largely contributed to the type of bacteria present. \nThe study found that microbes associated with humans, including Bacillusand Staphylococcus , were the most prevalent throughout the habitat, suggesting that the crew was the main source of the microbial dispersal. For example, Staphylococcus \u2014 a type of bacteria commonly found in the nose and respiratory tract and on the skin, and some strains of which are known to cause skin infections \u2014 was likely dispersed via skin flakes shed by the crew, according to the statement. \nIn addition, the crew also detected unique bacterial signatures in different areas of the spacecraft. Communal areas, sleep areas, the gym and the bathroom, for example, had the highest numbers and greatest diversity of bacteria; the lowest levels of bacteria were found inside the medical module (where medical and psychological experiments took place and sanitary conditions were required), according to the study. \nThe researchers also saw the effect of cleaning agents on the bacteria. \"Although we located some microbial hotspots, where the number of bacteria was much higher than in other areas, we were quite relieved to find that the overall bacterial counts were within the acceptable limits,\" Schwendner said. \"Due to appropriate cleaning measures, the microbial community inside the habitat was under control at all times with no or little risk for the crew.\" \nA high level of bacterial diversity is generally considered healthy. However, the study also showed that over time, bacterial diversity dropped, and certain opportunistic, stress-tolerant pathogens became more prevalent. Such a scenario could create a problem for astronauts enduring long-duration isolation, because these types of bacteria could make the astronauts sick, according to the researchers. \n\"Countermeasures may be required to avoid development of highly resistant, adapted microorganisms and a complete loss of microbial diversity,\" Schwendner said. \nTheir findings were published Oct. 4 in the journal Microbiome. \nOriginal article on Live Science.

Credit: Worakit Sirijinda | Shutterstock \nThe Palace of Versailles is an opulent complex and former royal residence outside of Paris. It has held sway in the public imagination for years because of its architectural grandeur and political history. \n\"To the public imagination, Versailles is the epitome of opulence,\" said Louise Boisen Schmidt, a Denmark-based writer at This Is Versailles . \" It represents an age in French history of both France's rise as a fashion and power center as well as the dramatic \u2014 and bloody \u2014 decline of the monarchy.\" \nLocated about 10 miles (16 kilometers) southwest of Paris, the palace is beside the settlement of Versailles. The town was little more than a hamlet before becoming the seat of royal power. By the time of the French Revolution, it had a population of more than 60,000 people, making it one of the largest urban centers in France. From hunting lodge to palace \nFrance's kings were first attracted to Versailles because of the area's prolific game. Louis XIII, who lived 1601-1643, bought up land, built a chateau and went on hunting trips. At the time, much of the land around Versailles was uncultivated, allowing wild animals to flourish. \nThe chateau Louis XIII built was little more than a hunting lodge having enough space to house the king and a small entourage. It was his successor, Louis XIV (1638-1715), the \"Sun King,\" a ruler who chose the sun as his emblem and believed in centralized government with the king at its center, who would radically transform Versailles making it the seat of France's government by the time of his death. Versailles features many fountains that were technological marvels for their time. Credit: Joan Quevado Fle Shutterstock \nLouis XIV ruled France for 72 years, and in that time transformed Versailles by encompassing Louis XIII's chateau with a palace that contained north and south wings, as well as nearby buildings housing ministries. \nVersailles was built to impress. \"The most important message Louis XIV sent through the architecture of Versailles was his ultimate power,\" said Tea Gudek Snajdar, an Amsterdam-based art historian, museum docent and a blogger at Culture Tourist . \"He is an absolute monarch, untouchable and distant. But, even more then that, he is the Sun King. That symbolism of the Sun King is very visible in the architecture of the Versailles. The painter Lebrun, who designed the iconographic program of the Palace, focused paintings, sculptures and the architecture to one goal only \u2014 celebrating the King.\" \nA series of gardens, created in a formal style, stood to the west of the palace (one of them today is in the shape of a star) and contained sculptures as well as the pressurized fountains capable of launching water high into the air. The formality and grandeur of the gardens symbolized Louis XIV's absolute power, even over nature, according to Gudek Snajder. \n\"From the outset Louis attached a supreme importance to these water effects. Their virtuosity formed the star turn of a tour of the gardens,\" writes Tony Spawforth, a professor at Newcastle University, in his book \"Versailles: A Biography of a Palace\" (St. Martin's Press, 2008). \"The effects were the work of engineers whose machines made Versailles a hydraulic as much as an artistic wonder.\" Unfortunately, Spawforth notes, problems supplying water meant that the fountains could only be turned on during special occasions. \nIn addition a grand canal, constructed to the west of the garden and running about a mile long, was used for naval demonstrations and had gondolas, donated by the Republic of Venice, steered by gondoliers. \nBuilding such a lavish complex was an important part of Louis XIV's style of rule and beliefs about monarchy, which we would call absolutism, said Schmidt. \"As king of France he was the embodiment of France \u2014 and his palace was meant to display the wealth and power of his nation,\" she said. \"Furthermore, it was vital to him to enhance France's status in Europe; not just by military feats but in the arts as well. For instance, when the Hall of Mirrors was built, mirrors were usually imported from Italy at a great cost. Louis XIV wanted to show that France could produce mirrors just as fine as those produced in Italy, and consequently, all the mirrors of that hall were made on French soil.\" \nLouis also insisted on moving the French government to Versailles. Scholars have suggested a number of factors that led him to build a great palace complex at Versailles and move the French government there. It's been noted that by keeping the king's residence some distance from Paris, it offered him protection from any civil unrest going on in the city. It also forced the nobles to travel to Versailles and seek lodging in the palace, something that impeded their ability to build up regional power bases that could potentially challenge the king. \nAs the French government moved into Versailles, and the king found himself swamped by work in his palace, he built himself the Grand (also called Marble) Trianon, a more modest palatial structure, about a mile (1.6 kilometers) to the northwest of the palace as a private retreat where only he and those invited could visit. Inside the palace \nSpawforth notes that the palace contained about 350 living units varying in size, from multi-room apartments to spaces about the size of an alcove. The size and location of the room a person got depended on their rank and standing with the king. While the crown prince (known as the dauphin) got a sprawling apartment on the ground floor, a servant may have nothing more than a space in an attic or a makeshift room behind a staircase. \nLouis XIV's bedroom was built on the upper floor and located centrally along the east-west axis of the palace. It was the most important room and was the location of two important ceremonies where the king would wake up ( lever ) and go to sleep ( coucher ) surrounded by his courtiers. The king also had a ceremony for putting on and taking off his hunting boots. The Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles. Credit: Jose Ignacio Soto Shutterstock \nThese practices were symbols of Louis XIV's moniker of Sun King. \"His court was seen as microcosms of the universe and the king is the sun that shines over everything. Each action he would took (having a meal, strolling through the garden) became symbolic metaphor for his divine presence,\" explained Gudek Snajdar. \"The 'Escalier des Ambassadeurs' was the first and the most important Baroque ceremonial staircase. The interaction between the visitor and the king could be directed here in the most careful fashion.\" \nThe importance of the courtiers' presence at these ceremonies continued into the reigns of Louis XV and XVI. Spawforth notes that a courtier in 1784 wrote that \"most of the people who come to the court are persuaded that, to make their way there, they must show themselves everywhere, be absent as little possible at the king's lever , removal of the boots, and coucher , show themselves assiduously at the dinners of the royal family ... in short, must ceaselessly work at having themselves noticed.\" \nThe king had his throne in the \"Apollo Salon\" and worshiped in a royal chapel, which spanned two stories, which Bajou notes was built between 1699 and 1710. \nDespite the richness of the palace, the kings had to make do with makeshift theaters up until 1768 when Louis XV allowed the building of the royal opera. It contained a mechanism that allowed the orchestra level to be raised to the stage allowing it to be used for dancing and banqueting. Spawforth notes that the opera required 3,000 candles to be burned for opening night and was rarely used due to its cost and the poor shape of France's finances. Art and architecture \nAccording to Schmidt, to our modern eyes, Versailles is a perfect example of baroque and rococo architecture. But, said Gudek Snajdar, the French of the time would not have considered it baroque. \"And it's understandable why,\" she said. \"It's very different from, for example, Italian baroque architecture, which served as an inspiration for other European countries during that time.\" \nHaving his palace evoke Italian baroque architecture would have angered Louis XIV. It would have gone against his sense of absolutism, said Gudek Snajdar, the belief that he is at the center of everything. In fact, Louis XIV fired a famous Italian architect hired to work on the Louvre Palace, which was built not long before Versailles. \nSome art historians now call the style of the Louvre and Versailles \"French classicism.\" They possess somewhat different features than Italian baroque architecture, including the emphasis on symbols of power and timeless domination. Other types of baroque architecture featured symbolic art, but not necessarily with the emphasis on divine right, kingly power and timeless rule. \n\" Everything in the Versailles of Louis XIV had a symbolic meaning,\" said Schmidt. \"The ceilings are adorned with illustrations of Roman gods with Louis XIV himself painted as Apollo, the Sun God. Throughout the palace you will find the intertwined L's of his name. It all serves as a constant reminder that he is the king and all power comes from him by the grace of God.\" \nThe decoration also emphasized the achievements of the king. \" The 'Hall of Mirrors' and the adjacent Salons of War and Peace were decorated with the history of the king,\" said Gudek Snajdar. The Hall of Mirrors has 30 tableaux that depict an epic story of Louis XIV's achievements and aspirations. Victory in battle features prominently in these narratives, with one example showing Louis with his army crossing the Rhine River in 1672. He is dressed in Roman clothes, his long hair flows behind him, and he holds a thunderbolt like a projectile. He sits like a god in a chariot that is being pushed by none other than Hercules himself. Estate of Marie Antoinette \nNear the Grand Trianon, Marie Antoinette, the queen of Louis XVI, created an estate for herself. She took over a building called the \"Petit Trianon\" and built a number of structures, including a working farm (also called the \"hamlet\"), which provided the palace with fresh produce, and a nearby house and small theater. \nShe also built a \"Temple of Love,\" which modern-day curators say can be seen from her room in the Petit Trianon. It features a dome propped up by nearly a dozen columns covering a statue, which shows a depiction of \"Cupid cutting his bow from the club of Hercules,\" Bajou writes. \nAdditionally, she built the charming \"grotto,\" a cave that had a moss bed for Marie Antoinette to lie on. It had two entrances, prompting much speculation as to what went on in it. \nThough Marie Antoinette is known for her lavishness, in reality she did not always enjoy being queen. Her estate reflects a desire for a simpler life and homesickness for her native Austria. \"Marie Antoinette grew up in Vienna as the youngest daughter of Empress Maria Theresa and Francis I. In the Habsburg Empire, royalty was allotted a far greater sense of privacy and she had a remarkably \"normal\" upbringing,\" explained Schmidt. \"During her childhood she would enjoy private family dinners and played with commoners' children, but at Versailles that was impossible. Once she had become Dauphine, her life was constantly in the spotlight. Etiquette demanded that she dine before a seemingly never-ending crowd of spectators and getting dressed was a court ceremony in itself.\" \nMarie Antoinette attempted to break some etiquette rules but was opposed by the court and the French people. She built the Hamlet and took over the Petit Trianon so that she could escape the many watchful eyes and be herself. It was an attempt to \"recreate some of her dearly missed childhood.\" American history at Versailles \n\nTwo key events in the American Revolution happened at Versailles. Benjamin Franklin, acting on behalf of a newly independent United States, negotiated a treaty with Louis XVI, which led to America getting critical support from the French military. Spawforth notes that Louis XVI would have one of his inventions, a \"Franklin chimney,\" installed that produced less smoke than an ordinary fireplace. \nFittingly, the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the Revolutionary War, was signed on Sept. 3, 1783, at Versailles, close to the palace in the nearby foreign affairs building. Several decades later, when King Louis Philippe (reign 1830-1848) was turning Versailles into a museum, he would include a painting that depicts the siege of Yorktown, a decisive victory in the Revolutionary War in which the Americans and French cooperated against the British. \nAmerica would reciprocate in the 1920s when oil millionaire John D. Rockefeller Jr. paid to have the palace's expansive roof restored, among other buildings. Versailles after the fall \nAfter the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette would be stripped of power, brought to Paris and ultimately beheaded. The palace fell under the control of the new republican government. \nMany of its furnishings were sold to help pay for the subsequent Revolutionary Wars. When Napoleon came to power, he had an apartment created for himself in the Grand Trianon, complete with a map room. \nKing Louis Philippe, in the museum he created, showcased different aspects of French history. The Battles Gallery can still be seen today with its modern-day keepers noting that the gallery's art depicts every main French battle between the Battle of Tolbiac in A.D. 496 and the Battle of Wagram in 1809. \nIn the late 19th and 20th centuries, Versailles curators would convert many of the museum areas back into palace space, trying to show how they looked before the French Revolution. \nTwo more pivotal events would occur at Versailles in this post-revolutionary period. In 1871, after France had lost a war against Prussia, Kaiser Wilhelm I was proclaimed Emperor of Germany in the Hall of Mirrors, adding an extra layer of humiliation to the French defeat. For several years after this defeat, the situation in France was so bad that its Chamber of Deputies and Senate opted to meet at Versailles, rather than Paris, for reasons of safety. \nIn 1919, France would have its revenge, of sorts, when the Treaty of Versailles, which imposed reparations on Germany, was signed in the same hall. Although the treaty formally ended World War I, it has been argued by some that it helped pave the way for World War II. Even then, centuries after its modest start as a hunting lodge, events still took place at Versailles that ultimately helped shaped the world we live in today. Legacy \nToday, Versailles is one of the most-visited sites in France. Visitors are drawn to its architectural grandeur, the stunning water features (concerts are often played in the gardens during the summer) and its sense of history. \nAs a symbol, Versailles can be understood as one of opposites, said Schmidt. It reflects both the beauty and culture of France and its tumultuous history. \"When it was built, it was a marvel (and still is) and represented France's power. However, toward the end of the 18th century it became more of a symbol of the aristocracy's wealth, which stood in stark contrast to that of the common people. The entire mindset of society had changed with the Enlightenment, which caused the palace to be seen as a symbol of the old regime.\" Author Bio Owen Jarus, Live Science Contributor \nOwen Jarus writes about archaeology and all things about humans' past for Live Science.

Credit: Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO \nA graceful bronze arm that was once attached to a statue dating to the first century was recently recovered from a famed shipwreck near the Greek island of Antikythera. That site has already yielded a treasure trove of artifacts, including the mysterious astronomical computer and calculator called the Antikythera mechanism. \nThe newly discovered limb joins other bronze and marble statue fragments discovered during the same expedition. Together, these artifacts indicate that there are likely more statues to be found buried in the seabed around the wrecked vessel, representatives of the \" Return to Antikythera \" project reported in a statement released today (Oct. 4). \nDivers with the expedition, part of an international partnership under the supervision of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports (HMCS), visited Antikythera between Sept. 4 and 20 and recovered other precious relics in addition to the statue pieces, according to the statement. Those finds included a mysterious metal disk decorated with an image of a bull. [ In Photos: Diving for Famed Antikythera Shipwreck ] \nAs it happens, a bronze statue arm was also the very first object recovered from the wreck when it was discovered in 1900, according to the excavation project website . \nExperts afterward determined that the vessel likely sank between 70 B.C. and 60 B.C., and is 2,085 years old. It carried a vast cargo of luxury goods , including glassware, gemstones, coins and jewelry, and statues of marble and bronze; hundreds of these objects were recovered in 1976 in an expedition conducted by the underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau. \nDuring the recent expedition, archaeologists were drawn to certain features on a part of the seafloor that suggested the area might merit a closer look, field project co-director Brendan Foley, a researcher with the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Lund University in Sweden, told Live Science in an email. Those features included a red marble plaque and a marble statue base. A rectangular slab of marble embedded in the seafloor drew the attention of underwater archaeologists. Credit: Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO \n\n\"We investigated further, test trenched [dug trenches at the site without excavating further], metal detected and began to find extremely interesting finds, including wooden-hull remains, large bronze nails and spikes from the hull, and then the bronze sculpture elements,\" Foley said. \nIn addition to the bronze arm and the marble pieces, the archaeologists found a bronze statue piece with clothing folds, and a highly oxidized disk with four holes punched along its edge, HMCS representatives reported in a statement . Scans of the disk revealed the shape of \"possibly a bovine animal\" under layers of detritus and corrosion, according to the statement. \nThe scientists also found wooden ship parts; their condition and location, relative to where the cargo was found, will help experts peer back in time and reconstruct the scene of the shipwreck, HMCS representatives said. Radiography of a disk revealed the image of an animal, possibly a bull, under layers of corrosion. Credit: Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO \n\nMany fascinating objects have emerged from the site over time, but one of the best-known finds is a celestial calculator known as the Antikythera mechanism , which was also salvaged during initial dives to the site in 1900. This complex machine is thought to be capable of displaying dates, the positions of the moon and sun, and planetary cycles, as well as predicting eclipses over a period of 223 months. \nThen, in August 2016, archaeologists detected evidence of human remains in the wreck, providing a possible source of ancient DNA. The remains, a skeleton, were not the first found at the site; bones were also recovered from the Antikythera shipwreck in 1976. But for the first time, technology existed that could allow scientists to extract genetic information from the preserved organic material. \nWhile the prospect of an ancient \"computer\" or the extraction of 2,000-year-old DNA sounds arguably more exciting than the newly discovered statue arm, the recent finds are historically significant, Foley told Live Science. Few bronze sculptures from ancient Greece have survived to the modern age, and none that were previously found underwater were recovered directly from an archaeological site, he said. This provides critical historical context for artifacts, he explained. \n\"We have the chance to bring scientific methods to bear on these sculptures, to excavate carefully and precisely, and then give back to the world fabulous ancient artwork,\" he said. [ In Photos: Mission to 2,000-Year-Old Antikythera Shipwreck ] \nThe scientists' work is far from over. Antikythera still holds many secrets in its watery ruins, and the archaeologists plan to return in the spring to uncover more of those mysteries, Foley said. \n\"We have some large boulders to remove in order to access the bronze sculptures that are surely beneath them. And we have a lot of sediment to excavate, so we can expose, document and recover the goods that were in the ship's cargo hold,\" he said. \nThe site covers a lot of ground, measuring approximately 164 square feet (50 square meters) at ocean depths ranging from 131 to 184 feet (40 m to 56 m), Foley said. The team has scanned much of the area with metal detectors, and the researchers have mapped the surrounding area of 34,449 square feet (10,500 square m) using sonar. But to date, they have opened only 10 test trenches, just two of which have been excavated. \nThose two trenches account for only a fraction of the site , Foley told Live Science. \n\"The most time-consuming aspect of the investigation is excavation,\" Foley said. \"Lots of work ahead of us.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: Ian Brooks/CRAG \nAmateur archaeologists excavating a Bronze Age site in the United Kingdom have discovered a cache of unusual stone tools unlike any that have been found before. \nThe tools appear to have been deposited deliberately \u2014 perhaps ceremonially \u2014 in what would have been a stream around 4,500 years ago, according to the researchers. \nAround 20 of the roughly triangular stone hand tools , of various sizes, were found at the excavation site in the Clwydian Range, a series of hills in Denbighshire in northeast Wales, by the Clwydian Range Archaeological Group (CRAG) during four weeks of excavations in July and August. [ See More Photos of the Stone Tools at the Bronze-Age Site ] \nCRAG is made up of local people who have trained for several years in archaeological techniques under the guidance of professional archaeologists. Mystery tools \nIan Brooks, an archaeologist employed as a consultant by CRAG, said the tools discovered by the group were like nothing found before in the area. \n\"I've not seen anything like them before, and I've talked to a number of colleagues who've never seen anything like them,\" Brooks told Live Science. \nHe said the tools were made from a hard limestone found locally, but not in the immediate area of the excavation. \n\"They are rough slabs of the limestone, which have been shaped to produce one pointed end,\" he said. \nThe tools vary in size, between 2 inches (50 millimeters) long to about 8.6 inches (220 mm) long. \"But they all have this characteristic point at one end, which has then been battered \u2014 you've got pitting and distinctive damage on the end, so they've been heavily used,\" Brooks said. \nThe purpose of the tools is unknown, and future work by the archaeological team would include examining the utensils in more detail. But, it's possible that the tools were used for chipping ornamental designs onto rock surfaces , he said. \n\"One of the things that you do get in the Bronze Age is the decoration of natural boulders and rock faces, producing things like cut marks and rings and suchlike,\" Brooks said. \"The point on these things would be about the right sort of size for pecking that sort of design.\" Ancient stream \nBrooks explained that all of the mysterious stone tools were found at the bottom of what would have been a stream around 4,500 years ago, on a plateau northeast of the Moel Arthur hill fort \u2014 one of six hill forts in the Clwydian Range thought to have been built around 800 B.C., during the Iron Age in Britain. [ 24 Amazing Archaeological Discoveries ] Excavations by researchers from Oxford University at the Moel-y-Gaer hillfort, near the village of Bodfari, have found roundhouse dwellings and examined the construction of the earthen ramparts. Credit: University of Oxford \nBrooks thinks the site where the tools were found could be more than 1,000 years older than the hill fort itself, based on carbon dating of stones from an archaeological feature known as a \"burnt mound.\" An excavation of the burnt mound by CRAG members in 2013 found that it was used to produce large amounts of hot water, by heating stones in a fire and dropping them into a trough-shaped pit filled with water from the nearby stream, he said. \nCarbon dating has revealed that the burnt mound, located beside the former streambed, dates to between 2456 to 2583 B.C., Brooks said. \nWhile the purpose of that activity is not known, it's possible that the hot water was used for cooking, or for brewing beer , or for producing steam for a sweat lodge, according to Brooks. \nThe limestone tools did not seem directly related to the activity at the burnt mound, but they appeared to have been deposited on purpose at a particular spot nearby, in what would have been a running stream at the time, he said. Bronze Age agriculturalists \nBrooks thinks the tools and the activity at the burnt mound were probably associated with a variety of activities going on at the site for a time during the Bronze Age. \nGeophysical surveys, funded by CRAG in 2011 and 2012, indicated that the plateau near the burnt mound and the ancient stream may have included a small settlement of roundhouses, a typical style of dwelling in Bronze Age Britain. \nThe inhabitants of the roundhouses were likely to have been agriculturalists, rather than nomadic hunter-gatherers , Brooks said. In the early Bronze Age, the climate in North Wales was warmer by around 3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (2 to 3 degrees Celsius), and there was evidence that grain crops were grown at that time on the broad tops of hills in the area. \n\"The likelihood is that the Clwydian Range was more intensively used than the Vale of Clwyd itself, which is likely to have been wet and nasty, with heavier lands which were less suitable for simple plowing,\" Brooks said. \nFiona Gale, the county archaeologist for Denbighshire, said that the limestone tools and other evidence from the CRAG excavations show that there were people living in the area much earlier than the Iron Age, when the hill forts were built. \nSix hill forts were found in the Clwydian Range, two of which were the subject of ongoing excavations by archaeologists from the University of Liverpool and Oxford University, and the work by CRAG fit in with that wider project, Gale said. \nThe purpose of the hill forts themselves remains something of a mystery, she said, with modern research suggesting that the traditional explanation \u2014 that they were mainly used for defense against attacks by hostile communities \u2014 was probably not their main function. \nInstead, many researchers now think that the construction of hill forts may have mainly been a symbol of status: \"look at us, we can build all this,\" Gale said. \nOthers suggest that they served as central places for the distribution of produce, or that some may be linked to particular local festivals, or that they provided protection for herd animals against predators like wolves and bears. \n\"These are all things that we don't know, but with more work and more excavations, we will get some answers to some of these things \u2014 the more we do, the more information we will have,\" Gale said. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

(iStock)\nThere's nothing quite like the rush of seeing your favorite sports team pull off a win at the last second. But watching live sports can put some serious stress on your heart, a new, small study finds.\nWatching a hockey game live can more than double a fan's heart rate, according to the study. And you don't even have to be in the arena for your heart rate to climb: Catching the game on TV can also have an effect, according to the study, published today (Oct. 5) in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology.\nThe excitement of sports is likely responsible for the observed increases in heart rate, said study author Dr. Paul Khairy, a cardiologist at the Montreal Heart Institute.\nMOM LOSES FINGER IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT SON'S BASEBALL PRACTICE\nBut the new study is the first to demonstrate that the ambience of a live game \u2014 being surrounded by cheering fans, being closer to the action and experiencing an increased level of engagement \u2014 may all contribute to the heightened emotional stress response in fans, Khairy told Live Science.\nIn the study, the heart rates of fans who watched a hockey game in person increased by 110 percent, on average, from their resting heart rates. That's comparable to the increase you'd see in someone running, jumping rope or doing any other vigorous form of exercise, Khairy said.\nFans who watched the same game on TV had a 75 percent increase in their heart rates, on average, which is similar to the heart rates seen with moderate physical activity, such as a casual bike ride, Khairy noted.\nThis is the first time that the heart-rate response of hockey spectators has been measured, the researchers wrote. But previous studies from Europe have found higher heart rates in soccer fans who watched World Cup matches in person. These increases occurred after their team scored a goal or after their team beat an opponent.\nIn the new study, the researchers looked only at fans of the Montreal Canadiens, a team with an avid fan base in a country where hockey is considered the national winter sport. The study was the brainchild of two 13-year-old girls in Canada, one of whom was Khairy's daughter.\nMore on this...

Half of the participants attended Canadiens games while the rest watched the action at home. Both groups wore heart-rate monitors during the games.\nBecause the researchers included fans of only one team, the results may not apply to all hockey fans, the study noted.\nTaking hockey to heart The study found that fans' heart rates peaked most often during overtime periods. The second-most-stressful time for fans was during scoring opportunities by the Canadiens, followed by the opposing team's attempts to put the puck in the net.\nSurprisingly, a person's interest in the sport and engagement as a fan were not linked to changes in heart rate during the game, Khairy said. However, he added that he suspects there might have been a different result if researchers had developed their own way to measure passion in hockey fans rather than adapting a tool originally designed for soccer spectators.\nDONORS CONTINUE TO LINE UP AT BLOOD CENTERS IN RESPONSE TO LAS VEGAS MASSACRE\nAlthough fans watching any sport can experience a similar amount of excitement as was observed in this group of hockey enthusiasts, these results may not apply to other sports, Khairy said. There are too many elements that differ among sports \u2014 such as the pace of the game, a fan's emotional attachment to a team, and even the number of high-intensity moments \u2014 that prevent researchers from making similar generalizations, he said.\nA fan's emotional reaction to a game can be intense, Khairy said, and that could trigger cardiovascular problems.\nFans who experience cardiac symptoms during a game should seek immediate medical attention rather than waiting for a convenient moment, such as in-between periods, Khairy said. Many arenas and ice rinks have cardiac defibrillators on hand, as well as people trained in using them, he added.\nOriginally published on Live Science .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T16:37:02.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "16b6d27b00034e71d3a3a2566237186de4816210", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmnFfijd9EtgobKPgS7DD8PQu9uVmGGFWCByJDIg0kjw7G8hfO3hc3zB4kBrVM6LvcLwo0tWFnlA9pHZQ0c1Ns5WWRK4.WF6X2", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/livescience/YpIK", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Live Science", "title": "Different Meditation Practices Reshape Brain in Different Ways", "title_full": "Different Meditation Practices Reshape Brain in Different Ways", "published": "2017-10-05T18:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA4My8wMTAvb3JpZ2luYWwvbWVkaXRhdGlvbi16ZW4uanBn", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "16b6d27b00034e71d3a3a2566237186de4816210", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmnFfijd9EtgobKPgS7DD8PQu9uVmGGFWCByJDIg0kjw7G8hfO3hc3zB4kBrVM6LvcLwo0tWFnlA9pHZQ0c1Ns5WWRK4.WF6X2", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-05T18:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Different Meditation Practices Reshape Brain in Different Ways", "text": "Different Meditation Practices Reshape Brain in Different Ways By Tereza Pultarova, Live Science Contributor | October 5, 2017 11:50am ET MORE Credit: Mooshny/Shutterstock \nDifferent types of meditation change the brain in different ways, a new study finds. \nIn one of the largest studies on meditation and the human brain to date, a team of neuroscience researchers at the Max Planck Institute of Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Germany examined 300 participants in a nine-month meditation program. The project, called ReSource, consisted of three periods of three months each. During this program, the participants each practiced different three types of meditation focused on improving attention, compassion or cognitive skills. \nAt the beginning of the program, and then again at the end of each three-month period, the researchers took measurements of the participants\u2019 brains using a variety of techniques, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The researchers found that not only did certain brain regions change substantially within the three-month periods, but these regions also changed differently based on the type of meditation the participants had practiced. [ Mind Games: 7 Reasons You Should Meditate ] \n\"We were surprised [by] how much can actually happen in three months, because three months isn't that long,\" said Veronika Engert, a neuroscience researcher at Max Planck. Engert was the lead author of one of two papers published on Oct. 4 by the research group in the journal Science Advances . \nEngert told LiveScience that while changes in brain structure after intensive meditation programs have been observed before, this is the first time that researchers could clearly see the changes that followed a period of practicing a specific type of meditation. \nThe participants were divided into three groups, and practiced each type of meditation in a different order. This allowed the researchers to more reliably link the changes in the brain to the type of meditation that was being practiced. \nFor example, in one part of the study, a group of participants was asked to practice mindfulness-based attention for 30 minutes daily six days a week for three months. During this type of meditation, the participants were taught to focus on their breath with their eyes closed or to monitor tension in their bodies. At the end of the three-month period, the participants showed thickening in the prefrontal cortex of the brain, an area involved in complex thinking, decision-making and attention, Engert said. \nAfter the three-month session that focused on mindfulness, that group moved on to types of mediation focused on developing social skills such as compassion and understanding a situation from a perspective of another person. As with the first session, the researchers observed different changes in the people's brains after each of the next two sessions. \n\"If people train [in the skill of] perspective-taking, we see changes in brain regions that are important for these cognitive processes\" Engert said. Or, if people focus on affect, or emotion, \"then we see changes in brain regions that are important for emotional regulation,\" she said. \nBut the participants' brains weren't the only things that were changing. The researchers also observed changes in the behavior of the participants, and these changes matched up with the changes in their brains. Stress and meditation \nIn another part of the study, the researchers measured how the participants responded to a stressful situation similar to a job interview or an exam. The scientists found that all respondents who were practicing meditation reported feeling less stressed than people who were not meditating. However, only those participants practicing compassion and perspective-taking showed consistently lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol in their saliva after the stressful situation, according to Engert. \n\"After this type of a stress test we usually see that cortisol rises after about 20 minutes,\" said Engert. \"This rise in cortisol was lower by 51 percent in those subjects who had the social training.\" \nOne limitation of the study was that the participants included only healthy people who did not have any type of mental health condition. Engert said the researchers haven\u2019t looked at whether meditation could be used to, for example, help people suffering from depression or anxiety. However, Engert said, considering the fact that stress is a major contributor to a wide range of diseases that plague the modern world, the findings could help tailor approaches that could be used as preventive measures . Stress, according to Engert contributes not only to the development of depression but also cardiovascular or metabolic diseases. \nIn addition, the findings could help researchers develop tailored training programs for specific areas of the brain to help people perform better in various areas of their lives, she said, however, more research is needed to understand exactly how such programs affect the brain. \nThe team will now focus on studying the effects of the three mind-training techniques on children and people working in highly stressful professions, Engert said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-05T20:18:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a05b960dac37c78e73faac518721cf7f4f7b0f76", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmY3mdDu7UbWT5CHOYZwI6riCE43Ehy58Hqtx0SkyxCjYRdRRB7lD7TDMP9z9JA2N6YSU8PJkOx0kJM62VFOMUqg--", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/livescience/YpIK", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Live Science", "title": "Man v.

Snake: 26-Foot-Long Python Loses Epic Battle By Stephanie Pappas, Live Science Contributor | October 5, 2017 02:53pm ET MORE \nA village in Indonesia enjoyed a snake-meat feast this weekend after a resident wrestled and killed a 26-foot-long (7.8 meters) python. \nThe python was of the species Malopython reticulatus , said Donal Boyer, the curator of herpetology at the Wildlife Conservation Society. Also known as the reticulated python , the snake is found all over Southeast Asia and has been reported to grow up to 30 feet (9.1 m) long, though snakes of that size are \"quite rare,\" Boyer said. Just last year, a 26.2-foot-long (8 m) reticulated python was captured at a construction site in Malaysia, though the reptile died three days later while laying an egg. \nAccording to the BBC, a security guard named Robert Nababan stumbled across the snake on a road inside a palm oil plantation in the Sumatran district of Batang Gansal. [ In Images: Hungry Python Eats Porcupine Whole ] \n\"I tried to catch it, my hand was bitten, and I managed to wrestle it,\" Nababan told Detik, an Indonesian news outlet. \nA government official told the BBC that Nababan's arm was severely injured by the bite and might have to be amputated. \nM. reticulatus usually eats mice and other small- to medium-size prey, including domesticated animals like chickens, pigs and dogs. In Singapore, they've been known to chow down on invasive iguanas, according to a case report published in January 2016 in the journal Herpetological Review. They constrict their prey to suffocate it before swallowing it. And the larger the snake, the larger the prey it can take. \nThe python that attacked Nababan was provoked, Boyer said, and likely tried to bite and squeeze the guard to defend itself \u2014 not to make a meal. But reticulated pythons have very rarely been known to feed on humans. On another palm oil plantation in West Sulawesi, Indonesia, a 25-year-old man was found inside the belly of a 23-foot-long (7 m) python in March. \nA 2011 study in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reported that in the past, reticulated pythons have menaced humans in the Philippines. Data on the hunter-gatherer Agta people from 1976 revealed 16 cases of predatory reticulated python attacks over the previous decades. Two of the fatalities were children, but the pythons also constricted and killed two adults. A third adult died from an infected python bite. \nThis weekend's attack had a happier result, at least for the humans involved. Nababan killed the snake with the help of some nearby villagers, according to the BBC, and it was subsequently fried and eaten. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: \u00a9 MPI f. Evolutionary Anthropology/ J. Krause \nA female Neanderthal who lived in what is now Croatia 52,000 years ago is revealing that our \"caveman\" relatives may have passed on genes that play roles in cholesterol levels, eating disorders, arthritis and other diseases today, the researchers who sequenced her genome say. \nAnd some modern humans are carrying around more Neanderthal DNA than scientists had thought: The study found that the genomes of modern human populations that originated outside Africa hold between 1.8 and 2.6 percent Neanderthal DNA . That's much higher than previous estimates of 1.5 to 2.1 percent. \nNeanderthals were the closest extinct relatives of modern humans. Research over the past decade has revealed that Neanderthals interbred with the ancestors of modern humans who migrated out of Africa , contributing variants of genes that play a wide variety of roles in modern human biology, such as in depression, heart attacks, nicotine addiction and obesity . \nBy extracting DNA from Neanderthal fossils, researchers sequenced the genomes of five Neanderthals. However, until now, just one of these yielded high-quality data \u2014 that of a woman found in Denisova Cave , in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. The fossil of the woman, who lived about 122,000 years ago, is known as the Altai Neanderthal. [ Denisovan Gallery: Tracing the Genetics of Human Ancestors ] \nNow, scientists have fully sequenced the genome of another female Neanderthal \u2014 this one from Vindija Cave, in Croatia \u2014 who lived about 52,000 years ago. Prior work suggested that Neanderthals lived in Vindija Cave until relatively late in their history. Scientists estimate that Neanderthals in Europe went extinct around 40,000 years ago. Neanderthal genes \nIn the new study, the researchers analyzed billions of DNA segments from a bone fragment discovered in 1980. It was challenging to find a bone from Vindija Cave that carried enough Neanderthal DNA to yield high-quality data and that had relatively little contamination from modern-human and other DNA, said lead study author Kay Pr\u00fcfer, a paleogeneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. \n\"Advances in laboratory methods helped us to overcome some of these challenges, in combination with cheaper sequencing technology,\" Pr\u00fcfer told Live Science. \nThe new findings suggest that, compared with the Altai Neanderthal, the Vindija Neanderthal was more closely related to the Neanderthals who interbred with the ancestors of modern humans living outside Africa. This closer relation allowed the scientists to identify an additional 10 to 20 percent more Neanderthal DNA in modern humans. [ In Photos: Neanderthal Burials Uncovered ] \nThe newly identified Neanderthal gene variants found in modern humans play roles in blood levels of vitamin D and \"bad\" LDL cholesterol , as well as in eating disorders, body fat levels, rheumatoid arthritis, schizophrenia and responses to antipsychotic drugs, the study found. \n\"Variants from Neanderthals are not necessarily bad for your health,\" Pr\u00fcfer said. \"We find one variant that is associated with LDL cholesterol, and the variant we got from Neanderthals is associated with lower LDL cholesterol.\" \nTheir findings also suggested that modern-human DNA entered the Neanderthal gene pool. The scientists estimated that modern human gene flow into Neanderthal populations occurred between 130,000 and 145,000 years ago, before the Altai and Vindija Neanderthals diverged. Neanderthal inbreeding \nIn addition, by comparing the genomes of the Vindija Neanderthal and the Altai Neanderthal, the researchers found that the two were surprisingly similar. \n\"The two Neanderthals were separated by thousands of kilometers and probably lived tens of thousands of years separated in time as well,\" Pr\u00fcfer said. \"That is why it is so surprising to find them to be so similar.\" \nA small overall Neanderthal population size is the best explanation for this similarity, Pr\u00fcfer said. The fewer Neanderthals there were, the more likely it was that they had ancestors in common, he explained. \nPrevious research suggested that the Altai Neanderthal's parents were half-siblings, prompting scientists to wonder if Neanderthals often interbred with family members. The new Vindija genome does not have similar incestuous patterns \u2014 a finding that suggests the extreme inbreeding seen with the Altai Neanderthal may not have been common among Neanderthals. \nStill, Pr\u00fcfer noted that the two sets of chromosomes that the Vindija Neanderthal inherited from both of her parents carried only about 1.6 differences per 10,000 base pairs of DNA. (The double strands of DNA that make up each chromosome are made of sets of molecules known as base pairs.) \n\"For comparison, modern humans in Africa have around 10 differences in 10,000 [base pairs], and Europeans and Asians around seven differences in 10,000 \u2014 much more than we see in Neanderthals,\" Pr\u00fcfer said. \"This shows again that Neanderthals lived in small populations.\" \nIn the future, the researchers hope to obtain even more high-quality Neanderthal genomes. \"More Neanderthal genomes will help us to better understand how they were related in space and time, but also to narrow down which Neanderthals contributed to disease,\" Pr\u00fcfer said. \nThe scientists detailed their findings online Oct. 5 in the journal Science. \nOriginal article published on Live Science .

Then, a blue laser beam excites the cube-shaped cloud of the atoms. Credit: G.E. Marti/JILA \nA new kind of atomic clock is more precise than any yet built, with the ability to tick smoothly for a thousand times the lifetime of the universe. In addition to being the best timekeeper to date, the new so-called quantum gas clock might one day offer insights into new physics. \nResearchers at JILA (formerly also referred to as the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics) used a combination of strontium atoms and an array of laser beams to create a clock so precise it might be able to measure the interaction of gravity at smaller scales than ever before. In doing so, it might shed light on the nature of its relationship to other fundamental forces, a mystery that has baffled physicists for decades. \nAtomic clocks measure time by using the vibrations of atoms like a very precise metronome. Current atomic clocks are off by seconds over tens of billions of years. This newest iteration stays precise enough that it will be off by only 1 second over about 90 billion years. [ 5 of the Most Precise Clocks Ever Made ] \nTo get that kind of precision, the team chilled strontium atoms to keep them from moving around and bumping into one another \u2014 something that can throw off their vibrations. First, they hit the atoms with lasers. When hit by the photons in the lasers, the atoms absorbed their energy and re-emitted a photon, losing kinetic energy and getting colder. But that didn't cool them enough. So to get them even colder, the team relied on evaporative cooling, allowing some of the strontium atoms to evaporate and accept yet more energy. They were left with between 10,000 and 100,000 atoms, at a temperature of only 10 to 60 billionths of a degree above absolute zero, or minus 459 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 273 degrees Celsius). \nThe cold atoms were trapped by a 3D arrangement of lasers. The beams were set up to interfere with each other. As they did so, they created regions of low and high potential energy , called potential wells. The wells act like stacked egg cartons, and each one holds a strontium atom. \nThe atoms got so cold that they stopped interacting with each other \u2014 unlike a normal gas, in which atoms are running around randomly and bouncing off their fellows, such cooled atoms remain quite still. They then start to behave in a way that is less like a gas and more like a solid, even though the distance between them is much larger than what's found in solid strontium. [ 8 Ways You Can See Einstein's Theory of Relativity in Real Life ] \n\"From that point of view, it's a very interesting material; it now has properties as if it is a solid state,\" project leader Jun Ye, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, told Live Science. (JILA is jointly operated by the NIST and the University of Colorado at Boulder.) \nAt this point, the clock was ready to start keeping time: The researchers hit the atoms with a laser, exciting one of the electrons orbiting the strontium's nucleus. Because electrons are governed by the laws of quantum mechanics , one can't say what energy level the electron is in once it is excited, and can only say that it has a probability of being in one or another. To measure the electron, after 10 seconds, they fired another laser at the atom. That laser measures where the electron is located around the nucleus, as a photon from the laser gets re-emitted by the atom \u2014 and how many times it oscillated in that period (the 10 seconds). \nAveraging this measurement over thousands of atoms is what gives this atomic clock its precision, just as averaging the beats of thousands of identical pendulums will give one a more precise idea of what the period of that pendulum should be. \nUntil now, atomic clocks had only single \"strings\" of atoms as opposed to a 3D lattice, so they could not take as many measurements as this one did, Ye said. \n\"It's like comparing watches,\" Ye said. \"Using that analogy, the laser pulse on the atoms kicks off a coherent oscillation. Ten seconds later we turn on the pulse again and ask the electron, 'Where are you?'\" That measurement is averaged over thousands of atoms. \nKeeping electrons in that in-between state is difficult, Ye said, and that's another reason the atoms need to be so cold, so that the electrons don't accidentally touch anything else. \nThe clock can essentially measure seconds down to 1 part in trillions. This ability makes more than a really good timekeeper; it might aid in searches for phenomena such as dark matter, Ye said. For example, one could set up an experiment in space using such an accurate timer to see if atoms behave differently from what conventional theories predict. \nThe study is detailed in the Oct. 6 issue of the journal Science. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Here, the Chacoan people from the mid-9th to early 13th centuries created along Chaco Canyon the largest, most architecturally advanced (and most archaeoastronomically aligned) series of roads, villages and solar stone structures found in North America, and arguably anywhere in the world. Fajada Butte within Chaco Culture National Historic Park is shown here. Historic park Credit: NPS Chaco Culture National Historic Park is located in the southeastern portion of the Colorado Plateau, some 88 miles (142 km) as the crow flies from the Four Corners region. Chaco Canyon is one of hundreds of Ancestral Puebloan sites found across the 130,000-square-mile (337,000 square km) plateau. These ancient indigenous people created large population centers across the Colorado Plateau that show evidence of a very rich culture of art, trade, religion and the celestial sciences. Many suggest that Chaco Canyon was the epicenter of the Ancestral Puebloans' world. Geological wonder Credit: NPS The park is situated totally within the San Juan Basin. This high scrubland desert canyon, with an average elevation of 6,175 feet (1,882 meters), has a general northwest-to-southeast alignment. It is surrounded by ancient dune fields, ridges and three mountain ranges: the Chuska Mountains to the west, the San Pedro Mountains to the east and the San Juan Mountains to the north. Chaco Canyon was carved over time by the Chaco Wash, a seasonal stream. The layout of the 10 Ancestral Puebloan pueblos scattered along 9 miles (14 km) of the Chaco Wash are considered to be the most significant of all ancient Colorado Plateau pueblo communities. Preserving culture Credit: NPS Some archeologists have long contended that the ruins of Chaco Canyon are the most significant ancient ruins in North America and even across the world. President Theodore Roosevelt recognized these alluring ruins in 1907 when he designated Chaco Canyon a national monument. The ruins were placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. In 1980, the boundary of the national monument was enlarged by 20 square miles (52 square kilometers) and the monument became the Chaco Culture National Historical Park. Finally, because of the exceptional architecture, skillfully engineered and constructed roads, and the influence that the Chaco culture had upon the people of the Four Corners area for more than four centuries, Chaco Canyon was recognized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1987. Today, Chaco Culture National Historic Park preserves more than 4,000 cultural sites reflective of habitation by Paleo-Indians, Ancestral Puebloans, Navajo, Hopi and the Euro-American occupation. Pueblo Bonito Credit: NPS The uniquely D-shaped Pueblo Bonito (Spanish for \"beautiful town\") is the most famous and largest of all Chacoan great houses, hosting more than 350 ground floor rooms, three great kivas and 32 smaller kivas. At its peak, Pueblo Bonito rose some four stories along the arc of north side rooms with interior rooms from one -- three stories high. Pueblo Bonito was first occupied from the mid-850s A.D. until the early 12th century. Like all the other major structures found in Chaco Canyon, Pueblo Bonito was built with an internal geometry that aligns it to the relationships of the solar and lunar cycles. Its northern back wall is built along a perfect east-west axis. In addition, Pueblo Bonito is located near the center of Chaco Canyon and plays a crucial role in the astronomical solar/lunar alignment of 10 other Chaco Canyon great houses. Ceremonial role Credit: NPS The Chaco great houses found along a 9-mile (14 km) belt of the canyon floor are astronomically aligned. Some are positioned with the 18.6-year cycle of the maximum and minimum moonrise and moonset, while others were set up cardinally. Archeologist think that many of the great houses served as temples with people throughout the region making annual pilgrimages to the Chaco kivas for ceremonial activities. Chetro Ketl, shown here, contains some 500 rooms, and a Great Kiva, also found here, illustrates how the great houses of Chaco Canyon served during this time as the spiritual, administrative and economic capital of the American Southwest. Chacoan construction Credit: NPS The many spectacular great houses found along Chaco Canyon remain a modern-day testament to the fact that the Chaco people were very skilled masons. Their pueblos were built in sections over hundreds of years, and archaeological architects have identified seven evolving styles. The vast majority of the great houses were built with slabs of sandstone rocks, specifically quarried and preciously stacked as if the Chacoans were following some magnificent ancient blueprint. These designs and styles allowed the people to build strong, multi-storied structures with a large number of interconnecting rooms. It is estimated that more than 240,000 ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, spruce and aspen trees were used in the construction of the floors and the roofs of the Chaco great houses. The average weight of these logs was more than 600 pounds ( 272 kilograms). Since the Chacoans had no beasts of burden (horse, oxen, mules or even cows), metal tools, nor did they know of the wheeled cart, these timbers were simply carried from forests that were upwards of 40 to 60 miles (64 to 97 km) from Chaco Canyon. Network of roads Credit: NPS Another stunning achievement of the Chaco people was their large and carefully engineered series of roads found both within the canyon and extending from the canyon to the far outlying Chaco villages. Some 250 miles (400 km) of road were built by these industrious people. Within the canyon, the roads were about 15 feet (4.6 m) wide, while the roads leaving the canyon were nearly twice as wide. These roads are incredibly straight and when they come to a mesa or cliff face, steps (like the ones shown here) were cut, never wavering from the road's straight alignment. Why would a people with no beast of burden nor wheeled carts build such an extensive system of wide roads? Archeologist can only speculate that the roads were used for large ceremonial and religious parades, yet their actual purpose may forever be lost in the dust of history. Cosmic connection Credit: Chaco Observatory/NPS Archeologist and astronomers both agree that Chaco Canyon just might be the greatest example of an archaeoastronomy site found anywhere in the world. The scientific knowledge and mathematics needed to accurately position and then build each of their great pueblos aligned with the cosmos would take generations of astronomical observations. Some suggest the mathematics for such construction came from trade and influences of the Mayan people of the Yucatan. Whatever the origin, the ancient people of Chaco were an intelligent and creative people.

On these days, a narrow shaft of light falsl upon two, spiral petroglyphs. This light, shown here and known as the Chaco Sun Dagger, also tracks an 18 1/2-year lunar cycle. Such an astronomical site is found nowhere else among North American Indian cultures. But, such solar/lunar sites were once common to the Toltec and Mayan people of central and southern Mexico. For many archeologists, the Chaco Sun Dagger, along with the copper bells, mother-of-pearl and macaw feathers found among Chaco ruins, confirms the theory that Chaco Canyon was once the terminus of the great Toltec trade route. Pottery patterns Credit: NPS It should be no surprise that Chaco pottery was also unique and beautiful in its design, function and quality. Plain, clay cooking pots first appeared at Chaco around 450 to 500 A.D. More durable and easier to make than baskets, pottery artisans became an indispensable part of the Chacoan culture, producing both plain and ornate ceramics for cooking, serving and the storage of food supplies. Chaco pottery makers soon began using black paint to decorate their pottery with geometric designs, as seen in this photo. This black-on-white painted pottery is the hallmark of Chacoan pottery. Archeologists find great value and insight in studying pottery because variations in pottery design reflect the peoples\u2019 cultural changes. Park animals Credit: Linda & Dr. Dick Buscher Chaco Canyon is located in an arid region with a characteristic high desert and a xeric scrublands biome. The flora throughout the region is similar to what is typically found within all North American high deserts, areas with short growing seasons, long winters and minimal rainfall. Creosote bush ( Larrea tridentata( ) a variety of cholla with a mingling of pin\u0303on and juniper trees are typically found. A wide variety of high desert animals, such as elk ( Cervus elaphus ), American badger ( Taxied taxes ), black-tailed jackrabbit ( Lepus californicus ) and the bobcat ( Lynx rufus ), shown here, are just some of the many mammal species that have long made Chaco Canyon their home. Rich history Credit: NPS Chaco Canyon was the major center of the ancient Pueblo Peoples culture between 900 to 1150 A.D. The great houses that they built were the largest building in North America until the 19th century. At its zenith, the population of Chaco probably never exceeded more than 6,000 people, but their influence spread across the Colorado Plateau and southward to their trading partners within the large Mesoamerica cultures of central Mexico. Exactly why the people eventually abandoned Chaco Canyon is not known, but an extensive drought that began around 1130 A.D. may have been a major contributing factor. The bumpy journey across the unpaved roads that lead even today to Chaco Culture National Historic Park is well worth the effort for visitors to explore firsthand the amazing ruins still found in Chaco Canyon. previous | next Ancient civilization Credit: NPS In the great desolation and emptiness of northwestern New Mexico, the ruins of an advanced Pre-Columbian civilization is preserved today within a 53-square-mile (137 square kilometers) national historic park.

For many archeologists, the Chaco Sun Dagger, along with the copper bells, mother-of-pearl and macaw feathers found among Chaco ruins, confirms the theory that Chaco Canyon was once the terminus of the great Toltec trade route. Pottery patterns Credit: NPS It should be no surprise that Chaco pottery was also unique and beautiful in its design, function and quality. Plain, clay cooking pots first appeared at Chaco around 450 to 500 A.D. More durable and easier to make than baskets, pottery artisans became an indispensable part of the Chacoan culture, producing both plain and ornate ceramics for cooking, serving and the storage of food supplies. Chaco pottery makers soon began using black paint to decorate their pottery with geometric designs, as seen in this photo. This black-on-white painted pottery is the hallmark of Chacoan pottery. Archeologists find great value and insight in studying pottery because variations in pottery design reflect the peoples\u2019 cultural changes. Park animals Credit: Linda & Dr. Dick Buscher Chaco Canyon is located in an arid region with a characteristic high desert and a xeric scrublands biome. The flora throughout the region is similar to what is typically found within all North American high deserts, areas with short growing seasons, long winters and minimal rainfall. Creosote bush ( Larrea tridentata( ) a variety of cholla with a mingling of pin\u0303on and juniper trees are typically found. A wide variety of high desert animals, such as elk ( Cervus elaphus ), American badger ( Taxied taxes ), black-tailed jackrabbit ( Lepus californicus ) and the bobcat ( Lynx rufus ), shown here, are just some of the many mammal species that have long made Chaco Canyon their home. Rich history Credit: NPS Chaco Canyon was the major center of the ancient Pueblo Peoples culture between 900 to 1150 A.D. The great houses that they built were the largest building in North America until the 19th century. At its zenith, the population of Chaco probably never exceeded more than 6,000 people, but their influence spread across the Colorado Plateau and southward to their trading partners within the large Mesoamerica cultures of central Mexico. Exactly why the people eventually abandoned Chaco Canyon is not known, but an extensive drought that began around 1130 A.D. may have been a major contributing factor. The bumpy journey across the unpaved roads that lead even today to Chaco Culture National Historic Park is well worth the effort for visitors to explore firsthand the amazing ruins still found in Chaco Canyon.

[ 27 Devastating Infectious Diseases ] \nDoctors have long assumed that increasing water intake could lower the risk of UTIs, and they often recommend that women at risk of these infections drink more water. But, until now, the recommendation had not been rigorously studied. \n\"There's lots of things we recommend to women to reduce the risk of UTIs, but none have really been studied,\" said Dr. Thomas Hooton, lead author of the study and clinical director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine, who presented the findings at a news conference. \n\"It's good to know the recommendation is valid, and that drinking water is an easy and safe way to prevent an uncomfortable and annoying infection,\" Hooton said. \nUp to 60 percent of women will develop a UTI in their lifetimes, and about 25 percent will have more than one UTI, the researchers said. Women are generally more prone than men to UTIs because, in women, the urethra is shorter, so it is easier for bacteria to travel from the rectum and vagina to the bladder , the researchers said. \nThe new study involved 140 healthy women under age 45 who had experienced at least three UTIs in the past year and who typically drank fewer than six 8-ounce glasses of fluids a day. Half of the women were told to drink an extra 8 ounces of water a day, while the other half didn't make any changes in their water consumption. \nAfter one year, the women who increased their water intake had, on average, about 1.5 UTIs over the course of the study, compared with about three UTIs, on average, for the women who didn't increase their water intake. \nIn total, the women in the water group were drinking about 11 glasses of water a day, compared with five glasses in the other group. \nDrinking more fluids is thought to reduce the risk of UTIs because it increases the rate at which bacteria are flushed from the bladder, and also likely reduces the concentration of bacteria that enter the bladder from the vagina, the researchers said. This means there are fewer opportunities for bacteria to attach to cells lining the urinary tract, Hooton said. \nAs a result of having fewer UTIs, the women in the water group also took less antibiotics \u2014 on average, women in the water group took about two courses of antibiotics, compared with 3.5 courses in the group that didn't increase their water intake. Reducing the use of antibiotics helps to lower the risk of antibiotic resistance , the researchers said. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: NASA Earth Observatory \nAs the sun rises above the Antarctic horizon after the long, dark austral winter, scientists are getting a better look at the Delaware-size iceberg that sheared off from the frozen continent's Larsen C ice shelf in July. \nWith the illumination from the sun's rays, new satellite images have captured the iceberg, dubbed A68, and the motley assortment of ice and water surrounding it, in impressive detail. In the coming months and years, scientists will be poring over such images to watch the progression of the iceberg and its parent ice shelf. \nThe researchers said they also hope to study the area up close, to examine details of the seafloor that have been blocked by ice for hundreds of years and to learn how such a massive shift could alter the local ecosystem. [ In Photos: Antarctica's Larsen C Ice Shelf Through Time ] \n\"It's obviously a completely different physical environment once the ice is gone,\" Susie Grant, a marine biogeographer with the British Antarctic Survey, told Live Science. \nKeeping tabs on the iceberg, the ice shelf and the ecosystem in the coming years could also help scientists better understand how other major ice shelves might respond to a warming world, according to Grant. \"Extraordinary\" images \nScientists have watched for several years as a rift slowly propagated its way across the Larsen C ice shelf , a platform of ice that extends out from the coast and floats atop the ocean. After a couple of surges in 2016 and earlier this year, the rift finally reached the edge of the ice shelf and calved off the iceberg. Snapshot of the rift in the Larsen C on Nov. 10, 2016. Credit: John Sontag/NASA \nBut with the sun below the Antarctic horizon, researchers could monitor the event only with thermal imagery and radar , according to NASA's Earth Observatory . \n\"When it did finally break off, it was just sort of these tantalizing\" glimpses, Grant said. \nOnce the sun re-emerged in August, more satellite views started streaming in \u2014 and they haven't disappointed. The \"satellite images are extraordinary,\" Grant said. \"To see something of that scale moving across the water.\" \nIn mid-September, NASA's Terra satellite and the Landsat 8 satellite captured shots of the iceberg in visible light and of the surrounding area in infrared wavelengths of light. The images reveal exciting details, like the wrinkly-looking rifts that stretch across parts of the iceberg and the mixture of open water and ice surrounding it. [ Earth from Above: 101 Stunning Images from Orbit ] An instrument onboard the Terra satellite captured this image of the A68 iceberg on Sept. 11, 2017. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory \nIn the psychedelic thermal image, the cold iceberg and ice shelf appear a ghostly white, while the relatively warmer sea ice shows up in shades of purple, and the even warmer (though still sub-freezing) open water pops out in yellow. Bluer shades show the mixture of ice called m\u00e9lange, which can include snow, sea ice, bits of ice that fell from the sides of the rift and something called marine ice, which forms along the underside of the floating ice, said Ala Khazendar, a scientist with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who uses radar to study polar ice. Dramatic changes in store? \nThe images also show how much the iceberg has moved away from its parent ice shelf. So far, it has been progressing at a steady clip, but how fast it might continue to move is unclear and depends on several factors: winds and ocean currents, as well as whether there are any bumps or ridges on the seafloor that the iceberg might get stuck on, Khazendar said. \nIf it does get stuck, he said, that will tell scientists something about the topography of the seafloor, which they had no way of viewing before the calving event, Grant said. \nThat seafloor and the water above it are also being exposed to sunlight for the first time in at least hundreds of years, and this could have major impacts on the local ecosystem, Grant said. For instance, ocean life at the water's surface could suddenly ramp up in productivity. The newly opened area could also see species moving in from neighboring regions, she said. [ Antarctica Photos: Meltwater Lake Hidden Beneath the Ice ] \nThe ecosystem will be \"potentially dramatically changed\" by the calving event, Grant said, though it's \"impossible to know anything about that until we can get down and visit.\" \nThe British Antarctic Survey and other groups are planning scientific cruises to get an up-close look at the changes to the region, and the sooner that happens the better, so they can establish a baseline before major changes occur, Grant said. Sediment cores drilled from the ocean floor will help scientists establish how long the area has been covered by ice, and sampling of the water will tell them how the temperature and salt content may be changing and what creatures live there, she said. \nThose efforts are helped by an international agreement by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, which has 25 international members, to designate the area around the ice shelf as a protected area so that activities like commercial fishing won't hamper scientific work, Gizmodo reported . This is the first time there has been such a designation, Grant said. \n\"I think that was a really important step,\" she said. \"We were really pleased to have managed to get that.\" Clues to the fate of Antarctic ice \nIn the meantime, scientists will glean what information they can from satellite images and airborne observations made by NASA's IceBridge program, which is gearing up for the Antarctic summer season, Khazendar said. \nResearchers will be watching to see if the remaining ice shelf begins to flow faster in response to the iceberg's loss, he said, and how the iceberg melts and potentially breaks up into smaller pieces (one such piece already broke off later in July). \n\"We still need to collect data and analyze them in order to understand how the Larsen C ice shelf is going to react to this event,\" Khazendar said. \nThere are concerns that the massive calving event could mark a turning point for the glacier, sending it toward a global warming-fueled collapse like those suffered by its northern neighbors, Larsen A and Larsen B, in 1995 and 2002, respectively. But whether that will happen isn't yet clear, and the ice shelf could recover from the calving event, as these events do happen naturally, Khazendar said. \n\"It will take us some time before we have some clearer answers,\" he said. \nHow Larsen C responds could also give scientists a better idea of how other major ice shelves around Antarctica will respond to the warming waters that are lapping away at the shelves' undersides and causing the glaciers that feed into shelves to flow faster out to the ocean, raising sea levels. \n\"It could teach us a lot about the fate of other large ice shelves in Antarctica,\" Khazendar said \nStudying the region could also \"improve our understanding of how ecosystems might respond to the impacts of climate change,\" Grant said. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: Res Eichenberger \nArchaeologists found a copper blade in Switzerland that's just like the ax \u00d6tzi the famous \"Iceman\"was carrying when he died. \nLike \u00d6tzi's ax, this tool was made with copper that came from hundreds of miles away, in present-day Tuscany in central Italy. The discovery could shed light on Copper Age connections across Europe. \nBad fortune eventually made \u00d6tzi the Iceman famous. About 5,300 years ago, he was shot with an arrow , struck in the head and left to die near a mountain pass high in the Alps. He was entombed in a glacier until 1991, when hikers near the Italian-Austrian border discovered his body. \n\u00d6tzi is the oldest mummy in Europe, and scientists have studied nearly every possible aspect of his life and death, from his tattoos and tools to his diet and DNA. Among the equipment \u00d6tzi carried was an ax of almost pure copper, remarkable because its wooden handle and leather straps were still preserved. [ Mummy Melodrama: 9 Secrets About Otzi the Iceman ] \nThis past summer, researchers traced the source of the metal in \u00d6tzi\u2019s ax to southern Tuscany, which came as a surprise to them. The huge mountains of the Alps were thought to be a \"neat cultural barrier\" separating the metal trade, the authors of that study wrote in the journal PLOS One; people living around the Alps at that time were believed to have gotten their copper locally or from the Balkans. \nNow, archaeologists in Switzerland report that they've found another blade with the same make as \u00d6tzi's at the northern foot of the Alps. A reconstruction of the village Zug-Riedmatt, where the copper ax was found, as it looked more than 5,000 years ago. Credit: Eva Kl\u00e4ui and Eda Gross The ax was discovered in Zug-Riedmatt, one of the many pile-dwelling villages around the Alps that are famous for their prehistoric wooden houses built on stilts on lakeshores and other wetlands.\n\"It was a very efficient general-purpose ax, especially proper for woodworking,\" said Gishan Schaeren, an archaeologist with the Office for Monuments and Archaeology in the Swiss canton (or state) of Zug. But in addition to chopping trees to build stilted houses, people could use these axs as lethal weapons, Schaeren added. \nThe newfound blade was between 5,300 and 5,100 years old and missing its wooden handle. It was about half the weight of \u00d6tzi's blade and shorter, but the same shape. By measuring the traces of lead in the blade, Schaeren and his colleagues could link the copper to the same source in southern Tuscany. \n\"Mainstream research normally does not consider the possibility of intense contacts between south and north in the Alps\" during this time, Schaeren told Live Science in an email. A view of the excavation where the blade was found in 2008. Credit: Rolf Glauser He thinks Copper Age people should be given more credit.\"We have to consider that people who traveled in the Alps had a very profound knowledge of the landscape and its conditions due to their experience with hunting, herding and exploring natural resources in these areas,\" he said.\nStronger links to southern Europe, Schaeren added, could explain certain styles of rock art, pottery, burial customs and other phenomena seen in the north. \n\"It is one step to a much more connected worldview,\" Schaeren said. \nThe findings were published last month in the German journal Arch\u00e4ologische Informationen. \nOriginally published on Live Science.

But why is it so hard to stop? \nAbout 20 new cases of hepatitis A per week have been reported during this outbreak, Dr. Eric McDonald, director of San Diego County's Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch, said at a news conference here yesterday (Oct. 5), part of an infectious diseases conference called IDWeek 2017. Most of the hepatitis A cases have been among people who are homeless or use illegal drugs, or who have close contact with those populations. Of the 481 people who have been infected, 337 (70 percent) have been hospitalized and 17 (4 percent) have died, officials said. \nDr. Monique Foster, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Division of Viral Hepatitis, said it's not uncommon for large hepatitis A outbreaks like this to last a long time \u2014 around one to two years \u2014 before they are completely halted. \nThough the hepatitis A virus isn't typically deadly, it can infect the liver and cause inflammation and damage to that organ, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Symptoms can include dark-yellow urine, fever, joint pain, nausea and vomiting. People with the infection usually get better on their own without treatment, the NIH says. But in some cases, the infection can lead to liver failure , particularly in older adults or people who have other liver diseases. [ 27 Devastating Infectious Diseases ] \nHepatitis A spreads when small amounts of stool from an ill person contaminate objects, food or drinks that another person then touches and ingests. This can happen when people with the illness don't properly wash their hands after going to the bathroom, according to the CDC. In San Diego, officials have installed 66 portable handwashing stations in the streets to address the hygiene issue, with 100 more stations on the way. The virus can also spread among drug users, also through poor hygiene when sharing equipment related to illicit drug use. \nOne reason specialists and doctors have a hard time stopping the spread of hepatitis A is its long \"incubation period\"\u2014 the time it takes a person to show symptoms after he or she is infected \u2014 which lasts on average 28 days. But it can be up to 50 days, Foster said. \n\"People infected today probably won't show symptoms for four weeks,\" Foster said. This makes it hard for people to recall what they were doing, or who they had contact with, at the time they were exposed to hepatitis, Foster said, and both of those factors help officials track and control outbreaks. It also means people who don't yet appear sick can infect others, causing more cases. \nIn addition, the long incubation period means that by the time officials notice a cluster of hepatitis A cases, the outbreak has likely been going on for at least a month, Foster said. And once officials do identify an outbreak, it can take six weeks to determine whether efforts to control the outbreak are working, McDonald said. \nAnother challenge in the San Diego outbreak is the specific population at risk for contracting hepatitis A in this outbreak: people who are homeless or who use illicit drugs. This is a population that has limited access to clean toilets and handwashing facilities, which are important to preventing the spread of hepatitis A. \nAdditionally, vaccination with the hepatitis A vaccine is one of the key ways to prevent the infection, the CDC says. But in the current outbreak, it took time to get these vaccinations to the groups at risk for the disease, McDonald said. To get vaccines to this \"target\" group, officials used unique strategies, including administering vaccines in emergency rooms, where it is easier to track down homeless people, and jails, where illicit drug users may be vaccinated before they end up back on the streets, officials said. Officials also established teams of people to go to homeless encampments and administer vaccinations. \n\"It takes time to set up systems in order to deliver vaccines,\" McDonald said. \"I think those systems are [now] strongly in place here to address the ongoing outbreak.\" \nAs of Sept. 30, more than 54,000 adults in the area had been vaccinated against hepatitis A as part of the efforts to stem the current outbreak, McDonald said. \nIn general, the hepatitis A vaccine is recommended for children at age 1; travelers to countries that have high rates of hepatitis A; users of illegal drugs; people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis C; men who have sexual contact with other men; and people who work with animals infected with hepatitis A, according to the CDC. \nPrior to the San Diego outbreak, the hepatitis A vaccine was not specifically recommended for people who are homeless, but now, the state of California is recommending that this vaccine be given to the homeless population. CDC officials will also consider whether this should become a national recommendation, Foster said. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

By Sara G. Miller, Staff Writer | October 6, 2017 01:30pm ET MORE Health officials spray pesticides to kill fleas, which carry plague-causing bacteria, in a school in the city of Antananarivo, Madagascar on Oct. 2, 2017. Credit: Rihasolo/AFP/Getty \nMore than 30 people in Madagascar have died from an outbreak of the plague , and nearly 200 have fallen ill since August, according to news reports. \nExperts say these numbers represent the deadliest outbreak of the disease on the African island-nation in years, according to The Washington Post . Last year, for example, 63 people died out of 275 cases. \nThe plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis , which lives in fleas and rats. In Madagascar, the plague is considered a seasonal worry: At the end of the harvesting season, rat populations drop because they don't have enough to eat. As a result, fleas start looking for new hosts to bite, and so begin targeting humans, according to NPR . \nOne possible reason why this year's outbreak is larger is because the disease has spread to cities, including the capital city of Antananarivo, NPR reported Oct. 4. In that city, government officials have begun to disinfect schools and have urged students to stay home, and a jazz festival canceled its opening concert, The Washington Post reported Oct. 3. \nIn addition, most of the cases of plague this season are a more dangerous form, called the pneumonic plague, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). \nThe most common form of plague is the bubonic plague; it occurs when the plague-causing bacteria gets into the body and travels to the lymph nodes . These lymph nodes become inflamed, and are referred to as \"buboes,\" the WHO says. If the bubonic plague goes untreated, the bacteria can spread to the lungs, causing pneumonic plague. This form of the disease can be spread through the air, the WHO says. \nBut getting sick with the plague is no longer a death sentence, according to health officials. \n\"Plague is curable if detected in time,\" Dr. Charlotte Ndiaye, the WHO representative in Madagascar, said in a statement today (Oct. 6). The disease can be cured with common antibiotics, and the WHO has delivered nearly 1.2 million doses of the drugs to the country, according to the statement. Antibiotics can also help prevent infection in people who have been exposed to the disease, the WHO says. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Miller/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images \nThe lawyer for Aaron Hernandez is suing the National Football League after an autopsy found that the 27-year-old player, who died by suicide after being convicted of murder, had a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) . A new study suggests that kids who play tackle football before age 12 are at risk of developing CTE, which can cause mood swings, aggression and dementia-like symptoms. And yet, another recent study found evidence of CTE in the brains of 99 percent of NFL players examined posthumously. \nIs football inherently unsafe? \nDespite this spate of bad news, there is no consensus on the answer to that question. Some researchers think football is best-avoided. Others think the sport can be made safer with equipment and training modifications, or at least that there's not enough evidence to throw out the entire game. [ See Images of Brains with CTE ] \n\"There are other things we would need to know in order to answer that,\" said Erik Swartz, a kinesiologist at the University of New Hampshire. But, Swartz said, researchers can't kick the can down the road for much longer. Chris Harris (25) of the Denver Broncos tackles Aaron Hernandez (81) of the New England Patriots on Dec. 18, 2011. After his death, Hernandez was found to have a degenerative brain disease that has been linked to head impacts.

The science is better. The evidence is stronger.\" Yellow flags \nChronic traumatic encephalopathy was once known as \"punch-drunk syndrome\" because it was thought to be a problem mostly exclusive to boxers. It's not. In 2002, an autopsy of former Pittsburgh Steelers football player Mike Webster, who died at 50, revealed the distinctive mark of CTE: a buildup of a protein called tau. Abnormalities in tau are also present in patients with Alzheimer's disease, and the symptoms of people with CTE are dementia-like. They include impulsivity, loss of memory, confusion, tremor and movement problems as well as depression and anxiety. The top images here show a normal brain. The bottom images show the brain of former University of Texas football player Greg Ploetz, who died at age 66. Credit: Dr. Ann McKee, Copyright: BU Photography \nCTE can currently only be diagnosed by autopsy, though that may change. A study published in the journal PLOS ONE in September found that an inflammatory protein called CCL11 circulates at high levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of people with CTE compared with levels in people with Alzheimer's or without long-term brain damage. Researchers don't yet know if the protein increases early or late in the disease or whether the levels of the protein correspond to disease severity, but CCL11 could be a potential biomarker for diagnosing the disease during life , they wrote. \nThe inability of researchers to diagnose the disease until after a person dies is one of the problems facing scientists who are trying to figure out just how dangerous football really is. In July, Boston University-led research found evidence of CTE in the brains of 110 of 111 former NFL players that they examined . The limitation to this study is that because CTE can't be diagnosed until after death, families who noticed dementia-like symptoms in their loved ones were disproportionately likely to donate their brains to research. A diagnosis of CTE while the patient is alive would pave the way for more accurate statistics. \nAnother problem is that many questions about how CTE develops and who is most vulnerable are still unanswered. \n\"Everyone has a different genetic background,\" said Jonathan Cherry, a postdoctoral fellow at Boston University and the lead author of the CCL11 research. \"They have different environmental factors that can come into play.\" \nWhat researchers do know, Cherry said, is that CTE doesn't require people to experience actual concussions , which are traumatic brain impacts that cause noticeable symptoms like confusion, nausea and ringing ears. Subconcussive impacts, if repeated enough times, can also lead to CTE. In the CCL11 study, Cherry and his colleagues found that the inflammatory protein, like CTE itself, correlated not with the number of concussions someone received in life, but with years of football played. \n\"Something we're trying to answer is how many hits is too many hits,\" Cherry told Live Science. Making football safer The Vicis Zero1 football helmet aims to reduce head impacts with a flexible shell and deformable, column-like inner layer. Credit: VICIS \nIn the absence of sure information, there are attempts to make football safer. A major push, funded by the NFL, is to design better helmets. The newest to show up on professional fields is the Vicis Zero1, a helmet with a larger surface area and a flexible outer shell that gives during a collision \"like a car bumper,\" Vicis CEO Dave Marver told Live Science in an email. Instead of traditional padding, the helmet's interior is made up of a series of flexible \"columns,\" which can twist and buckle to absorb rotational forces. The helmet scored above all others in the NFL's 2017 laboratory testing . It's already being used in games by Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith, according to Business Insider, and the University of Mississippi announced in March that it would be trying out the helmets for its players as well. Vicis plans to continue refining its technology, Marver said, and the company's engineers are using sophisticated computer modeling and new types of testing to continue to improve the helmets. \nStill, Vicis is careful not to market its product as concussion proof. \n\"As long as there are impact forces resulting from collisions, risk of concussion remains,\" Marver said. Different people have different thresholds for concussion, Marver said, and no helmet is foolproof enough to protect against all potential hits. \nHelmet companies have overstepped on concussion-reduction claims before. Helmet company Riddell marketed its helmet as reducing the risk of concussion by 31 percent, even after a biomechanics lab warned the company in 2000 that no helmet could promise to reduce concussion risk. In 2013, Riddell was docked $11.5 million for making those claims as a result of a lawsuit filed by a Colorado family whose son suffered a severe concussion during a game. \nSome researchers argue that helmets are part of the problem \u2014 or at least not a clear-cut solution. The larger the helmet (and the VICIS Zero1 is larger than many), the more surface area there is for impact, the University of New Hampshire's Swartz said. (More impacts mean more brain trauma over time.) Helmets also offer a false sense of security to players, Swartz said. When your head is cocooned in inches of plastic and padding, you're more likely to ram it into other people than if you're helmetless. [ 5 Ways Science Could Make Football Safer ] \nHelmets undeniably provide head protection, Swartz said, and they're a necessary part of the game. But he and his colleagues are testing a method of helmet-free training for college and high-school players. The idea, Swartz said, is to teach players how to tackle and block without head protection so that their instinctive desire to protect their head becomes muscle memory. \n\"I played rugby for eight years, and it never occurred to me to lead with my head going into contact,\" Swartz said. Rugby players get concussions and head injuries, he said, but they don't endure as many head impacts as football players do . \nIn a study in which University of New Hampshire football players were randomly assigned to receive the helmetless training or not, Swartz and his team found that those who'd trained without helmets experienced 30 percent fewer head impacts over the course of a season than those who trained with helmets. The researchers have done a larger randomized trial in high-school students, but those results have yet to be published. \nWhether 30 percent is enough to prevent long-term damage, no one knows. \n\"We won't be satisfied with a certain threshold,\" Swartz said. \"We just want to get it as low as we can.\" Treatment and timing \nHead impacts could be even more damaging for athletes who are still recovering from a prior concussion. That's why concussion diagnosis is so important. Even so, diagnosis among athletes hasn't been as throrough as it needs to be, experts said. [ 5 Facts About Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) ] \nWhen an athlete gets hit on the head in the field, National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) standards call for a battery of cognitive and neurological tests that assess things like symptoms and balance on the spot. That's not enough, said Semyon Slobounov, a professor of kinesiology and neurosurgery at Penn State University and author of \"Concussions in Athletics: From Brain to Behavior\" (Springer-Verlag New York, 2014). To really assess concussion damage, Slobounov told Live Science, athletes need a direct assessment. At Penn State's Center for Sport Concussion Research and Service, that assessment can include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging, electroencephalograms and other methods of directly measuring brain function. \n\"Concussive injury is definitely linked to pathophysiological alteration of the brain,\" which means meaning changes to the structure and function of brain tissue, Slobounov said. \nThat alteration can persist, even once-obvious symptoms like confusion or dizziness clear up, he said. In other words, letting athletes back on the field when symptoms abate doesn't guarantee that their brains have really recovered. Most players are cleared to play after a week, Slobounov said, while studies on blood flow show that alterations in brain function persist past 30 days. The damage may be compounded in players who take more hits before the brain heals. \nAt the same time, Slobounov said, athletes' brains recover from concussions faster than the brains of nonathletes, and he and his colleagues have found that light, low-impact exercise started as early as two days post-injury can speed recovery. The benefit of exercise for the brain is one reason Slobounov is among the experts who are reluctant to throw the football out with the bathwater. \n\"We should be concerned about disability and mobility and obesity issues and kids not getting exercise,\" Slobounov said, while still characterizing the questions surrounding concussions as \"a serious problem.\" \nThe benefits of a physically active lifestyle make Swartz hesitate to condemn football, as well. There may eventually be enough evidence to suggest that the full-tackle game be delayed to older ages, he said. In September, Boston University researchers published data in the journal Translational Psychiatry that showed that individuals who began playing before age 12 were more likely to show depression, problems with cognitive functioning and trouble with behavioral regulation in middle age than those who had started later, as assessed over the phone and in online psychological testing. More research is needed to make any policy changes or guidelines, those researchers wrote. \n\"If a parent were to decide, 'My child is going to play football, but they're going to start off for two or three years in flag football, then progressively move over to a tackle football,' that is almost objectively a safer approach,\" Swartz said, simply because the child will receive fewer total head impacts . The age at which children have the capacity to weigh the risks and rewards of the game is also worth thinking about, he said. \nFor Cherry, who disentangles the postmortem consequences of CTE, it's hard to see how to reduce the risk enough. \n\"When people ask what is the best way to not get CTE , I tell them that you don't get hit in the head,\" he said. \"That is the surefire way to not get CTE.

Credit: Peter Barry \nLarge underground reserves of helium in East Africa are at least twice as large as first reported, according to scientists from the University of Oxford and the company that plans to start pumping up the precious gas within three years. \nThe discovery of pockets of helium in the Great Rift Valley region of Tanzania was announced late last year. The initial samples from gas seeps in the area indicated that the underground deposits contained an average of 2.6 percent helium, mixed mostly with nitrogen. [ See More Photos of the Helium Cache Found in Africa ] \nBased on that figure, independent resource assessors estimated that the underground gas field contains 54 billion cubic feet (1.5 billion cubic meters) of helium, or about one-third of the world's known reserves of the gas, which have been dwindling for decades, according to annual assessments by the US Geological Survey . \nBut new measurements from the Tanzanian gas seeps now show helium concentrations of up to four times the earlier average value, said Thomas Abraham-James, a geologist and CEO of Helium One, a Portugal-based company that plans to start selling the gas internationally by 2020. \nAbraham-James told Live Science that a second independent assessment of the underground helium resource in Tanzania now amounts to 98.6 billion cubic feet (2.8 billion cubic meters). \"So it's pretty much doubled in size,\" he said. \nHe explained that the field-sampling methods used in 2015 had allowed a small amount of air to dilute the concentration of helium in the gas samples. \nBut new, real-time measurements of gas from the seeps, conducted by geochemists Chris Ballentine and Peter Barry from the University of Oxford late last year, showed that the concentrations of helium are much higher than the initial estimates suggested. \n\"We are probably still somewhat understating what is present, but nevertheless, that gives us room to update and improve as we progress,\" Abraham-James said. Critical shortage \nThe discovery of the helium field in Tanzania comes as the world faces a shortage of the nonrenewable gas , which has critical applications in industry, scientific research and medicine \u2014 especially for the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners used in many hospitals. \nFor decades, the main source of helium worldwide has been underground reserves in Texas owned by the U.S. government. By the mid-1990s the National Helium Reserve near Amarillo was more than $1.4 billion in debt, and in 1996, the U.S. Congress ordered the gas reserves to be sold off to private companies. Commercial supplies of helium from the reserve will cease in 2021, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management. [ Beyond Balloons: 8 Unusual Facts About Helium ] \nThe Middle Eastern nation of Qatar has also been an important source of helium in recent years, supplying up to one-quarter of international demand from traces of helium separated from underground natural gas , Abraham-James said. \nBut supplies of helium from Qatar ceased earlier this year, after the closure of the country's border with Saudi Arabia and other sanctions imposed by several Middle Eastern nations over Qatar's alleged support for terrorist organizations, he said. \n\"The supply dynamics at the moment are very challenging, particularly with U.S. output stopping in 2021, and Qatar, it's fair to say, has its share of problems,\" he said. \"The world needs a reliable source of helium, so that we don't see the fluctuations that we have in recent times.\" \nHelium is created on Earth only by the radioactive decay of heavy elements like uranium . It takes millions of years for pockets of the gas, like those found in Texas and Tanzania, to accumulate underground, and the gas escapes easily into the atmosphere after use. \nAbraham-James said exploratory drilling will begin in June or July of next year, and the company expects to start producing the gas as soon as a small processing plant can be built in the area. \"Probably by the end of 2020, people will start to be using Tanzanian helium,\" he said. African gas \nBarry and Ballentine used a portable mass spectrometer to make the latest measurement of gas at the Helium One sites in Tanzania, rather than employing their earlier method of collecting samples for later analysis in a laboratory. \n\"We made probably 50 measurements out there in the field, and we saw up to four times as much helium in these samples,\" Barry told Live Science. \"So this was really exciting for us, because we were able to show quite convincingly that there's a lot more helium than we originally assessed.\" \nBarry and Ballentine were part of the scientific team that identified the location of likely helium pockets in Tanzania, using a new theory of helium production by underground heat sources \u2014 such as the volcanoes in Tanzania's Rift Valley region \u2014 which can set the gas free from where it slowly forms inside ancient rocks. \nBarry said the helium deposits were within a \"Goldilocks Zone\" for helium production, about 124 miles (200 kilometers) from the volcanic zone around Tanzania's Mount Rungwe. \n\"We think that you need to be in pretty close proximity to a volcanic center to have these gases liberate,\" he said. \nBarry added that the initial research on the Tanzanian helium field was presented at last year\u2019s Goldschmidt Conference on geochemistry in Yokohama, Japan, and that the updated research was presented at the same conference in August in Paris. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

By Dan Robitzski, Staff Writer | October 6, 2017 11:30am ET MORE Credit: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic/Getty \nActress Gabrielle Union has had \"eight or nine miscarriages ,\" according to an essay published in her new book. \nIn the book, Union, who is 44, described her struggles with fertility and in vitro fertilization (IVF), according to People magazine. \n\"For three years, my body has been a prisoner of trying to get pregnant \u2014 I've either been about to go into an IVF cycle, in the middle of an IVF cycle, or coming out of an IVF cycle,\" Union wrote in the book, \"We're Going to Need More Wine\" (HarperCollins, 2017). \"I have had eight or nine miscarriages,\" she wrote. [ 6 Myths About Miscarriage ] \nUp to 20 percent of known pregnancies (in other words, when a woman knows she is pregnant) end in miscarriage , according to the Mayo Clinic. The actual number of miscarriages, however, is probably higher, because many occur very early in pregnancy, before a woman knows she is pregnant, the Mayo Clinic says. But what causes miscarriages? And what factors raise a woman's risk? \nThe most common cause of miscarriage \u2014 which is the spontaneous loss of a fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy \u2014 is genetic problems that arise when the fetus is developing, according to the National Library of Medicine . (After the 20th week, the spontaneous loss of a fetus is considered a stillbirth.) These faulty genes are rarely inherited from the mother or the father; rather, the errors occur when the cells of an embryo or a fetus are rapidly dividing. This is especially the case for mothers who have had multiple miscarriages, according to a 2012 study of nearly 500 women that was published in the journal Human Reproduction. \nThese types of miscarriages have nothing to do with the mother's health or activities; rather, they result from events that occur by chance, according to the Mayo Clinic. \nDoctors refer to two or more consecutive miscarriages as \"recurrent pregnancy loss,\" according to UCLA Health . Recurrent pregnancy loss sometimes may be caused by genetic abnormalities in the mother, UCLA Health says, but in more than half of the women with the condition, the cause is unknown. A study from March , published in the journal Mitochondrial DNA Part A, found that recurrent pregnancy loss may be linked to genetic mutations in a woman's mitochondrial DNA. ( Mitochondria are the energy powerhouses of cells and have their own DNA separate from the rest of the cell.) \nWomen with recurrent pregnancy loss have a higher risk of miscarriages, according to the Mayo Clinic. \nCertain health conditions can also raise a woman's risk of miscarriage, including uncontrolled diabetes , infections, hormonal problems, uterine or cervical problems, and thyroid disease, according to the Mayo Clinic. \nAge is also a risk factor for miscarriage: A 35-year-old woman has about a 20 percent risk of having a miscarriage; a 40-year-old woman has about a 40 percent risk; and a 45-year-old woman has about an 80 percent risk, the Mayo Clinic says. \nSmoking, drinking and using drugs also increase a woman's risk of having a miscarriage, according to the National Library of Medicine. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

The sci-fi thriller will serve as a distant sequel to the original \"Blade Runner\" film from 1982, in which a faction of advanced humanoid robots become murderous in their quest to increase their artificially-shortened life spans. \nThe robots, called replicants, are nearly indistinguishable from humans in every way except for their emotions. They're so similar that it takes special police officers called Blade Runners, played by Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling, to administer a fictional Voight-Kampff test \u2014 not unlike a lie detector test for emotional responses \u2014 in order to tell them apart from real humans. \nAs real-world robotics becomes more and more advanced by the day, one might wonder how far off we really are from creating truly life-like, autonomous replicants. In order to do so, we'll need to sort out a few key aspects of robotics and artificial intelligence. Here's what we'd need to build a Blade Runner-like replicant. Create a brain that can learn Photo Credit: Phonlamai Photo/Shutterstock Slide 2 of 11 Create a brain that can learn \nThe quest toward a true, generalized artificial intelligence that requires neither training nor supervision to learn about the world has thus far eluded scientists. \nMost machine learning systems use either supervised or adversarial learning. In supervised learning, a human programmer provides the machine with thousands of examples to jumpstart its knowledge base. With adversarial learning, a computer trains itself against another computer or itself to optimize its own behavior. Adversarial learning is practical only for gaming \u2014 a chess-playing computer can play countless games against itself per minute but knows nothing else about the world . \nThe problem is that many researchers want to base artificial intelligence on the human brain, but basic knowledge of neuroscience progresses at a different rate than does our technological capabilities and ethical discussions over what it means to be intelligent , conscious and self-aware.

That's good, because scientists are really bad at programming emotion into intelligent machines . But replicants still have some semblance of emotion, which makes them more advanced than today's machines. \nIn order to teach emotional salience to robots, programmers need to use supervised learning just as they would to train image-detection software, according to Jizhong Xiao , the head of the robotics program at City College of New York. For example, a computer would need to face thousands of examples of a smile before it could detect and comprehend one on its own. \nThe machines would also need to comprehend emotional language. While some preliminary work has been done to teach context and proper language comprehension to computers by making an artificial intelligence agent read the entirety of Wikipedia , our AI isn't quite ready to take on the guise of a human as replicants do.

While hydrogels can make plastics feel more like living tissue and the silicone that coats some modern robots may feel similar to real flesh, it still doesn't pass for actual tissue, especially given that it would have to last for a replicant's entire 4-year life span. \nA robot that was put on display at a recent convention had to undergo expensive repairs after too many passers-by manhandled it . That's because even though artificial skins seem increasingly life-like, they don't possess skin's ability to self-repair. Rather, each tear and stretch will only compound over time. Some attempts to generate self-repairing plastics found early success, but they were only able to self-repair once. \nThe \"Terminator\" film series had a clever solution to the skin problem: Rather than being fully synthetic machines, the the terminators were described as simply robots encased in living tissues.

Credit: M. Weisberger/Live Science \nNEW YORK \u2014 A novel interactive at New York Comic Con (NYCC) allows visitors to sample the pulse-pounding adventures of a fictional CIA agent firsthand. \nIn \"Echo Escape,\" presented by Amazon, a group of players work together against a ticking clock, piecing together clues that will open the doors and release them from a series of locked rooms. But there's an unexpected twist to this unusual challenge. \nLike other escape rooms, this entertainment experience places participants in seemingly locked spaces, where they must solve puzzles that guide them to freedom. But this is the first such experience to incorporate voice-activated technology, Amazon representatives told Live Science. \"Echo Escape\" harnesses Amazon's Echo devices and the company's Alexa virtual assistant to help players find what they need in order to outwit enemy agents and escape each room before time runs out. [ 11 Odd and Intriguing Smart Home Technologies ] \n\"We wanted to show people the fun experiences that you can have using your voice \u2014 and an escape room seemed like a really unique way to do that,\" Amazon spokesperson Dawn Brun told Live Science at New York Comic Con (NYCC). \nIn homes, Echo devices and Alexa can perform a number of \"smart\" tasks, allowing users to remotely control lights, temperature settings and individual appliances via voice commands. Alexa can also search for information on the internet, play music, and perform tasks such as setting alarms and notifications and updating calendars. Amazon designed \"Echo Escape\" to incorporate ways that people can interact with Alexa , weaving those functions into a narrative that mirrors the world of the new Amazon original series \"Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan,\" coming out in 2018. \nThe series' title character, a CIA agent played by actor John Krasinski, was created by author Tom Clancy and was introduced in the 1984 political thriller \"The Hunt for Red October.\" Ryan has since appeared in five films, played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck and Chris Pine. \nIn \"Echo Escape,\" players use the Echo device to interact with voice recordings from Ryan and with video calls from another agent, known only as \"Foxtrot.\" Two types of Echo smart-home tech appear throughout the NYCC escape room: Echo Show, which includes a touch screen, and Echo Plus, a new device that incorporates a hub to connect multiple appliances. It's commercially available on Oct. 31. Helpful CIA operative \"Foxtrot\" shows team members what they need to find in order to complete the mission. Credit: M. Weisberger/Live Science \nThe mission, which takes about 20 minutes to complete, begins when a team of up to six players fitted with wireless microphones enters a small room resembling a metal vault. To open the locked door, and the doors of subsequent rooms, participants follow instructions from Ryan and interact with Foxtrot to find the objects that will advance them to the next level. The group can also request help along the way from Alexa, for instance, by remotely controlling the room's lighting or other elements. \n\"An escape room lends itself really well to 'Jack Ryan,'\" Brun told Live Science. \"And [a voice-enabled escape room] hasn't been done before, so we thought it would be a fun experiment to try.\" \n\"Echo Escape\" is at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center during New York Comic Con (Oct. 5 to Oct. 8) and is open to all badge-holders. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

But workers who handle the metal need to watch out, as airborne beryllium has been known to be highly toxic. \nNamed after beryllos , the Greek name for the mineral beryl, the element was originally known as glucinium \u2014 from Greek glykys , meaning \"sweet\"\u2014 to reflect its characteristic taste. But the chemists who discovered this unique property of beryllium also found that it is in fact highly toxic and should therefore never be tasted, according to Jefferson Lab . In fact, the metal, its alloys and salts should only be handled in accordance with specific work codes. Beryllium is also classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and it can cause lung cancer in people who get exposed to beryllium on a daily basis because of their occupations that require them to mine or process the metal, said Dr. Lew Pepper, a medical researcher at Queens College Center for the Biology of Natural Systems in New York. \nDespite its toxicity, the element is highly useful because of its unique qualities. For instance, it is one of the lightest metals and has one of the highest melting points among the light metals, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory . Steel gray in color, beryllium's modulus of elasticity is about one-third greater than steel. Beryllium is nonmagnetic and resistant to concentrated nitric acid. It also has superior thermal conductivity and resists oxidation in air in normal temperatures. Just the facts Atomic symbol (on the Periodic Table of the Elements ): Be Atomic weight (average mass of the atom): 9.012182 Density: 1.85 grams per cubic centimeter Phase at room temperature: Solid Melting point: 2,348.6 degrees Fahrenheit (1,287 degrees Celsius) Boiling point: 4,479.8 F (2,471 C) Number of isotopes (atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons): 12, including one stable isotope. Most common isotopes: 9 Be (Natural abundance: 100 percent) Beryllium discovery and use \nBeryllium was discovered in 1798 by the French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who found it in the oxide form in beryl and a green-colored variety of beryl, emerald.The metal was isolated in 1828 by two chemists, Friedrich W\u00f6lhler from Germany and Antoine Bussy from France, who independently reduced beryllium chloride (BeCl 2 ) with potassium in a platinum crucible, according to the Jefferson Lab . These days, beryllium is typically obtained from the minerals beryl and bertrandite in a chemical process or through the electrolysis of a mixture of molten beryllium chloride and sodium chloride, the Jefferson Lab reports. \nBeryllium is found in about 30 mineral species, including bertrandite, beryl, chrysoberyl, and phenacite, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory . Beryl and bertrandite are the most important commercial sources of the element and its compounds. \nBeryllium is alloyed with copper or nickel to make springs, gyroscopes, electrical contacts, spot-welding electrodes and non-sparking tools, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry . Other beryllium alloys are used in high-speed aircrafts and missiles, as well as spacecraft and communication satellites. Beryllium copper is also used in windshield frame, brake discs, support beams, and other structural components of the space shuttle. \nThanks to its low thermal neutron absorption cross-section, beryllium is used in nuclear reactors as a reflector or moderator. Moreover, the high melting point of beryllium oxide makes it a useful material for nuclear work and ceramic applications, according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory . \nWho knew? Emerald, morganite and aquamarine are precious forms of beryl. Some of the oldest emerald mines were developed by the Romans in the Eastern Desert of Egypt about 2,000 years ago, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . Beryllium-containing materials are used in cell phones, other portable devices and cameras, according to the Beryllium Science & Technology Association . Beryllium is also present in parts of the analytical equipment used to test blood for HIV and other diseases, the Beryllium Science & Technology Association reports. Beryllium played a role in the discovery of the neutron when James Chadwick bombarded beryllium with alpha particles and discovered the subatomic particle with no net electric charge. Beryllium was the primary ingredient used to make mirrors in NASA\u2019s James Webb Space Telescope, according to NASA . The European Commission lists beryllium as one of the 20 critical raw materials for the European Union. The U.S. Department of Defense classifies beryllium as a strategic and critical material as it can be found in products that are essential to national security, according to the U.S. Geological Survey . The United States is the world\u2019s leading beryllium source and producer. In fact, just one mine at Spor Mountain, Utah, was the source of more than 85 percent of beryllium excavated worldwide in 2010, the USGS reports. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays and is therefore used in windows for X-ray tubes, according to Jefferson Lab . Louis Nicolas Vauquelin \u2014 the chemist who discovered beryllium also discovered another element \u2014 chromium. Current research \nBeryllium has long been a topic of interest to researchers who have examined its harmful effects on health in people who are exposed to the metal on a daily basis for long periods of time. However, this risk does not apply to people in the general population who do not actually handle beryllium, Pepper said. \n\"Beryllium becomes harmful when it is generated into an airborne particulate \u2026 which is inhaled and descends into the lungs, and it can have an immunologic response in the individual,\" Pepper told Live Science. This immunologic response, called beryllium sensitization, can then develop into chronic beryllium disease, which causes scarring of the lung tissue and can be deadly. There is currently no cure for the disease, whose progression can be slowed by medication, oxygen therapy, and lung transplants in severe cases, according to the University of California San Francisco Medical Center . \nInterestingly, not all those who get exposed to potentially harmful levels of beryllium will experience an allergic, potentially deadly reaction. \"There is a genetic susceptibility component, which means that not everyone who is exposed is at risk of going on to develop sensitization, then chronic beryllium disease,\" Pepper said. \"For the most part, it depends upon a genetic susceptibility,\" he said. \nAbout 85 percent of people who develop chronic beryllium disease after getting exposed have an immune system protein known as HLA-DP2, according to recent research published in July 2014 in the journal Cell. In the study , researchers determined that the bodies of people who have this protein create a unique molecular \"pocket,\" which captures beryllium ions and triggers an inflammatory response in the lungs. \n\"The immune system does not actually 'see' beryllium,\" study author John Kappler, a researcher at National Jewish Health, said in a statement. \"The beryllium changes the shape of otherwise innocuous self-peptides [peptides produced by the body's own tissues] so that T cells recognize them as foreign and dangerous.\" (T cells are white blood cells that are essential for one's immunity.) He added that the new findings could one day lead to new therapeutic strategies to treat and prevent chronic beryllium disease. \nAdditional resources Here is more info on beryllium from the Los Alamos National Laboratory . This video shows how beryllium is extracted in the West Desert of Utah. Here is also a series of practical videos on beryllium worker safety training. Dating geological events with beryllium \nUsing a technique known as cosmogenic nuclide dating, scientists can determine how long rocks have been exposed to the air by measuring their levels of beryllium-10, a radioactive isotope of beryllium. Cosmogenic nuclide dating is often used to determine the dates of important geological events, such as glacier advances and retreats, rock slides, meteor impacts and lava flows. \nFor example, after a rock avalanche, boulders that land on top of the heap have surfaces that are exposed to the sky for the first time. Particles from incoming cosmic rays (high-energy radiation from outer space) begin to hit these boulder surfaces, creating beryllium-10. The longer the surface area is exposed, the greater the amount of beryllium-10, according to the University of Utah . \nIn a recent study, researchers at the University of Utah conducted the first rigorous analysis to date a landslide that had occurred thousands of years ago in what is now Zion National Park in Utah. Scientists have known for some time that the flat floor of this park was previously a lake originally created when a massive rock avalanche dammed up the Virgin River, but it was still unclear exactly when this landslide occurred. To find out, the researchers analyzed the levels of beryllium-10 in 12 boulders taken from the area. \nTheir findings conclude that the rock avalanche occurred about 4,800 years ago as a single event, with a range of uncertainty that gives or takes 400 years, according to the University of Utah . Their work was published in 2016 in GSA Today, the journal of the Geological Society of America. \nAdditional reporting by Traci Pedersen, Live Science contributor.

But some discoveries, though impressive on their own, hint at something bigger and more intriguing. Those are the mysteries that keep archaeologists up at night. From the cryptic Sea People who are thought to have attacked civilizatoins throughout the Mediterranean to massive stone structures formed into various geometric shapes in Jordan and Syria to hidden tombs in Egypt's Valley of the Kings, researchers are hot on the trail of solving some pretty amazing archaeological mysteries. Here are 16 of those. Who were the Sea People Photo Credit: Prisma/UIG/Getty Slide 2 of 35 Who were the Sea People \nAround 3,200 years ago, a group of people whom modern-day scholars often call the Sea People attacked cities and civilizations throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Many cities were destroyed and the Sea People, who may have been from the Aegean (based on the design of their pottery), settled in the Middle East. \nExcavation of cities associated with the Sea People and studies of ancient texts that mention them are ongoing. In October 2017, archaeologists revealed a massive stone inscription that refers to the Sea People and was found in Beyk\u00f6y, in Turkey. Slide 3 of 35 What are the Works of the Old Men? Photo Credit: CNES/DigitalGlobe/Google Slide 4 of 35 What are the Works of the Old Men? \nThe Works of the Old Men , as the Bedouin called them in the early 20th century, are a variety of stone structures found in Jordan, Syria and Saudi Arabia. The structures are often difficult to make out on the ground but can be readily seen in airplanes or on satellite images. The stone structures tend to be named after the shapes they form \u2014 with \"kites,\"\" wheels \" and \"gates\" being used to describe the shape of the structures. \nResearch into these structures is ongoing and Live Science is aware that researchers are about to publish a paper on new discoveries from Saudi Arabia.

Photo Credit: Photo12/UIG/Getty Slide 6 of 35 Are there any hidden chambers in the Great Pyramid? \nResearch carried out by the Scan Pyramids Project indicates that there may be two unknown voids or cavities inside the Great Pyramid \u2014 the largest pyramid ever built by the ancient Egyptians. It was constructed at Giza about 4,500 years ago for the pharaoh Khufu. \nOne void is located on the northeast corner of the pyramid, while the other is located on the north face of the pyramid behind four building blocks with chevron designs (an inverted v-shape). \nSome scientists who have reviewed the research have cast doubt on the findings and more scans are being conducted to try to verify the results. New results may be announced in 2017. Slide 7 of 35 Are there hidden royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings?

Credit: Alex Khripunov/Shutterstock \nA 3,200-year-old stone slab with an inscription that tells of a Trojan prince and may refer to the mysterious Sea People has been deciphered, archaeologists announced today (Oct. 7). \nThe stone inscription, which was 95 feet (29 meters) long, describes the rise of a powerful kingdom called Mira, which launched a military campaign led by a prince named Muksus from Troy . \nThe inscription is written in an ancient language called Luwian that just a few scholars, no more than 20 by some estimates, can read today. Those scholars include Fred Woudhuizen, an independent scholar, who has now deciphered a copy of the inscription. [ Cracking Codices: 10 of the Most Mysterious Ancient Manuscripts ] \nWoudhuizen and Eberhard Zangger, a geoarchaeologist who is president of the Luwian Studies foundation, will publish findings on the inscription in the December issue of the journal Proceedings of the Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society. According to James Mellaart's notes, this Luwian inscription was copied by the archaeologist Georges Perrot in 1878 at Beyk\u00f6y in Turkey. The inscription dates back 3,200 years and discusses the rise of a kingdom called Mira and how it launched raids in targets across the Middle East, destroying the Hittite Empire, along with other kingdoms. Credit: James Mellaart \nIf the inscription is authentic, it shines light on a period when a confederation of people that modern-day scholars sometimes call the Sea People destroyed cities and civilizations across the Middle East, scholars say. The kingdom of Mira, which engaged in this military campaign, was apparently part of this Sea People confederation given their participation in the attacks . A Trojan war? \nThe inscription tells of how King Kupantakuruntas ruled a kingdom called Mira that was located in what is now western Turkey. Mira controlled Troy (also in Turkey), according to the inscription, which additionally described Trojan prince Muksus leading a naval expedition that succeeded in conquering Ashkelon, located in modern-day Israel , and constructing a fortress there. [ Biblical Battles: 12 Ancient Wars Lifted from the Bible ] \nThe inscription details King Kupantakuruntas' storied path to the throne of Mira: His father, King Mashuittas, took control of Troy after a Trojan king named Walmus was overthrown. Soon after that, King Mashuittas reinstated Walmus on the Trojan throne in exchange for his loyalty to Mira, the inscription says. \nKupantakuruntas became king of Mira after his dad died. He then took control of Troy, although he wasn't the actual king of Troy. In the inscription, Kupantakuruntas describes himself as a guardian of Troy, imploring future rulers of Troy to \"guard Wilusa [an ancient name for Troy] (like) the great king (of) Mira (did).\" (translation by Woudhuizen) A copy of a copy \nThe inscription itself no longer exists, having been destroyed in the 19th century, but records of the inscription, including a copy of it, were found in the estate of James Mellaart, a famous archaeologist who died in 2012. Mellaart discovered several ancient sites in his life, the most famous of which is \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, a massive, 9,500-year-old settlement in Turkey that some scholars think is the oldest city in the world. [ The 25 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth ] \nMellaart left instructions saying that if the inscription could not be fully deciphered and published before he died, other scholars should do so as soon as possible. Some scholars (not Zangger and Woudhuizen's team) have raised concerns that the inscription could be a modern-day forgery created by Mellaart or someone else. \nMellaart briefly mentioned the existence of the inscription in at least one publication, a book review published in 1992 in the Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society journal. But he never fully described the inscription in a scientific publication. \nAccording to Mellaart's notes, the inscription was copied in 1878 by an archaeologist named Georges Perrot near a village called Beyk\u00f6y in in Turkey. Shortly after Perrot recorded the inscription, villagers used the stone as building material for a mosque, according to Mellaart's notes. In the aftermath of the inscription being used as building material for the mosque, Turkish authorities searched the village and found three inscribed bronze tablets that are now missing. The bronze tablets were never published and it is not certain exactly what they say. \nA scholar named Bahad\u0131r Alk\u0131m (who died in 1981) rediscovered Perrot's drawing of the inscription and made a copy, which Mellaart, in turn, also copied and which the Swiss-Dutch team has now deciphered. Last member of a team \nMellaart was part of a team of scholars who, starting in 1956, worked to decipher and publish Perrot's copy of the inscription, along with the now-missing bronze tablets and several other Luwian inscriptions, his notes say. \nMellaart's notes state that the team he was part of was unable to publish its work before most of the team members died. The notes add that the team Mellaart worked on included the scholars Albrecht Goetze (died 1971), Bahad\u0131r Alk\u0131m (died 1981), Handam Alk\u0131m (died 1985), Edmund Irwin Gordon (died 1984), Richard David Barnett (died 1986) and Hamit Z\u00fcbeyir Ko\u015fay (died 1984). Mellaart, who was one of the younger members of the team, died at the age of 86, having outlived the rest of his team. \nThe Swiss-Dutch team found that in his later years, Mellaart spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand the copies of the different Luwian inscriptions in his possession. However, Mellaart couldn't read Luwian; he was brought onto the team for his knowledge of the archaeological landscape of western Turkey, while other members could read the ancient language . [ Cracking Codes: 5 Ancient Languages Yet to Be Deciphered ] Did the inscription exist? \nLive Science talked to several scholars not affiliated with the research. Some of them expressed concern that the inscription is a modern-day forgery. They said that until records of the inscription are found that are not left behind by Mellaart, they can't be sure the inscription existed. \nZangger and Woudhuizen said that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for Mellaart or someone else to create such a forgery. The inscription is very lengthy, and Mellaart couldn't read, much less write Luwian, they said in their paper. They also noted that nobody had deciphered Luwian until the 1950s, which means that Perrot wouldn't have been able to forge it either. Zangger and Woudhuizen added that few scholars today are able to read Luwian, much less write a lengthy inscription. They said they also don't understand why Mellaart would have wanted to create a lengthy and complex forgery, but leave it largely unpublished. [ 24 Amazing Archaeological Discoveries ] \nMellaart was accused in his life of inadvertently aiding smugglers and exaggerating or even \"imagining evidence\" (as Ian Hodder, the current director of excavations at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck put it) to prove his archaeological ideas; however, he was never found to have created a forgery , Zangger and Woudhuizen noted. \nEven so, Zangger told Live Science that until records of the inscription are found apart from Mellaart's estate, he can't be totally certain it's authentic and not a forgery. \nZangger is also publishing details of the newly deciphered inscription in a German-language book called \"Die Luwier und der Trojanische Krieg \u2013 Eine Forschungsgeschichte,\" (Orell F\u00fcssli, 2017), which is being released today. \nEditor's note: This article was updated to reflect the fact that Woudhuizen, not Zangger, can read Luwian and was the one who deciphered the inscription. \nOriginal article published on Live Science.

By Mindy Weisberger, Live Science Senior Writer | October 10, 2017 04:46pm ET MORE Whether slick and shiny or grimy and pitted, cities of the future can harbor dark and desperate stories. Credit: KhDuy Vo/Shutterstock \nNEW YORK \u2014 Grim sci-fi and speculative fiction tales are often rooted in scenarios of oppression, moral disintegration or even total social collapse \u2014 from the perpetual surveillance and menace of \"Big Brother\" in George Orwell's \"1984,\" to the deadly state-sanctioned battles fought by desperate children in Suzanne Collins'\"The Hunger Games\" trilogy. \nBut as bleak as these stories are, they have captivated readers and writers alike for decades. What drives authors to imagine these broken futures, and what might explain their enduring popularity? \nOn Oct. 6, a panel of writers at New York Comic Con (NYCC) explored their own relationships with dystopian sci-fi , and what characters who navigate dire situations in futuristic but degraded environments under totalitarian control can tell us about our world today \u2014 and about ourselves. [ Doom and Gloom: Top 10 Post-Apocalyptic Worlds ] \nSome authors of dystopian sci-fi write to exorcise their own fears about how the future might go horribly wrong, panelist Lauren Oliver explained. But many also find that the genre allows them to address contemporary issues that might otherwise be too uncomfortable to confront, Oliver said. In her book \"Ringer\" (HarperCollins, 2017), Oliver uses a plot about cloning to highlight the topic of inequality, and to point out how some people in society are considered expendable \u2014 a grave problem that we face today, she told the audience at NYCC. At New York Comic Con, moderator Petra Mayer led a discussion with authors Paolo Bacigalupi, Lauren Oliver, D. Nolan Clark, Amy S. Foster and Scott Reintgen, for the Oct. 6 panel \"The End of the World and Questionable Futures.\" Credit: M. Weisberger/Live Science \nDystopian science fiction can also introduce weighty topics, such as climate change, in ways that are entertaining, and not \"dry or preachy,\" panelist Paolo Bacigalupi said. \nWhen a reader meets a character who's trying to survive on a coastline that's been reshaped by rising sea levels, or who's coping with a Category 6 hurricane , the story resonates because it reflects circumstances that are already in motion around us, Bacigalupi said. Recent destructive hurricanes like Harvey, Irma and Maria have already raised concerns about the possibility of stronger storms to come , fueled by a warming world, he told the audience. \n\"Fiction lets you talk about something that hasn't happened yet, but we're leaning toward it,\" he said. \nVisiting a pessimistic future can also be surprisingly cathartic, because the reader knows that, however frightening that world may be, they can instantly leave it behind with the turn of a page, according to panelist D. Nolan Clark. A reader can experience the gamut of anxiety and unease, but there's also a sense of relief and safety when they step away from the book \u2014 which isn't always possible in real life, Clark said. \nDystopian fiction also provides a space where readers can wrestle safely with disturbing situations in an uncertain or malevolent world, panelist Scott Reintgen explained. And seeing characters make tough decisions and bravely face gut-wrenching challenges provides a shred of hope that goodness can still prevail, even when the odds seem hopeless, Clark said. \n\"A lot of us feel like we don't have any control over our lives these days.

Credit: Ramona Heim/Shutterstock \nSAN DIEGO \u2014 A potential new drug might protect infants from whooping cough in their first few months of life, before they can be vaccinated, early research suggests. \nIn a new study, researchers gave this drug to baboons just after they were born, and found that the drug protected the animals when they were subsequently infected with the bacteria that cause whooping cough. \nThe study was presented here Thursday (Oct. 5) at an infectious disease conference called IDWeek 2017. [ 27 Devastating Infectious Diseases ] \nHuman infants are most vulnerable to whooping cough during their first two months of life \u2014 when they are too young to get the whooping cough vaccine. (Babies' immune systems are not mature enough to respond to the whooping cough vaccine until they are 2 months old.) For this reason, women are advised to get the whooping cough vaccine, called Tdap, during pregnancy, so that they can pass protective antibodies to the fetus before birth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nBut not all pregnant mothers get the whooping cough vaccine \u2014 among U.S. women who gave birth between fall 2015 and spring 2016, less than half (49 percent) received the recommended vaccine, according to the CDC. \n\"It's hard to get 100 percent of all mothers vaccinated,\" said Jennifer Maynard, an associate professor in the Department of Chemical Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin, and lead author of the new study . \nA potential solution to this problem would be to give infants a drug as soon as they are born that would protect them against whooping cough. \nMaynard and her colleagues investigated such a drug in their study. The drug contains an antibody \u2014 an immune system protein that binds to harmful pathogens to stop infection. In this case, the antibody , called hu1B7, binds to the toxin produced by whooping cough bacteria and renders the toxin harmless. \n\"It's essentially giving you instant immunity, as if the baby has been fully vaccinated,\" Maynard told Live Science. \nIn the new study, the researchers gave hu1B7 to seven baboons a few days after they were born, and compared them with another seven baboons who did not receive hu1B7. When the animals were later infected with whooping cough bacteria, called Bordetella pertussis , all of the baboons that received hu1B7 appeared normal, and didn't develop any symptoms of whooping cough. In contrast, the baboons that did not receive hu1B7 got sick, and four had to be euthanized, Maynard said. \nThe study was funded in part by Synthetic Biologics, a biotechnology company that is developing the drug with hu1B7. The study was also funded by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the U.S. National Institutes of Health. \nUnlike a vaccine , hu1B7 antibodies don't provide long-term protection \u2014 the antibodies are degraded and cleared from the body after a limited amount of time, Maynard said. The hu1B7 drug has a \"half life\" of about 25 days in people, meaning that about half of the drug is cleared from the body in that time. But Maynard and colleagues have engineered a slightly different version of hu1B7 that doesn't degrade as quickly. Based on their animal studies, the researchers hypothesize that this altered version of hu1B7 would have a half life in people of 80 to 100 days. \nIf this turns out to be true, \"then you could give one dose and it could really protect [infants] for that whole period during which babies are most susceptible,\" Maynard said. \nThe next step is to conduct a trial in humans to see if the findings from the animal studies hold true in people. Synthetic Biologics has an \"orphan drug\" designation for its drug, which allows the company to move forward more quickly with a human trial, Maynard said. \nAn earlier study by Synthetic Biologics also found that hu1B7, combined with a second antibody called hu11E6, was effective at treating Bordetella pertussis infection in baboons. The company is considering the possibility of testing the drug for prevention or treatment of whooping cough. \nOriginal article on Live Science Editor's Recommendations", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rachael rettner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jennifer maynard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maynard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramona heim/shutterstock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bill & melinda gates foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "synthetic biologics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of texas at austin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of chemical engineering", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. national institutes of health", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san diego", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T15:41:14.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5617bea6ea45debae851c366e678d0f5a620feae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmM_DUifvNCNOyZq6Z6xo8nZwYqZGyzbNx9BNqy6HurnBEfetpIH1pVNzRFAPklTku", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/foxnews/latest?format=xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "FOX News", "title": "Here's how to talk to your kids about opioids", "title_full": "Here's how to talk to your kids about opioids", "published": "2017-10-09T16:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "//a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2017/09/22/0/0/694940094001_5584719299001_5584699850001-vs.jpg?ve=1", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 41, "comments": 0, "shares": 41}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5617bea6ea45debae851c366e678d0f5a620feae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmM_DUifvNCNOyZq6Z6xo8nZwYqZGyzbNx9BNqy6HurnBEfetpIH1pVNzRFAPklTku", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Margie Skeer, Tufts University", "published": "2017-10-09T16:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Here's how to talk to your kids about opioids", "text": "close Opioid Epidemic: Can alternative treatments help? As many as one in four people struggle with addiction. There are alternatives to opioid use like meditation, tai chi and acupuncture that are helping patients knock out pain\nBy now, most people are aware of the enormity of the opioid epidemic. In 2015, over 33,000 Americans died from an opioid overdose \u2013 more from opioid pain relievers than heroin.\nJust because someone experiments with opioids doesn't mean that he or he will become addicted. However, there's risk with any opioid use, even when it's medically warranted. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency classifies opioids as a Schedule II drug, a substance with medically accepted use but a high potential for abuse.\nMany parents and guardians don't think their child is at risk for misusing opioids. While that may be true, consider this: In 2013, one in eight U.S. high school seniors reported using opioids for nonmedical reasons. In 2015, 122,000 teens under 17 and 427,000 adolescents between 18 and 25 had a pain reliever use disorder, meaning that they had a problem with the drug.\nSOLVING THE OPIOID CRISIS MUST START IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE\nI've studied substance use prevention for 15 years, including time in rehabilitation centers with teenagers addicted to heroin, so I understand how critical it is to prevent opioid use at a young age. Fortunately, there's a lot of research on this topic, as well as numerous resources to help parents figure out where to start.\nWhat parents need to know First, parents should educate themselves about opioids: what they are, how they work in the brain and body, risk factors for using them and how to spot signs of use.\nParents shouldn't convey misinformation about opioids to their children. If their children find out that what they've been told isn't accurate, they may turn instead to their peers for information.\nThere are excellent online resources available for parents and their children, such as the National Institute on Drug Abuse for Teens website and the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids' Parent Drug Guide .\nVideo How serious is the opioid epidemic? It's particularly important to note the long-term effects that nonmedical use of opioids can have on adolescents. Around puberty, the brain starts a massive restructuring process. Neural connections get stronger and stronger, helping adolescents go from the emotional decision-making of youth to rational decision-making in early adulthood. This process continues until the mid- to late 20's.\nDuring this time, what adolescents do can get \"hard-wired\" into the brain. So, for example, if a young person is engaged in academics, sports or learning a musical instrument, those connections get set in the brain. If they spend a lot of time using drugs, those could be the connections that stick. That means they'd have an increased chance of developing a substance use disorder later in life.\nIn adolescence, many people learn important life skills, including how to cope with adversity. However, long-term drug use that starts during adolescence can affect our memory and learning . Because drugs, particularly opioids, help alleviate both physical and emotional pain, adolescents may then continually turn to this drug as a way to cope, rather than using more adaptive coping skills that are usually learned during this time.\nStarting the conversation One of the most important tools that parents have is the ability to talk to their child about substance use. While talking about drugs with young people isn't always comfortable, research has shown that it's critical for prevention.\nChances are good that even young teenagers will have heard about opioids and overdose deaths at some point. Pretending that opioid use is not a problem \u2013 or thinking that a child is a \"good kid\" and therefore doesn't need to hear and talk about it \u2013 is a mistake. Being a \"good kid\" does not mean that an adolescent will not be curious or be tempted by peers.\nStarting the conversation can be difficult. I advise parents to keep an eye out for a time when the topic can naturally come up. For example, if a celebrity is found to be using opioids or other drugs, or if the problem comes up in the child's school or neighborhood, or even on the child's social media account, this could provide the opening for a discussion.\nDALLAS SEES 177 PERCENT SPIKE IN K2-RELATED 911 CALLS\nParents could ask their children if they have heard about opioids and, if so, what they know. That could be a good starting point and an opportunity to do the research together.\nThere are also helpful online resources that provide tips and advice on how to have these types of conversations, such as the Parent Talk Kit , which provides advice on what to say in specific scenarios with kids of different ages. For example, the beginning of high school is an incredibly important time for parents to bring up how some teens use opioids and to let their child know that, if she ever makes a mistake or gets stuck in a bad situation, she should come and talk to them.\nThese conversations aren't a one-shot deal. They should happen often, ideally repeating parents' expectations and adding new information when relevant.\nOther tips Parents should make an effort to get to know their children's friends. Having friends who use drugs is very strongly associated with adolescents' own drug use.\nAdditionally, children are less likely to use prescription drugs if their parents monitor where they are when they're not at home.\nMore on this... America's opioid-use epidemic: 5 startling facts 10 interesting facts about heroin Opioid crisis has frightening parallels to drug epidemic of late 1880s About two-thirds of teenagers who use prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons report getting the drugs from friends or family members, including taking them from medicine cabinets without people knowing. So, parents should properly and safely secure their prescription medication, especially opioids.\nFinally, if parents suspect that their child is using or has a problem with opioids, it's imperative to get help as soon as possible. The best outcomes often come from intervening early.\nFor more information, the Partnership for Drug Free Kids has a resource hotline with advice on how to confront children about suspected drug use, as well as additional resources to help parents navigate getting children help with a substance use disorder.\nThe good news is that nonmedical opioid use among adolescents is on the decline. However, it's still a significant problem that needs attention. Parents have the power to help \u2013 and talking to their children is an important first step.\nThis story was published in collaboration with PBS NewsHour.\nMargie Skeer , Associate Professor of Public Health and Community Medicine; Interim Director of the Health Communication Program, Tufts University", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "margie skeer", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "tufts university", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "national institute on drug abuse for teens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. drug enforcement agency", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-09T17:25:30.029+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c92e755cd718e45633103ea8867197ee0ab369b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmM_DUifvNCNNjAHFa6lOlK3nHFPJz_gEfy9hTb4DYNsytUnKHL5y4jUD4Ahw9gudNFnkqujKj05o-", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "No Sweat: Small Doses of Exercise May Ward Off Depression", "title_full": "No Sweat: Small Doses of Exercise May Ward Off Depression", "published": "2017-10-09T18:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.051, "main_image": "https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA5Mi80MzAvb3JpZ2luYWwvcnVubmluZzEuanBn", "performance_score": 4, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 486, "comments": 1, "shares": 486}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 25}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c92e755cd718e45633103ea8867197ee0ab369b7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmM_DUifvNCNNjAHFa6lOlK3nHFPJz_gEfy9hTb4DYNsytUnKHL5y4jUD4Ahw9gudNFnkqujKj05o-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jasmin Malik Chua", "published": "2017-10-09T18:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "No Sweat: Small Doses of Exercise May Ward Off Depression", "text": "No Sweat: Small Doses of Exercise May Ward Off Depression By Jasmin Malik Chua, Live Science Contributor | October 9, 2017 03:00pm ET MORE Credit: Shutterstock \nAnyone who has experienced the euphoric \"runner's high\" that follows a satisfying workout will likely attest to a connection between physical activity and mental health. Studies have long borne this theory out: Endorphins, the opiate-like chemicals that flood the brain after intense or sustained exercise, appear to act as a buffer against depressive thoughts and feelings. \nBut you don't have to train to the point of collapse to reap the benefits of this \"mind-body\" relationship: A new study from Australia finds that even small doses of exercise \u2014 as little as 1 hour per week \u2014 can elevate one's mood, regardless of age or gender. [ How to Start an Exercise Routine and Stick to It ] \n\"We've known for some time that exercise has a role to play in treating symptoms of depression, but this is the first time we have been able to quantify the preventative potential of physical activity in terms of reducing future levels of depression,\" lead study author Dr. Samuel Harvey, an associate professor of medicine at the Black Dog Institute at the University of New South Wales, said in a statement . \nIn the study, which was published Oct. 3 in the American Journal of Psychiatry , the researchers looked at data from the Health Study of Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag County (aka the HUNT study), one of most extensive population-based health surveys ever conducted. Specifically, they tracked the levels of exercise and symptoms of depression in nearly 34,000 Norwegian adults between January 1984 and June 1997. \nAt the beginning of the HUNT study, participants were asked about their frequency and intensity of exercise , then, at a follow-up session, about any symptoms of anxiety and depression. \nThe scientists found that people who said they never exercised had a 44 percent increased risk of developing depression compared with those who sweated it out 1 to 2 hours a week. There was no link between exercise levels and symptoms of anxiety, however. \nIn fact, just 1 hour of physical activity each week could have prevented 12 percent of depression diagnoses over the course of the study period, the researchers said. \n\"These results highlight the great potential to integrate exercise into individual mental health plans and broader public health campaigns,\" Harvey said. \"If we can find ways to increase the population's level of physical activity even by a small amount, then this is likely to bring substantial physical and mental health benefits.\" \nThe findings are significant, but perhaps even more so because most of the psychological benefits of exercise manifest almost immediately, Harvey said. \n\"With sedentary lifestyles becoming the norm worldwide, and rates of depression growing, these results are particularly pertinent as they highlight that even small lifestyle changes can reap significant mental health benefits,\" he added. \nScientists are unsure why exercise has this protective effect. \u201cBut we believe it is from the combined impact of the various physical and social benefits of physical activity,\u201d Harvey said. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Choi, Live Science Contributor | October 9, 2017 01:54pm ET MORE Bacterial colonies programmed with synthetic genes can assemble microscopic particles of gold into useful devices such as sensors, a new study finds.\nThis work is proof \"of the ability to grow a functional device starting from a single cell ,\" said study senior author Lingchong You, a synthetic biologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \"This process is analogous to programming a cell to grow an entire tree.\" \nNature is full of examples in which living things create structures by combining organic and inorganic materials. For instance, mollusks grow shells and humans grow bones by weaving calcium-based molecules with organic components. [ Magnificent Microphotography: 50 Tiny Wonders ] \nThe ability to use bacteria to fabricate devices could have many advantages over current manufacturing processes, You and his colleagues said. For instance, biological fabrication uses raw materials and energy very efficiently and is typically environmentally friendly, they said. \nPrevious research successfully used bacteria to assemble devices that incorporated metallic components and other inorganic parts. In a 2014 study published in the journal Nature Materials , scientists at MIT and their colleagues wove bacteria and inorganic components, such as gold particles and microscopic crystals, into hybrid materials that could emit light or conduct electricity. \nHowever, in that 2014 study, the bacteria still needed outside coaxing in order to assemble structures. Now, scientists have figured out a way to genetically program bacteria so they manufacture devices on their own. \nThe new study's researchers incorporated a series of synthetic genes into E. coli , a microbe that's common in the human gut . These genes worked together a bit like the components of an electronic circuit to carry out a set of biological instructions. A demonstration of the pressure sensor built by bacteria in action as a researcher taps out some Morse code. Credit: Will (Yangxiaolu) Cao, Kara Manke/Duke University \nColonies of the bacteria grew into dome-like structures. The researchers could alter the size and shape of the colonies by controlling the properties of the porous membranes they grew on. For instance, changing the size of the pores or how much the membranes repelled water influenced how many nutrients could reach the microbes and thus alter their growth pattern, according to the study. \nThe gene circuit in the bacteria also had the microbes generate a protein that latched onto specific inorganic compounds \u2014 in this case, microscopic gold particles. This caused the bacteria to create golden shells about the size of an average freckle, the researchers said. \nThese golden shells could be used as pressure sensors, according to the scientists. The researchers used copper wires to connect golden domes with LEDs . When pressure was applied to a dome, that deformation increased its electrical conductivity, leading the LED connected to it to brighten a certain amount depending on the amount of pressure applied. \n\"To me, the most surprising and exciting part of the research was that the pressure sensor worked so well,\" You said. \"When we first came up with the simple design, we thought the structures would be too fragile, such that the whole device could collapse after a single push. Yet it turned out that the composite structures were quite resilient. The pressure sensor worked upon many rounds of pressing.\" \nThe researchers stressed that they could potentially manufacture far more than just pressure sensors with bacteria. \"We could use biologically responsive materials to create living circuits ,\" study lead author Will (Yangxiaolu) Cao, a postdoctoral researcher at Duke University, said in a statement. \"Or, if we could keep the bacteria alive, you could imagine making materials that could heal themselves and respond to environmental changes.\" \nThe researchers cautioned that biofabrication by genetically modified cells is in its infancy. \"The process is certainly tedious and requires tremendous technical know-how, and the resulting pressure sensor would be cumbersome in comparison to commercially available ones,\" You said. \nStill, \"what the work demonstrates is a fundamentally new approach to assemble structured materials,\" You said.

Credit: Rohan Cleave/Melbourne Zoo \nEfforts to resurrect long-extinct species like the woolly mammoth or carrier pigeon have garnered a lot of attention and debate, but in at least one case, a massive insect thought to be long gone has come back all on its own. DNA analysis has revealed that the insect, known as a \"tree lobster,\" is still alive and kicking. \nWith its thick, worm-like tail and widened, blade-like back legs, the palm-size Lord Howe Island stick insect could easily have crawled out of a horror movie. After rats arrived and tore through the population in 1918, the critters were thought to be have been utterly destroyed, and they were officially declared extinct in 1960. But a few years later, remains of what seemed to be tree lobsters were found on the nearby island of Ball's Pyramid. The finding was largely ignored, however, because the insects looked different from any of the insects from Lord Howe Island, according to new research \nIt wasn't until 2001 that some live stick insects were found and collected from Ball's Pyramid, and new research published online Oct. 5 in the journal Current Biology confirmed through DNA analysis that the two types of bugs are in fact the same species \u2014 contrary to reports, the tree lobster never went extinct. [ Gallery: Out-of-This-World Images of Insects ] \n\"In this case, it seems like we're lucky and we have not lost this species forever, although by all rights we should have,\" study lead author Alexander Mikheyev, a professor in the Ecology and Evolution Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), said in a statement . \"We get another chance \u2014 but very often we do not.\" The \"tree lobster\" stick insect has a thick, worm-like tail and widened, blade-like back legs. Credit: Rohan Cleave/Melbourne Zoo \nThe Ball's Pyramid population of the insect, Dryococelus australis , is a darker shade than its Lord Howe Island counterpart, with thinner legs and a longer tail. It's possible that the two islands, which are now about 12 miles (20 kilometers) apart, may have been larger and therefore closer together during an ice age, allowing a population of the stick insects to migrate and become separated from the group that was eradicated by rats, according to a 2011 study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. As such, the insects found on Ball's Pyramid are considered to be a so-called \"relic population,\" according to the study. \nThe Australian government soon aims to enact a $10 million conservation plan on Lord Howe Island that includes eradicating its invasive rat population, in response to the widespread ecological damage the rats have caused to date, driving 12 (previously thought to be 13) invertebrates and five birds to extinction, according to the Lord Howe Island Board . The rats are also threatening another 70 species that are native to the island. Once that's done, conservationists plan to try to reintroduce D. australis to the island. \nBringing a new species to a habitat, even in the name of conservation and restoring a more natural ecosystem, can be rife with political and legal red tape. However, the scientists who verified that the Lord Howe Island and the Ball's Pyramid stick insects are one and the same, argue that their DNA evidence will make the process easier, because there are fewer legislative hurdles for reintroducing a species than there are for bringing in a new one. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

A small new study from Australia suggests that making some changes to your diet could help ease your tummy troubles when working out. \nIn the study, researchers found that eating a diet low in foods containing \"FODMAPs\" led to less gastrointestinal distress in endurance athletes compared with a high-FODMAP diet, according to the study, published online in September in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise . \nFODMAPs (short for fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyols) are a group of short-chain carbohydrates found in a variety of foods, including wheat, onions, milk, apples and cauliflower. [ Get Gutsy About Your Digestive Health in 2017 ] \nThese carbohydrates aren't well-digested in the upper part of the gut, so when they arrive in the large intestine, they are fermented by gut bacteria, producing gas, said Dana Lis, a health sciences researcher at the University of Tasmania in Australia. FODMAPs can cause symptoms in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but are \"rarely an issue\" for those without IBS, Lis said. \nBut earlier work by Lis led her to suspect that FODMAPs could be a culprit of gastrointestinal distress in otherwise-healthy endurance athletes. For example, Lis and her team found that a gluten-free diet reduced stomach issues in athletes, but it didn't seem like the gluten itself was responsible for the effects. Instead, the gluten-free diet also cut out a lot of FODMAPs, Lis told Live Science. \nIn addition, most athletes say that they avoid at least one food high in FODMAPs to reduce GI symptoms, even if they don't realize the food is high in the compounds, Lis said. \nTo test the hypothesis, 11 recreational competitive runners with self-reported exercise-related GI symptoms \u2014 such as bloating and diarrhea \u2014 ate either a high-FODMAP diet or a low-FODMAP diet for six days. During that time, they followed a prescribed training routine. After the six days, the people in the study took one day off, and then repeated the procedure with the other diet. \nAthletes reported fewer symptoms, on average, during exercise with the low-FODMAP diet compared with when they followed the high-FODMAP diet, the researchers found. In particular, the low-FODMAP diet was associated with reduced flatulence , urge to defecate, loose stool and diarrhea during exercise. \nChanges in the body during exercise are the main reason that endurance athletes experience GI symptoms, Lis said. For example, during exercise, less blood flows to the gut, which can affect digestion . \nBut it's possible that FODMAPs make these symptoms worse: Even healthy people don't digest FODMAPs well, and when gut function is already affected by exercise, digesting the short-chain carbohydrates becomes even more difficult, Lis said. \nIn addition, many endurance athletes tend to eat high-FODMAP diets, including lots of fruits, vegetables and sports-related food products, Lis said. Though this can be good for gut health overall, some athletes may benefit from cutting back on FODMAPs around key training sessions, she said. [ Fitness Nutrition: What Science Says About Diet and Exercise ] \nThe new study was very small, and more research is needed to confirm the findings. However, Lis said that \"for athletes who are at their wits' end trying to deal with exercise-associated GI distress, this could be a novel tool for possible symptom reduction,\" particularly around specific endurance events. \"A full low-FODMAP diet for an extended period is rarely advised and could lead to unnecessary diet restriction,\" she added. \nA sports nutritionist can help athletes design a safe low-FODMAP diet, Lis said. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Choi, Live Science Contributor | October 9, 2017 04:56pm ET MORE In spy novels and superhero films, the ability to see through walls has always been a handy \u2014 not to mention, impressive \u2014 trick. And now, this tech could be available to people in real life, with smartphone cameras that can help detect moving objects even if they are hidden around corners, according to a new study.\nThis futuristic-sounding tech could one day help vehicles see around blind corners, the researchers said. \n\"We may eventually be able to use this idea to alert drivers to pedestrians or cars that are about to dart out from behind buildings into a driver's path. Perhaps a few seconds of notice could save lives,\" said study lead author Katie Bouman, an imaging scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.[ Mind-Controlled Cats?! 6 Incredible Spy Technologies That Are Real ] \n\"Search and rescue, or helping to understand what is going on behind a wall in a hostage situation, are also potential applications,\" Bouman added. \nResearchers have taken many different approaches in trying to make the \"superpower\" of seeing around corners a reality. For example, in 2015, researchers showed they could use lasers to see objects around corners by firing light pulses at surfaces near the items. Those surfaces could act like mirrors, scattering the laser pulses onto any hidden objects. By analyzing the light that was reflected off the objects and other surfaces back onto the scanners, researchers could reconstruct the shapes of the hidden items. \nAlthough most strategies for seeing around corners \"are really great ideas,\" they also \"usually require complex modeling [or] specialized hardware, or are computationally expensive,\" Bouman told Live Science. The 2015 study's technique, for example, required both extremely fast lasers and extraordinarily sensitive cameras. \nBut Bouman and her colleagues' method for seeing around corners simply uses a smartphone camera. \n\"We use light naturally in the scene and do not have to introduce our own light to probe the hidden scene,\" Bouman said. \"This allows us to use common consumer cameras and not specialized equipment to see around corners.\" \nThe new system, known as CornerCameras, analyzes light that is reflected off objects hidden around corners and that falls on the ground within the line of sight of the camera. This light is called the \"penumbra.\" The system works by analyzing light at the edge of walls, which is impacted by the reflections of objects around the corner from the camera. Credit: MIT CSAIL \nThe system analyzes this penumbra over several seconds, stitching together dozens of distinct images, according to the study. This data helps the system measure the speed and trajectory of objects around corners in real time. (It does not see any identifying details about those objects \u2014 just the fact that they are moving.) \n\"I think the biggest surprise was that the system worked well in situations that I would not have expected,\" Bouman said. \"For instance, once, during filming, it started raining. This caused big raindrops to start appearing on the ground, changing the color of the concrete floor.\" \nBecause CornerCameras is trying to analyze light signals that are just 0.1 percent of the total brightness of the ground, \"I thought these raindrops would wipe out any signal we had,\" Bouman said. However, CornerCameras analyzes the data of a scene across dozens of images, so \"the effect of the raindrops was essentially averaged out.\" \nOne current limitation of CornerCameras is that it requires a stationary camera that's held very steady. \"In many situations, such as in a collision-avoidance system on a car , you do not have the luxury of a stationary camera,\" Bouman said. The researchers are now focused on getting the system to work first on a moving wheelchair and eventually on a moving car, she said. \nFuture research will also aim to make CornerCameras work in a variety of lighting situations, or in changing lighting conditions, such as when clouds overhead constantly move in front of the sun. \"Getting the system to work in these scenarios would open up the possibility of it being able to be used by a person with a handheld smartphone,\" Bouman said. \nBouman and her colleagues will detail their findings on Oct. 25 at the International Conference on Computer Vision in Venice, Italy. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

The cancers, which include those of the brain , esophagus, thyroid, gallbladder, stomach, pancreas, kidney, uterus and colon, make up 40 percent of all diagnosed cancers in the U.S., according to the report. \nIn the report, published Oct. 3 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the researchers found that in 2014 alone, more than 630,000 people in the U.S. had a type of cancer that was associated with being overweight or obese . These cases amounted to more than 55 percent of all cancers diagnosed among women and 24 percent of all cancers diagnosed among men in the U.S. \nThe link between a person's weight and the risk of certain cancers may come as news to many, the researchers said. Though the relationships between a higher body-mass index (BMI) and chronic conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are well-touted, researchers know far less about how a higher body weight may be linked to certain cancers. [ 10 Do's and Don\u2019ts to Reduce Your Risk of Cancer ] \nIndeed, the \u201cawareness of some cancers being associated with obesity and [being] overweight is not yet widespread\" among Americans, Dr. Anne Schuchat, the deputy director of the CDC, said in a press conference on Oct. 3. \nThe International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is the cancer agency of the World Health Organization, says that there is \"sufficient evidence\" to link excess body fat to at least 13 different cancers, according to the report. Excess weight may increase a person's risk of cancer by increasing levels of inflammation in the body, according to the report. Excess weight may also increase levels of certain hormones, such as insulin and sex hormones, and a compound called insulin-like growth factor, which plays a role in growth, the report said; these factors have been linked to cancer risk. \nIn the report, the researchers used government data on 2014 cancer rates , as well as data from 2005 to 2014 to study any changes that may have occurred in the rates of certain cancers. One limitation of the study, the researchers noted, was that they did not have data on patient's' weights or BMIs. \nThe researchers found that weight-related cancers were increasingly being diagnosed among younger people. From 2005 and 2014, there was a 1.4 percent uptick in cancers related to being overweight and obese among people ages 20 to 49, compared with a 0.4 percent increase in these cancers among the 50-to-64 set. In addition, nearly half of all cancers in people younger than 65 were associated with excess weight, the researchers found. \nThe report also found that people who are overweight or obese are nearly twice as likely as people who are of normal weight to develop cancers of the esophagus, stomach, liver and kidney.

Miller, Staff Writer | October 9, 2017 12:25pm ET MORE Credit: Jacopo Raule/GC/Getty \nLast week, The New York Times reported that Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein had reached at least eight settlements with women who accused him of sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact. \nThe allegations go back almost three decades, according to the Times , but why do women often wait to speak out about sexual assault? Last fall, for example, women came forward with allegations that then-candidate Donald Trump had sexually assaulted them years earlier. \nJust because a victim doesn't come forward right away about sexual assault doesn't mean the accusations are untrue, said Yolanda Moses, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Riverside and a consultant/trainer for preventing sexual harassment and sexual assault. [ 5 Misconceptions About Sexual Assault ] \nIndeed, there are many reasons why victims of sexual assault may hesitate to speak out immediately after an incident. \nSociety tends to blame victims \u2014 female victims, in particular \u2014 for what happens to them, Moses told Live Science. In several recent rape cases, for example, the victim was accused of \"ruining\" the man who committed the assault, Moses said. \nInstances such as these demonstrate that there's still a lopsided nature to our society and that women are devalued, Moses said. \nThere's also an outdated cultural belief that \"good women don't get raped,\" Moses said. Such beliefs can lead victims to think that the sexual assault might have been their own fault, she said. People ask victims questions such as, \"Why were you in that place at that time?\" and \"Why did you go to that person's room?\" Such questions can shift the blame to the victim rather than the perpetrator, she said. \nIn addition, speaking out about an instance of assault can be very painful and cause personal embarrassment, Moses said. \nA person may not want to relive the experience, Moses said. When a person speaks out, he or she has to relive the event over and over again, by telling the story of the assault to police officers and juries, for example, Moses said. This can be an even more harrowing experience if people don't believe the victim, she added. \nAnd it's particularly difficult if a victim is accusing a high-power individual in society, or someone who has power over their life, Moses said. \nInstead, for many reasons, the victim may feel that it could be easier to try to move on from the assault without speaking up , she said. \nMoses noted that the majority of sexual assaults are perpetrated by someone the victim knows, which can make it harder to speak out. \nThe perpetrator may be someone a victim interacts with every day, and the victim may think the perpetrator is a good person in other areas of his or her life; as such, the victim may not want to \"hurt\" that person. Moses said. \nThere's a burden from society upon people who speak out, she said. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Credit: Alberto Sendra \nA two-tailed cave dweller seems to have a thing for cheese. Scientists lured the pale and eyeless creature from a cave in Turkmenistan using French Camembert cheese. \nThe animal, now called Turkmenocampa mirabilis , is new to science and is the first known underground land animal in Turkmenistan. The species name \"mirabilis\" means \"unusual\" or \"remarkable\" in Latin and highlights the insect-like creature's unique body shape (two tails and a pearl-like head and bottom), researchers said in a new study describing the findings. [ Gallery: Out-of-This-World Images of Insects ] \n\"What we have here is not only a new remarkable organism, but also an amazing and unusual cave critter that has undergone a long evolutionary journey to adapt to the underground environment of Central Asia,\" study lead researcher Alberto Sendra, a biologist at the University of Alcal\u00e1, in Spain, said in a statement . \nIn May 2015, Sendra and two other researchers \u2014 Boris Sket, of the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia, and Pavel Stoev, of the National Museum of Natural History in Bulgaria \u2014 traveled to a remote cave known as Kaptarhana, located in eastern Turkmenistan. The cave, along with more than 300 others, is hidden in the Koytendag Mountains. Kaptarhana cave is part of an extensive and deep system of ravines, sinkholes and crevices where many animals unknown to science likely live. This is where scientists recently found Turkmenocampa mirabilis . Credit: Aleksandr Degtyarev \nIn an effort to find animals new to science, the researchers spent 8 hours placing pitfall traps in humid areas of the cave. They baited the pitfall traps with less-than-appetizing cheese. The traps were placed near guano heaps, which are piles of bat excrement. \n\"For attracting animals living in caves (where nutrition is highly limited), any smelly food would do the work,\" Stoev told Live Science in an email. \"Speleobiologists [scientists who study cave-dwelling creatures] often use rotting fish or meat, various cheese or, in extreme cases, also their own excrements.\" \nTheir efforts paid off. \nThe creature they found was only 0.02 inches (0.6 millimeters) long, and because of its two long bristletails \u2014 which it uses to sense its dark world without eyes \u2014 the animal has been designated to the scientific order Diplura. \nThe discovery highlights the importance of Kaptarhana cave as a refuge for many local invertebrates (animals without backbones), the researchers said. As such, the scientists think the finding also indicates that the 35-mile-long (57 kilometers) cave system deserves protection under the laws of Turkmenistan. \nThe new species was first described online Sept. 21 in the journal Subterranean Biology . \nOriginal article on Live Science .

To do this, people tend to not only focus on the exchange of words, but also a person's facial expressions and other nonverbal cues. \nBut a new study from the American Psychological Association suggests that you could be trying to do too much. In fact, relying on a combination of vocal and facial cues may not be the most effective method for understanding the emotions or intentions of others, the study said. [ 5 Ways Your Emotions Influence Your World (and Vice Versa) ] \n\"Social and biological sciences over the years have demonstrated the profound desire of individuals to connect with others and the array of skills people possess to discern emotions or intentions ,\u201d study author Michael Kraus, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at Yale University, said in a statement . \"But, in the presence of both will and skill, people often inaccurately perceive others' emotions.\" \nThe new research found that people who focus solely on listening to another person's voice \u2014 including what the person says and vocal cues such as pitch, cadence, speed and volume \u2014 were able to better empathize with that individual. \nIn the study, the researchers examined how more than 1,800 individuals communicated with others. Some participants were askedto listen but not look at each other , while others were asked to look but not listen. And in some cases, the participants were allowed to both look and listen while communicating with one another. \nIn addition, some of the participants listened to a recorded interaction between two strangers that was read to them by a computerized voice lacking the usual emotional inflections of human communication. \nOn average, the study found participants were able to interpret the emotions of their partner more accurately when they just listened to the other person and didn't focus on facial expressions. Furthermore, listening to the computerized voice proved to be the least effective for accurately recognizing emotion. \n\"I think when examining these findings relative to how psychologists have studied emotion, these results might be surprising. Many tests of emotional intelligence rely on accurate perceptions of faces ,\" Kraus said in the statement. \"What we find here is that perhaps people are paying too much attention to the face \u2014 the voice might have much of the content necessary to perceive others' internal states accurately. The findings suggest that we should be focusing more on studying vocalizations of emotion.\" \nAlthough facial expressions can tell a lot about how someone is feeling, Kraus said that people are good at using facial expressions to mask their emotions. Also, watching and listening may reduce empathetic accuracy because more information isn't always better, and trying to do both at the same time can actually make it harder to understand the meaning behind a person's vocal inflection and facial expression. \n\"Listening matters,\" Kraus said. \"Actually considering what people are saying and the ways in which they say it can, I believe, lead to improved understanding of others at work or in your personal relationships.\" \nThe findings were published today (Oct. 10) in the journal American Psychologist. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

By Space.com, staff  41pm ET MORE How will the future of humanity be shaped by our growing reliance on computers and machines? Credit: Willyam Bradberry/Shutterstock \nNEW YORK \u2014 From transporters and lightsabers to spaceships that can travel faster than the speed of light, futuristic devices that lie beyond humanity's grasp \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 are a staple of science fiction. And yet over time, people have steadily advanced the boundaries of what technology can do. For some, this raises concerns about whether we should be paying closer attention to sci-fi's cautionary tales about the hidden costs of relying too heavily on tech \u2014 particularly when it comes to robots and   (AI). \nAs machines become ever more sophisticated and specialized, and perhaps even begin to think for themselves, what does that mean for the humans who engineer and depend on them? \nOn Oct. 5, here at New York Comic Con (NYCC), a group of science-fiction authors took part in a panel titled \"It's Technical: Our Future with Robots and More.\" During the discussion, they addressed rapid advances in robotics, how those advances align with sci-fi speculations about the creation of intelligent robots \u2014 helpful and malevolent \u2014 and whether some of the more pessimistic views of a technology-dominated future could ever come to pass. [ Super-Intelligent Machines: 7 Robotic Futures ] \nIn recent years, one of the most prominent figures in the tech world \u2014 Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla \u2014 has spoken repeatedly about the inherent dangers of AI. Musk recently raised eyebrows when he tweeted on Aug. 11 that AI posed a \"vastly\" bigger threat to the world than North Korea , and he urged lawmakers on July 15 at the National Governors Association summer meeting to regulate AI before \"people see robots going down the street killing people.\" Friend or foe? \nMany of the current fears about AI center on the rise of superintelligent computers that can outthink humans, the NYCC panelists said. In reality, the dangers of nascent AI may lie in its similarities to human intelligence, author Annalee Newitz told the audience. AI that emerges from human-generated data would likely be shaped by humanity's own flaws and failings, making it \"just as screwed up and neurotic as we are,\" Newitz said. \nAnd even if robots can think for themselves, that doesn't necessarily mean they'll take over. In Newitz's novel \"Autonomous\" (Tor Books, 2017), robots that think and feel as humans do are still seen as property, and are indentured to their owners for up to 10 years, or until they pay off their manufacturing costs, she told the audience. Throughout human history, slavery has existed as an economic cornerstone, Newitz said. In a futuristic world , this would likely extend to include intelligent robots \u2014 which could further cement the institution of slavery for people as well, as it does in her book, she explained.

Weisberger/Live Science \nIn \"Autonomous,\" as the robot character Paladin becomes self-aware, she navigates what it means to be a person in a world where personhood does not necessarily come with personal freedom, Newitz said. \nTruly autonomous, intelligent robots may exist solely in the realm of sci-fi, but   has recently made large strides toward behaviors that we consider to be uniquely human, such as making art , crafting a holiday song and even writing the next novel in the popular George R. R. Martin fantasy series \"A Song of Ice and Fire,\" the basis for the HBO series \"Game of Thrones.\" \"Very dark places\" \nAnd it can be difficult to predict how tech that's around today might evolve in the future, according to the NYCC panelists. Often, advanced technology is introduced and widely used without consideration of the long-term consequences, author Kirsten Miller said during the panel discussion. [ History of A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (Infographic)] \nThe novel \"Otherworld\" (Delacorte Press, 2017), which Miller co-wrote with Jason Segel, explores an advanced form of virtual reality (VR) that engages all the senses, and questions the ramifications of spending months, or even years, in a virtual space. In the real world, immersive VR experiences are relatively new, but we may find that, over time, the technology could insinuate itself into daily life in ways we don't expect, Miller told the audience. For example, she asked, who would have guessed five years ago that Facebook \u2014 a social media platform \u2014 could play a pivotal role in a presidential election? And what unexpected consequences might we see in five more years, from the widespread use of VR? \n\"I have a feeling it's going to go into some very dark places \u2014 probably more quickly than we're ready for,\" Miller said. \nHowever, though science fiction may sometimes seem prescient about certain technologies, it doesn't predict the future, Miller noted. Rather, sci-fi acts as a mirror for modern issues that are otherwise difficult to talk about; ultimately, even the most futuristic science fiction is still about the present, Newitz said. By considering what it could mean to share a world with intelligent machines \u2014 and questioning whether people could eventually accept the humanity of a thinking robot \u2014 writers can draw attention to pervasive inequalities among people in society today, panelist Sylvain Neuvel told the audience. \nAnd as for desirable sci-fi tech that's still nowhere to be found in the real world, the panelists named an array of personal favorites, including the robo-driver in the movie \"Total Recall,\" the personal force fields in \"Dune,\" and antiviral treatments that attack viruses on a molecular level. \n\"And giant robots,\" Newitz added. \"I just want to come back to that.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: SQO team/University of Ottawa \nA quantum-encrypted message containing more than one bit of information in each particle of light was beamed through the air between two buildings in a real-life city for the first time, a demonstration that could simplify quantum communication and make it more viable in the future, according to a recent study. \nScientists previously demonstrated in laboratory conditions that a single particle of light, or photon, could encode multiple bits of information. But until now, the experiment had never been demonstrated in a real-world scenario. \n\"So far, people have done quantum communication in such a way that they can send either zero or one: one bit of information,\" said study lead author Ebrahim Karimi, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics at the University of Ottawa. [ The 9 Most Massive Numbers In Existence ] \n\"The problem is that for every single letter, you need to send eight signals \u2014 eight zeros or ones. And that's really difficult,\" Karimi told Live Science. \"One signal can get lost and then the entire letter, the entire message, is lost.\" \nEncrypting information into the quantum states of particles such as photons in multiple dimensions would therefore considerably simplify the whole process, according to Karimi. \n\"Instead of sending many photons, or many electronic signals, I can send you a single pulse, which contains a file of information,\" he said. \"That would be amazing. This is what we call superdense coding.\" \nThe method tested by Karimi and his team can reduce the number of photons required to transmit a message by 50 percent, according to the study. \nDuring the experiment, Karimi and his team successfully sent photons containing two bits of information between two buildings at the University of Ottawa that were located 984 feet (300 meters) apart. \nAccording to Karimi, using high-dimensional encoding would also bolster security, making the quantum-communication channel more resistant to \"noise\" from weather or other external influences. \n\"In one-dimensional quantum communication, if the noise reaches to 11 percent [of the signal], the channel is no longer secure,\" Karimi said. \"However, the limit will increase to 19 percent, if you work with four dimensions.\" \nThe researchers would now like to experiment with sending and receiving high-dimensional quantum-encrypted messages at distances of up to 3.5 miles (5.6 kilometers), in order to be able to use the technique on the city scale. However, there are significant challenges that will need to be overcome. \n\"The biggest difficulty is turbulence as the light transmits through the atmosphere,\" Karimi said. \"In our experiment, we are sending a single photon, so that is really difficult. You need to send it to go under a certain angle and use a complicated telescope with sophisticated electronics.\" [ Wacky Physics: The Coolest Little Particles in Nature ] \nThe researchers used equipment developed by their colleagues from the University of Naples Federico II, in Italy, that was previously tested in the lab. The device relies on liquid-crystal technology to polarize a passing beam of light to encode the information. For the purposes of the experiment, the researchers had to build rooftop sheds to protect the equipment from weather. \nThe technology could one day be used as part of a global quantum-communication system that would include ground-based networks as well as satellites, the researchers said. \nScientists around the world are focusing efforts on quantum cryptography as a way to increase security in the digital world. All messages, transactions and data exchanges between Internet users are encoded via complex mathematical algorithms. However, with recent developments in quantum computing, experts fear such mathematical algorithms will no longer be secure in the future. Quantum computers, once they become a reality, are expected to be capable of performing multiple calculations at the same time. As such, quantum encryption could be the answer to security concerns, experts say, because it is inherently unbreakable . \n\"There is no cloning method that means you cannot copy information perfectly,\" Karimi said. \"The second point is that in the quantum world, everything is undefined, everything is blurred. You don't know what is the value unless you measure it.\" \nMeasuring the particle, however, affects the particle and thus the message it contains, Karimi said. This means a third person eavesdropping on communication between A and B would be caught immediately. \nEarlier this year, in July, Chinese scientists reported a major milestone in the development of quantum encryption when they successfully transmitted entangled photons from a satellite to a ground station. \nThe study's findings were published online Aug. 24 in the journal Optica . \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: Los Alamos National Lab \nNeptunium, element 93 on the periodic table of elements, was the first transuranium element to be produced synthetically and the first actinide series transuranium element to be discovered. Its discovery came after several false findings of the element, including Enrico Fermi's attempt to bombard uranium with neutrons. That experiment resulted in the discovery of fission, or splitting atoms. \nNeptunium is sandwiched on the periodic table between uranium and plutonium, which are also radioactive. All three of these elements, named after planets, have between 92 and 94 protons in their nuclei, large enough to undergo a nuclear fission reaction, or \"atom splitting.\" Due to this capability, uranium and plutonium are both widely used in nuclear power plants and weapons. \nNeptunium, however, was discovered significantly later in history than either of its periodic table neighbors, and is not widely used. Neptunium remains an important element to study because it is produced by nuclear reactions of uranium and plutonium and can last as harmful radioactive waste for millions of years, according to a 2003 report by the Pacific Northwest Nuclear Laboratory . Understanding neptunium's chemistry is essential to ensure safe long-term nuclear waste storage. Just the facts Atomic symbol (on the periodic table of elements ): Np Atomic weight (average mass of the atom): 237 Density: 11.48 ounces per cubic inch (19.86 grams per cubic cm) Phase at room temperature: solid Melting point: 1,191 degrees Fahrenheit (644 degrees Celsius) Boiling point: 7,052 F (3,900 C) Number of natural isotopes (atoms of the same element with a different number of neutrons): 4 \u2014 Neptunium-237 through neptunium-240. There are 21 additional known isotopes created in a lab. Most common isotope: Np-237 Credit: Andrei Marincas Shutterstock Discovery: Third time's a charm \nAccording to John Emsley in his book, \" Nature\u2019s Building Blocks: An A-Z Guide to the Elements \" (Oxford University Press, 1999), Italian scientist Enrico Fermi was the first to claim he discovered element 93, in 1934. He hypothesized that elements heavier than uranium (element 92) could be created by bombarding uranium with neutrons. Theoretically, this would add one neutral mass unit to the uranium atoms, which would then undergo beta decay, or loss of a negative charge that turns a neutron into a proton, resulting in an element with 93 total protons. Fermi's experiment did not end up producing an element; instead of the neutrons fusing with the uranium atoms, they split the uranium atoms into many fragment radioisotopes. Fermi was criticized for his false claim, and did not know at the time that he had actually performed the first atom splitting, or fission , experiment. \nJust four years later in 1938, Romanian physicist Horia Hulubei and French chemist Yvette Cauchois made a similar false report of discovering element 93. They claimed that they found the element in a naturally occurring mineral sample. At the time, scientists rejected this, believing no elements with more protons than uranium (transuranium elements) were present in nature. \nElement 93 was accepted as an existing element in 1940 at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Edwin McMillan and graduate student Philip Abelson used a technique similar to Fermi, but with one important difference: they used slow-moving neutrons. McMillan used a machine called a cyclotron to slow the neutrons and then directed them at a uranium-238 target. This time, the neutrons actually worked to create element 93 by fusing with the uranium atoms instead of breaking them apart. Abelson analyzed the resulting sample, and noted unusual beta radiation that showed a new isotope (later named Np-289) was present. McMillan and Abelson decided to call the element neptunium because Neptune is the next planet beyond Uranus in the solar system. The discovery was the first transuranium element to be synthesized in a lab and earned McMillan a Nobel Prize in 1951. Sources of neptunium \nAlthough scientists used to think neptunium could only be created synthetically, trace amounts of four of neptunium's 25 isotopes have since been found in nature, according to Los Alamos National Laboratory . Uranium, found in rock, soil and water, undergoes a natural nuclear reaction that results in small amounts of isotopes Np-237 to Np-240. \nThe majority of neptunium, however, is anthropogenic; that is, it is created as a byproduct of reactions in nuclear power plants. Scientists can extract neptunium from spent nuclear fuel in large quantities. Because of its long half-life of 2.14 million years, Np-237 is the most abundant isotope of neptunium created. Most other isotopes of neptunium have short half-lives and decay within days. Properties of neptunium \nNeptunium is a member of the actinide series, row 5f of the periodic table. This row (along with the lanthanide row above) is often depicted below and separately from the rest of the periodic table because it is too long to fit on a page with normal dimensions. All 15 actinide elements have very large atomic radii and are radioactive. \nNeptunium is a silver metal and is very reactive, with four different oxidation states. When it combines with other elements it occurs as different colored solutions (purple, yellow, green and pink). Even on its own, neptunium occurs as three different allotropes, or physical forms, depending on the temperature. It is the densest of the actinides and can remain a liquid for the largest temperature range of any known element. Can we use it? \nNeptunium's current applications are limited. Neptunium has only been considered, not actually used, as a fissile nuclear fuel. However, neptunium-237 is used to create plutonium-238, which is then used in special energy generators that can power satellites, spacecraft and lighthouses for a long period of time. Neptunium-237 is also used in nuclear physics research as a part of a device that detects high-energy neutrons. Can it harm us? \nThere may be radioactive neptunium in your house! Neptunium accumulates in a common household item: ionizing smoke detectors. To detect smoke, another actinide element, americium-241, emits radiation and turns into neptunium-237. But no need to worry: the amount of radioactive material in smoke detectors is negligible and causes no harm to human health, according to Emsley. Smoke detectors contain less than 0. 1 ounces (0. 3 grams) of americium, which decays so slowly that only about 0.2 percent of this already small amount converts to neptunium each year. \nScientists are, however, concerned with the long-term storage of neptunium present in spent nuclear fuel, according to a 2005 article published by Berkeley Lab . Although neptunium makes up only a small percentage of total radioactive waste, it poses a particular threat because it is long-lasting and hard to extract. Amy Hixon, an assistant professor at the Notre Dame College of Engineering, has studied the less familiar actinide elements and how to best contain them. \n\"The neptunium present in a used nuclear fuel rod can last for millions of years, and I'm not exaggerating,\" Hixon said as she explained the reality of containing neptunium. Her lab studies how neptunium and other actinides move through materials simulating geological repositories, like the one proposed for Yucca Mountain in Nevada. Though these deep storage sites are generally accepted as the safest long-term storage, there are none currently operating in the United States. The Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository was defunded under the Obama administration in 2011. The Trump administration has cut all funding for deep borehole waste research, but Congress may reconsider funding in the next budget cycle for 2018. \nAdditional resources Here is more info on neptunium from the Los Alamos National Laboratory .

For example, a 2011 study found that 14 percent of women who use a hormonal birth control pill, or 1.5 million women, take the medication exclusively for noncontraceptive reasons. Among teens, that percentage is higher \u2014 about one-third of women (33 percent) ages 15 to 19 who use a birth control pill do so for reasons other than preventing pregnancy. In addition, an estimated 762,000 women who take a birth control pill (7 percent) have never had sex, according to the study, which was conducted by the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization. [ Birth Control Quiz: Test Your Contraception Knowledge ] \nMany women also take a birth control pill for both contraceptive and noncontraceptive reasons. The study found that, overall, nearly half of birth control pill users (49 percent) use the pill for more than one reason. \nHere are five conditions that birth control medications can help treat: Menstrual cramps \nAccording to the 2011 study, 31 percent of birth control pill users take the medication to reduce the severity of menstrual cramps or menstrual pain. Birth control pills contain hormones that thin the lining of the uterus, which can result in shorter, lighter periods that are less painful, according to Bedsider, an online birth control support network that is operated by a nonprofit organization, The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Irregular periods \nIrregular periods can refer to a number of different problems, including missed periods, periods that are longer than seven days, periods that are much heavier than usual and periods that are less than 21 days apart or more than 35 days apart, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Some women can use a hormonal birth control pill to help regulate their menstrual cycles, or control heavy bleeding. According to the 2011 study, about 28 percent of birth control pill users take the medication for menstrual regulation. Acne \nAbout 14 percent of birth control pill users take the medication to treat their acne , according to the 2011 study. Other studies have found that women with acne can improve the condition by taking birth control pills that contain estrogen and a progestin (so-called \"combined hormonal birth control pills\"). Three types of birth control pills are specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acne: Estrostep, Ortho Tri-Cyclen and YAZ, according to Bedsider. Endometriosis \nEndometriosis is a condition in which the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows outside of the uterus, causing serve pain during menstruation. Hormonal birth control methods help control the buildup of endometrial tissue each month, and these medications may reduce or eliminate the pain of endometriosis , according to Mayo Clinic. About 4 percent of birth control pill users take the medication to help treat endometriosis, according to the 2011 study. Premenstrual syndrome \nPremenstrual syndrome , or PMS, is a group of symptoms that begin one to two weeks before a woman's period, and include breast tenderness, bloating, food cravings, irritability, mood swings and depression, according to the NIH. For some women, these symptoms are severe enough to interfere with their daily lives. Hormonal contraception medications stop ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary), which may bring relief from PMS symptoms, according to Mayo Clinic. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Choi, Live Science Contributor | October 11, 2017 06:24am ET MORE A material with random irregularities scatters an incident light wave into all directions. Credit: TU Wien \nOnce thought of as the province of only \"Star Trek\" or \"Harry Potter,\" cloaking technologies could become a reality with a specially designed material that can mask itself from other forms of light when it is hit with a \"beam of invisibility,\" according to a new study. \nTheoretically, most \" invisibility cloaks \" would work by smoothly guiding light waves around objects so the waves ripple along their original trajectories as if nothing were there to obstruct them. Previous work found that cloaking devices that redirect other kinds of waves, such as sound waves, are possible as well. \nBut the new study's researchers, from at the Technical University of Vienna, have developed a different strategy to render an object invisible \u2014 using a beam of invisibility. [ Now You See It: 6 Tales of Invisibility in Pop Culture ] \nComplex materials such as sugar cubes are opaque because their disorderly structures scatter light around inside them multiple times, said study senior author Stefan Rotter, a theoretical physicist at the Technical University of Vienna. \n\"A light wave can enter and exit the object, but will never pass through the medium on a straight line,\" Rotter said in a statement . \"Instead, it is scattered into all possible directions.\" \nWith their new technique, Rotter and his colleagues did not want to reroute the light waves. \n\"Our goal was to guide the original light wave through the object, as if the object was not there at all. This sounds strange, but with certain materials and using our special wave technology, it is indeed possible,\" study co-author Andre Brandst\u00f6tter, a theoretical physicist at the Technical University of Vienna, said in the statement. \nThe concept involves shining a beam, such as a laser , onto a material from above to pump it full of energy. This can alter the material's properties, making it transparent to other wavelengths of light coming in from the side. \n\"To achieve this, a beam with exactly the right pattern has to be projected onto the material from above \u2014 like from a standard video projector, except with much higher resolution,\" study lead author Konstantinos Makris, now at the University of Crete in Greece, said in a statement. \nThe pattern that is projected onto an object to render it invisible must correspond perfectly to the inner irregularities of that item that usually scatters light, the researchers said. \n\"Every object we want to make transparent has to be irradiated with its own specific pattern, depending on the microscopic details of the scattering process inside,\" Rotter said in a statement. \"The method we developed now allows us to calculate the right pattern for any arbitrary scattering medium.\" \nRotter and his colleagues are now carrying out experiments to see whether their idea will actually work. \"We think that an experiment would be easiest to perform in acoustics,\" Rotter told Live Science.

In fact, the skies were often sunny and blue. \nThe rash of flooding was instead the work of so-called king tides, the highest high tides of the year, brought on by a combination of seasonal factors and the alignment of the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon. \nThe floods from this annual event effectively allow locals to \"step into a time machine\" and glimpse their future as global warming drives up sea levels at an ever-faster pace, said Brian McNoldy, a tropical meteorologist at the University of Miami. The level of today's highest tides could become the average level for high tides of the future, scientists say. [ 6 Unexpected Effects of Climate Change ] \nAlong the Atlantic coast of Florida, the tides are naturally highest in the fall, McNoldy said. This happens, he said, because of several factors: Ocean waters are at their warmest, causing the water to expand; the Gulf Stream \u2014 a warm Atlantic current that moves from the Gulf of Mexico to the tip of Florida and then up the state's eastern coast \u2014 slows down, allowing water to pile up along the coast; atmospheric pressure is low; and onshore winds are strong. When the sun and moon line up at the new and full moons, their combined gravitational pull acts on top of those already high-tide levels to create the biggest non-storm tides of the year. \nMiami experienced even higher-than-expected king tides last week thanks to persistent easterly winds that helped push more water ashore. On Oct. 5, a tide gauge at Virginia Key measured water levels 2.1 feet (0.6 meters) higher than the average annual high tide (or the average of the high tides from that year), McNoldy told Live Science. \nIn the Tampa Bay area, southerly winds from Hurricane Nate also boosted sea levels above the expected high tide and caused flooding, which normally isn't as prevalent there during king tides, said Andrew McKaughan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Tampa Bay office. \nThe high and low tides along the Gulf Coast don\u2019t vary as widely as those on the eastern shore, as conditions there tend to be calmer, said William Sweet, an oceanographer with the National Ocean Service. \nThe king tide flooding provides a glimpse of the future for these areas, Sweet said, as rising sea levels make flooding events more common and flood levels higher. Nuisance flooding, as it is called, has already been on the rise in recent decades because of the sea-level rise that has occurred so far, he said, and both flooding and sea level rise are progressing at ever faster rates. \nAlong with more frequent floods in the future, in \"places with the exact same king tide as this year, you'll have many more areas that flood because of it,\" McNoldy said. \nSuch floods hamper the everyday lives of people in affected areas; in Miami, the flooding caused major traffic slowdowns. \n\"There are areas along my drive that I know flood during the highest tide days, and I don't drive through those,\" McNoldy said. He said he had co-workers whose normal half-hour commutes took 2 to 3 hours, as cars plodded their way along inundated streets. \nFlooding can also affect infrastructure, like wastewater plants, and coastal city planners are increasingly realizing they need to take action to protect the residents. \n\"Sea levels are expected just to keep increasing,\" Sweet said. \"It doesn't bode well for a future that isn't ready.\" \nFlorida has two more king tide events coming up, with the new moon later this month and the full moon at the beginning of November, usually the highest tide of the year. The strong onshore winds may mean that the recent tides during October's full moon take the crown this year, though. \nOne thing is for certain, though: During the November full moon, the tide \"will be high, and it will flood streets,\" McNoldy said. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Miller, Staff Writer | October 11, 2017 06:21am ET MORE Credit: SYCO/Columbia Records \nWhen the boy band One Direction sang about trying to \"scream out my lungs\" in its ballad \"Moments,\" the group likely wasn't expecting anyone to take the lyrics literally. But one devoted fan's boisterous screams landed her in the emergency room after a concert a few years ago, according to a new case report. \nThe then-16-year-old girl told doctors that she had been screaming forcefully at the concert when she started to feel short of breath. The next day, her shortness of breath hadn't gone away, so she went to the emergency room. \nInitially, the doctors examining the girl didn't think her condition was too severe, said lead case report author Dr. J. Mack Slaughter Jr., who was a resident in emergency medicine at UT Southwestern Medical Center at the time he saw the patient. Though the girl was breathing quickly, her lungs sounded normal, Slaughter Jr. said. [ 27 Oddest Medical Cases ] \nBut then, the doctors noticed something odd: When they pressed down on the skin around the girl's chest and neck, it felt like they were crushing Rice Krispies beneath their fingers, Slaughter Jr. told Live Science. \nThis is a sign called \"crepitus,\" which happens when air gets into the soft tissue beneath the skin. When you press down on it, you can hear a popping or crackling sound. \n\"It was a really surprising finding,\" Slaughter Jr. said, adding that it was an immediate sign that something was wrong. \nA chest X-ray revealed that the girl had air in places where it shouldn't be in the body, including the space around her heart, between the lungs and the walls of her chest, and even in the narrow space behind the back of her throat, according to the report. \nWhen air gets into the space between the lungs and the walls of the chest, the condition is called pneumothorax, or a collapsed lung . \"It's a dramatic term,\" Slaughter Jr. said, but in the girl's case, it was very mild. \"Technically, she had collapsed lungs, but just ever so slightly,\" he added. (In severe cases, the lungs can become so compressed that they can longer adequately exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of the blood.) \nThe doctors deduced that the girl's passionate screaming had forced air out of the respiratory tract and into these other cavities. But a lingering question remained: Through what part of the respiratory tract did the air get out? \nTo find the point of escape, the girl was given a CAT scan. It was possible that there was a tear somewhere along the respiratory tract, Slaughter Jr. said. But the doctors didn't find anything. Another possibility, he said, could be that she had a tiny hole somewhere along the tract that opened up only if enough force was applied \u2014 for example, from very intense screaming \u2014 and then had sealed shut again. \nThe girl also had type 1 diabetes , according to the report, and at times, that can put people at risk of air escaping from the respiratory tract into other body cavities, Slaughter Jr. said. This could happen if a person's blood sugar levels are too high, leading the body to produce acidic compounds called ketones. These compounds make the blood very acidic , so the body tries fix the condition by breathing really fast to get rid of the acid. That rapid breathing could lead to tears in the respiratory tract. \nBut the doctors tested the girl's blood and found she wasn't experiencing this condition, Slaughter Jr. said. \nUltimately, the doctors couldn't pinpoint exactly what caused the air escaping out of the girl's respiratory tract. \nThe girl stayed in the hospital overnight and was given oxygen, according to the report. The next day, her condition hadn't gotten any worse, and she was allowed to go home. The patient fully recovered, the report said. \nThe case report was published Oct. 4 in the Journal of Emergency Medicine. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

But that's coming to an end. On Nov. 5, most Americans will set their clocks back an hour, as daylight saving time (sometimes erroneously called daylight saving s time) comes to an end for the year. These spring and fall clock changes continue a long tradition started by Benjamin Franklin to conserve energy. \nBelow is a look at when daylight saving time starts and ends during the year, its history, why we have it now and some myths and interesting facts about the time change. \nRelated coverage: Tips: How to Survive the Time Change When Does It Start and End? \nHistorically, daylight saving time has begun in the summer months and ended for winter, though the dates have changed over time as the U.S. government has passed new statutes, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO). \nStarting in 2007, DST begins in the United States on the second Sunday in March , when people move their clocks forward an hour at 2 a.m. local standard time (so at 2 a.m. on that day, the clocks will then read 3 a.m. local daylight time). Daylight saving time ends on the first Sunday in November , when clocks are moved back an hour at 2 a.m. local daylight time (so they will then read 1 a.m. local standard time). \nLast year, DST began on March 13 and ended on Nov. 6. And this year, DST began on March 12 and ends on Nov. 5, 2017 . You will then move your clock forward an hour on March 11, 2018, and the cycle will begin again. How Did It Start? \nBenjamin Franklin takes the honor (or the blame, depending on your view of the time changes) for coming up with the idea to reset clocks in the summer months as a way to conserve energy, according to David Prerau, author of \" Seize the Daylight : The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time\" (Thunder's Mouth Press, 2005). By moving clocks forward, people could take advantage of the extra evening daylight rather than wasting energy on lighting. At the time, Franklin was ambassador to Paris and so wrote a witty letter to the Journal of Paris in 1784, rejoicing over his \"discovery\" that the sun provides light as soon as it rises. \nEven so, DST didn't officially begin until more than a century later. Germany established DST in May 1916 as a way to conserve fuel during World War I. The rest of Europe came onboard shortly thereafter. And in 1918, the United States adopted daylight saving time. \nThough President Woodrow Wilson wanted to keep daylight saving time after WWI ended, the country was mostly rural at the time and farmers objected, partly because it would mean they lost an hour of morning light. (It's a myth that DST was instituted to help farmers .) And so daylight saving time was abolished until the next war brought it back into vogue. At the start of WWII, on Feb. 9, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt re-established daylight saving time year-round, calling it \"War Time.\" [Learn more about the crazy history of Daylight Saving Time ] \nAfter the war, a free-for-all system in which U.S. states and towns were given the choice of whether or not to observe DST led to chaos. And in 1966, to tame such \"Wild West\" mayhem, Congress enacted the Uniform Time Act . That federal law meant that any state observing DST \u2014 and they didn't have to jump on the DST bandwagon \u2014 had to follow a uniform protocol throughout the state in which daylight saving time would begin on the first Sunday of April and end on the last Sunday of October. \nThen, in 2007, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 went into effect, expanding the length of daylight saving time to the present timing. Why do we still have daylight saving time? \nFewer than 40 percent of the world's countries observe daylight saving time, according to timeanddate.com . However, those that do are taking advantage of the natural daylight in the evenings. That's because the days start to get longer as Earth moves from the winter season to spring and summer, with the longest day of the year on the summer solstice. That's because during the summer, Earth, which revolves around its axis at an angle, is tilted directly toward the sun (at least its top half). [Read more about the science of summer ] As Earth orbits the sun, it also spins around its own imaginary axis. Because it revolves around this axis at an angle, different parts of our planet experience the sun's direct rays at different times of the year, leading to the seasons. Credit: BlueRingMedia / Shutterstock.com \nRegions farthest away from the equator and closer to the poles get the most benefit from the DST clock change, because there is a more dramatic change in sunlight throughout the seasons. \nResearch has also suggested that with more daylight in the evenings, there are fewer traffic accidents, as there are fewer cars on the road when it's dark outside. More daylight also could mean more outdoor exercise (or exercise at all) for full-time workers. Energy savings \nThe nominal reason for daylight saving time has long been to save energy. The time change was first instituted in the United States during World War I, and then reinstituted again during World War II, as a part of the war effort. During the Arab oil embargo, when Arab members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) stopped selling petroleum to the United States, Congress even enacted a trial period of year-round daylight saving time in an attempt to save energy. [ 5 Crazy Chapters in the History of Daylight Saving Time ] \nBut the evidence for energy savings is slim . Brighter evenings may save on electric lighting, said Stanton Hadley, a senior researcher at Oak Ridge National Laboratory who helped prepare a report to Congress on extended daylight saving time in 2007. But lights have become increasingly efficient, Hadley said, so lighting is responsible for a smaller chunk of total energy consumption than it was a few decades ago. Heating and cooling probably matter more, and some places may need air-conditioning for the longer, hotter evenings of summer daylight saving time. \nHadley and his colleagues found that the four weeks of extra daylight saving time that went into effect in the United States in 2007 did save some energy, about half of a percent of what would have otherwise been used on each of those days. However, Hadley said, the effect of the entire months-long stretch of daylight saving could very well have the opposite effect. A 1998 study in Indiana before and after implementation of daylight saving time in some counties found a small increase in residential energy usage. Temporary changes in Australia's daylight saving timing for the summer Olympics of 2000 also failed to save any energy, a 2007 study found. \nPart of the trouble with estimating the effect of daylight saving time on energy consumption is that there are so few changes to the policy, making before-and-after comparisons tricky, Hadley told Live Science. The 2007 extension of daylight saving time allowed for a before-and-after comparison of only a few weeks' time. The changes in Indiana and Australia were geographically limited. \nUltimately, Hadley said, the energy question probably isn't the real reason the United States sticks with daylight saving time, anyway. \n\"In the vast scheme of things, the energy saving is not the big driver,\" he said. \"It's people wanting to take advantage of that light time in the evening.\" Who observes daylight saving time? (and who doesn't) \nMost of the United States and Canada observe DST on the same dates. But of course, there are exceptions. Hawaii and Arizona are the two U.S. states that don't observe daylight saving time, though Navajo Nation, in northeastern Arizona, does follow DST, according to NASA. \nAnd, every year there are bills put forth to get rid of DST in various states, as not everyone is keen on turning their clocks forward an hour. For instance, Sen. Ryan Osmundson, R-Buffalo, introduced Senate Bill 206 into the Senate State Administration Committee in February 2017, which would exempt Montana from daylight saving time, keeping the state on standard time year-round, according to the bill . Three bills put forth this year in Texas aim to abolish DST for good: House Bill 2400, Senate Bill 238 and House Bill 95, according to the broadcast company kxan . Nebraskans may be off the hook for clock changes as well. In January, state Sen. Lydia Brasch, a Republican of Bancroft, proposed a bill called LB309 to eliminate daylight saving time in the state, according to the bill . \nSome regions of British Columbia and Saskatchewan don't change their clocks. These include the following areas in British Columbia: Charlie Lake, Creston (East Kootenays), Dawson Creek, Fort St. John, and Taylor; In Saskatchewan, only Creighton and Denare Beach observe DST, according to NASA. \nMost of Europe observes daylight saving time, called \"summer time,\" which begins at 1 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday in March and ends at 1 a.m. GMT on the last Sunday in October. \nThe United Kingdom moved their clocks forward on March 26, 2017, and they will move them back to standard time on Oct. 29, according to the U.K. government . \nThe DST-observing countries in the Southern Hemisphere \u2014 in Australia, New Zealand, South America and southern Africa \u2014 set their clocks an hour forward sometime during September through November and move them back to standard time during the March-April timeframe. \nAustralia, being such a big country (the sixth-largest in the world), doesn't follow DST uniformly: New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory follow daylight saving, while Queensland, the Northern Territory (Western Australia) do not, according to the Australian government . Clocks in the observing areas spring forward an hour at 2 a.m. local time on the first Sunday in October and push back an hour at 3 a.m. local daylight time on the first Sunday in April. \nRussia instituted year-round daylight saving time in 2011, or permanent \"summer time,\" which seemed dandy at first. But in the depths of winter, sunrise occurred at 10 a.m. in Moscow and 11 a.m. in St. Petersburg, Prerau, author of \" Seize the Daylight : The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time,\" said. This meant Russians had to start their days in the cold, pitch-dark. The permanent summer is coming to an end, however, as now Russian president Vladimir Putin abolished DST in 2014, according to BBC News . As such, the country will remain in \"winter time\" forever, or until another law is passed. Myths and Interesting Facts Turns out, people tend to have more heart attacks on the Monday following the \"spring forward\" switch to daylight saving time. Researchers reporting in 2014 in the journal Open Heart , found that heart attacks increased 24 percent on that Monday, compared with the daily average number for the weeks surrounding the start of DST. Before the Uniform Time Act was passed in the United States, there was a period in which anyplace could or could not observe DST, leading to chaos. For instance, if one took a 35-mile bus ride from Moundsville, West Virginia, to Steubenville, Ohio, he or she would pass through no fewer than seven time changes, according to Prerau. At some point, Minneapolis and St. Paul were on different clocks. A study published in 2009 in the Journal of Applied Psychology showed that during the week following the \"spring forward\" into DST, mine workers got 40 minutes less sleep and had 5.7 percent more workplace injuries than they did during any other days of the year. Pets notice the time change , as well. Since humans set the routines for their fluffy loved ones, dogs and cats living indoors and even cows are disrupted when, say, you bring their food an hour late or come to milk them later than usual, according to Alison Holdhus-Small, a research assistant at CSIRO Livestock Industries, an Australia-based research and development organization. The fact that the time changes at 2 a.m. at least in the U.S., may have to do with practicality. For instance, it's late enough that most people are home from outings and setting the clock back an hour won't switch the date to \"yesterday.\" In addition, it's early enough not to affect early shift workers and early churchgoers, according to the WebExhibits, an online museum. \nEditor's Note: This article was first published on Sept. 9, 2016, and then updated by Stephanie Pappas with information about energy use during daylight saving time. It was also updated in March 2017 to include bills put forth in the United States to eliminate DST in certain states. \nFollow LiveScience.com on Facebook for interesting news and discoveres.

Credit: Kathrin Glauser/Archaeological Service of the Canton of Bern \nPieces of a 4,000-year-old bow, arrows and a wooden food container that belonged to a Bronze Age mountaineer have been found in a high alpine pass in Switzerland. \nThe artifacts are among several items found in what appears to have been a rock shelter beside a glacier near the top of the nearly 8,800-foot (2,700 meters) L\u00f6tschberg Pass, or L\u00f6tschenpass, in the Bernese Alps. \nThe bow and arrows, food box and other items are thought to have belonged to Bronze Age hunters or animal herders who took shelter beneath a large rock near the top of the pass around 4,000 years ago, said Regula Gubler, an archaeologist for the Canton of Bern government, which announced the finds this week. [ See More Photos of the Bronze-Age Artifacts Found in Switzerland ] \nThe site was discovered in 2011 by Beat Dietrich, the warden of a nearby mountain hut, while he was walking with his dog near the top of the pass, Gubler told Live Science. Part of a neve \u2014 a long-lasting snowfield at the head of a glacier \u2014 had melted more than usual, revealing pieces of ancient wood and leather. \nGubler and other archaeologists from the Canton of Bern Archaeological Service surveyed the site that year and recovered several items during an excavation in 2012, but bad weather prevented them from finishing the dig before the onset of winter. \n\"Since then we've had snow on the site, but this year we could finish it,\" Gubler said. \"It was a warm summer and not much snow in the winter, and this combination melted the snow.\" Ancient alpinists \nThe latest finds, recovered by the researchers in September, include four pieces of shaped elm wood from what could be two Bronze Age bows , wood from possible arrow shafts, strips of ancient leather and a cord made from animal fiber attached to a button made from cattle horn, Gubler said. \nThe excavations in 2012 also found pieces of curved elm wood from bows, as well as three flint arrow heads, a cow-horn container and a wooden box that had once held roughly ground grain flour . \nCarbon dating showed that the objects originated from between 2000 and 1800 B.C., according to tests conducted by the Canton of Bern Archaeological Service . The top of the L\u00f6tschberg Pass, in the Bernese Alps in Switzerland. Credit: Kathrin Glauser/Archaeological Service of the Canton of Bern \nGubler explained that the artifacts all came from an area that measures about 21 square feet (2 square meters), inside a hollow among the rocks just below the top of the pass. \nThe finds suggest a single person or small group had taken shelter in the hollow around 400 years ago, and left the objects behind, she said. \n\"It can be very windy up there at 2,600 meters [8,530 feet] above sea level, but that hollow is quite sheltered, as we found out ourselves while working there,\" Gubler said. \"We think it may have been a shelter underneath [a] big rock, but the rock must have broken in the intervening years.\" \nThe bows and arrowheads suggest the Bronze Age mountaineers may have been hunters: The pass is still a prime hunting area today, with many game animals such as chamois and ibex, Gubler said. But, they may also have been herders, who carried bows and arrows to protect their animals from predators like bears and wolves, she added. Flour find \nTests on the wooden container found at the alpine archaeological site in 2012 have shown that it once contained a roughly ground flour made from a variety of grains, including wheat, rye, barley and smelt, according to research published in June in the journal Scientific Reports . \nGubler thinks the box was used to carry dry flour that could be mixed with water or milk before eating. \"It's lighter if you just take flour with you,\" she said. \nThe Bronze Age alpinists could have chosen a food container made from wood for the same reason: \"You wouldn't take a pottery vessel with you in the mountains \u2014 it would be far too heavy.\" \nThe 4,000-year-old artifacts were the oldest yet found in the L\u00f6tschberg Pass, although fragments of wood and leather dating to the medieval period and Iron Age have also been found near the hollow at the top of the pass, according to Gubler. \n\"There are also finds in other parts, but the hollow is the most interesting part of the whole pass,\" she said. \"If you come up over the glacier, which you could have in the past, then that would be the best way to come off the glacier and go up over the pass.\" \nThe discovery confirmed historic records that indicate the pass was a major route for hunters, herders and traders for centuries, between the Bernese Oberland to the north and the Valais region to the south, she said. And the region may hold more secrets yet. \n\"I think there's more to find up there in the pass generally, that it's not finished yet,\" Gubler said. \"We'll have to keep an eye on the whole area \u2014 we might not have found all the interesting corners of that pass.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science .

One family's desperate search for a cure for ALD was depicted in the 1992 film \"Lorenzo's Oil.\" \nALD occurs when an individual inherits a faulty copy of the ABCD1 gene. This faulty gene means that boys with ALD are unable to make a protein that helps break down certain fatty acids, causing their nerve cells to die and neurological function to rapidly deteriorate. Once children start showing symptoms, they quickly lose the ability to walk or talk, going from fully functioning kids in school to being dependent on feeding and breathing tubes within five to ten years of diagnosis. In the disease's most severe form, boys with cerebral ALD die before their 10th birthday. [ 7 Diseases You Can Learn About from a Genetic Test ] \n\"It's a devastating disease,\" said co-lead study author Dr. Florian Eichler, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"Unfortunately, when it is diagnosed after symptoms occur, it is often too late, and the wildfire of inflammation in the brain has already spread so far that we have trouble controlling it.\" \nCurrently, the only effective treatment for ALD is a bone-marrow transplant , Eichler told Live Science. But that requires a long, arduous wait for a compatible donor, and often results in complications such as graft-versus-host disease, in which the body attacks the transplant. \nBut with gene therapy, the risk of graft-versus-host disease is eliminated, because the boys can serve as their own cell donors, Eichler says. \nIn the new study, published online Oct. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine , Eichler and his team treated 17 boys ages 17 or younger with a single dose of the experimental gene therapy. When the researchers followed up on the boys two years later, 15 were functioning without any major disability or progression of their disease. The other two had died, one from a worsening of the disease and the other from complications of a donor transplant he got after he withdrew from the study. \nFor the gene therapy, the children had their own stem cells harvested from their blood rather than bone marrow. Then, scientists used a unique tool to infuse the cells in a lab with the healthy ABCD1 gene: a lentivirus made from a disabled form of HIV . The lentivirus acts as a \"vector,\" carrying and inserting the healthy gene into the stem cell DNA. \n\"These vectors are kind of like living medicines,\" said Dr. David Williams, the chief scientific officer at Boston Children's Hospital and the senior author of the study. Once in the body, these altered blood stem cells constantly regenerate to keep treating the patient's disease. The advantage of using disabled HIV over other viral carriers is that HIV actually delivers the healthy gene more safely, without apparently altering any neighboring DNA, Williams told Live Science. \nWhen the modified stem cells are transplanted back into the patient two months later, the cells multiply in the bone marrow and eventually find their way into the brain through the bloodstream. There, they replace microglial cells, breaking down fatty acids and supporting neurons to prevent any further brain damage from occurring. \n\"This is very exciting, not just for kids and families with adrenoleukodystrophy, but also as a breakthrough for other disorders that [affect] the brain,\u201d said Amanda Bergner, a genetic counselor at Columbia University who was not involved in the study. Neurological disorders have traditionally been hard to target and treat because of how the brain is sealed off from the rest of the body , she said. \nBut the study's success has prompted the therapy maker and study sponsor \u2014 biotech company Bluebird Bio \u2014 to include an additional eight boys in the trial. Separate research is also focused on how boys receiving gene therapy fare compared to those who had bone-marrow transplants.

The story never gets old, but it's also been told in multiple films, many more books and countless articles. \nThat's why it's astounding that the documentary \"Jane\" (2017), directed by Brett Morgen and scored by Philip Glass, has something new to contribute to the lexicon of information about Goodall. The movie may be able to do that because it draws on more than 100 hours of never-before-released footage from the early 1960s, shot in the Gombe Stream National Park of Tanzania, where Goodall did some of her most important work . \n\"I never thought that another documentary could be new for me,\" Goodall told a group of reporters at a media roundtable for the movie on Monday (Oct. 9). \"[The film has] taken me back to those days more than any other movie that's been done about me.\" [ 8 Human-Like Behaviors of Primates ] Chimps in the wild \nGoodall's studies of chimps in the wild revolutionized scientists' understanding of primates, primarily by revealing just how much these animals have in common with humans. Her observations of chimps using reeds to withdraw insects from dirt mounds provided some of the first evidence that animals use tools . \nTo study these chimpanzees, Goodall would first earn their trust, such that she eventually could interact with them and be welcomed by the troop of chimps. Jane Goodall and the chimp she named David Greybeard, the first member of the wild chimpanzee troop to lose his fear of Goodall. Credit: National Geographic Creative/Hugo van Lawick \nThe newly released footage captures Goodall's solitude in the east African jungle, and the film emphasizes that it took more than five months for her to even get close enough to the chimps to observe them doing anything other than running away from her. Later footage shows Goodall's progress with the chimps, including sitting close by as they cautiously approached her to get a banana she had placed on the ground. \nFeeding the animals unfortunately inspired some of the males to attack Goodall's camp in search of other goods. (This problem was largely fixed with a feeding station.) \nAnd of course, there are shots of Goodall much later on, physically interacting with the chimps \u2014 grooming, tickling and showing affection. In the film, Goodall describes this time as the greatest period in her life, because she was submerged in the process of discovery. [ Image Gallery: Lethal Aggression in Wild Chimpanzees ] \nThe 16mm film has been digitally restored and looks incredibly vivid and bright compared with most newsreel films shot at that time. It had been \"tucked away in the National Geographic archives for over 50 years,\" according to a statement from the company. Hugo van Lawick, characterized in the film as perhaps the greatest wildlife photographer and filmmaker of his era, was sent by the National Geographic Society to film Goodall as part of a grant that had been awarded to her. During that time in Gombe, the photographer and his human subject gradually fell in love, and later got married and had a son. Jane Goodall kisses her son, Grub, in Gombe, Tanzania.

After Goodall left Tanzania to help her husband make films in the Serengeti, multiple groups of wild African chimpanzees were infected with polio they had contracted from humans (though not necessarily from the scientists at Goodall's station), according to the film. The disease decimated multiple chimp groups in Africa, including the troop Goodall had spent most of her time studying. Many chimps died, and at least one was euthanized by the scientists at Goodall's research station. The footage is harrowing. Jane Goodall and infant chimpanzee Flint in Gombe, Tanzania.

But in a roundtable interview with journalists this month, Goodall pointed out that there is still a chimp research center at Gombe, and research into wild primate behavior has changed, not stopped. \n\"The field of animal behavior, I don't think, has ever been so exciting, because finally science has been forced to admit that we are part of the amazing animal kingdom, and it's not only us who have personalities, minds and emotions,\" Goodall said. \"Now, we're learning about the intelligence not just of chimpanzees and dolphins and elephants , but [also] birds \u2014 there's a flurry of interest in avian intelligence \u2014 octopuses , even insects. And now we find trees can communicate with pheromones and microfungi under the roots on the forest floor. It's a really exciting time for young people wanting to go into this field.\" Sharing an experience \nThe task of sorting through the 100 hours of new footage fell to documentary filmmaker Brett Morgen, whose previous film subjects have included musician Kurt Cobain, rock band the Rolling Stones, film producer Robert Evans and O.J. Simpson \u2014 people who don't seem to have a lot in common with Goodall. Jane Goodall at the premier of \"Jane\" at the Hollywood Bowl on Oct. 9, 2017. From left, Goodall's grandson, Merlin van Lawick; her son, Hugo \"Grub\" van Lawick; the film's director, Brett Morgen; and the film's composer, Philip Glass. Credit: National Geographic \nBut in talking with reporters at the media roundtable, Morgen said his approach to filmmaking has less to do with the particulars of a subject and more with \"opening myself up to the energy of the subjects I'm documenting and to try to bottle that energy.\" \nHe added that even though he had never-before-seen footage at his fingertips, he did not set out to find new information about Goodall or her experience in Gombe. Instead, he sought to use the footage to \"tell the story in a cinematic way,\" he said. He seems to have been left somewhat unmoved by the other documentaries about Goodall. \n\"All of these films told me what happened in Gombe,\" he said. \"None of them allowed me to experience what happened in Gombe.\" \nThe film is also very much about motherhood, and Morgen expressed a deep reverence for Goodall's mother, Vanne, who gave Goodall the confidence to ignore the rampant sexism of the time and pursue her dream. (Goodall even says in the film that as a child she \"dreamed as a man,\" because in her world, women didn't do the things she wanted to do, like go on adventures in Africa and live among animals.) Vanne also accompanied her daughter on some of the scientist's early expeditions to Africa. \nIn the movie, Jane Goodall talks about admiring the mothering skills of one of her chimp subjects, Flo. Those observations resonated deeper with Goodall after the birth of her son, she said in the film, and it wasn't until becoming a mother herself that Goodall could more fully understand the mothering behaviors she had observed in the chimp communities. \nMorgen may have succeeded in creating more of an experience than just a historical record, based on Goodall's own thoughts about the movie. \n\"There's an immediacy about it, and, you know, [watching it], I feel I'm living in that best time of my life,\" she said during the media roundtable. \"There's more about me personally and my personal life [than in previous movies], and the relationship with the chimpanzees is so vivid, and so it was very moving to watch. And I think people will take away, not exactly a different Jane but maybe have a better understanding of who I am.\" \n\"Jane\" will appear in select theaters starting on Oct. 20. You can see a complete list of screening dates on the National Geographic website . The film will also be released on the National Geographic channel in the winter of 2018. \nFollow Calla Cofield @ callacofield .

Credit: Antonin Thuillier/AFP/Getty \nAs the saying goes, beauty is in the eye of the beholder \u2014 but People magazine may play a big role, too: The magazine has arguably helped to shape modern standards of beauty since launching its annual \"World's Most Beautiful\" list in 1990. \nThis year, actress Julia Roberts claimed the title for People's \"World\u2019s Most Beautiful Woman\" of 2017 for a record-breaking fifth time. And now, a new study sheds light on how beauty standards have evolved from 1990 \u2014 when Michelle Pfeiffer was named the first \"Most Beautiful Person\" by People \u2014 to the present day. \nIdeas about beauty can vary greatly based on personal preference and across different cultures. In the study, the researchers examined changing standards of beauty according to People magazine, which has the largest audience of any U.S. magazine, with a readership of 43.6 million adults, according to the study, published today (Oct. 11) in the journal JAMA Dermatology . \nThe researchers compared the 50 celebrities from the 1990 list with the 135 celebrities from the 2017 list. Specifically, they looked at how demographics such as age, sex, race, skin type, hair or eye color and any visible dermatologic conditions have changed over the last 27 years. [ 7 Beauty Trends that Are Bad for Your Health ] \nTo classify different skin types, dermatologists use something called the Fitzpatrick Scale, which looks at a person's skin tone and risk of sunburn (lower numbers on the scale are more likely to burn). In the study, the researchers found that 88 percent of the celebrities from the 1990 \"Most Beautiful Women\" list had lighter skin tones (Fitzpatrick Skin Types 1 to 3), and only 12 percent had darker skin tones (Fitzpatrick Skin Types 4 to 6). In 2017, however, 70.4 percent of the candidates had lighter skin types and 29.6 percent had darker skin types, according to the study. \nIn addition, the researchers found that the average age of celebrities on the list has increased from 33.2 in 1990 to 38.9 in 2017. \n\"As evidenced by our data and contrary to our hypothesis, at present, a wider variety of skin colors and inclusion of older age groups are represented among those deemed to be the most beautiful ,\" the researchers, led by Dr. Mayra Maymone, a dermatology research assistant at Boston University School of Medicine, wrote in the report. \nThe study also revealed that the proportion of females has increased from 52 percent in 1990 to 88.1 percent in 2017. The only men that have earned the title of \"World's Most Beautiful\" include Mel Gibson (1996), Tom Cruise (1997) and Leonardo DiCaprio (1998). \nRegarding race, the proportion of nonwhite celebrities also increased from 24 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2017. Furthermore, mixed-race celebrities were represented by only one person (2 percent) in 1990, and 14 people (10.4 percent) in 2017. However, only four women of color \u2014 Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez, Beyonc\u00e9 and Lupita Nyong'o \u2014 have received the title of \"World's Most Beautiful\" since 1990. \n\"The mass media platform has for years introduced certain criteria for what constitutes beauty ,\" the researchers said. \u201cThrough an examination of the [World's Most Beautiful] issue of People, we found that these beauty standards are evolving as people learn how to integrate the effects of media with exposure to new cultures and different norms.\" \nOriginally published on Live Science .

In other cases, works of art feature cryptic clues placed by the artist, or contain curious resemblances \u2014 and some have even sparked popular conspiracy theories. \nHere are 11 hidden secrets in famous works of art. The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck Photo Credit: Shutterstock Slide 2 of 23 The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck The Arnolfini Portrait by the Dutch painter Jan van Eyck is thought to portray an Italian merchant named Giovanni di Nicolao Arnolfini and his wife, who lived in the Flemish city Bruges.\nThe painting is celebrated for its vivid and detailed representations of the couple and their surroundings, and the precise geometry of its composition, which includes an intricate reflection of the scene in a framed circular mirror hanging on the wall of the room. \nThe details of the painting have fueled many theories about its hidden symbolism, from the way the couple is joining hands, to the meaning of the small dog, the carelessly placed pairs of shoes, and the single lit candle in the chandelier. The artist's signature also appears as graffiti on the wall of the room: \"Jan van Eyck was here, 1434.\" \nThe circular convex mirror on the wall near the center of the painting reveals an intricate reflection of the room as the scene was painted \u2014 including two additional figures standing beside the doorway, one whom may be the artist himself. It's not known if van Eyck used a real convex mirror to paint the scene from behind, but the curved distortions of the image are almost optically perfect, experts have said. \nA contentious theory from the 1930s holds that the scene is a representation of the marriage of the couple, and that the mirror image and van Eyck's dated signature are designed to serve as a legal record of the marriage, including the two witnesses required to be present. But, this theory now finds little favor with most art historians and with the curators of the National Portrait Gallery in London, England, where the painting is now on exhibit. \nThe distinctive Arnolfini Portrait is often referenced and parodied in popular culture, including a Muppet version featuring Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. In Ridley Scott's 1982 science-fiction movie \"Blade Runner,\" bounty hunter Rick Deckard (played by actor Harrison Ford) find clues about the androids he is chasing by zooming in on the reflection in a circular, convex mirror that hangs on the wall of a room in a photograph. Slide 3 of 23 The Blue Room by Pablo Picasso Photo Credit: Evan Vucci/AP Slide 4 of 23 The Blue Room by Pablo Picasso \nThe Blue Room is regarded as one of Pablo Picasso's earliest masterpieces. It was painted when Picasso was 19 years old and living in Paris, and is one of the first works of his early \"Blue Period\" of melancholy scenes dominated by varying shades of blue. \nIn 2014, scientists announced that they had found a hidden image underneath the painted surface of \"The Blue Room,\" showing the hidden portrait of a man wearing a bow tie, resting his chin on his hand, reported the Associated Press . \nIt's not yet known who the mystery man could be, but it's definitely not a portrait of Picasso himself. One possibility is the art dealer Ambroise Vollard, who hosted Picasso's first show in Paris in 1901. \nArt historians say Picasso was poor but very productive at the time he painted \"The Blue Room,\" so it wasn't unusual for him to reuse an earlier canvas for a new idea. Slide 5 of 23 Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci Photo Credit: Chris Radburn-Pool/Getty Slide 6 of 23 Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci \nFrench scientist Pascal Cotte announced earlier this year that he'd found a hidden image of a different woman beneath the world's most famous portrait, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. \nCotte was able to examine the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum in Paris in 2004 under intense lights of different frequencies. He then spent more than 10 years analyzing the data from these experiments. Cotte said his research has revealed the original portrait on the Mona Lisa canvas, but it portrays a different woman who is looking off to the side instead of directly at the artist. \nDa Vinci painted the Mona Lisa in around 1506. It's generally thought to portray Lisa Gherardini of Florence, the wife of a silk merchant. \nBut, Cotte thinks the original Mona Lisa shows a different Florentine woman of the time named Pacifica Brandano. \nNot all art experts are convinced by Cotte's research, however. One art historian suggested his methods may have created an artificial image from the original brush stokes used by Leonardo to create the final portrait, but they did not represent a different portrait.

By Sara G. Miller, Staff Writer | October 11, 2017 04:31pm ET MORE Credit: Leon Bennett/WireImage/Getty \nIn an interview on ABC's \"Dancing with the Stars\" Monday (Oct. 9), actor Frankie Muniz revealed he's had \"a fair amount of ministrokes.\" \nMuniz brought up the ministrokes while discussing problems with his memory, according to People magazine . \n\"I have had nine concussions and I've had a fair amount of mini-strokes \u2026 I'm not saying those things correlate exactly to the reason why my memory's not great,\" Muniz said. He's had an estimated 15 ministrokes, the People magazine article added. [ Strange Stroke Stories: Ebola, Hickeys and Other Weird Causes ] \nBut what are ministrokes? And do they have lasting effects? \nA ministroke, or \"transient ischemic attack\" (TIA), occurs when a blood clot briefly blocks blood flow to a part of the brain, according to the Mayo Clinic . A TIA is similar to an ischemic stroke , but during an ischemic stroke, the blockage lasts longer, leading to permanent brain damage. In both cases, the blockages are often caused by the buildup of plaque in a blood vessel. \nThe symptoms of a TIA are also similar to those of an ischemic stroke, which is the most common type of stroke, the Mayo Clinic says. During a TIA, a person might experience symptoms such as weakness, numbness or paralysis on one side of the body, slurred or garbled speech, blindness in one or both eyes or double vision, dizziness or loss of balance, or a sudden, severe headache with no known cause. \nUnlike a stroke, however, a TIA usually doesn't lead to permanent brain damage, according to the Mayo Clinic. This is because in the case of a TIA, the body gets rid of the blockage in the blood vessel before it causes lasting damage, according to the American Stroke Association (ASA). Once the clot is gone, blood flow returns; the longer blood flow is blocked, the more likely there will be permanent damage. (If a TIA-causing clot doesn't go away, it is classified as an ischemic stroke.) \nStill, it's essential to seek medical attention if you experience stroke-like symptoms. It's not possible to tell if a person is having a full-blown stroke or a TIA based on symptoms alone, the Mayo Clinic says . In some cases of stroke , the symptoms may seem to go away, for example. \nThough a TIA is often referred to as a ministroke, the ASA says a more accurate term is \"warning stroke.\" This is because a TIA can be a sign that a person will have a full-blown stroke in the future. More than 10 percent of people who have a TIA go on to have a full-blown stroke within three months, and half of these strokes occur with 48 hours of the TIA, according to the National Library of Medicine . \nIn addition, about 1 in 3 people who have had a TIA go on to have a stroke within one year, and up to 40 percent of people who have had an ischemic stroke report that they had a TIA first, the ASA says. \nOnce a person has had a TIA, he or she is more likely to have another one, according to the Mayo Clinic. \nIf you think you're having a stroke, call 911 immediately. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | October 11, 2017 05:59pm ET MORE Credit: vitstudio/Shutterstock \nA new gene therapy may soon be approved to treat a rare genetic form of vision loss and blindness. But how does it work? \nTomorrow (Oct. 12), a panel of advisers for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will consider whether to approve the therapy, called Luxturna. It is made by the biotechnology company Spark Therapeutics. \nLuxturna is intended to help people who have mutations in a gene called RPE65, which is responsible for making a protein found in the retina (the light-sensitive cells at the back of the eye) that is critical for normal vision. People inherit two copies of the RPE65 gene, but if both of the copies have mutations, those people experience progressive vision loss starting in infancy, according to Spark Therapeutics. At first, patients may lose their peripheral vision and develop \"tunnel vision,\" and they may also have trouble seeing in dim light. But eventually, they may lose their central vision as well and become totally blind, Spark Therapeutics said. [ Unraveling the Human Genome: 6 Molecular Milestones ] \nRPE65-related eye diseases affect an estimated 1,000 to 3,000 people in the United States, the company said. Currently, there are no drugs to treat these diseases. \nThe gene therapy works by giving patients a working copy of the RPE65 gene. The researchers placed this gene inside a modified virus that is not harmful to people, and this \"vector\" delivers the gene to the retinal cells. Doctors administer the therapy during a procedure that involves injecting the modified virus into patient's eyes. \nIn a recent study of Luxturna, conducted by Spark Therapeutics, the researchers gave the drug to 20 patients with a condition called Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), an eye disease that results from RPE65 mutations. This group was compared to nine patients with LCA who did not receive Luxturna (called the \"control group.\") \nOne year after the treatment, 18 of the 20 participants (90 percent) who received the therapy showed improvement in their ability to navigate a maze in low to moderate lighting conditions, Spark Therapeutics said. And 13 of the 20 participants were able to navigate the maze under the lowest light conditions, the researchers said. In contrast, none of the participants in the control group was able to navigate the maze under the lowest lighting conditions. \nBecause patients in the study were followed only for a year, it's unclear how long the effects last. However, some patients in earlier studies of the drug have been followed for several years, and these patients have maintained their initial improvements, Spark Therapeutics said. \nAlthough Luxturna was only tested in patients with LCA, it's thought the drug may be helpful to patients with other diseases caused by RPE65 mutations, the researchers said. \nIf Luxturna gets the green light from the FDA, it would be the first time a gene therapy for an inherited disease has been approved in the United States, according to Reuters. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: And-One/Shutterstock \nA sprain happens when the ligaments of the body become stretched or torn. A ligament is a fibrous band of tissue that connects the bones at a joint. This is why sprains are localized around joints such as ankles, knees and shoulders. Causes & symptoms \nNormally, the ligament can expand and snap back into place when a person moves. Sometimes, though, the ligament is pushed beyond its normal capabilities and causes a sprain. Any joint can be affected by a sprain if the ligament is suddenly pushed, twisted or impacted. The most common type of sprain is an ankle sprain, according to the Mayo Clinic . \nPeople who are involved in sports are more likely to injure their ligaments, though anyone can experience a sprain. For example, if someone stumbles and catches the fall with their hands, they can sprain their wrists. Twisting a knee while dancing, running or just going up a flight of stairs can cause a knee sprain. A person can even sprain fingers and thumbs. \nSymptoms of a sprain include a popping sound during the injury, bruising, pain, swelling and limited movement for the affected joint. \nA sprain can also lead to long-lasting health problems. For example, a sprain in the wrist can lead to carpel tunnel syndrome (CTS). Symptoms of CTS can start with nighttime numbness or tingling, along with hand pain and those affected should seek medical attention, according to Dr. Shari Liberman, a hand and upper extremity orthopedic surgeon at Houston Methodist Hospital. \"Usually, the patient will wake up at night with those symptoms and has to shake out their hands to relieve the pain,\" said Liberman. \"The symptoms can progress to daytime numbness or tingling and pain.\" A sprained ankle can get bruised and swollen. Credit: J HIME/Shutterstock Sprain and strains \nSprains and strains have many of the same symptoms, but they are not the same thing. A strain is when a tendon stretches or tears, while a sprain affects ligaments. Tendons are cords of tissue that connect bones to muscles in the body. \nWhiplash is a condition that often involves both sprains and strains. Whiplash is any injury of the neck's soft tissues resulting from forced movement, often caused by a car accident. It can affect muscles, joints, discs, nerves, ligaments and tendons, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . Whiplash is often classified as a secondary injury of a concussion, Kenneth Podell, a neuropsychologist at Houston Methodist Hospital, told Live Science. Treatment \nA medical professional typically performs a physical inspection of the injured area to look for symptoms of a sprain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to see determine how badly the ligament is affected. If the bone could be broken, the medical professional may order an X-ray. \nThere are three types of sprains, rated by their severity. According to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons the three types of strains are: Grade 1 sprain (mild): This includes a slight stretching and some damage to the fibers of the ligament. Grade 2 sprain (moderate): This includes the partial tearing of the ligament. Grade 3 sprain (severe): This involves a complete tearing of the ligament. \nMild sprains usually only need time to heal, rest and a little care. Remember the RICE procedure: rest, ice, compression and elevation. Over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen (Motrin IB, Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) can be used to lessen the pain, and ice packs can be applied to reduce swelling. An ice pack should be placed on the area 20 minutes four to eight times a day, according to the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases . The area should also be elevated and compression should be applied using a compression bandage. \nIn more severe cases, a medical professional may immobilize the area with a brace. If there is a torn ligament or ruptured muscle, surgery may be needed to correct the problem, according to the Mayo Clinic. Prevention \nMuscle training, stretching and stability training are all important steps to preventing strains because they keep the muscles strong and flexible. A medical professional should be consulted for the best exercises. The medical professional will take into consideration the type of sports and activities an individual is interested in for the best training recommendation. \nWarm-up exercises, such as light jogging, before a strenuous activity can also help avoid sprains. Also, avoid running, exercising or playing a sport when tired or in pain. \nAdditional resources ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "alina bradford", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kenneth podell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shari liberman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national institute of neurological disorders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institute of arthritis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american academy of orthopaedic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayo clinic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "houston methodist hospital", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "motrin ib", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T05:47:18.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d66a788bc8f5f9c67bf03505e4b8a68c0258b4b4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/gbH1E_3V_D5ykjvip.8_AFombaj1PmqpcBnI_v1tTkOc.4.HRzoV1be.crls146dFzWa8ButJFbekffw.L17.A--", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://www.livescience.com/home/feed/site.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Live Science", "title": "Monsters and Zombies?

Credit: solarseven/Shutterstock \nThis year, the scariest Halloween costumes in the United States could be corrupt government officials or polluted water \u2014 at least according to a new survey ranking the top fears of Americans. \nChapman University released its annual Survey of American Fears yesterday (Oct. 11), and fears about the government and the environment dominated the top 10. \nAs in 2015 and 2016, this year, corrupt government officials topped the list, with 75 percent of survey respondents reporting that they were either scared or very scared of corrupt officials in the government. [ End of the World? Top Doomsday Fears ] \nBut the No. 2 fear this year was one that was entirely new to the list: \"Trumpcare.\" Just over 55 percent of the people in the survey ranked this as something they were either scared or very scared of. \nComing in third and fourth were pollution of oceans, rivers and lakes; and pollution of drinking water , respectively \u2014 two fears that were new to the top 10, according to the survey. \nNot having enough money in the future, high medical bills, U.S. involvement in a world war, climate change, North Korea's use of weapons and air pollution rounded out the top 10. Fears of the U.S. being involved in a world war and North Korea using weapons were new to the list, the researchers said. Here are Americans' top fears of 2017. Credit: Chapman University \n\"The 2017 survey data shows us that while some of the top fears have remained, there has been a pronounced shift to environmental fears,\" lead researcher Christopher Bader, a professor of sociology at Chapman University in California, said in a statement . Bader added that many of the top fears mirror top media stories, such as news about changes to environmental policies and health care. \nFear of heights ranked 38th on the survey, with 28 percent of respondents reporting being scared or very scared of it; fear of sharks came in at No. 41 (25 percent); and fear of insects and spiders came in at No. 50 (20 percent).

New research finds an under-ice canyon stretching the length of the shelf. Credit: Copernicus Sentinel data (2017), processed by A. Hogg/CPOM \nA mysterious world of upside-down canyons crisscrosses the underbelly of Antarctica's ice shelves. \nNow, research finds that some of these crevasses may contribute to both the thinning of the shelves and sea-level rise. A single canyon in the Dotson ice shelf in West Antarctica is responsible for dumping 4.4 billion short tons (4 billion metric tons) of freshwater into the Southern Ocean, according to Noel Gourmelen, a remote-sensing researcher at The University of Edinburgh. [ 50 Amazing Facts About Antarctica ] Icy divots \nThese divots in the underside of the ice shelves are poorly understood , according to the European Space Agency (ESA). To learn more, Gourmelen and his colleagues have been using data from ESA's CryoSat and Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites to peer into the invisible under-ice world of the Antarctic canyons. The Dotson ice shelf appears flat from above, but its underside is a rugged landscape of melt. Credit: N. Gourmelen \nBoth of these satellites use radar techniques to gauge ice-shelf thickness and dynamics. The team used the data to investigate the flow of the Dotson ice shelf, a 30-mile-wide (50 kilometers) expanse off the remote coast of Marie Byrd Land. \n\"We have found subtle changes in both surface elevation data from CryoSat and ice velocity from Sentinel-1, which shows that melting is not uniform, but has centered on a 5-km-wide [3 miles] channel that runs 60 km [37 miles] along the underside of the shelf,\" Gourmelen said in a statement . \nThis under-ice canyon is probably formed by relatively warm ocean water \u2014 33.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius \u2014 that circulates clockwise and upward due to the planet's rotation, Gourmelen said. \n\"Revisiting older satellite data, we think that this melt pattern has been taking place for at least the entire 25 years that Earth observation satellites have been recording changes in Antarctica,\" he said. \nIn that time, he said, the warm water has created an upside-down canyon in the bottom of the ice shelf that is up to 124 miles (200 km) deep and 9 miles (15 km) wide. The crevasse is deepening by about 22 feet (7 meters) each year, Gourmelen said. \n\"The strength of an ice shelf depends on how thick it is. Since shelves are already suffering from thinning , these deepening canyons mean that fractures are likely to develop and the grounded ice upstream will flow faster than would be the case otherwise,\" he said, referring to the land-based ice that is buttressed by the floating ice shelves. This land-based ice has a greater impact on overall sea-level rise because it's not already floating in the ocean. (When floating ice melts, it doesn't directly impact sea levels.) \nThe next goal, Gourmelen said, is to expand the same line of research to the rest of the ice shelves ringing Antarctica. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

(Alex Khripunov/Shutterstock) \nA 3,200-year-old stone slab with an inscription that tells of a Trojan prince and may refer to the mysterious Sea People has been deciphered, archaeologists announced on Oct. 7. \nThe stone inscription, which was 95 feet (29 meters) long, describes the rise of a powerful kingdom called Mira, which launched a military campaign led by a prince named Muksus from Troy . \nThe inscription is written in an ancient language called Luwian that just a few scholars, no more than 20 by some estimates, can read today. Those scholars include Fred Woudhuizen, an independent scholar, who has now deciphered a copy of the inscription. [ Cracking Codices: 10 of the Most Mysterious Ancient Manuscripts ] \nWoudhuizen and Eberhard Zangger, a geoarchaeologist who is president of the Luwian Studies foundation, will publish findings on the inscription in the December issue of the journal Proceedings of the Dutch Archaeological and Historical Society. More From LiveScience Photos: Ancient Inscriptions Tell of Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II \nIf the inscription is authentic, it shines light on a period when a confederation of people that modern-day scholars sometimes call the Sea People destroyed cities and civilizations across the Middle East, scholars say. The kingdom of Mira, which engaged in this military campaign, was apparently part of this Sea People confederation given their participation in the attacks . A Trojan war? \nThe inscription tells of how King Kupantakuruntas ruled a kingdom called Mira that was located in what is now western Turkey. Mira controlled Troy (also in Turkey), according to the inscription, which additionally described Trojan prince Muksus leading a naval expedition that succeeded in conquering Ashkelon, located in modern-day Israel , and constructing a fortress there. [ Biblical Battles: 12 Ancient Wars Lifted from the Bible ] \nThe inscription details King Kupantakuruntas' storied path to the throne of Mira: His father, King Mashuittas, took control of Troy after a Trojan king named Walmus was overthrown. Soon after that, King Mashuittas reinstated Walmus on the Trojan throne in exchange for his loyalty to Mira, the inscription says. \nKupantakuruntas became king of Mira after his dad died. He then took control of Troy, although he wasn't the actual king of Troy. In the inscription, Kupantakuruntas describes himself as a guardian of Troy, imploring future rulers of Troy to \"guard Wilusa [an ancient name for Troy] (like) the great king (of) Mira (did).\" (translation by Woudhuizen) A copy of a copy \nThe inscription itself no longer exists, having been destroyed in the 19th century, but records of the inscription, including a copy of it, were found in the estate of James Mellaart, a famous archaeologist who died in 2012. Mellaart discovered several ancient sites in his life, the most famous of which is \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck, a massive, 9,500-year-old settlement in Turkey that some scholars think is the oldest city in the world. [ The 25 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth ] \nMellaart left instructions saying that if the inscription could not be fully deciphered and published before he died, other scholars should do so as soon as possible. Some scholars (not Zangger and Woudhuizen's team) have raised concerns that the inscription could be a modern-day forgery created by Mellaart or someone else. \nMellaart briefly mentioned the existence of the inscription in at least one publication, a book review published in 1992 in the Bulletin of the Anglo-Israel Archaeological Society journal. But he never fully described the inscription in a scientific publication. \nAccording to Mellaart's notes, the inscription was copied in 1878 by an archaeologist named Georges Perrot near a village called Beyk\u00f6y in in Turkey. Shortly after Perrot recorded the inscription, villagers used the stone as building material for a mosque, according to Mellaart's notes. In the aftermath of the inscription being used as building material for the mosque, Turkish authorities searched the village and found three inscribed bronze tablets that are now missing. The bronze tablets were never published and it is not certain exactly what they say. \nA scholar named Bahad\u0131r Alk\u0131m (who died in 1981) rediscovered Perrot's drawing of the inscription and made a copy, which Mellaart, in turn, also copied and which the Swiss-Dutch team has now deciphered. Last member of a team \nMellaart was part of a team of scholars who, starting in 1956, worked to decipher and publish Perrot's copy of the inscription, along with the now-missing bronze tablets and several other Luwian inscriptions, his notes say. \nMellaart's notes state that the team he was part of was unable to publish its work before most of the team members died. The notes add that the team Mellaart worked on included the scholars Albrecht Goetze (died 1971), Bahad\u0131r Alk\u0131m (died 1981), Handam Alk\u0131m (died 1985), Edmund Irwin Gordon (died 1984), Richard David Barnett (died 1986) and Hamit Z\u00fcbeyir Ko\u015fay (died 1984). Mellaart, who was one of the younger members of the team, died at the age of 86, having outlived the rest of his team. \nThe Swiss-Dutch team found that in his later years, Mellaart spent a considerable amount of time trying to understand the copies of the different Luwian inscriptions in his possession. However, Mellaart couldn't read Luwian; he was brought onto the team for his knowledge of the archaeological landscape of western Turkey, while other members could read the ancient language . [ Cracking Codes: 5 Ancient Languages Yet to Be Deciphered ] Did the inscription exist? \nLive Science talked to several scholars not affiliated with the research. Some of them expressed concern that the inscription is a modern-day forgery. They said that until records of the inscription are found that are not left behind by Mellaart, they can't be sure the inscription existed. \nZangger and Woudhuizen said that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for Mellaart or someone else to create such a forgery. The inscription is very lengthy, and Mellaart couldn't read, much less write Luwian, they said in their paper. They also noted that nobody had deciphered Luwian until the 1950s, which means that Perrot wouldn't have been able to forge it either. Zangger and Woudhuizen added that few scholars today are able to read Luwian, much less write a lengthy inscription. They said they also don't understand why Mellaart would have wanted to create a lengthy and complex forgery, but leave it largely unpublished. [ 24 Amazing Archaeological Discoveries ] \nMellaart was accused in his life of inadvertently aiding smugglers and exaggerating or even \"imagining evidence\" (as Ian Hodder, the current director of excavations at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck put it) to prove his archaeological ideas; however, he was never found to have created a forgery , Zangger and Woudhuizen noted. \nEven so, Zangger told Live Science that until records of the inscription are found apart from Mellaart's estate, he can't be totally certain it's authentic and not a forgery. \nZangger is also publishing details of the newly deciphered inscription in a German-language book called \"Die Luwier und der Trojanische Krieg \u2013 Eine Forschungsgeschichte,\" (Orell F\u00fcssli, 2017), which is being released today. \nEditor's note: This article was updated to reflect the fact that Woudhuizen, not Zangger, can read Luwian and was the one who deciphered the inscription. \nOriginal article published on Live Science.

(Res Eichenberger) Archaeologists found a copper blade in Switzerland that's just like the ax \u00d6tzi the famous \"Iceman\"was carrying when he died. Like \u00d6tzi's ax, this tool was made with copper that came from hundreds of miles away, in present-day Tuscany in central Italy. The discovery could shed light on Copper Age connections across Europe. \nBad fortune eventually made \u00d6tzi the Iceman famous. About 5,300 years ago, he was shot with an arrow, struck in the head and left to die near a mountain pass high in the Alps. He was entombed in a glacier until 1991, when hikers near the Italian-Austrian border discovered his body. \n\u00d6tzi is the oldest mummy in Europe, and scientists have studied nearly every possible aspect of his life and death, from his tattoos and tools to his diet and DNA. Among the equipment \u00d6tzi carried was an ax of almost pure copper, remarkable because its wooden handle and leather straps were still preserved. [ Mummy Melodrama: 9 Secrets About Otzi the Iceman ] More From LiveScience The 25 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth \nThis past summer, researchers traced the source of the metal in \u00d6tzi\u2019s ax to southern Tuscany, which came as a surprise to them. The huge mountains of the Alps were thought to be a \"neat cultural barrier\" separating the metal trade, the authors of that study wrote in the journal PLOS One; people living around the Alps at that time were believed to have gotten their copper locally or from the Balkans. \nNow, archaeologists in Switzerland report that they've found another blade with the same make as \u00d6tzi's at the northern foot of the Alps. \nThe ax was discovered in Zug-Riedmatt, one of the many pile-dwelling villages around the Alps that are famous for their prehistoric wooden houses built on stilts on lakeshores and other wetlands. \n\"It was a very efficient general-purpose ax, especially proper for woodworking,\" said Gishan Schaeren, an archaeologist with the Office for Monuments and Archaeology in the Swiss canton (or state) of Zug. But in addition to chopping trees to build stilted houses, people could use these axs as lethal weapons, Schaeren added. \nThe newfound blade was between 5,300 and 5,100 years old and missing its wooden handle. It was about half the weight of \u00d6tzi's blade and shorter, but the same shape. By measuring the traces of lead in the blade, Schaeren and his colleagues could link the copper to the same source in southern Tuscany. \n\"Mainstream research normally does not consider the possibility of intense contacts between south and north in the Alps\" during this time, Schaeren told Live Science in an email. \nHe thinks Copper Age people should be given more credit.\"We have to consider that people who traveled in the Alps had a very profound knowledge of the landscape and its conditions due to their experience with hunting, herding and exploring natural resources in these areas,\" he said. \nStronger links to southern Europe, Schaeren added, could explain certain styles of rock art, pottery, burial customs and other phenomena seen in the north. \n\"It is one step to a much more connected worldview,\" Schaeren said. \nThe findings were published last month in the German journal Arch\u00e4ologische Informationen. \nOriginally published on Live Science.

(Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO) \nA graceful bronze arm that was once attached to a statue dating to the first century was recently recovered from a famed shipwreck near the Greek island of Antikythera. That site has already yielded a treasure trove of artifacts, including the mysterious astronomical computer and calculator called the Antikythera mechanism. \nThe newly discovered limb joins other bronze and marble statue fragments discovered during the same expedition. Together, these artifacts indicate that there are likely more statues to be found buried in the seabed around the wrecked vessel, representatives of the \" Return to Antikythera \" project reported in a statement released today (Oct. 4). \nDivers with the expedition, part of an international partnership under the supervision of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports (HMCS), visited Antikythera between Sept. 4 and 20 and recovered other precious relics in addition to the statue pieces, according to the statement.

It carried a vast cargo of luxury goods , including glassware, gemstones, coins and jewelry, and statues of marble and bronze; hundreds of these objects were recovered in 1976 in an expedition conducted by the underwater explorer Jacques Cousteau. \nDuring the recent expedition, archaeologists were drawn to certain features on a part of the seafloor that suggested the area might merit a closer look, field project co-director Brendan Foley, a researcher with the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Lund University in Sweden, told Live Science in an email. Those features included a red marble plaque and a marble statue base. \n\"We investigated further, test trenched [dug trenches at the site without excavating further], metal detected and began to find extremely interesting finds, including wooden-hull remains, large bronze nails and spikes from the hull, and then the bronze sculpture elements,\" Foley said. \nIn addition to the bronze arm and the marble pieces, the archaeologists found a bronze statue piece with clothing folds, and a highly oxidized disk with four holes punched along its edge, HMCS representatives reported in a statement . Scans of the disk revealed the shape of \"possibly a bovine animal\" under layers of detritus and corrosion, according to the statement. \nThe scientists also found wooden ship parts; their condition and location, relative to where the cargo was found, will help experts peer back in time and reconstruct the scene of the shipwreck, HMCS representatives said. \nMany fascinating objects have emerged from the site over time, but one of the best-known finds is a celestial calculator known as the Antikythera mechanism , which was also salvaged during initial dives to the site in 1900. This complex machine is thought to be capable of displaying dates, the positions of the moon and sun, and planetary cycles, as well as predicting eclipses over a period of 223 months. \nThen, in August 2016, archaeologists detected evidence of human remains in the wreck, providing a possible source of ancient DNA. The remains, a skeleton, were not the first found at the site; bones were also recovered from the Antikythera shipwreck in 1976. But for the first time, technology existed that could allow scientists to extract genetic information from the preserved organic material. \nWhile the prospect of an ancient \"computer\" or the extraction of 2,000-year-old DNA sounds arguably more exciting than the newly discovered statue arm, the recent finds are historically significant, Foley told Live Science. Few bronze sculptures from ancient Greece have survived to the modern age, and none that were previously found underwater were recovered directly from an archaeological site, he said. This provides critical historical context for artifacts, he explained. \n\"We have the chance to bring scientific methods to bear on these sculptures, to excavate carefully and precisely, and then give back to the world fabulous ancient artwork,\" he said. [ In Photos: Mission to 2,000-Year-Old Antikythera Shipwreck ] \n\nThe scientists' work is far from over. Antikythera still holds many secrets in its watery ruins, and the archaeologists plan to return in the spring to uncover more of those mysteries, Foley said. \n\"We have some large boulders to remove in order to access the bronze sculptures that are surely beneath them. And we have a lot of sediment to excavate, so we can expose, document and recover the goods that were in the ship's cargo hold,\" he said. \nThe site covers a lot of ground, measuring approximately 164 square feet (50 square meters) at ocean depths ranging from 131 to 184 feet (40 m to 56 m), Foley said. The team has scanned much of the area with metal detectors, and the researchers have mapped the surrounding area of 34,449 square feet (10,500 square m) using sonar. But to date, they have opened only 10 test trenches, just two of which have been excavated. \nThose two trenches account for only a fraction of the site , Foley told Live Science. \n\"The most time-consuming aspect of the investigation is excavation,\" Foley said. \"Lots of work ahead of us.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science.

But that may not mean as much as the president would like to think. \nIn a recent interview with Forbes, Trump said of Tillerson's alleged insult , \"I think it's fake news, but if he did that, I guess we'll have to compare IQ tests. And I can tell you who is going to win.\" [ Creative Genius: The World's Greatest Minds ] \nBut what do IQ tests really measure? Are they a valid metric for intelligence ? \nFor some, the answer is fairly clear. \"In my view, 'intelligence' is easy to define: It is that quality measured by performance on a well-standardized intelligence test,\" Robert Bilder, a psychologist at UCLA who researches cognition and psychopathology, told Live Science. \nBut intelligence testing, even intelligence as a concept, is the focus of a constant debate that raises more questions than it answers. \nThe IQ, or the intelligence quotient , is a measure of a person's mental age divided by their actual age, multiplied by 100. So, a person who is exactly as \"mentally old\" as one might expect for that individual's chronological age would score a perfectly average 100. People who deviate from that score in either direction are considered to be of above- or below-average intelligence. These scores can change with age and can fluctuate from one testing session to another , according to researchers. \nBut intelligence is a many-faceted beast. While it is colloquially associated with math and reasoning skills, psychologists assert that there are many kinds of intelligence, with Howard Gardner, a developmental psychologist at Harvard University, classifying seven distinct types , including bodily-kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, musical, logical-mathematical, visual-spatial and linguistic. \nGiven that it's so hard to pin down exactly what intelligence is , the task of measuring it with a standardized test is particularly difficult, experts say. One of the standard IQ tests used today is called the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (used for adults and older teens), which measures verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills, or as the psychologist who developed the test put it, the ability to \"adapt and constructively solve problems in the environment.\" \nTrump might not get the clear-cut result he's hoping for, since this test and others like it, including the Stanford-Binet test, don't present some unified quantity of a person's \"smartness.\" \nTest results are affected by several confounding variables, such as smoking habits, hours spent playing computer games and various aspects of one's personality, according to past research. IQ scores also change with the test taker's level of self-discipline and personal motivation and grit \u2014 all things that can change from testing session to testing session \u2014 according to a 2005 study that surveyed the IQ test results of 140 eighth-graders. \n\"Indeed, IQ tests are influenced by many factors,\" Cornell University developmental psychologist Stephen Ceci told Live Science. \"For example, schooling affects IQ test performance,\" he added, explaining that for each year that a student falls short of finishing high school, there is a drop of between 1.8 and 4 IQ points compared to peers who did finish high school. \nIn Vietnam, Ceci explained, people who had a higher risk of being drafted stayed in school longer as a means to defer service compared to those with safer draft numbers. IQ testing revealed that those who stayed in school longer had higher scores \u2014 not because they were smarter, but because they had greater exposure to the conditions that would help them answer IQ test questions such as \"who wrote Hamlet,\" Ceci said. \nIQ test scores even correlate with birth order among siblings, according to two 2007 studies, as reported by The New York Times . \nTherefore, IQ tests measure not just intelligence (however that is defined), but also the environment and context of one's life. \nWhether or not a superior IQ test result would actually provide Trump with a satisfying victory over Tillerson, Bilder said he would love to help out. \n\"I would be delighted personally to test President Trump's hypothesis, and [I] offer to conduct the examinations for free,\" he said. \"I would only request that we also include standardized tests of 'emotional intelligence' and 'response inhibition' that are not as fully examined in standard IQ tests but are very important to our success as a species.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "dan robitzski", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "howard gardner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bilder", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ceci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen ceci", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "forbes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ucla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wechsler adult intelligence scale", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cornell university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-12T20:22:49.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "87011b0497c74a7176a7d2941af0a3d5595fbb21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmXuaMQhzurzjnWoIiQ5FnPYsxZ1xhiRhFBnFBaYY3UNzTcCAdScfICQQM08xYyfF6", "site_full": "www.livescience.com", "site": "livescience.com", "site_section": "http://www.livescience.com/home/feed/site.xml", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "Live Science", "title": "Long Sleeves on Doctors' White Coats May Spread Germs", "title_full": "Long Sleeves on Doctors' White Coats May Spread Germs", "published": "2017-10-12T18:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.purch.com/h/1000/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5saXZlc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vaW1hZ2VzL2kvMDAwLzA5Ni8wODgvb3JpZ2luYWwvZG9jdG9yLXdoaXRlLWNvYXQuanBn", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 2967, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 399, "comments": 0, "shares": 399}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 19}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "87011b0497c74a7176a7d2941af0a3d5595fbb21", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRiDpHw2pFuaxgPwRqHZ_rmXuaMQhzurzjnWoIiQ5FnPYsxZ1xhiRhFBnFBaYY3UNzTcCAdScfICQQM08xYyfF6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-12T18:58:00.000+03:00", "title": "Long Sleeves on Doctors' White Coats May Spread Germs", "text": "Long Sleeves on Doctors' White Coats May Spread Germs By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | October 12, 2017 11:58am ET MORE Credit: ilikestudio/Shutterstock \nSAN DIEGO \u2014 Doctors may want to roll up their sleeves before work, literally. A new study suggests that long sleeves on a doctor's white coat may become contaminated with viruses or other pathogens that could then be transmitted to patients. \nIn the study, the researchers had 34 health care workers wear either long- or short-sleeved white coats while they examined a mannequin that had been contaminated with DNA from the \"cauliflower mosaic virus.\" This virus infects plants and is harmless to humans, but it is transmitted in a way that is similar to that of other, harmful pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile , a bacteria that causes severe diarrhea, said Dr. Amrita John, an infectious disease specialist at University Hospitals Case Medical Center in Cleveland, who led the study. John presented the research here on Friday (Oct. 6) at an infectious disease conference called IDWeek 2017. \nThe health care workers wore gloves while they examined the mannequin, then removed the gloves, washed their hands and put on a new pair of gloves before examining a second, clean (non-contaminated) mannequin. After the health care workers had finished examining both mannequins, the researchers swabbed the workers' sleeves, wrists and hands, and tested the samples for DNA from the cauliflower mosaic virus. Each of the 34 participants completed the exam twice (once wearing short sleeves and once wearing long sleeves), for a total of 68 \"simulations.\" [ 6 Superbugs to Watch Out For ] \nThey found that, when the health care workers wore long-sleeved coats, 25 percent of the simulations resulted in contamination of their sleeves or wrists with the virus DNA marker, compared with none when the health care workers wore short-sleeved coats. \nIn addition, about 5 percent of health care workers who wore long sleeves contaminated the clean mannequin with the virus DNA marker, while none of the health care workers who work short sleeves contaminated the clean mannequin. \nThese results provide support for a recommendation \"that health care personnel wear short sleeves to reduce the risk for pathogen transmission,\" John said. [ 10 Deadly Diseases That Hopped Across Species ] \nSuch a recommendation already exists in the United Kingdom \u2014 in 2007, the country's department of health introduced a \"bare below the elbow\" policy for hospitals, which recommended that health care personnel wear short sleeves. In the United States in 2014, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America said that health care facilities might consider the adoption of a \"bare below the elbow\" policy. \nSome U.S. facilities have subsequently adopted this policy within their institutions, and the new findings suggest that \"more people should consider it,\" said study co-author Dr. Curtis J. Donskey, an infectious disease specialist and professor of medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \nStill, the policy has been met with some resistance, with some doctors calling for more evidence showing that long sleeves really do increase the likelihood of transmitting pathogens. The new study provides some evidence, but additional, larger studies are still needed before some hospitals may adopt the policy, John said. \nIn addition, future research is still needed to show that a short-sleeve policy actually reduces the number of infections spread in a hospital, the researchers said. \nBut John said the study has changed her personal preference for the way she wears her white coat. \"I role up my coat sleeves above my elbow,\" John said. \nThe study has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Credit: CIRA \nPlumes of dense, gray smoke rise from deadly wildfires burning across multiple locations in California, in a striking animation of satellite images shared online Tuesday (Oct. 10) by the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (CIRA). \nCIRA, a research institution at Colorado State University, operates in collaboration with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to track and analyze weather data collected by satellites. \nThe sequence, which lasts for just a few seconds, was created with preliminary data captured by a satellite with the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) system, known as GOES-16. CIRA processed the data with a visualization tool called GeoColor, which displays satellite data of land and shallow water features in true color. In the animated sequence of wildfire images, GeoColor combined with the natural color of the fires, rendered in the red, blue and green (RGB) color model, accounting for the realistic detail of the wildfires' smoke and flames. [ Wildfires Blaze in Northern California (Photos) ] \nSince Sunday (Oct. 8), fast-moving wildfires have blazed across eight counties in Northern California's wine country, sparked by hot, dry conditions and fueled by gusting winds, which are also impeding the firefighters' progress . The fires claimed the lives of 23 people, destroyed approximately 3,500 buildings and scorched more than 170,000 acres (about 69,000 hectares), leading to the evacuation of over 20,000 people, ABC News reported today (Oct. 12). \nAnd the destructive fires in the Sonoma and Napa valleys are not slowing down, NASA representatives said yesterday (Oct. 11) in a statement . \nIn neighborhoods left charred and smoking in the wildfires' wake, \"acres of standing fireplaces\" are the only surviving remnants of the homes that once stood there, and thousands more homes are threatened by the encroaching flames , according to NASA. \nIn a natural-color image captured by NASA's Terra satellite Tuesday (Oct. 10) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), so-called \"hotspots\"\u2014 areas where fires are actively burning \u2014 are highlighted with red outlines. Winds continue to fan the flames of wildfires in northern California.

When accompanied by plumes of smoke, as in this image, such hot spots are diagnostic for fire,\" NASA representatives explained in the statement. \nCurrently, 17 fires are active in northern California, according to a map generated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CAL FIRE). Though wildfires are common in California during the month of October, the size and intensity of this year's fires are unusual, according to NASA. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Miller, LiveScience Email \nSevere infections with the Seoul virus can cause a disease called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which includes symptoms such as internal bleeding and kidney problems. (iStock) \nA mother and her daughter in Tennessee were infected with a virus rarely seen in the United States, and the culprit seems to be pet rats. \nThe two women tested positive for the Seoul virus, according to a new report, published today (Oct. 12) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Seoul virus is part of the Hantavirus family, a group of viruses that typically infect rodents. \nThe CDC reported in January that there was an outbreak of the virus among rat breeders and owners in Illinois and Wisconsin; that same month, the Tennessee Department of Health was notified of an individual with pet rats from one of the Illinois breeders with infected rats, according to the new report. \nIn fact, the owner of the pet rats, an 18-year-old, had gotten sick in December 2016 with an \"unspecified viral illness,\" the researchers said. She recovered fully from the virus without treatment. A test on a preserved sample of her blood that had been drawn when she was sick revealed that she had been infected with the Seoul virus. \nThe teenager didn't let health officials test her pet rats for the virus, but the officials presumed that the rodents also had the virus. As such, the officials recommended that the rats be euthanized. Once again, the teen refused. In response, the Tennessee Department of Health prohibited the teen from removing the rats from her home, essentially quarantining the pets. In addition, they educated the teen and her family about the best ways to avoid infection, which include avoiding contact with rodent urine, droppings, saliva and nesting material, according to the report. \nBut in April, the teen's 38-year-old mother got sick, too. She went to the emergency room with symptoms including a very high fever of 104.5 degrees Fahrenheit (40.3 degrees Celsius), shortness of breath, fatigue and lack of appetite, the report said. A blood test revealed that she had the Seoul virus. The mother told doctors that she had cleaned up rodent droppings from a bathtub about three weeks before she got sick. The Seoul virus \nThe Seoul virus infects brown Norway rats ( Rattus norvegicus ), which are found worldwide, according to the report. The virus can spread easily between rats, and can also be passed from rats to humans, according to the CDC.

Figuring that out, as well as understanding what mechanisms govern that interplay and how they might change along with the climate, has been an open question and one that is key to understanding how global warming will progress. \nThe 2014 launch of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 satellite was aimed at beginning to piece together some answers by monitoring the comings and goings of CO2 from the atmosphere with unprecedented precision and over large regions. [ The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted ] \nSo far, the mission has done that and has turned up some surprises along the way. The mission serendipitously coincided with one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1os (an ocean and atmosphere cycle that impacts global weather) on record, allowing scientists to see how the carbon cycle responded and pinpoint exactly where the resulting record pulse of CO2 that entered the atmosphere came from. The satellite's instruments also unexpectedly proved capable of distinguishing the relatively small CO2 signatures of cities and even volcano plumes. An artist's rendition of the OCO-2 Observatory. Credit: Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech \n\"We're very, very happy with these results,\" deputy project scientist Annmarie Eldering, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told Live Science. \nBut the findings, described in series of five papers in the Oct. 13 issue of the journal Science, are just the first steps at getting a better handle on the carbon cycle (how carbon flows through land and sea ecosystems and the atmosphere), as OCO-2 heads into an expected extended mission and other space-based projects are scheduled to follow in its wake. Luck and surprises \nCarbon dioxide is added to and removed from the atmosphere by a range of competing processes. On land, for example, the photosynthesis of plants takes up CO2, while the decay of plant matter and wildfires release it back into the atmosphere. [ Here's How Carbon Dioxide Warms the Planet ] \nScientists knew that El Ni\u00f1os were another factor that caused more CO2 to build up in the Earth's atmosphere, and from the 1997-1998 major El Ni\u00f1o, they had some suspicions on why that was. For one thing, El Ni\u00f1o tends to lead to drying in parts of the tropics, resulting in less photosynthesis and less uptake of carbon dioxide. \nWhat project scientists couldn't know when the satellite rocketed into space on July 2, 2014, was that it would be perfectly poised to observe how one of the strongest El Ni\u00f1os in the books affected the carbon cycle. \n\"Sometimes you get really lucky,\" said Galen McKinley, a carbon cycle scientist at Columbia University's Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory. \nThese effects were in evidence during the 2015-2016 event, which caused the biggest year-over-year jump in global CO2 concentrations on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. But OCO-2 revealed, as is so often the case in science, that the picture was more complicated than previously thought. [ CO2 Satellite: NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 Mission in Photos ] This artist's rendition reveals a column of carbon dioxide as the OCO-2 satellite monitors it. Credit: Debbi McLean/GSFC, Courtesy NASA/JPL-Caltech \nThe satellite's observations let project scientists piece together the sequence of events of the carbon cycle's response as the El Ni\u00f1o geared up and then reached its peak. They saw that at first there was a tiny dip in carbon dioxide levels over the tropical Pacific because of changes in the structure of the underlying ocean that meant waters gave off less CO2. But that slight decrease was quickly overtaken by the much larger response from terrestrial biomass as drought, heat and wildfires took a toll and caused less CO2 to be absorbed and more to be released. [ Top 10 Deadliest Natural Disasters in History ] \nThe ocean signal \"was really a big surprise to us,\" said Abhishek Chatterjee, a scientist with University Space Research Association working at NASA's Goddard Spaceflight Center. The response had been inferred before, \"but it was never observed to the degree that we could\" with OCO-2, he said. \nThe team was able to take the analysis a step further by using OCO-2's capability to detect a signature of photosynthesis, which is a marker of the productivity of land plants. Together, the data showed that while the tropical areas of Southeast Asia, South America and Africa all added about the same amount of CO2 into the atmosphere, they did so for different reasons. In Southeast Asia, the hot, dry conditions brought on by El Ni\u00f1o made the region more vulnerable to fire, which releases CO2 into the atmosphere. In South America, dry conditions tamped down plant productivity, meaning the biosphere took up less carbon dioxide, so that the region became a net source of CO2. And in Africa, while rainfall was about normal, exceptional heat increased plant respiration, which caused more CO2 emissions. More work to do Illustration of an OCO-2 data collection over the Los Angeles Basin. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech \nOCO-2 sensors were also surprisingly good at picking out much smaller CO2 signatures, such as the plume of Vanuatu's Yasur volcano and the contrast between Los Angeles' relatively higher CO2 levels compared with the surrounding suburban and rural areas. [ Earth from Above: 101 Stunning Images from Orbit ] \nThe satellite could also see how the difference between the urban core and rural areas declined in the summer because plants in the region took up some of the excess. \nThe ability of satellites to pinpoint these signatures has implications for a wide range of applications, including monitoring emissions to make sure cities and countries are complying with their pledges to reduce CO2. Satellite CO2 measurements could also provide earlier warnings of volcanic eruptions, said Florian Schwandner, also of NASA's JPL, as CO2 emissions from volcanoes increase before an eruption. \nOCO-2 has completed its initial two-year planned mission and is expected to begin a three-year extended mission once NASA officials sign off on it, said Eldering, the deputy project scientist. \nScientists are also hoping that two other planned missions go as scheduled to build on OCO-2's work. One, called OCO-3, will use leftover spare parts from OCO-2 and would be mounted on the International Space Station to allow scientists to point at features of interest. That mission has been slated to be cut by the Trump administration, though it remains to be seen whether Congress will go along with that plan. \nThe other, called the Geostationary Carbon Cycle Observatory, would be able to measure CO2 over continuous areas, such as the U.S., something OCO-2 can't do. \n\"It's very exciting science, [but] there's a lot more work to do,\" McKinley said. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

By Rachael Rettner, Senior Writer | October 12, 2017 05:45pm ET MORE Credit: Viktor1/Shutterstock \nThe poultry products you buy at the grocery store may be a source of bacteria that cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) in people, a new study suggests. \nIn the study, researchers analyzed samples of meat from grocery stores in California, as well as urine samples from patients with UTIs; the scientists were looking for the presence of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria. There are many strains of E. coli , and most are harmless to people, but some cause disease, including UTIs. \nOut of the six strains of E. coli known to cause the majority of UTIs around the world, the researchers detected three strains in the meat samples tested, the majority of which were poultry products. \nThe findings \"suggest that there might be a food-borne source of urinary tract infection,\" said study co-author Dr. Cindy Friedman, of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne and Environmental Diseases. However, the study does not show for certain that bacteria in meat products cause UTIs, and so more research is needed to examine the link further, the researchers said. [ Top 7 Germs in Food That Make You Sick ] \nThe study was recently presented at IDWeek 2017, an infectious disease conference in San Diego. \nE. coli bacteria cause about 80 percent of UTIs in people, but exactly where the harmful bacteria come from is not clear, said study co-author Dr. Reina Yamaji, a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Public Health, who presented the work at the conference on Friday, Oct. 6. Some earlier studies have suggested that the bacteria could come from food \u2014 from poultry products, in particular. \nTo examine this connection further, Yamaji and colleagues collected urine samples from more than 1,000 patients with UTIs at a university-affiliated health care center in 2016 and 2017. The scientists also sampled 200 meat products collected from local grocery stores near the university. The researchers analyzed bacterial DNA from both the meat and urine samples, looking for certain genetic \"fingerprints\" to determine which strains of E. coli were found in patients and in meat products. \nResults showed that, overall, 38 percent of the meat samples were contaminated with E. coli . Of the different types of meat, ground turkey was the most commonly contaminated, with 73 percent of ground turkey products testing positive for E. coli . In addition, 43 percent of chicken breast samples, 18 percent of ground beef samples and 15 percent of pork chop samples contained E. coli . \nOverall, nearly one-quarter of the poultry products contained E. coli bacteria strains that were also found in the patient's urine samples. \nAs for how E. coli in meat could cause UTIs, the researchers hypothesized that this could happen when people don't properly cook raw meat, or don't properly handle the raw meat and thus contaminate parts of their kitchen or other foods with E. coli . Once ingested, the E. coli could live harmlessly in a person's intestine (if the bacteria is a type that does not cause food-borne illness). But if the E. coli passes out of the body in a person's stool, and some of that fecal material containing the bacteria then enters a person's urethra, it could cause a UTI, the researchers said. \nStill, the study cannot prove a \"cause and effect\" relationship between the E. coli in the poultry products and people's UTIs. For one thing, the researchers did not ask participants about their dietary habits, so the scientists can't trace the path of the bacteria from food to patients, Friedman said. In addition, the researchers analyzed only part of the E. coli genome. Sequencing the full genome would provide more information about how closely the E. coli in poultry and the patients is related, the researchers said. \nThe study has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

New research finds an under-ice canyon stretching the length of the shelf. (Copernicus Sentinel data (2017), processed by A. Hogg/CPOM) \nA mysterious world of upside-down canyons crisscrosses the underbelly of Antarctica's ice shelves. \nNow, research finds that some of these crevasses may contribute to both the thinning of the shelves and sea-level rise. A single canyon in the Dotson ice shelf in West Antarctica is responsible for dumping 4.4 billion short tons (4 billion metric tons) of freshwater into the Southern Ocean, according to Noel Gourmelen, a remote-sensing researcher at The University of Edinburgh. [ 50 Amazing Facts About Antarctica ] Icy divots \nThese divots in the underside of the ice shelves are poorly understood , according to the European Space Agency (ESA). To learn more, Gourmelen and his colleagues have been using data from ESA's CryoSat and Copernicus Sentinel-1 satellites to peer into the invisible under-ice world of the Antarctic canyons. More From LiveScience Extreme Antarctica: Amazing Photos of Lake Ellsworth \nBoth of these satellites use radar techniques to gauge ice-shelf thickness and dynamics. The team used the data to investigate the flow of the Dotson ice shelf, a 30-mile-wide (50 kilometers) expanse off the remote coast of Marie Byrd Land. \n\"We have found subtle changes in both surface elevation data from CryoSat and ice velocity from Sentinel-1, which shows that melting is not uniform, but has centered on a 5-km-wide [3 miles] channel that runs 60 km [37 miles] along the underside of the shelf,\" Gourmelen said in a statement . \nThis under-ice canyon is probably formed by relatively warm ocean water \u2014 33.8 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1 degree Celsius \u2014 that circulates clockwise and upward due to the planet's rotation, Gourmelen said. \n\"Revisiting older satellite data, we think that this melt pattern has been taking place for at least the entire 25 years that Earth observation satellites have been recording changes in Antarctica,\" he said. \nIn that time, he said, the warm water has created an upside-down canyon in the bottom of the ice shelf that is up to 124 miles (200 km) deep and 9 miles (15 km) wide. The crevasse is deepening by about 22 feet (7 meters) each year, Gourmelen said. \n\"The strength of an ice shelf depends on how thick it is. Since shelves are already suffering from thinning , these deepening canyons mean that fractures are likely to develop and the grounded ice upstream will flow faster than would be the case otherwise,\" he said, referring to the land-based ice that is buttressed by the floating ice shelves. This land-based ice has a greater impact on overall sea-level rise because it's not already floating in the ocean. (When floating ice melts, it doesn't directly impact sea levels.) \nThe next goal, Gourmelen said, is to expand the same line of research to the rest of the ice shelves ringing Antarctica. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

Shifeta said that the actual death toll could be higher than the reported numbers, because crocodiles may have eaten some of the carcasses. \nThough officials are waiting on laboratory confirmation of the disease, a diagnosis of anthrax is reasonable given the findings, said Dr. Barbara Byrne, a professor of clinical pathology, microbiology and immunology at the University of California, Davis, School of Veterinary Medicine. Byrne was not involved in studying the Namibian outbreak. \nIf anthrax is indeed the culprit, then the hippos were likely infected with the bacteria by ingesting a resistant form, called a spore, that was found in their environment, Byrne told Live Science. \nShe added that she suspects that the area had anthrax spores in the mud that became available to the hippos as water levels in the river decreased. The outbreak may have affected so many hippos because water spread the bacteria to other areas, she said. \nIn addition, \"hippos can also be cannibalistic [and feed] on dead carcasses, so some may be picking up the infection from eating other hippos that died of anthrax,\" Byrne said. \nFlies can also spread the bacteria throughout the environment, by feeding on the infected carcasses and then spreading the bacteria further, Byrne said. Bacillus anthracis \nAnthrax is a bacterial disease that can kill humans and animals by disrupting the water balance of cells in the body, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Animals become infected when they breathe in or ingest spores of anthrax bacteria ( Bacillus anthracis ), the CDC says. \nOnce inside a host , Bacillus anthracis disrupts cellular water balance, which causes cells to swell up with water and die. If the bacteria get into the cells that make up blood vessels, those vessels can no longer hold blood or water, resulting in the leaking of fluids, internal bleeding and, eventually, death, Byrne said \nBut for humans handling the hippo carcasses, there is a \"very low risk, if any\" of getting anthrax, said Dr. Wolfgang Beyer, the head of the anthrax consulting laboratory at the University of Hohenheim's Institute of Animal Science in Germany. \n\"Skin anthrax\" could happen if the bacteria get into an open cut, Beyer told Live Science. \"Of course, the meat or any specimens of the carcasses should not be used for human consumption at all,\" he added. \nA previous anthrax outbreak in Siberia killed more than 2,000 reindeer and sickened 13 people; it was linked to 75-year-old anthrax spores released by melting permafrost. That case highlights the concern that climate change may encourage the spread of certain diseases, experts said. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

Bromances were also more socially fulfilling than their romantic relationships, according to the study. \n\"The main differences between romances and bromances were the lack of judgment and boundaries in discussion\" or expressing emotion, said study co-author Adam White, a lecturer of sport and physical education at the University of Bedfordshire in England. \"These men felt they could tell their deepest, darkest and most sensitive secrets to their bromances, as they did not feel like they would be judged, ridiculed or thought of differently,\" White said. [ 10 Things Every Woman Should Know About a Man's Brain ] \nBut in their romantic relationships with their girlfriends, the \"men felt pressured to maintain a certain standard, meaning they regulated their disclosures and emotions more,\" White told Live Science. \nOne study participant, for example, told the interviewers that there were no boundaries between what he could talk about with his bromance, but there were things he wouldn't tell his girlfriend out of fear \"she might not like me after.\" In particular, he thought his girlfriend would judge him for listening to Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 , he told the researchers, adding that he felt like had to be more \"manly\" around her. \nIn the study, which was published Oct. 12 in the journal Men and Masculinities , the researchers interviewed 30 young British men in their sophomore year of college who identified as heterosexual about their romantic relationships and their close male friendships. \nOf the 30 men interviewed, 28 said they would rather discuss personal matters with a close male friend than with a tic partner. \nThe findings could have important implications for the health of young men, White said. \n\"We recognize that a whole host of physical and mental health conditions are exaggerated in young men, primarily due to previous pressures to not disclose their emotions,\" White said. But if men are happy to talk about and discuss their health worries with their closest friends, it may have therapeutic effects for reducing and managing a whole host of health-related concerns, he said. \nThe researchers noted that the rise in bromances can be recognized as a progressive development in the relations between men but that this progress may have a negative impact on heterosexual relations. \nFor example, strong bromances could challenge traditional living arrangements between men and women in romantic relationships, as men may choose to live with each other, just as many do in college, the researchers wrote. \nOne limitation of the study was that it involved only 30 men; more research is needed to see whether the findings apply to a larger male population. \nOriginally published on Live Science .

This year features a duo of Friday the 13ths, the second of which occurs today (Oct. 13). The first myth-mired Friday fell on Jan. 13 this year. \nToday, it's taken for granted that Friday the 13th is an inauspicious day , but that wasn't always the case. Until the late 1800s, no one felt that Fridays that happen to fall on the 13th day of the month were anything special at all. \nExactly how the date became mired in the mind as an unlucky one is murky. Certainly the idea was firmly implanted in the cultural consciousness by 1980, when the slasher flick \"Friday the 13th\" was released. The hockey-masked villain of that tale, Jason Voorhees, has taken on a life of his own, driving 12 films as well as multiple novellas and comic books. Thus, it's no surprise that a Google Ngram search of the phrase \"Friday the 13th\" finds the term shot up in use in books in 1980. [ The Surprising Origins of 9 Common Superstitions ] \nCredit for popularizing the Friday the 13th myth often goes to Capt. William Fowler, a noted soldier who rubbed elbows with former presidents and other high-profile people of the late 1800s. Fowler noticed that the number 13 was woven throughout his life (he went to Public School No. 13 in New York City, for example, and fought in 13 Civil War battles), so he decided to combat the \"popular superstition against thirteen,\" according to his obituary. \nFowler started a society called the Thirteen Club, which held its first meeting on Sept. 13, 1881. Guests walked under crossed ladders to a 13-seat table festooned with spilled salt. It was a notable party and repudiation of superstition, but Fowler can't take credit for Friday the 13th, specifically: Sept. 13, 1881, was a Tuesday. (Another account, detailed in a blog by the New York Historical Society , puts that inaugeral meeting on a Friday the 13th \u2014 Jan. 13, 1882, at 8:13 p.m., in room 13 of Fowler's Knickerbocker Cottage.) \nThat idea that 13 was an unlucky number may go back to ancient mythology. According to Donald Dossey , author of \"Holiday Folklore, Phobias and Fun\" (Outcome Unlimited Pr, 1992), a Norse myth told of a dinner party for 12 gods at which a 13th guest showed up uninvited. The gatecrasher \u2014 the trickster god Loki \u2014 shot the god of joy and happiness, Balder. The Christian tale of the Last Supper likewise holds Judas, Jesus' betrayer, as the \"unlucky\" 13th guest. \nFriday has also been considered an unlucky day in Western tradition. E. Cobham Brewer's 1898 \"Dictionary of Phrase and Fable\" claims Friday as the day that Jesus was crucified and perhaps the day that Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, according to Christian beliefs. In 1882, poet John Godfrey Saxe published a poem called \"The Good Dog of Brette,\" about a poodle that roams the city with a basket, bringing donations home to his blind master. On a Friday, \"a day when misfortune is aptest [sic] to fall,\" a cruel butcher chops off the dog's tail. \nIn 1907, author Thomas William Lawson put together the notion of unlucky Friday and unlucky 13 with the novel \"Friday the 13th,\" a tale of an unscrupulous broker taking advantage of superstition to game the stock market on that date, described as \"Wall Street hoodoo-day.\" Lawson may not have invented the idea of the unlucky date, but he likely spread the notion. \nOriginal article on Live Science . \nEditor's Note: This article was first published in 2015 and updated on Oct. 13, 2017.

By Megan Gannon, Live Science Contributor | October 13, 2017 07:05am ET MORE Easter Island is known for these iconic Moai statues, as well as mysteries surrounding the inhabitants of the island. Credit: Terry Hunt \nOn a map, Easter Island is a remote dot more than 2,000 miles (3,219 kilometers) from the western coast of Chile. It has long fascinated archaeologists \u2014not only for its hundreds of enormous statues, called moai, but also because it could hold clues about epic Pacific sea voyages and subsequent cultural mash-ups that occurred before the arrival of Europeans. \nMost scholars think that Easter Island, also known by its native name Rapa Nui , was first populated by Polynesians who arrived around AD 1200. But there\u2019s also some evidence that the island's early settlers interacted with people native to South America before Europeans showed up in 1722. \nA new study , published yesterday (Oct. 12) in the journal Current Biology, adds to the debate. Scientists looked at five skeletons from the Rapanui culture and found no genetic traces of Native American ancestry, contradicting earlier assertions of contact with South American peoples. [ Image Gallery: The Walking Statues of Easter Island ] \n\"We were really surprised we didn't find anything,\" study leader Lars Fehren-Schmitz, an associate professor of anthropology at UC Santa Cruz, said in a statement. \"There's a lot of evidence that seems plausible, so we were convinced we would find direct evidence of pre-European contact with South America, but it wasn't there.\" \nFehren-Schmitzand his colleagues took samples from the ribs of skeletons that were found in the 1980s during an archaeological digat the beachside moai site of Ahu Nau Nau. Some bones date back to as early as 1445, while others were buried as late as 1925, well after European contact. In all cases, no DNA traces of Native Americans were found. \nThe idea that South Americans first populated Easter Island was proposed in the 1950s by Thor Heyerdahl, the Norwegian anthropologist famous for his Kon-Tiki raft expedition. He saw sweet potatoes native to the Andes growing on Rapa Nui, and noticed similarities between fishing gear, language quirks and pre-Inca stone statueson the island and the mainland. \nToday, the archaeological consensus is that Polynesians \u2014who were skilled at long-distance ocean voyages and settled scattered Pacific islands \u2014got to Rapa Nui first. But scholars haven\u2019t totally tossed out Heyerdahl\u2019s idea about early contact with South America. \nErik Thorsby of the University of Oslo, who was not involved in the new study, previously found some genetic markers typical of Native Americans in Rapanui skeletons. \nBased on a recent review of the evidence, Thorsby suggested that Native Americans may have arrivedat Rapa Nuias early as AD 1280 to 1495, perhaps by hitching a ride with Polynesians who were returning from visits to the shores of South America. \nThorsby said he thinks the new findings are interesting, but added that \"great caution must be exercised in drawing general conclusions since ancient DNA from only five different individuals was studied.\" He noted that past studies have revealed small percentages of early Native American ancestry in just a few individuals from the island. Therefore, it\u2019s possible that only a few Native Americans reached Rapa Nui early and their ancestral genes \"may be easily missed when ancient DNA from only five individuals are investigated,\" he told Live Science in an email. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

And in the future, robots may be able to pull off this seemingly magical camouflage trick as well. \nResearchers have created a synthetic form of cephalopod skin that can transform from a flat, 2D surface to a three-dimensional one with bumps and pits, they report today (Oct. 12) in the journal Science . This technology could one day be used in soft robots, which are typically covered in a stretchy silicone \"skin,\" the researchers said. \n\"Camouflaged robots may hide and be protected from animal attacks and may better approach animals for studying them in their natural habitats,\" Cecilia Laschi, a professor of biorobotics at the BioRobotics Institute of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies, in Pisa, Italy, wrote in an accompanying article in the current issue of Science. \"Of course, camouflage may also support military applications, where reducing a robot's visibility provides it with advantages in accessing dangerous areas,\" wrote Laschi, who wasn't involved in the current study. [ Biomimicry: 7 Clever Technologies Inspired by Nature ] The giant Australian cuttlefish ( Sepia apama ) expresses its papillae for camouflage purposes. Credit: Roger Hanlon Bumpy skin \nThe researchers, led by James Pikul of the University of Pennsylvania and Robert Shepherd of Cornell University, took inspiration from the 3D bumps, or papillae, that octopus and cuttlefish can inflate using muscle units in one-fifth of a second for camouflaging. [ 8 Crazy Facts About Octopuses ] \nThe complement of papillae in a soft robot would be the air pockets, or \"balloons,\" beneath the silicone skin. Often, these pockets get inflated at different times in different spots to generate locomotion in a robot. In the new research, this robotic inflation was taken a step further. \n\"Based on these things they [cephalopods] can do and what our technology can't do, how do we bridge the gap to have technological solutions to their pretty amazing capabilities?\" was the central question posed by Shepherd. \n\"In this case, inflating a balloon is a pretty feasible solution,\" he added. \nBy embedding small fiber-mesh spheres into the silicone, the scientists could control and shape the texture of the inflated surface, just as an octopus might retexture its skin. The researchers created a silicone-mesh composite that they then inflated with air to mimic the papillae that cephalopods inflate to texture their skin for camouflage. Credit: J.H. Pikul et al., Science (2017) \nPikul, then a postdoctoral student at Cornell University, came up with the idea of texturing these air pockets via patterns of the fiber-mesh rings. He was drawn to the idea of inflating silicone because of how quick and reversible the inflation could be, Pikul explained to Live Science. From there, it was just a matter of figuring out the mathematical models to make it work. Proof of concept \nThe current prototype for the textured skins looks fairly rudimentary: By dividing up the silicone bubbles with concentric circles of fiber-mesh frames, the researchers figured out how to control the shape of the silicone as it inflated. They managed to inflate the bubbles into some new shapes by reinforcing the mesh, according to the paper. For instance, they created structures that mimicked rounded stones in a river as well as a succulent plant ( Graptoveria amethorum ) with leaves arranged in a spiral pattern. The researchers tested out their silicone camouflage technique by creating a prototype that transformed from a flat surface into a 3D one that mimicked a succulent plant. Credit: J.H. Pikul et al., Science (2017) \nBut sophistication wasn't their primary goal, Shepherd noted. \n\"We don't want this to be a technology that only a few people in the world can use; we want it to be fairly easy to do,\" Shepherd told Live Science. He wanted the texturing technology, which built on the team's earlier findings on how to make color-changing silicone skins , to be accessible to industry, academia and hobbyists alike. Therefore, the team deliberately used limiting technologies like laser cutters to manufacture the wire rings because that's what people outside a Cornell University lab could use. \nItai Cohen, a physics professor at Cornell, who also worked on the research, noted another accessible aspect of the technology. On an excursion into the field, Cohen envisions stacking sheets of deflated silicone \u2014 programmed to inflate into a camouflaging texture \u2014 into the back of one's truck. \"Now, you can inflate it so it doesn't have to be in that permanent shape, which is really difficult to transport,\" Cohen told Live Science. As the technology advances, one might even be able to scan an environment and then program the corresponding silicone sheet right then and there to mimic it, Cohen speculated. \nBoth Pikul and Shepherd plan to pursue this technology in their own respective labs. Shepherd explained that since developing the technology, he's started to replace the inflation with electric currents that could cause the same texturing \u2014 no tether and pressurized air system required. And Pikul hopes to apply the lessons learned from manipulating the surfaces of materials to things where surface area plays a significant role, like batteries or coolants, he said. \n\"We're still very much in the exploratory phase of soft robotics,\" Shepherd said. Because most machines are made up of hard metals and plastics, the conventions and best uses of soft robots have yet to be fully fleshed out. \"We're just at the beginning, and we have great results,\" he said, but the key is, \"in the future, making it easier for other people to use the technology and making sure these systems are reliable.\" \nThe study was funded by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory's Army Research Office. \nOriginal article on Live Science .

(Kathrin Glauser/Archaeological Service of the Canton of Bern) \nPieces of a 4,000-year-old bow, arrows and a wooden food container that belonged to a Bronze Age mountaineer have been found in a high alpine pass in Switzerland. \nThe artifacts are among several items found in what appears to have been a rock shelter beside a glacier near the top of the nearly 8,800-foot (2,700 meters) L\u00f6tschberg Pass, or L\u00f6tschenpass, in the Bernese Alps. \nThe bow and arrows, food box and other items are thought to have belonged to Bronze Age hunters or animal herders who took shelter beneath a large rock near the top of the pass around 4,000 years ago, said Regula Gubler, an archaeologist for the Canton of Bern government, which announced the finds this week. [ See More Photos of the Bronze-Age Artifacts Found in Switzerland ] \nThe site was discovered in 2011 by Beat Dietrich, the warden of a nearby mountain hut, while he was walking with his dog near the top of the pass, Gubler told Live Science. Part of a neve \u2014 a long-lasting snowfield at the head of a glacier \u2014 had melted more than usual, revealing pieces of ancient wood and leather. More From LiveScience Neolithic Bow and Arrow Revealed in Melting Snow \nGubler and other archaeologists from the Canton of Bern Archaeological Service surveyed the site that year and recovered several items during an excavation in 2012, but bad weather prevented them from finishing the dig before the onset of winter. \n\"Since then we've had snow on the site, but this year we could finish it,\" Gubler said. \"It was a warm summer and not much snow in the winter, and this combination melted the snow.\" Ancient alpinists \nThe latest finds, recovered by the researchers in September, include four pieces of shaped elm wood from what could be two Bronze Age bows , wood from possible arrow shafts, strips of ancient leather and a cord made from animal fiber attached to a button made from cattle horn, Gubler said. \nThe excavations in 2012 also found pieces of curved elm wood from bows, as well as three flint arrow heads, a cow-horn container and a wooden box that had once held roughly ground grain flour . \nCarbon dating showed that the objects originated from between 2000 and 1800 B.C., according to tests conducted by the Canton of Bern Archaeological Service . \nGubler explained that the artifacts all came from an area that measures about 21 square feet (2 square meters), inside a hollow among the rocks just below the top of the pass. \nThe finds suggest a single person or small group had taken shelter in the hollow around 400 years ago, and left the objects behind, she said. \n\"It can be very windy up there at 2,600 meters [8,530 feet] above sea level, but that hollow is quite sheltered, as we found out ourselves while working there,\" Gubler said. \"We think it may have been a shelter underneath [a] big rock, but the rock must have broken in the intervening years.\" \nThe bows and arrowheads suggest the Bronze Age mountaineers may have been hunters: The pass is still a prime hunting area today, with many game animals such as chamois and ibex, Gubler said. But, they may also have been herders, who carried bows and arrows to protect their animals from predators like bears and wolves, she added. Flour find \nTests on the wooden container found at the alpine archaeological site in 2012 have shown that it once contained a roughly ground flour made from a variety of grains, including wheat, rye, barley and smelt, according to research published in June in the journal Scientific Reports . \nGubler thinks the box was used to carry dry flour that could be mixed with water or milk before eating. \"It's lighter if you just take flour with you,\" she said. \nThe Bronze Age alpinists could have chosen a food container made from wood for the same reason: \"You wouldn't take a pottery vessel with you in the mountains \u2014 it would be far too heavy.\" \nThe 4,000-year-old artifacts were the oldest yet found in the L\u00f6tschberg Pass, although fragments of wood and leather dating to the medieval period and Iron Age have also been found near the hollow at the top of the pass, according to Gubler. \n\"There are also finds in other parts, but the hollow is the most interesting part of the whole pass,\" she said. \"If you come up over the glacier, which you could have in the past, then that would be the best way to come off the glacier and go up over the pass.\" \nThe discovery confirmed historic records that indicate the pass was a major route for hunters, herders and traders for centuries, between the Bernese Oberland to the north and the Valais region to the south, she said. And the region may hold more secrets yet. \n\"I think there's more to find up there in the pass generally, that it's not finished yet,\" Gubler said. \"We'll have to keep an eye on the whole area \u2014 we might not have found all the interesting corners of that pass.\" \nOriginal article on Live Science.
