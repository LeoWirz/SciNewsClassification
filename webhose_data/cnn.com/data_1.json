Follow @cnnsport Ollie is eight and Harry is five, and the boat in question their Playmobil pirate ship -- a once prized possession that had been gathering dust at home. But the voyage has taken it -- aptly named Adventure -- to Scandinavia and now on towards Cape Verde, having traveled through waters that have smashed far grander vessels than one measuring just 67 centimeters in length and costing $67 (\u00a349.99.) Its an unexpected voyage that has garnered attention from Copenhagen to Canada and from the United Kingdom to the United States.

Currently, they have chalked off 208 with each one detailed on their Facebook page but none have caught the attention quite like the Playmobil pirate ship. \"It started with the premise of a message in a bottle,\" Mac explains to CNN from the family home, \"of sending a message from one country to another, to learn about how big the world is, and things like crosswinds. \"We didn't want to send a plastic bottle into the ocean as that's littering and sent the wrong message so instead we used a Playmobil ship that they no longer used and would have gone to a charity shop or something.\" READ: Sailing's glamor tribe and the downsides of paradise Voyage of discovery To make it more seaworthy, the boys added a counterweight to stop it from flipping over and polystyrene to help it float. It then underwent testing in their local swimming pool and in open water before its main voyage. But the Fergusons had no idea how the journey would play out as, on May 26, it was put to sea along with the family's contact details. Their Dad recalls: \"I half thought, it'd get caught up and spilled back onto the beach a few miles down the coast.\" JUST WATCHED Blair Tuke's pursuit of history\nBlair Tuke's pursuit of history 03:04 Read: Meet the violin-playing surfer Instead, though, it traveled 390 miles to Denmark where it was picked up by a family, who contacted the Fergusons via Facebook with photos of them with the boat before returning it to the sea. From there, it traveled to Sweden where it found its way into a tree, found by a woman in her boat who did some running repairs before setting it off on its latest voyage, this time to Norway. \"Partly because it was going to waste, we used the Playmobil boat but also as it was more eye-catching for people to pick up rather than leave it where it is,\" he says. \"It's obviously worked better than it ever could have.\" Its last appearance was in Norway, where it was found by a crew member aboard a conservation vessel a quarter-of-a-mile off the Norwegian shoreline. \"It made it to three countries in just about six weeks which is incredible,\" says Ferguson, with an infinitely more demanding journey now under way. It was put on board the Christian Radich, a fully-rigged ship, and pushed into the waters towards Cape Verde in the Atlantic Ocean. Lego in outer space As for what the future holds, the family have no idea but the boys are still relishing it. \"It's funny as this is not even the most adventurous of our 500 challenges,\" explains Ferguson, who sent two Lego men into space 19.5 miles above earth with a GoPro. \"But of the 500, this one has certainly grown arms and legs, and it's certainly made the boys popular at school.\" Photos: Sailing at the 2016 Olympic Games Andreas Cariolou, RS-X (Cyprus) \u2013 The sun was beginning to set over the Marina da Gl\u00f3ria and award-winning sports photographer Clive Mason was finishing up for the day.

Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Sailing at the 2016 Olympic Games Nathan Outteridge, 49er skiff (Australia) \u2013 But the photographer's craft is also about intensely \"personal\" moments. Mason says he was \"lucky\" to get the opportunity to shoot Australian sailor Nathan Outteridge washing down his boat in this pragmatic, four or five days before the hustle and bustle of Olympic competition. \"I love this picture,\" Mason says, telling CNN Sport he and his fellow professionals sometimes find themselves forming bonds with the athletes they cover over the years, quietly sharing their moments of victory.

Long lines at San Juan airport Hundreds of people have packed the main terminal at San Juan's Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport this week, hoping to escape the devastation -- but leaving hasn't been easy. Hurricane Maria: Puerto Rico officials describe 'apocalyptic' conditions Because of damage to radar and other equipment at the airport, only about 10 commercial flights between San Juan and the US mainland could take off and land Monday -- and the same number is scheduled for Tuesday, airport authorities told CNNMoney . People are waiting in a main terminal that -- because it is running on limited emergency power -- has no air conditioning. \"Everyone is in the same boat, trying to get out,\" Leyla Colon, standing in line at the airport Monday, told Reuters. She said she couldn't buy tickets before she arrived at the airport, because she didn't have Internet or cellphone service. \"At this point I'll buy a ticket on any flight to get out of here,\" Colon told Reuters. Stranded passengers rest Monday at San Juan's Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn International Airport. Dozens more flights with relief material -- meals, water and generators -- have come into the airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The first commercial flight from San Juan to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport since Maria landed Monday night, to the relief of the 200 passengers' relatives. Sarita Mongelli's parents, in their 80s, were on the flight. \"I can't describe the feeling after five days (of) not talking to them,\" Mongelli told CNN affiliate WABC . \"I can't tell you what they've gone through -- horrible, horrible conditions -- and at this age, it's very hard for them.\" Mongelli said her parents want to return to Puerto Rico but won't be going back anytime soon. \"Whatever's left of their life right now, they need to be safe with their children, not alone,\" she told the TV station. \"We can't ask for more, I got them home -- I'm taking them home with me now.\" 'We're on a mission' Ryan says Puerto Rico will get aid, calls situation 'a humanitarian crisis' At Atlanta's international airport, aid workers were preparing Tuesday to board a charter flight to San Juan. Among them were 31 members of the New York City Fire Department, many of whom are of Puerto Rican descent. \"As Puerto Rican New York City firefighters with family that live in Puerto Rico, devastated by Hurricane Maria, we're on a mission to do what we can as best as we can, to get to all the people we can,\" said Lt. Joe Montalvo, a fireman from Battalion 57 in Brooklyn. The firefighters loaded supplies onto the plane, including special cases of blood in refrigerated containers. Montalvo said he had yet to speak with relatives living on the island. \"Phone service is still down, cellphone service is limited,\" Montalvo said. \"My family (lives) in the southwest corner of the island, and we haven't heard anything from anybody.\" He added, \"We're hopeful they're OK.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald j. trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill weir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosario heredia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 donald j. trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wilfredo villegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gaspar rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leyla santiago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doris velez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodriguez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heredia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "irma", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean customers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean rescue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean cars", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roberto clemente coliseum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "energy department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas & florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naguabo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humacao arena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean power", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le carbet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "punta cana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toa baja", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "st. martin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fajardo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guadeloupe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martinique", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roseau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humacao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean people", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fort-de-france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean waves", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utuado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominican republic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petit-bourg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luquillo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caribbean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marigot", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dominica", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T13:22:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "73cdb043ee793868955fcc29bbd559eea2c320cb", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNbflWXFH9MpkspothY6sK6iFMz1olbXDJX3pvCyqK1ZW.eyRgZ66cFnMqvxnprwu0WUFqyobilXiF5LcE6FBn9v", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com -

Stone, a one-time adviser to Trump, issued a combative opening statement Monday evening ahead of his highly anticipated appearance before the House intelligence committee Tuesday morning in a closed session. Following his meeting, Stone said he had a \"frank exchange\" and described the preceding as \"an entirely political exercise.\" Stone said he denied any Russian collusion or knowledge of the hacking of John Podesta's email during the roughly three-hour closed-door session. In his testimony, Stone attacked the very lawmakers questioning him, calling out the statements of three Democrats on the panel, including ranking member Adam Schiff of California. Read More \"Multiple members of this committee have made false allegations against me in public session in order to ensure that these bogus charges received maximum media coverage,\" Stone said in his statement. \"Now, however, you deny me the opportunity to respond to these charges in the same open forum. This is cowardice.\" Stone said there were \"partisan clashes\" during the session \u2014 and he wasn't holding his breath for apologies he sought from the panel's Democrats \u2014 but he said that members were professional and courteous and he was prepared for all the questions asked. Stone said he did not answer one question that was asked about his \"intermediary\" to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Stone said that it was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist, though he added he would ask the journalist to release him from the off-the-record agreement. Schiff said after the hearing there was one area of Stone's testimony where Stone would not answer questions, and that if Stone did not cooperate the committee would need to subpoena him. Schiff wouldn't say what the area was, though it had to do with Stone's description of his intermediary. Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the panel's Russian investigation, said he agreed with Schiff that the committee needed to get the information about the intermediary from Stone. He also told reporters that Stone's comments to the media describing the hearing were \"accurate.\" Stone's meeting comes after he battled with the committee when he demanded a public hearing, which lawmakers rejected, and as the members demanded he produce public records about his contacts with Russians, which sources said he did not do. Multiple sources told CNN that Stone did not provide the committee with records about his alleged contacts with Russians, despite the panel's request. But one source familiar with the matter said that the committee asked for all public records -- and all of Stone's contacts with Russians have been released on Twitter and elsewhere. Stone had no private communications with Russians, the source said. \"We fully complied with the document request from the House on a timely basis,\" said Stone's attorney, Grant Smith. In his 47-page opening statement, which includes exhibits, Stone denied he had any collusion with the Russian state, and also says that allegations Russia was responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee were unproven. \"I understand the committee's interest in me, I use all clauses of the 1st Amendment to achieve my goals, I am out there, I am provocative and partisan, but let's be clear: I have no involvement in the alleged activities that are within the publicly stated scope of this committee's investigation -- collusion with the Russian state to affect the outcome of the 2016 election,\" Stone says. Stone's testimony Tuesday is his first before the congressional panels investigating Russian election meddling and potential collusion with the Trump team. Stone's own words have turned him into a lightning rod when it comes to the Russia investigation. He admits exchanging private messages last summer with the Twitter handle belonging to Guccifer 2.0, who had already leaked stolen documents from the Democratic National Committee. At one point, Guccifer 2.0 told Stone, \"tell me if I can help u anyhow,\" though Stone didn't appear to accept the offer. The US intelligence community now believes Guccifer 2.0 was a front for Russian operatives involved in the Kremlin's election-meddling campaign, an assessment first publicly revealed in January. During the presidential campaign last summer, Stone seemed to predict on a few occasions that WikiLeaks would soon release damaging information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He specifically alluded to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and said on a few occasions that he was in engaged in back-channel communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, which Assange has denied. Weeks later, WikiLeaks started releasing Podesta's emails -- which the US intelligence community says were stolen by Russia and handed over to the website. Stone has denied he had any advance knowledge of the Podesta email release, saying he was referring to his own research into Podesta. In his opening statement, Stone said he did not predict the hacking of Podesta's emails and that it's unproven Gufficer 2.0 is \"a Russian cut-out.\" \"I posted this at a time that my boyhood friend and colleague, Paul Manafort, had just resigned from the Trump campaign over allegations regarding his business activities in Ukraine,\" Stone said in the statement. \"I thought it manifestly unfair that John Podesta not be held to the same standard.\" Lawmakers will likely be interested to learn more about who connected Stone with Assange, who has been under scrutiny by the FBI for some time, pertaining to past leaks of classified US material. \"We want to obviously understand the nature of his relationship with Guccifer, what he knew about the release of information,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat. \"He predicted certain releases, so we're going to really want to understand the nature of that relationship and how broadly that relationship extended.\" Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, said Stone's comments predicting it would be Podesta's \"time in the barrel\" don't add up to his explanation that he didn't know the email leak was coming. \"It defies comprehension and belief all these things could have happened circumstantially,\" Quigley said. \"I'd like to see copies of his social media contacts and his phone records. He needs to say under oath that he never emailed, texted or otherwise communicated.\" One lawmaker on the panel, who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door hearing, said some panel members see Stone as the key cog to the collusion allegations, and Democrats have wanted to talk to him for months now. The lawmaker had hoped Stone's hearing would be held in public, in part due to the likelihood there would be competing narratives about what was said. \"He doesn't have access to classified information, so it's not like that part of the hearing shouldn't be open, I think, because again, he's not going to talk about classified or state secrets.\" Stone first volunteered to testify in March, and his initial date in July was postponed. Stone said he's asked the committee to immediately release a transcript from the closed-door session. \"I have again asked for immediate release of the transcripts so that there will be no confusion or misinformation about my testimony,\" Stone said in a statement earlier this month. Lawmakers want to hear testimony of potential eyewitnesses in classified settings because they say doing so publicly could undermine their investigation by tipping off other major witnesses. Stone is one of a number of officials with ties to Trump that the committee is investigating as one of several congressional panels probing Russia's election meddling and possible collusion. More recently, Stone has showcased his disdain for the US intelligence community, which he calls the \"deep state,\" by publicly dismissing their conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election. He even spread conspiracy theories about the leaked DNC emails, which were published by WikiLeaks during the Democratic convention last July. Stone claimed that a DNC staffer, who was later murdered, was responsible for the leak. No evidence has ever surfaced to back up this claim and the US intelligence community believes Russia was behind the DNC hacks and gave the emails to WikiLeaks. Stone denies participating in any collusion with the Russian government and says he is a target of the American \"deep state.\" He says his only link to Russia is that he enjoys drinking Russian vodka.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Story highlights Sessions spoke at an event hosted by a conservative group at Georgetown Law He said American universities are \"transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos\" Washington (CNN) As President Donald Trump ramps up his criticism of NFL National Anthem protests, his attorney general on Tuesday waded into a different culture war with an address to law students about free speech on college campuses. Attorney General Jeff Sessions warned of people seeking to block open discourse on campuses and said he did not see a contradiction between that robust defense of speech with Trump's sustained criticism of protests held by professional athletes. \"The President has free speech rights, too,\" Sessions said, following a speech at Georgetown University Law Center in Washington. Sessions said he agrees with Trump in opposing the protests. \"It is a big mistake to protest in that fashion,\" Sessions said, adding, \"I would condemn their actions.\" Read More He argued the players were, in effect, \"denigrating\" symbols of the US, and noted that while players wouldn't be subject to prosecution, they could expect condemnation for taking \"provocative\" actions. Sessions, after a speech calling on universities to push back against those who would seek to block controversial speakers on campus, said it is \"up to the owners\" to decide what they would allow on the football fields. \"Not a contradiction there,\" Sessions said. During the question-and-answer portion, Sessions was also asked about the time Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cut off Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren from reading a letter by Coretta Scott King to oppose Sessions' nomination. The attorney general said he believed Warren had the right to read the letter and defended the strength of debate in the US Senate. \"She certainly had the right to criticize my nomination,\" Sessions said. \"And I think she really had the right to read the letter that she was blocked, or at least temporarily blocked, from reading.\" He added, \"In general, the Senate is one of the most open forums in the history of the world\" and suggested caution before constricting any senator's speech. 'Shelter for fragile egos' In his speech, Sessions lamented American universities \"transforming into an echo chamber of political correctness and homogenous thought, a shelter for fragile egos.\" He called college administrators' giving into protesters' demands to rescind invitations for some speakers as giving into \"the heckler's veto.\" \"In other words, the school favors the heckler's disruptive tactics over the speaker's First Amendment rights,\" Sessions said. He announced the Justice Department would submit a statement of interest in a campus free speech lawsuit and said he anticipated more such moves soon. Protesters, including faculty members, lined up outside the attorney general's event at Georgetown, at one point dropping to one knee, a reference to the growing NFL National Anthem protests. Protestors taped their mouths and held signs, with one saying \"Sessions is afraid of questions\" and another reading \"why do you silence dissent but applaud hate speech?\" A row of silent protesters in black shirts stood up in the room where Sessions delivered his speech. They placed tape across their mouths and sat down. During a series of pre-submitted questions, Sessions was asked about the protests taking place. He responded that he respected everyone's views and their expression in an appropriate fashion, and again called on universities to \"push back\" against those who would seek to block speech. \"We celebrate the diversity of opinion,\" Sessions said. Violent clashes in free speech debates The debate Sessions entered has, in recent months, become a violent one. In February, on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, black-clad agitators smashed windows and hurled Molotov cocktails ahead of a planned appearance by far-right controversialist Milo Yiannopoulos. At Middlebury College in Vermont in March , protests outside the speech of a conservative political scientist devolved into a shoving match that left one professor hospitalized. Flashpoints around hot-button speakers, alongside a trend of trigger warnings and safe spaces, have fueled reputations that places of higher education are hostile to the First Amendment. More US adults surveyed by Gallup last year thought that Americans' ability to exercise their free speech rights is weaker today than 20 years ago (40%), than those who thought it was stronger (31%). Sessions has a strong interest in First Amendment protection and has discussed publicly remarking on university turbulence for months, according to a source familiar with the speech. Students and faculty members of Georgetown's law school said ahead of the event that they planned on protesting the attorney general's speech. \"I find it hypocritical for a member of the Trump administration to act as a champion for free speech while the President has consistently mocked and insulted those trying to exercise the very same rights,\" said Richard Hand, a third-year law student at the university. \"I think we understand those things without him having to tell us that, \" added third-year student Spencer McManus. \"I don't deny that he has the right to say what he wants and what he thinks -- I certainly believe that very strongly. It's the irony of him coming here.\" The law students, who helped organize a rally, point towards Trump's recent fight with NFL players who have protested civil rights abuses during National Anthem performances and the Justice Department's decision to prosecute a woman who laughed at Sessions during his confirmation hearing as examples of the hypocrisy. The woman, Desiree Fairooz, faces a November trial over charges of unlawful conduct after she rejected a plea deal offered by prosecutors earlier this year. Sessions has regularly faced small groups of protestors outside his speeches around the country, many denouncing his views on criminal justice and policing issues. A Georgetown Law spokeswoman said Monday night that the campus has \"designated protest areas for high-profile speaker events\" and that entry into the law school buildings are restricted to members of the school community and their invited guests. \"We are committed to upholding the values of academic freedom and serving as a forum for the free exchange of ideas, even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable to some,\" spokeswoman Tanya Weinberg said. Some on Monday also criticized the university's ticketing of the address, which is only open to a small group of students that have in the past signed up to attend at least one event held by its host organization. The group, the Georgetown Center for the Constitution, says it hosts programs to examine \"how best to remain faithful to the Constitution's text.\" Professor Randy Barnett, the right-leaning law professor who leads the group and is slated to speak Tuesday after Sessions, also invited students from his classes, Weinberg said. Both policies, she said, are in line with university policy \"given limited capacity.\" Sessions was met before his Georgetown appearance also with a statement signed by 44 members of the university law school faculty rebuking his remarks and saying that \"a man who fails to recognize paradigmatic violations of the First Amendment is a poor choice to speak about free speech on campuses.\" CNN's Jessica Schneider contributed to this report.

In an unusual twist in the case, the Trump administration is on opposite sides from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission -- a federal agency charged with enforcing Title VII. \nJoshua Matz, a lawyer who has has written about the issue for the Take Care law blog, said the Supreme Court will likely take up the issue. \"It's a matter of national importance, affecting employees and employers from every walk of life,\" he said. \nMost courts have rebuffed such challenges over the years, but last April, the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals broke new ground when Judge Diane Wood, a Clinton appointee writing for the majority, allowed a claim from Kimberly Hively to go forward. Hively sought to sue Ivy Tech Community College arguing that the school violated Title VII when it denied her employment based on her sexual orientation. \n\"Any discomfort, disapproval, or job decision based on the fact that the complainant -- woman or man -- dresses differently, speaks differently, or dates or marries a same-sex partner, is a reaction purely and simply based on sex,\" Wood wrote. \"That means that it falls within Title VII's prohibition against sex discrimination, if it affects employment in one of the specified ways.\" \nIn short, Wood held that claims of sexual discrimination encompass claims of discrimination based on sexual orientation because similarly situated people are treated differently solely on account of their sex. \n\"For instance,\" said Matz,\"if an employer fires a female employee because she is married to a woman, but would not fire an otherwise identical male employee married to a woman, the employee's sex is properly seen as having caused the termination.\" \nSupporters of LGBT rights call the 7th Circuit opinion a landmark decision, but critics say that that the law was not written to provide a remedy for claims of sexual orientation. \n\"The two traits are categorically distinct,\" wrote Judge Diane Sykes in a dissent. \nHively's employers have decided not to appeal the case, so it will remain on the books. But two other cases are moving forward. \nLawyers for Jameka Evans, a security guard who claims her employer, a hospital, violated Title VII by discriminating against her because of her sexual orientation lost her fight in the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals and her lawyers are asking the Supreme Court to take up her appeal. \nSeparately, on Tuesday, the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals will hear a claim brought by the estate of Donald Zarda. Zarda, a skydiving instructor, died before trial, but his estate has continued his suit. \nThe case stems back from 2010 when Zarda was an Altitude Express instructor for Rosanna Orellana. Zarda's role was to be tied to the back of Orellana, deploy the parachute and supervise the jump. According to court papers, at some point Zarda informed Orellana that he was gay. After the jump, Orellana's boyfriend learned that Zarda had disclosed his sexual orientation and called Altitude Express with various complaints about Zarda's behavior. Zarda was fired. \nThe company contended that Zarda was fired for failing to provide an enjoyable experience to customers. Zarda asserted that his actions were appropriate and he was fired because of his sexuality -- he filed a complaint with the EEOC alleging sex discrimination in violation of Title VII. \nThe case is in an unusual position as the EEOC supports Zarda, while the Justice Department is on the other side. \n\"The EEOC is not speaking for the United States,\" DOJ lawyers say in their brief. They stress that Congress did not mean Title VII to extend to claims of sexual orientations. \nComing more than two years after the Supreme Court cleared the way for same sex marriage, government lawyers note \"to be sure\" there have been \"notable changes in societal and cultural attitudes about such discrimination\" but they insist that Congress has \"consistently\" declined to amend Title VII in light of those changes. \nThey say that even changes in societal attitudes \"do not present courts with a license to rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done to implement a clear statute's policy objectives. \" \nLawyer Gregory Antollino and the LGBT rights group Lambda Legal will argue in support of Zarda's estate. \n\"If you discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, you necessarily take into account the sex of the employee,\" said Antollino. \"You can't take the 'sex' out of \"sexual orientation.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "antollino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane wood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosanna orellana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jameka evans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joshua matz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hively", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zarda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane sykes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orellana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gregory antollino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kimberly hively", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald zarda", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "supreme court by ariane de vogue", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn supreme court", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "2nd us circuit court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lambda legal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "7th circuit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "11th us circuit court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equal employment opportunity commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivy tech community college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eeoc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "7th us circuit court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T13:23:45.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36beed8852ec45be3aed5f4e4028566350740046", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls9kjErabBuPNuJhElw6G3yGGYpCxI.GAJYZRzspBtWHqcV.FswpahmnTn1ddcQjHa", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - App International Edition", "title": "Bali volcano: Waiting for signs of eruption", "title_full": "Bali volcano: Waiting for signs of eruption", "published": "2017-09-26T13:34:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926180143-01-bali-volcano-mount-agung-092617-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1233, "comments": 0, "shares": 1233}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36beed8852ec45be3aed5f4e4028566350740046", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls9kjErabBuPNuJhElw6G3yGGYpCxI.GAJYZRzspBtWHqcV.FswpahmnTn1ddcQjHa", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T13:34:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bali volcano: Waiting for signs of eruption", "text": "Bali volcano in danger of erupting 01:02 (CNN) Bali is on volcano watch amid rumblings from Mount Agung and warnings that it could erupt at any time. More than 75,000 people have now been evacuated from an exclusion zone around the volcano, which is around 70 kilometers (43 miles) north of Bali's main tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak. That's more than the number of people who live there, but others outside the zone are also fleeing to evacuation centers on the island, according to the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency. The official exclusion zone extends 12 kilometers from Mount Agung, which is based on last time the volcano erupted in 1963. People wait inside an evacuation centre in Klungkung regency, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on September 25, 2017. Then, more than 1,700 people were killed and many villages destroyed, though at that stage there was no early warning system. Around 1,700 houses on the mountain's slopes were destroyed. Read More This time, officials aren't taking any chances. Villagers have been asked to leave the exclusion zone, however visitors are being told it's still safe to go to popular tourist areas south of the volcano. Here's some advice for travelers. Should you cancel your trip? Bali is still a safe destination, according to government and airline officials. \"Denpasar City and most of the touristic destinations in Bali are safe from the eruption or dangerous impact of the eruption,\" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of Information and data of Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency, said. Travelers should stay away from the exclusion zone and check with their airline or travel agency before traveling. Will flights be affected? Aircraft have been advised to avoid the area but so far no flights have been canceled. Bali International Airport will likely be closed in the case of an eruption, but it'll depend on whether volcanic material is considered to be a hazard to flights. How close is it to holiday destinations? The most dangerous area is within the radial of 12 kilometers from the Mount Agung peak where all activities are closed -- including Pura Besakih, Bali's biggest and holiest Hindu temple located on the slopes of Mount Agung. Bali's artistic hub, the small town of Ubud, is about 50 kilometers (31 miles)from Mount Agung. Denpasar (where the airport is located) and the popular Kuta Beach are more than 63kilometers (40 miles)from the active volcano. In case of a big eruption, the danger zone could be expanded. A man monitors seismic waves at the Mount Agung monitoring station in Karangasem, September 23. How likely is an eruption? It's hard to tell, experts say. \"Even with all the signs and calculation we have today no one can tell when is the eruption will occur,\" said Surono, an expert of volcanology and former head of Indonesia Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Center. The warning level has been updated to four, the highest level on Indonesia's Volcano Activities Warning System.

Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 He added , \"The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger... But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!\" Later Tuesday morning, he continued: \"The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!\" The ratings picture is much more complicated than Trump's tweet claimed. There was a big spike in viewership for the pre-game shows on Sunday, but it's too soon to reach any conclusions about the effect of the controversy on viewership. Read More Early Nielsen ratings, which are incomplete and subject to change, showed that Sunday's games on Fox and NBC were down compared to the same week last year, but Sunday's games on CBS and \"Monday Night Football\" on ESPN were up. Overall, according to the NFL, Week 3 ratings were slightly higher than Week 3 in 2016. The biggest single broadcast, NBC's \"Sunday Night Football,\" declined about 10% from the equivalent game last year. But it's hard to say whether that was due to Trump, the anthem protests, competition from other shows or the fact that the Washington Redskins' lopsided victory over the Oakland Raiders made for a relatively unexciting matchup. The most likely answer is \"all of the above.\" More detailed viewership data for Sunday's games will come in on Tuesday. Trump entered the controversy about the NFL at a Friday night rally when he went after the league and attacked players who have been kneeling or sitting during the national anthem to draw attention to social justice issues, including police brutality. \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired,'\" Trump told a crowd in Alabama. The comments drew widespread criticism from players and team owners. Trump: NFL owners should fire players who protest the national anthem On Saturday, he called for NFL fans to boycott games unless the league fired or suspended players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, and has tweeted more than a dozen times about the matter. At a private dinner with conservative leaders Monday evening, Trump said his NFL comments have \"really caught on,\" according to an attendee, who noted the President told them, \"I said what millions of Americans were thinking.\" White House chief of staff John Kelly, however, was not pleased with the resulting firestorm over the weekend, according to two administration officials. But in a brief interview Monday evening, Kelly told CNN he is \"appalled\" by what he sees as a lack of respect for the flag and national anthem. Trump's culture wars take over American sports \"I believe every American, when the national anthem is played, should cover their hearts and think about all the men and women who have been maimed and killed,\" Kelly said. \"Every American should stand up and think for three lousy minutes.\" His son, Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010. Kelly declined to talk about the President's decision to wade into the issue. White House officials say they believe this will blow over, but did not know how long the President would keep it alive. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President's comments from the briefing room podium Monday, saying they were not intended to be divisive. \"This isn't about the President being against anyone,\" Sanders said. \"This is about the President and millions of Americans being for something\" -- like \"honoring our flag.\" The President has a jam-packed Tuesday. He receives a briefing on hurricane recovery efforts from homeland security adviser Tom Bossert, meets with bipartisan House Ways and Means Committee members, and welcomes Spanish President Mariano Rajoy before traveling to New York for a Republican National Committee fundraiser.

U.S. crude futures have increased 22% since June, a comeback that has pushed prices to around $52 a barrel. \nIt's welcome news for OPEC, which has been trying to squeeze excess supply out of the market as it recovers from a dramatic price collapse in 2014. \nThere are two major factors helping to drive crude higher: \nThreats in the Middle East \nMajor oil deposits sit beneath land in northern Iraq that is currently administered by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government. \nThe Kurds, who have long sought a country of their own, cast ballots on Monday in a controversial independence referendum. The move has angered both Turkey and Iraq. \nRecep Tayyip Erdogan, the president of Turkey, has threatened to close the pipeline that carries oil from northern Iraq to the Turkish port of Ceyhan. \n\"We have the valve. And the minute we shut it down, that's done,\" Erdogan said in a speech on Monday. \nHe returned to the theme on Tuesday, saying that military action was possible if Kurds don't back away from independence plans. Turkey has a sizable Kurdish minority population. \nThe Kurdistan region of Iraq produces around 650,000 barrels per day, 85% of which goes through Turkish pipelines, according to FXTM. \n\"If the Turks decided to cut crude flows, it would create a shock which markets are currently pricing in,\" said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. \n\"I think this is going to be only a temporary threat, given that independence will not happen overnight and OPEC members will quickly cover the shortage,\" he added. \nMarket balance \nOPEC other major suppliers agreed in November to slash their production levels in order to support prices. \nThere had been chatter that OPEC would extend the cuts beyond their current expiration date of March 2018, but that has failed to materialize. \nEven so, there are signs that the market is now coming into balance. \nOPEC said Friday that its coalition recorded its highest level of compliance to date in August. And demand is strengthening. \nThe International Energy Agency says that demand grew very strongly in the second quarter, especially in developed economies. The agency upped its demand growth estimate for 2017 to 1.6 million barrels per day. \nCNNMoney (Dubai)   26, 2017: 8:05 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hussein sayed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kurdistan regional government", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international energy agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "opec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fxtm", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east  major", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ceyhan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T15:57:51.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ab05a0f0bba94086c8933d71c39c0ce3f1163a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdqU6teyNT74F_voq9dQg__hd7i6cacH0pZCLAVqZpIxjQP1CA5HxtaByP889enYnMg-", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Lauren Williams named editor in chief of Vox; Ezra Klein to be editor at large", "title_full": "Lauren Williams named editor in chief of Vox; Ezra Klein to be editor at large - Sep. 26, 2017", "published": "2017-09-26T16:52:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170926071419-ezra-klein-vox-white-house-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 190, "comments": 0, "shares": 190}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 219}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ab05a0f0bba94086c8933d71c39c0ce3f1163a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdqU6teyNT74F_voq9dQg__hd7i6cacH0pZCLAVqZpIxjQP1CA5HxtaByP889enYnMg-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian Stelter", "published": "2017-09-26T16:52:00.000+03:00", "title": "Lauren Williams named editor in chief of Vox; Ezra Klein to be editor at large", "text": "Lauren Williams named editor in chief of Vox; Ezra Klein to be editor at large by Brian Stelter @brianstelter September 26, 2017: 8:52 AM ET Ezra Klein, who founded Vox three years ago, is handing off the editor in chief reins to his deputy Lauren Williams. Klein said the editor job has been one of the \"great thrills and honors of my life,\" but \"I feel a deep need to be out reporting on this political era, and to be working directly on the projects we're launching next year.\" Those projects include a daily podcast and a fresh push into television programming. \nThe leadership transition was officially announced on Tuesday.

Allison Rockey, the site's director of programming, will succeed her as executive editor. \n\"In Lauren and Allison, Vox has amazing leaders ready to guide our future and build our organization,\" Klein told CNNMoney. \nHis new title will be editor-at-large. \"So proud of @ezraklein for firing himself!\" his wife Annie Lowrey quipped on Twitter Tuesday morning. \nVox bills itself as a destination for explanatory journalism.

It's really caught on,\" Trump reportedly told the assembled conservatives. \"I said what millions of Americans were thinking.\" Ratings. Booing. Great anger. Really caught on. Read More Trump's decision to start this feud with NFL players -- and professional athletes more broadly -- is a telling window into how he views (and uses) the power of the presidency: To divide, not to unite. To forever focus on scoring political points, to please and placate the political base that helped elect him to the White House. To always, always, always look for where we disagree -- and where those disagreements can be exploited for his own gain. That is, at root, a fundamental departure from the way that previous presidents have operated. Every man to hold the White House prior to Trump seemed to have an innate grasp of the power of the presidency and how to use it. Think of the presidency like a lighthouse. Anywhere a president chooses to shine that light will be illuminated. It will drive attention to it and media coverage of it. The bully pulpit may not be as bully-ish as it once was, but when the president prioritizes an issue, it becomes an issue that people and the press can't ignore. Trump keeps up clash with NFL, claims ratings are 'way down' For most presidents, that means shining a light on our common humanity -- whether it's helping bind the country together after a terrorist attack or a natural disaster or the more mundane daily work of reminding people that much more unites us than divides us. Trump has inverted that. He seems bent on reminding us on what divides us rather than what unites us. In the midst of what the governor of Puerto Rico has said is a crisis of epic proportions caused by Hurricane Maria, Trump has stayed largely silent on the matter -- breaking that silence only to tweet about the country's \"broken infrastructure & massive debt.\" Instead of rallying the country behind the 3.4 million American citizens who live in Puerto Rico, Trump has instead sent more than a dozen tweets about the NFL and the alleged lack of patriotism demonstrated by players who kneel or sit during the National Anthem. Cillizza: What Steve Mnuchin gets totally wrong about free speech (Worth noting here: The origin of the anthem protests was the violence against black men by police officers. It had -- and has -- absolutely nothing to do with dishonoring our military or the flag.) Why? Because Trump has a finely-tuned ear for what will resonate with his political base. And casting himself as the voice of the people against rich, entitled and primarily black athletes -- yes, of course, race is tied up in this -- is a strong place to be for some not-small element of his base. Whether he wants to admit it to himself or not, Trump is purposely playing on lingering racial resentment and animus in the country to remind people of what divides us. And he is doing so because he knows it will work. It's the same reason he suggested he saw Muslims celebrating on New Jersey rooftops on September 11, 2001. And the same reason he failed to condemn white supremacist David Duke for days during the campaign. And why he sought to cast the white supremacist protests in Charlottesville as the result of violent people \"on many sides.\" Trump ran as a divider, not a uniter. He won that way -- offering safe harbor for people who had long resented politicians who told them they had to accept those who didn't look like them, sound like them or think like them. Divisiveness works in politics -- especially in a fractured media environment in which you can spend your life never being confronted with a reasonable argument that clashes with your worldview and in a self-sorted America in which we live, work and play around only people who agree with us on, well, everything. Casting people who disagree with you as \"other\" -- and ensuring \"other\" = bad -- made for a winning political strategy for Trump. But, winning isn't an end in and of itself. Or any sort of legacy. Cillizza: 4 reasons Trump thinks NFL players are a good target (and 1 big reason he's wrong) The key -- for Trump and for any other winners out there -- is what you do once you grab the brass ring. Past presidents understood that the campaign was one thing and governing was another. That being president bestowed on you the responsibility of always trying to take the high road, always doing the right thing for the country rather than the best thing for your party or yourself. Trump has flipped that approach on its head. He does what's good for him first, then what he believes to be good for the GOP and, finally, what's good for the country. That's what \"modern day presidential\" means to Trump. And it's what is driving divisions in this country to dangerous levels.

He really pounded him.\" On tax reform, Trump offered some marketing advice for the attendees at the dinner. \"Just call it tax cuts,\" Trump said, arguing that's how to explain the issue to everyday Americans. \"It sounds convoluted\" when you call it tax reform, the person at the dinner Quote: d Trump as saying.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T16:03:10.037+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fd11993920a7c636860944fef6022e894393b94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4IN_FCRRkIdRR8r_wbQ2zvR9P0ZifNcD9rRq_0x5qlVeRYVcFsew3eNBUdHf5MtLxnSi__lKYk8_Jiaoq7mg5TymRfefIpg05cm", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "San Juan Mayor: You don't put debt over people", "title_full": "San Juan Mayor: You don't put debt over people", "published": "2017-09-26T15:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170923181250-puerto-rico-maria-aftermath-nick-paton-walsh-pkg-00015406-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 549, "comments": 0, "shares": 549}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fd11993920a7c636860944fef6022e894393b94", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4IN_FCRRkIdRR8r_wbQ2zvR9P0ZifNcD9rRq_0x5qlVeRYVcFsew3eNBUdHf5MtLxnSi__lKYk8_Jiaoq7mg5TymRfefIpg05cm", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T15:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "San Juan Mayor: You don't put debt over people", "text": "MUST WATCH San Juan mayor: You don't put debt over people San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz responds to President Trump's tweets on the devastation in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "carmen yulin cruz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T16:03:40.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4d221b7b6ba0f3ccb51d66fec1c1b64b70ef577f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeT76mbZMDHYq84IAJAkoU_rY7mA8gkxmfwhiOvnDgnpyUvmo8WyZLHIBcy1kfUkL.DTey5XK578w", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "They regret voting for Trump", "title_full": "They regret voting for Trump", "published": "2017-09-26T15:35:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926080306-trump-voter-panel-2-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3664, "comments": 0, "shares": 3664}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4d221b7b6ba0f3ccb51d66fec1c1b64b70ef577f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeT76mbZMDHYq84IAJAkoU_rY7mA8gkxmfwhiOvnDgnpyUvmo8WyZLHIBcy1kfUkL.DTey5XK578w", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T15:35:00.000+03:00", "title": "They regret voting for Trump", "text": "MUST WATCH Man on Trump vote: What did I do?

Mark Walker, who chairs the largest conservative caucus in the House, says that the deafening roar from the GOP base is: \"Get something done.\" Republicans need to carry out their promises on Obamacare, tax reform and border security, he says Mark Walker is the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus in the House of Representatives with over 150 members. He is also the representative for North Carolina's sixth district. his.\n(CNN) More than 50 bills have been signed into law by President Trump, but there is a unified voice that is loud and clear arriving daily from the base. \"Get something done\" is the deafening roar.\nIt's not that nothing has been done on the Hill. However, the American people are not enthralled with what we've accomplished so far. To this point, we've come up short and our voters have every right to demand not just the goals but the strategy and the action steps to fulfill these past promises. We can parse the meaning of the 2016 election all we want, but one thing is clear: it was a mandate election. Republicans need to remember the corollary to any mandate: if you do not deliver, voters will find others who will. I know that this message was clear to my colleagues during the August district work period. Even supporters and friends are confused at why the significant items we promised have not been written into law. Why single payer health care is a terrible option I am confident that the American people will deliver their final grade on Republicans over the next three months based on three things: repealing and replacing Obamacare, passing tax reform, and increasing border security. If Republicans cannot achieve results on these endeavors, do we deserve our majorities in both houses? Read More The group which I lead, the Republican Study Committee, is renewing these promises to the American people. We are calling on all Republicans in Congress and the White House to do the same. We must deliver before the calendar reads 2018. Repeal Obamacare Obamacare should be the easiest of the three. After all, the House of Representatives voted more than 50 times to repeal the law that destroyed our health insurance markets through skyrocketing premiums and fewer options. If we cannot deliver anything on Obamacare, Republicans are guilty of false promises and political malpractice. To be fair, the House already did our job in passing the American Health Care Act this year. We must continue to push for repeal, including dismantling the most damaging aspects of the law like the individual mandate, employer mandate, medical device tax, and the provision that gives employers an incentive to use part time workers rather than hire full timers. We should also pass common-sense replacement policies, like expanding how much money employees can contribute to their health savings accounts (HSAs) and selling insurance across state lines, which would increase competition. We have just a few days before Mitch McConnell's September 30th deadline to enact health care changes with a 51- rather than 60-vote majority in the Senate and the Graham-Cassidy bill is in trouble, but regardless of whether Congress can come to a solution in that time, we cannot turn our backs on our promise to the American people. On health care, let's do the impossible Fixing Obamacare is not an option. We cannot pass any type of \"stabilization\" package that only cements this horrific legislation further. Obamacare repeal and replace is not merely a political goal. There are Americans suffering immensely from this broken law, and we have a moral obligation to act by replacing it with patient-centered health care that prioritizes quality of care over anything else. Tax reform is a must Tax reform is another must-pass item before the end of the year. After years of stagnant growth due to ever-expanding government and regulations during the Obama years, our economy needs a jumpstart, and tax reform is the solution. Tax reform needs to be pro-growth, comprehensive, and permanent. We need our tax code to let Americans keep more of their paycheck and give companies an advantage compared to their overseas competitors. We need to show the world once again that America is a place where businesses can thrive. Border security In a time of increased threats to our national security by those that will do us harm, President Trump ran on a simple idea: border security. Securing our southern border is a must-do for Congress -- we cannot idly sit by while our nation's laws are flagrantly ignored, allowing potentially dangerous individuals to enter the United States with zero repercussions. Democrats try time and time again to have an immigration \"fix\" now and secure the border later. We cannot fall into this trap again. We need a real fix to our immigration challenge, not a band-aid that exacerbates the problem. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nWhile Republicans need to channel our legislative efforts into a long-term solution focusing on border security first, keeping America secure does not end at our borders.

It creeps up on lifelong homebodies, blossoms in the hearts of grumpy teenagers and pushes those who \"can't afford it\" out the door, bank accounts be damned. Because traveling the world is for everyone that means that none of us should be surprised to hear thatthose on the autism spectrum get itchy feet, too. When thinking about travel it's important to understand that autism isn't a monolithic diagnosis. \"Autism is a diverse disability and everyone's needs are different,\" says Zoe Gross, director of operations at the Autistic Self Advocacy Network . Autism, as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is \"a developmental disability that causes social communication and behavioral challenges.\" An estimated one in 68 children are affected, with the rate higher in boys than girls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . Depending on personality, where they are on the autism spectrum, and how their particular disability manifests, each autistic traveler will have different needs and challenges. Some might be physical, others might be cognitive, or a mix of the two. Examples include trouble dealing with unexpected routine changes; finding acceptable food; sensory issues with loud spaces or bright lights; and physical disabilities from minor to significant. \"Travel with service animals might be hard especially in other countries where they have different rules for animals,\" says Gross. And of course, just like anyone, autistic travelers will have varying interests, passions and bucket-lists. Travel can be especially onerous for people on the spectrum -- but it can be especially enriching, too. Making the world more connected \"Travel is often topic-oriented, so, for example, if someone is interested in history and historical sites and they have difficulty with abstraction, seeing what they've learned about in real life can be really meaningful and rewarding,\" says Gross. \"For someone who enjoys languages, which some autistic people do, that can be exciting too,\" she says. Even though new experiences and routines can be tough to navigate, autistic travelers might find the planning and organizing aspect of a trip to be really enjoyable, in a way that most others might find annoying or tiresome. Another foreign travel benefit: It can be particularly relaxing to those autistic people who find navigating their own culture exhausting. Jennifer Malia is an English professor at Norfolk State University in Virginia who writes and publishes stories as Mom with Autism . She traveled both before and since her diagnosis with autism spectrum disorder, and she says she often feels more comfortable abroad than at home. \"No one expects you to be completely familiar with cultural norms or to speak perfectly in foreign languages when you're abroad,\" says Malia. \"This made it easier for me to communicate as an autistic woman.\" Gross backs up the idea: \"Some countries have easier cultural norms for people with autism. You can relax, because if you need several tries to understand something, people understand because you're a tourist.\" With some minor adjustments, museums, hotels, flying, and even activities can be enjoyed by adults and kids on the autism spectrum. See below for some of the smartest ideas: Flying The tight spaces, strange noises, and general unpleasantness of flying can be a perfect storm for those with an autism spectrum disorders. It doesn't help that the general public can perceive common autistic behaviors to deal with that discomfort (like hand-flapping, vocalizations or pacing) as dangerous or disruptive. In 2015 a United Airlines plane was diverted and parents traveling with their 15-year-old autistic daughter were kicked off a flight. Flying is a particular challenge as it's not really something that can be understood or practiced in advance, which is one of the best ways for autistic people to prepare for new situations. READ: Preparing to fly with kids with autism That's why for the past four years, Autism Speaks has worked with JetBlue on Blue Horizons for Autism, a travel program that allows people with autism to practice the full airport experience. \"At Blue Horizons events, we work with JetBlue, TSA and airport personnel to make the experience as realistic as possible. Guests check in at the ticket counter, receive real boarding passes with seat assignments, and go through the full TSA security screening where all of the usual rules apply,\" says Alexandra Watters, director of family services projects and content at Autism Speaks. Practice boarding the plane and even taxiing around the tarmac helps autistic travelers work through their particular challenges, with trained airline employees and volunteers on hand to help. More than 3,000 people in 11 cities have already participated, with more planned for the fall. The TSA also has a separate program, Wings for Autism, that is similar -- a run-through that focuses on the oft-disturbing security protocols and travel too. READ: The world's worst places to be a disabled traveler Museums Museums can be particularly interesting to autistic people for the variety of learning opportunities they can provide: \"in a museum, learning can be verbal or nonverbal; hands-on or hands-off; fast or slow; social or solitary; loud or quiet; directed or inquiry-based. \"In a museum, lack of verbal skills need not stand in the way of discovery, learning, or passion. Lack of social skills need not stand in the way of achievement,\" writes Lisa Jo Rudy on the Autism in the Museum blog, a \"clearinghouse of best practices [...] about making museums welcoming and inclusive for people with autism and their families.\" Some museums provide prep and sensory-specific details for attendees with autism, such as New York City 's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has six social narratives for visits. These are \"printouts written in simple languages with pictures that list out the steps for visiting [...] so people can look at it and practice it in their heads,\" says Gross. The Met also provides a sensory map that shows busier and quieter areas, displays with low-light and areas with natural light, all superimposed over a map of exhibits. Preparing in advance means fewer surprises about lights and sounds, knowledge of quiet spots, and a better experience. Many other museums provide similar details, or have special programs, like the Dallas Museum of Art, the Intrepid Museum, the Boston Children's Museum and more. Places to stay Independent travel agents such as ASD Vacations , A Million Senses , and The Guided Tour specialize in hotels for autistic people or parents with kids on the autism spectrum. They can be a great resource since agents are familiar with floor plans, resort or hotel amenities, types of rooms, and will be more able to answer specific questions. Some resorts welcome autistic travelers specifically: Tradewinds Resort in St. Petersburg, Florida is one of five that has been designated \"autism friendly\" by the Center for Autism and Related Disabilities (CARD). To qualify, employees underwent CARD's training program. Beaches resorts, with locations throughout the Caribbean, also offer families with children with autism specialized activities, services and custom dining options via their autism-friendly kids' camps . Launched in June 2015, Accomable is an Airbnb-style service for people with disabilities of all kinds. The co - founder of the site, Srin Madipalli , loved to travel but, as a wheelchair-user, he hated how much prep work he had to do to ensure he would be able to access places to stay. The site now has more than 1,000 listings in more than 60 countries, all searchable by price, location, type of space and accessibility. \"I want our users to have a wide range of genuine choices and be able to build any kind of travel experience they want, irrespective of their background or physical ability,\" says Madipalli. Though its searchable features focus on physical disability, not sensory sensitivities -- it's not built specifically for autistic people -- they or their caregivers could find it useful depending on needs. READ: Can Accomable revolutionize disability travel? Theme parks While they can be high-stimulation, which some with autism seek to avoid, plenty of autistic kids and kids-at-heart have a theme park high on their travel wish-lists: A number have programs to make the long days a little easier for both adults and children. READ: Inspired by daughter, dad builds water park for people with disabilities Disney is seen as a leader: Their parks and resorts have a comprehensive program that includes attraction details with information about lights, sounds, smells, bumps and surprises; special assistance to those with light and sound sensitivity; passes so there's less standing on line; and dozens of break areas in the parks. Great America and Six Flags parks also have skip-the-line ticketing and other assistance, and the latter's Great Escape location also has an Autism Awareness Day (actually multiple days). Legoland in Florida has worked with Autism Speaks to be super-supportive of sensory challenges, and every staff member has been trained to understand special needs. Some smaller parks, such as the shady, nature-filled Dollywood in Tennessee, area less hectic choice generally, and they also have a calming room on-site, and railroad-themed Edaville Family Theme Park (an hour outside Boston), has a specially designed quiet bathroom and other amenities. Cruises Autism on the Seas has been working with Royal Caribbean International since 2007. They specially staff cruises throughout the year on popular lines including Royal Caribbean, Celebrity, Norwegian, Disney and Carnival Cruise Lines. In addition to being able to board early, educated, trained, and background-checked staff accompany cruisers and allow guests to use the ship's facilities and entertainments in an \"accommodated and assisted manner.\" They also have lower-touch programs available for more experienced or independent travelers.

At Copper Mountain Resort in Breckenridge, Colorado, autistic kids can try an adaptive skiing lesson, which includes equipment rental and a lift ticket. Some golf and swim centers also have similar programs. Adults and kids can decorate ceramics at autism painting events that are designed for smaller groups and feature lower lights. You can check out other ideas at the Autism Friendly Events page at Autism Speaks, which includes events in many cities throughout the US. \"Normally, I crave routines and like to know what to expect, so sometimes it's difficult to have the courage to travel somewhere new without knowing what it will be like,\" says Malia. The travel bug doesn't care what you look like or about what other people think of your choices -- when it bites, you're bitten. Malia loves seeing the world, having gone on safari in Kenya, hiked a Costa Rican rainforest and snorkeled with sharks in the United Arab Emirates. And now other travelers like her have a little extra assistance to go even further.

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan . his own.\n(CNN) The painful debate about the causes and cures for racial injustice in America flares periodically to capture the nation's attention. It did again over the weekend when many NFL players locked arms or knelt in protest during the playing of the National Anthem at football games across the country.\nThe protests were triggered by President Donald Trump's comments at an Alabama rally on Friday and subsequent tweets challenging the patriotism of athletes who kneel during the playing of the anthem. He suggested that these \"son of a \" athletes had dishonored the flag and deserve to be fired by their NFL employers. On Monday the President defended his attacks, even after team owners issued their own angry responses to his temper tantrum. This conflict has stirred impassioned debate around the nation about larger questions: the right to protest peacefully in a manner that many Americans, nonetheless, perceive as a form of disrespect for the flag or our troops, and the concern held by many that our President was focused on a few protesting football players instead of on the North Korean crisis, health care or Puerto Rico's recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Trump's ugly battles with the NFL go way back One often-heard, but inaccurate, refrain among the talking heads was that the athletes had a \"legal right\" to peacefully protest in football stadiums across the country because the US Constitution guarantees freedom of speech. \"It's a free country\" this line of thinking goes, and American soldiers have fought and lost their lives to preserve this sacred right. The fact is, these athletes do not have the \"right\" to protest at football games unless their employers consent to the conduct. Their private employers have a legal right under the US Constitution to fire or suspend players who engage in acts of protest on the field during the playing of the National Anthem and the display of Old Glory. Imagine what would happen if some of the TV anchors or commentators decided to \"take a knee\" during their shows in an act of protest. Read More My bet is that in most places they would be fired or suspended -- as would protesting bank tellers, store clerks, security guards, restaurant workers or anyone else with a job to do. As an attorney, I would likely be held in contempt of court if I interrupted my presentation to a judge to protest racial injustice in America by kneeling. Finally, a reason to watch the NFL again Yes, America is a \"free country,\" whose citizens enjoy greater liberty and \"freedom of speech\" than any place on Earth, but even here there are limitations to these rights. The courts have repeatedly affirmed restrictions on time and place in the legitimate exercise of our Constitutional rights. Try shouting your opposition to the Trump administration during a Broadway show and see what happens. You'll have to ask a friend how the show ended. You can explain your inaccurate concept of free speech as the usher throws you out of the theater. The First Amendment of the US Constitution outlines both the extent and limitation of our most important rights. It states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" Notice the words \"Congress shall make no law...\" The Founding Fathers made no mention of restricting the right of the National Football League or any other private employer to \"prohibit\" or \"abridge\" the freedom of speech. Colin Kaepernick should please take notice of the wording the next time he claims that his right to protest was violated when no team would sign him after he became a free agent. He had no \"on the field\" free speech rights under the Constitution. Perhaps he should consider registering to vote if he really wants to change public policy. What Trump's NFL, Curry remarks should signal to his base The First Amendment restricts only the government from abridging \"the freedom of speech.\" Private employers can do as they please. Thus, kneeling during the National Anthem can never be legally prohibited by the government, but can always be prohibited by private employers. NFL owners have so far made no attempt to create a league-wide rule on the matter of these protests. Much will undoubtedly depend on how the controversy affects ticket sales and whether the President continues to stir the pot with early morning tweets. A Reuters poll conducted last year when Kaepernick's protest methodology was a hot topic suggested that 72% of Americans viewed Colin Kaepernick's protest actions as \"unpatriotic,\" despite his stated rationale. The same poll, however, concluded that only 40% of minorities disagreed with the Kaepernick's form of protest, suggesting a big racial divide on the issue -- and potentially among sports fans as well. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nWhichever side of the issue is a winner for sports fans, they should be clear about one thing. America may be a \"free country\" but the Constitution takes no position on the actions of professional athletes staging protests on the field. The matter of cheering them, booing them or firing them has been left entirely in the hands of the fans and team owners.

(CNN) The latest reporting regarding the scope of attempted Russian cyber-interference in the 2016 presidential election suggests election officials made a mistake in ending efforts to recount the contest in key states. Those recounts offered the best opportunity to identify and resolve issues that are now coming to light. We should study our errors to avoid repeating them -- and to make sure recounts in the future are better at detecting hacking and other threats. Post-election efforts to recount the 2016 presidential vote did not get far. For example, the Michigan recount was shut down after just three days ; a federal judge rejected a request to recount paper ballots in Pennsylvania; and while Wisconsin did conduct a recount, in many counties, officials neglected to hand-count paper ballots and did not examine vulnerable software in electronic voting machines. Norman Eisen Just as Donald Trump continues to resist the finding that Russia manipulated our democratic process, he furiously contested the need to investigate the vote. His campaign and the Republican Party engaged in court battles to block the recounts in all three states. The exact outcome varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but the bottom line was the same. While no one should yet jump to the conclusion that Russian efforts to manipulate the vote were successful in changing its outcome, the risks were, in retrospect, sufficient to merit heightened scrutiny. We knew that the Russians had engaged in untoward activity. We were aware, too, that American elections are not as secure as they should be. Read More One clear area of vulnerability then and now is our reliance on electronic voting machines and vote tabulating machines without conducting any meaningful post-election audits. Like any other technology, these devices can fail in unexpected ways. They can have bugs that might produce an incorrect result. When irregularities occur in an election -- such as the approximately 84,000 ballots in Michigan on which there were reportedly no selections marked for president -- we need to see if an error is to blame. The truth about a cyber Pearl Harbor What's worse, according to Verified Voting, a organization that advocates for transparency in elections, in America, almost a quarter of voting machines do not leave a paper record of votes cast -- meaning that if a glitch or error occurs, there are no physical votes to cross-check. They effectively vanish just as they are cast. That's why these machines are banned in many states and elsewhere around the world, including in Germany . Indeed, it has been shown repeatedly that our voting machines are vulnerable to being hacked. Election security experts agree that the task would not be difficult for hackers who are sufficiently skilled and motivated. That's why the hackers made headlines in the run-up to the 2016 election -- and continue to do so today. They targeted the election-related computer systems of at least 21 states and, according to a declassified US intelligence report, \"obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state or local electoral boards.\" We now know hackers successfully breached at least three providers of critical election services, and that hackers broke into a registration database in Illinois, downloading close to 90,000 voter files . Like it or not, the threat from hackers is going to be a part of our electoral landscape for the foreseeable future. These hackers could come from anywhere. They could be thrill-seeking teens powered by adrenaline and Red Bull and furiously clattering away on their keyboards,or \"someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds,\" as Trump famously speculated in a presidential debate. They could conceivably be corrupt American partisans seeking to distort outcomes to favor their chosen candidate. Or, as we have seen , they could be professional cyberwarfare experts deployed on behalf of a hostile nation's interests. How courts put the brakes on Texas voter discrimination Of course, it was understandable that after such a protracted campaign, many wished to simply move on. A recount runs counter to the emotional need to close the door on 2016's bitter election and look to the future. But we cannot be complacent about our democracy. Sure, recounts are burdensome -- both because of the bureaucratic hurdles that state systems have erected and because requests for them get bogged down in partisan courts. But they are regrettably necessary at times. 2016 was one of those times. The 2004 Ohio recount of the presidential vote, initiated by the Libertarians and the Green Party, illustrated why recounts can be worth the trouble. It did not change the result: George W. Bush still won the state and, in turn, the White House. But it did uncover serious problems with the voting process -- including erroneously disqualified ballots and broken machines -- and eventually resulted in convictions and jail time for two local election officials. The 2004 recount was vital to protecting American democracy. It exposed the flaws during that vote and sent a message that those who abuse our electoral system will be punished. Although I am a Democrat who served as an election protection lawyer for the Kerry campaign in 2004, I was proud to act as co-lead counsel for the Ohio recount for those very reasons. Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Going forward in future elections, we must make our electoral system more secure. We have to ensure that recount efforts aren't so messy and time consuming. Universal paper ballot-based systems across the country and regular checks designed to spot unusual results -- known as risk-limiting audits -- are critical to restore public confidence in our voting system. Until then, our system remains deeply vulnerable to errors and attacks. And without recounts we might never know they have happened. Americans' trust in our system of governance is already too low. It turns out that our failure to conduct thorough recounts made it worse. Until we take decisive measures to rebut the threat from unreliable machines and hackers, we are actively allowing doubt over the integrity of our elections to multiply. America cannot afford this level of uncertainty. Until our elections are safer and more secure, recounts are sometimes necessary to show that our system works. We missed that opportunity in 2016. Let's not repeat the same mistake going forward.

The credit reporting bureau announced Smith's sudden retirement on Tuesday, three weeks after it disclosed that the hack had compromised the personal information of as many as 143 million Americans. \nSmith, 57, had been CEO for 12 years. His retirement is effective immediately and he won't receive a bonus for this year. \n\"At this critical juncture, I believe it is in the best interests of the company to have new leadership to move the company forward,\" Smith said in a statement. \nEquifax said all decisions on what money or benefits Smith is owed will be delayed until after the board completes an independent review into the breach and the company's response. \nThe company still faces an investigation from the Federal Trade Commission and a hearing before Congress next week. An Equifax spokeswoman said Smith is still scheduled to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on October 4. \nEquifax ( EFX ) is one three major companies that track the credit histories of almost all Americans and sell that sensitive information to banks, credit card companies and other clients. \nThe breach left its customers -- who never signed up for the service in the first place -- feeling helpless and vulnerable to identify theft . The company's response made things even worse. \nRelated: How the Equifax data breach happened \nEquifax learned of the hack in late July but only disclosed it September 7. Equifax at first couldn't say whose data had been breached, and it initially asked customers to give up their right to sue the company in exchange for credit monitoring services. \nIt set up a web domain to host customer service complaints, then repeatedly linked to a fake phishing site on its social media page. \nAnd three Equifax executives sold large chunks of stock after the company learned about the hack but before it went public. The company has said those executives did not know about the breach. \nSmith apologized in USA Today on September 13 and called it \"the most humbling moment\" in Equifax's history. \nSmith, who had also served as chairman, isn't leaving the company completely. Equifax said he agreed to serve as an \"unpaid adviser\" to assist in the CEO transition. \n\"The cybersecurity incident has affected millions of consumers, and I have been completely dedicated to making this right,\" Smith said. \nMark Feidler, an Equifax board member, was tapped to take over as the company's non-executive chairman. \n\"The Board remains deeply concerned about and totally focused on the cybersecurity incident,\" Feidler said in a statement. \"Speaking for everyone on the Board, I sincerely apologize.\" \nRelated: Equifax CEO's quiet $70 million stock profit \nEquifax said it has launched a search for a new CEO to guide it through what is likely to be a turbulent period. In the meantime, the company has tapped Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., an executive from its Asia Pacific division, to serve as interim CEO. \nEquifax's board also formed a special committee to focus on the breach and ensure \"all appropriate actions are taken.\" \nSmith isn't the only one out of a job. Equifax previously announced the retirements of its top security and information executives. \nBut those departures weren't enough to put out the firestorm, nor ease nervousness on Wall Street. As much as one-third of Equifax's market value vanished after the breach was disclosed. Equifax stock fell 1% further on Tuesday after the management shake-up. \nSmith has built a fortune with his Equifax holdings. Just since the start of 2016, Smith has netted $68.9 million by selling Equifax stock, a CNNMoney analysis found. His remaining shares are still worth about $28 million. \n--CNNMoney's Chris Isidore and Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report. \nCNNMoney (New York)   26, 2017: 9:09 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "matt egan", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "richard smith", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rego barros jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paulino", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal trade commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia pacific", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T16:33:32.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc4e455c78fc84d911eda496b7fa392769c4f1bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeZLYaFSJPP50oLHzR0JSPzzIu9EhholEbQSbUGVcFn6Rq5o0xmN8FAonWLONXkTgVNKajrICAFbB", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Voters break with Trump on NFL tweets", "title_full": "Voters break with Trump on NFL tweets", "published": "2017-09-26T16:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926092051-trump-voter-2-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 275, "comments": 0, "shares": 275}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc4e455c78fc84d911eda496b7fa392769c4f1bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INV86ItrMrxdfAbz5ybrNmeZLYaFSJPP50oLHzR0JSPzzIu9EhholEbQSbUGVcFn6Rq5o0xmN8FAonWLONXkTgVNKajrICAFbB", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T16:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Voters break with Trump on NFL tweets", "text": "MUST WATCH Voters break with Trump on NFL tweets Trump voters disagree with the President's attacks on NFL players for kneeling in protest during the National Anthem.

The Brazilian and teammate Edinson Cavani argued publicly on the pitch over who should take a penalty in this month's 2-0 win over Lyon and reportedly the Uruguayan international shouted \"do you really think you're Messi!?\" when he first walked into the changing room. PSG has also been forced to deny claims that club president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, offered Cavani a $1.2 million bonus to hand over the penalty-taking duties to Neymar. \"It's a team sport but every player's ego will kick in at a certain point,\" says Okocha who played 84 games and scored 12 goals for PSG after moving from Turkish club Fenerbah\u00e7e. \"Cavani has been taking penalties but I think it's negotiable.

That's not completely true by Frank Pallotta @frankpallotta September 26, 2017: 10:17 AM ET How Trump is changing sports coverage President Trump tweeted Tuesday morning that they NFL ratings \"are way down.\" The numbers for the league's most recent games say otherwise. The overall overnight ratings for the NFL's week 3 games were up 3% compared to the same week last year, according to Nielsen data. That increase includes a \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Arizona Cardinals that nabbed a 9.3 overnight rating for ESPN, up a whopping 63% over last year's New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons game, which brought in a 5.7. (To come up with overnight ratings, Nielsen takes the percentage of households watching in 56 U.S. markets and comes up with an overnight average -- so a 9.3 means that 9.3% of households in those 56 markets tuned into the game on ESPN on Monday night.) \nRelated: Early ratings for the NFL are down again, but maybe not because of President Trump \nNow, it should be noted that those numbers come with two major asterisks. \nThe first is that the Cowboys are arguably the most popular and watched team in the league, and almost any game featuring them is likely to do better than almost any other. \nThe second is that the overnight ratings for this week's Monday night game basically had to go up compared to last year's, which was competing with the first presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, and as a result brought in the program's lowest viewership in at least the past 25 years. \nTrump has been at war with the NFL over the past few days beginning with a firestorm he started on Friday night when he went after the league and attacked players who have been kneeling or sitting during the national anthem to draw attention to social justice issues. \nOn Tuesday morning, Trump tweeted that \"Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!\" \nIf Trump was talking about NFL ratings generally, and not this week, he was at least partially right in two ways. The NFL's ratings have fallen over the past two years, though that has happened for a number of reasons not related to the anthem protests, and the overnight ratings for the pregame shows on Sunday were way up -- though that was likely more about people tuning in to see discussion about the issue than about watching the anthem ceremonies themselves.

Passengers hoping to escape the devastation have packed the main terminal, which has noair conditioning since it's running on limited emergency power. The conditions were intolerable, said David Mannasmith, an Ohio insurance adjustor who works surveying areas hit by natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes. He and his wife Amber were in Puerto Rico for their third anniversary. \nThey rode Maria out at their resort and left for the airport Friday morning hoping to come home. Instead, they spent four days there, sleeping on hard floors, with little food and water -- and heat and humidity that made it feel like it was over 100 degrees. \nRelated: Apocalyptic' devastation in Puerto Rico, and little help in sight \n\"There was one vendor that was open, selling bottled water, very limited food,\" he said. \"Everything was operating on a cash only basis. Fortunately we had taken out a lot of cash. A lot of people, some with small children, were running out of cash.\" \nMannasmith said he was told several times he and his wife would be able to get on the next flight only to lose out. Finally on Monday morning they got on a flight to Miami. \n\"We were drenched by the time we reached the plane. The air conditioning was the best part,\" he said. He said he felt bad for all the other passengers left behind. \n\"There are people we stood on line with for four days, and they're still there,\" he said. \"And they're getting no help.\" \nThere are a limited number of flights in and out of the island because of damage to radar and other equipment, airport authorities told CNNMoney. On Monday there were only 10 commercial flights between San Juan and the mainland United States, with 10 more scheduled for Tuesday, \nAirlines have started flying larger than normal planes to handle as many passengers as possible on the few flights that can get in and out. \nAuthorities hope to resume international flights on Wednesday. They had originally aimed to do so on Monday. \nAt the same time, many more military, charter and relief operation jets are also flying in and out of the airport, according to the FAA. \nCommercial airlines are operating many of those relief flights, carrying tons of needed supplies, including bottled water and non-perishable food, medicine, blankets, cots, electrical generators and blood for the Red Cross. \nAnd they are sending volunteers to help with relief and recovery, many of whom are airline employees with family on the island. \nUnited and Southwest Airlines said they are only operating humanitarian relief flights in and out of the island -- no passenger flights. United's flights have carried 50 pallets of blankets and other supplies for the Red Cross, and nearly 40 tons of water, food, diapers, rope, tarps, and 50 power generators. The relief flights are returning with as many people as they can get on the plane, United said. \nBut conditions in the airport are very difficult. Airlines are having difficultyprinting out boarding passes that fliers need to go through TSA checkpoints and board flights. \nTSA said that some of its equipment has been damaged by the storms, so some screening is being done by hand. The TSA said it is bringing in about 1,100 staff members to work in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and other areas affected by the hurricanes that have slammed U.S. territories over the past month. It said 500 of those employees will deal with the more time consuming screening procedures, with the rest assisting in relief efforts. It is advising that passengers allow two hours for screening. \nHurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on Wednesday, Sept. 20, two weeks after Hurricane Irma hit the islands before battering Florida. Late last month, Hurricane Harvey caused widespread damage along Texas and Louisiana's Gulf Coast. \nRelated: Hurricane Maria is a nightmare for Puerto Rico's economy \nThe airport in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands has yet to resume commercial flights. The tower there was damaged by Hurricane Irma, and the FAA brought in the mobile tower to help manage traffic. But it had to take that tower back to the mainland ahead of Hurricane Maria to protect it from damage. \nThe FAA airlifted a mobile air traffic control tower back to St. Thomas over the weekend to support relief and recovery missions there. \nFinding housing in St. Thomas for airport staff is has also been a challenge. The controllers who staff the tower in St. Thomas are being shuttled back and forth to San Juan every day. \n-- CNN's Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.

La Monica @lamonicabuzz September 26, 2017: 11:16 AM ET 5 stunning stats about Disney Not planning a trip to a Disney theme park in the near future? You could just go to one of the company's revamped stores instead. And while you're there, you could buy a slow cooker with Lightning McQueen on it or a Mickey Mouse leather bag from Coach. Disney unveiled Tuesday a prototype for its re-imagined retail store -- as well as the shopDisney e-commerce site, which was previously DisneyStore.com. The online store will sell more products featuring popular classic Disney characters and those in the hit movies from Disney-owned Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. \nThe revamped stores, versions of which are currently open in Century City and Northridge in California, Nagoya, Japan and Shanghai, will also show a live broadcast of the famous parades that take place at Disney parks and a digital fireworks display each night before they close. \nDisney is also partnering with brands like Coach, cookware company Le Creuset, apparel companies rag & bone, Spyder and others to sell more products geared at older parents (like me) -- and not just their kids. \nSome of the new things you'll find online beyond toys and stuffed animals? A Darth Vader toaster, a Captain America popcorn maker and Mickey Mouse skinny jeans. \n\"Disney stores around the world will also be incorporating more product for guests of all ages, beyond their traditionally child-centric assortment,\" the company said in its release. \nThe media giant continues to mint money from its movie division, theme parks and consumer products. \nRelated: Disney's dark side -- stock tanks on earnings warning \nSo the revamped stores, which seek to capitalize even more on the success of its Disney princesses, Marvel superheroes and Star Wars characters, makes a lot of strategic sense. \nBut Disney investors remain concerned about problems in its cable TV network unit, specifically declining revenue and profits at ESPN. Investors are also unsure about Disney's plan to eventually pull content from Netflix ( NFLX , Tech30 ) and start its own streaming service . \nShares of Disney ( DIS ) fell a bit Tuesday morning. The stock was one of the worst performers in the Dow last year and has fallen about 5% in 2017 as well.

Ratings for NFL football are way down except before game starts, when people tune in to see whether or not our country will be disrespected!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 He added , \"The booing at the NFL football game last night, when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees, was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger... But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team, they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!\" Later Tuesday morning, he continued: \"The NFL has all sorts of rules and regulations. The only way out for them is to set a rule that you can't kneel during our National Anthem!\" The ratings picture is much more complicated than Trump's tweet claimed. There was a big spike in viewership for the pre-game shows on Sunday, but it's too soon to reach any conclusions about the effect of the controversy on viewership. Read More Trump says NFL ratings are 'way down.' That's not completely true Early Nielsen ratings, which are incomplete and subject to change, showed that Sunday's games on Fox and NBC were down compared to the same week last year, but Sunday's games on CBS and \"Monday Night Football\" on ESPN were up. Overall, according to the NFL, Week 3 ratings were slightly higher than Week 3 in 2016. The biggest single broadcast, NBC's \"Sunday Night Football,\" declined about 10% from the equivalent game last year. But it's hard to say whether that was due to Trump, the anthem protests, competition from other shows or the fact that the Washington Redskins' lopsided victory over the Oakland Raiders made for a relatively unexciting matchup. The most likely answer is \"all of the above.\" More detailed viewership data for Sunday's games will come in on Tuesday. Trump entered the controversy about the NFL at a Friday night rally when he went after the league and attacked players who have been kneeling or sitting during the national anthem to draw attention to social justice issues, including police brutality. \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, out, he's fired. He's fired,'\" Trump told a crowd in Alabama. The comments drew widespread criticism from players and team owners. Trump: NFL owners should fire players who protest the national anthem On Saturday, he called for NFL fans to boycott games unless the league fired or suspended players who refuse to stand for the national anthem, and has tweeted more than a dozen times about the matter. At a private dinner with conservative leaders Monday evening, Trump said his NFL comments have \"really caught on,\" according to an attendee, who noted the President told them, \"I said what millions of Americans were thinking.\" White House chief of staff John Kelly, however, was not pleased with the resulting firestorm over the weekend, according to two administration officials. But in a brief interview Monday evening, Kelly told CNN he is \"appalled\" by what he sees as a lack of respect for the flag and national anthem. Trump's culture wars take over American sports \"I believe every American, when the national anthem is played, should cover their hearts and think about all the men and women who have been maimed and killed,\" Kelly said. \"Every American should stand up and think for three lousy minutes.\" His son, Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010. Kelly declined to talk about the President's decision to wade into the issue. White House officials say they believe this will blow over, but did not know how long the President would keep it alive. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the President's comments from the briefing room podium Monday, saying they were not intended to be divisive. \"This isn't about the President being against anyone,\" Sanders said. \"This is about the President and millions of Americans being for something\" -- like \"honoring our flag.\" The President has a jam-packed Tuesday.

Following his meeting, Stone said he had a \"frank exchange\" and described the preceding as \"an entirely political exercise.\" Stone said he denied any Russian collusion or knowledge of the hacking of John Podesta's email during the roughly three-hour closed-door session. In his testimony, Stone attacked the very lawmakers questioning him, calling out the statements of three Democrats on the panel, including ranking member Adam Schiff of California. Read More \"Multiple members of this committee have made false allegations against me in public session in order to ensure that these bogus charges received maximum media coverage,\" Stone said in his statement. \"Now, however, you deny me the opportunity to respond to these charges in the same open forum. This is cowardice.\" Stone said there were \"partisan clashes\" during the session \u2014 and he wasn't holding his breath for apologies he sought from the panel's Democrats \u2014 but he said that members were professional and courteous and he was prepared for all the questions asked. Stone said he did not answer one question that was asked about his \"intermediary\" to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Stone said that it was an off-the-record conversation with a journalist, though he added he would ask the journalist to release him from the off-the-record agreement. Schiff said after the hearing there was one area of Stone's testimony where Stone would not answer questions, and that if Stone did not cooperate the committee would need to subpoena him. Schiff wouldn't say what the area was, though it had to do with Stone's description of his intermediary. Rep. Mike Conaway of Texas, the Republican leading the panel's Russian investigation, said he agreed with Schiff that the committee needed to get the information about the intermediary from Stone. He also told reporters that Stone's comments to the media describing the hearing were \"accurate.\" Stone's meeting comes after he battled with the committee when he demanded a public hearing, which lawmakers rejected, and as the members demanded he produce public records about his contacts with Russians, which sources said he did not do. Multiple sources told CNN that Stone did not provide the committee with records about his alleged contacts with Russians, despite the panel's request. But one source familiar with the matter said that the committee asked for all public records -- and all of Stone's contacts with Russians have been released on Twitter and elsewhere. Stone had no private communications with Russians, the source said. \"We fully complied with the document request from the House on a timely basis,\" said Stone's attorney, Grant Smith. In his 47-page opening statement, which includes exhibits, Stone denied he had any collusion with the Russian state, and also says that allegations Russia was responsible for the hacking of the Democratic National Committee were unproven. \"I understand the committee's interest in me, I use all clauses of the 1st Amendment to achieve my goals, I am out there, I am provocative and partisan, but let's be clear: I have no involvement in the alleged activities that are within the publicly stated scope of this committee's investigation -- collusion with the Russian state to affect the outcome of the 2016 election,\" Stone says. Stone's testimony Tuesday is his first before the congressional panels investigating Russian election meddling and potential collusion with the Trump team. Stone's own words have turned him into a lightning rod when it comes to the Russia investigation. He admits exchanging private messages last summer with the Twitter handle belonging to Guccifer 2.0, who had already leaked stolen documents from the Democratic National Committee. At one point, Guccifer 2.0 told Stone, \"tell me if I can help u anyhow,\" though Stone didn't appear to accept the offer. The US intelligence community now believes Guccifer 2.0 was a front for Russian operatives involved in the Kremlin's election-meddling campaign, an assessment first publicly revealed in January. During the presidential campaign last summer, Stone seemed to predict on a few occasions that WikiLeaks would soon release damaging information about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. He specifically alluded to Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and said on a few occasions that he was in engaged in back-channel communications with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, which Assange has denied. Weeks later, WikiLeaks started releasing Podesta's emails -- which the US intelligence community says were stolen by Russia and handed over to the website. Stone has denied he had any advance knowledge of the Podesta email release, saying he was referring to his own research into Podesta. In his opening statement, Stone said he did not predict the hacking of Podesta's emails and that it's unproven Gufficer 2.0 is \"a Russian cut-out.\" \"I posted this at a time that my boyhood friend and colleague, Paul Manafort, had just resigned from the Trump campaign over allegations regarding his business activities in Ukraine,\" Stone said in the statement. \"I thought it manifestly unfair that John Podesta not be held to the same standard.\" Lawmakers will likely be interested to learn more about who connected Stone with Assange, who has been under scrutiny by the FBI for some time, pertaining to past leaks of classified US material. \"We want to obviously understand the nature of his relationship with Guccifer, what he knew about the release of information,\" said Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat. \"He predicted certain releases, so we're going to really want to understand the nature of that relationship and how broadly that relationship extended.\" Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, said Stone's comments predicting it would be Podesta's \"time in the barrel\" don't add up to his explanation that he didn't know the email leak was coming. \"It defies comprehension and belief all these things could have happened circumstantially,\" Quigley said. \"I'd like to see copies of his social media contacts and his phone records. He needs to say under oath that he never emailed, texted or otherwise communicated.\" One lawmaker on the panel, who requested anonymity to discuss the closed-door hearing, said some panel members see Stone as the key cog to the collusion allegations, and Democrats have wanted to talk to him for months now. The lawmaker had hoped Stone's hearing would be held in public, in part due to the likelihood there would be competing narratives about what was said. \"He doesn't have access to classified information, so it's not like that part of the hearing shouldn't be open, I think, because again, he's not going to talk about classified or state secrets.\" Stone first volunteered to testify in March, and his initial date in July was postponed. Stone said he's asked the committee to immediately release a transcript from the closed-door session. \"I have again asked for immediate release of the transcripts so that there will be no confusion or misinformation about my testimony,\" Stone said in a statement earlier this month. Lawmakers want to hear testimony of potential eyewitnesses in classified settings because they say doing so publicly could undermine their investigation by tipping off other major witnesses. Stone is one of a number of officials with ties to Trump that the committee is investigating as one of several congressional panels probing Russia's election meddling and possible collusion. More recently, Stone has showcased his disdain for the US intelligence community, which he calls the \"deep state,\" by publicly dismissing their conclusions about Russian interference in the 2016 election. He even spread conspiracy theories about the leaked DNC emails, which were published by WikiLeaks during the Democratic convention last July. Stone claimed that a DNC staffer, who was later murdered, was responsible for the leak. No evidence has ever surfaced to back up this claim and the US intelligence community believes Russia was behind the DNC hacks and gave the emails to WikiLeaks. Stone denies participating in any collusion with the Russian government and says he is a target of the American \"deep state.\" He says his only link to Russia is that he enjoys drinking Russian vodka.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roger stone", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wikileaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim himes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul manafort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quigley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "podesta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julian assange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guccifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john podesta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike conaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam schiff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike quigley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikileaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dnc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T18:50:06.013+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2374663752804988233ac15ad9cc4cebe1387bb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcFJWzGzYee5O2aLXlHIkIAqFFp0o.irpdnFjaEQDTxPW_df1gOa9KiB9gQQeEf2Mc-", "site_full": "cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://cnn.com/podcast", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Amanpour", "title": "Germany's election, UK Labour Party Leader", "title_full": "Germany's election, UK Labour Party Leader", "published": "2017-09-26T18:31:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": null, "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2374663752804988233ac15ad9cc4cebe1387bb8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/0xd.sZhj5jcFJWzGzYee5O2aLXlHIkIAqFFp0o.irpdnFjaEQDTxPW_df1gOa9KiB9gQQeEf2Mc-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Amanpour", "published": "2017-09-26T18:31:00.000+03:00", "title": "Germany's election, UK Labour Party Leader", "text": "Angela Merkel has won a historic fourth term as chancellor, but the hard-right Alternative for Germany Party is also now in parliament for the first time.

CNN International", "text": "Obama: Dropping Malia off at college was 'like open-heart surgery' By Jennifer Hansler, CNN Updated 1:58 PM EDT, Tue September 26, 2017 \n(CNN) Former President Barack Obama revealed Monday night how emotional it was to say goodbye to his eldest daughter, Malia, when she went away to college this fall. \n\"For those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast. I dropped off Malia at college, and I was saying to Joe and Jill (Biden) that it was a little bit like open-heart surgery,\" Obama said in remarks at an event for the Beau Biden Foundation, according to video posted by WDEL radio. \nMalia started her undergraduate career at Harvard University after a taking a gap year following her high school graduation. The former president and first lady were spotted helping her move into her dorm at the end of August. \n\"I was proud that I did not cry in front of her,\" Obama joked. \"But on the way back, the Secret Service was off, looking straight ahead, pretending they weren't hearing me as I sniffled and blew my nose. It was rough.\" \nObama said the moment was \"a reminder that, at the end of our lives, whatever else we've accomplished, the things that we'll remember are the joys that our children -- and hopefully way later, our grandchildren -- bring us.\" \nObama has spoken in the past of how much fatherhood has meant to him. In his presidential farewell address, the 44th president told his daughters: \"Of all that I've done in my life, I am most proud to be your dad.\" \nThe former president's appearance at the charity event in Delaware was a surprise to attendees, according to Delaware Online . Obama said he was there to \"lend (his) voice and (his) support to a family that (he cares) deeply about, to honor a man that (he) thought the world of, and to say thank you to all of you for supporting this wonderful cause.\" \n\"It is proper and right that somebody as thoughtful and genuine and strong as Beau made it one of his missions that every child has protection,\" Obama said. \nFormer Vice President Joe Biden thanked Obama for his support of the foundation, which was created in 2015 to honor his late son's legacy in protecting children from abuse. \n\"Mr. President, you've been a great friend. Everybody, I think what they miss most is our memes,\" Biden joked. \"Mr. President, I can't surprise you by giving you a medal of freedom , but I can give you a group of people who think you brought a lot of freedom to this country.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "malia", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "joe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bidens", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn international obamas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "beau biden foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "secret service", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaware online", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wdel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard university", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delaware", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T19:02:57.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "86346a2fda1bffb7c946e64b08fd10fdbd69b00d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsNH3I4nv3oARoNTn2cTAaJOB2YVSWf6Wlm9cs5BRcyhTXv_YA9qAXnb_.Pj.uuk1bJ1vdq9jRBX3mnGWKynhb5g--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition_entertainment.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Entertainment", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker to lead walking tour of New York City", "title_full": "Sarah Jessica Parker to lead walking tour of New York City", "published": "2017-09-26T17:18:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170822100658-sarah-jessica-parker-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 254, "comments": 0, "shares": 254}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "86346a2fda1bffb7c946e64b08fd10fdbd69b00d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsNH3I4nv3oARoNTn2cTAaJOB2YVSWf6Wlm9cs5BRcyhTXv_YA9qAXnb_.Pj.uuk1bJ1vdq9jRBX3mnGWKynhb5g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T17:18:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sarah Jessica Parker to lead walking tour of New York City", "text": "Spend an afternoon with Sarah Jessica Parker 00:45 Story highlights Sarah Jessica Parker is giving a walking tour It includes shoe shopping (CNN) It's not exactly \"Sex and the City\", but shoes are involved.

It's the 40th market Airbnb has entered for \"Experiences,\" which allows travelers to book activities with locals. Parker, who famously played Carrie Bradshaw on the hit HBO series, is taking four lucky folks on what is described on the Airbnb listing as \"an unforgettable shoe-shopping experience\" which starts at Bloomingdale's in midtown Manhattan. \"I'll help you find the perfect pair of shoes from the SJP Collection to complete your look,\" the description says. \"As we peruse the shoe department, I'll tell you about the line and how the city that never sleeps helped inspire it.\" Read More So no, not the Manolo Blahnik's Carrie favored on the show, but Parker's own line of shoes, which retails for several hundred dollars a pair. But that's not all. The four people who paid $400 each for the opportunity will also get to enjoy some frozen yogurt with Parker at Forty Carrots and receive a ticket to the New York City Ballet, where they will have \"have some of the best seats in the house, plus some VIP surprises.\" Not surprisingly, the four available tickets sold out in a New York minute.

The series, which aired its series finale in June, is getting a spin-off. Freeform, Disney's young adult television and streaming network, has announced the new drama pilot, \"Pretty Little Liars: The Perfectionists.\" The new series comes from Warner Horizon Scripted Television and is based on the popular book series \"The Perfectionists,\" written by \"Pretty Little Liars\" author Sara Shepard. It's being developed by \"Pretty Little Liars\" showrunner, I. Marlene King. Read More \"At Freeform, we are committed to delivering shows that push boundaries and become a part of our viewers' lives. 'Pretty Little Liars' was a cultural phenomenon so it's no wonder fans wanted more.\" Karey Burke, executive vice president, programming and development at Freeform said in a statement. \"We can't wait to continue Marlene King's rich and revolutionary storytelling with a new crop of leading ladies from Beacon Heights who will hold just as many secrets and lies as Rosewood did.\" \"Pretty Little Liars\" stars Sasha Pieterse and Janel Parrish will reprise their original roles in the new pilot. Pieterse played Alison DiLaurentis, the former queen bee whose mysterious disappearance rocked the small town of Rosewood and set off the action. Parrish, played Mona Vanderwaal, who was eventually unmasked as the mysterious tormentor \"A\" at the end of the show's second season, and who ultimately successfully matched wits with uber-villain, A.D. Pieterse is currently competing on ABC's \"Dancing With the Stars.\" \"Pretty Little Liars\" was a hit during its seven season run and in its press release for \"The Perfectionists,\" Freeform highlighted the original show's staggering social media stats. Despite ending in June, the series remains the No. 1 most social TV series for the 2016/17 season to date, with 266 million engagements and still accounts for the top six most tweeted scripted cable TV telecasts in Twitter's history. The premiere date for the new show has not yet been announced. Follow Us \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Edie Falco in 'Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders' (Photo by: Justin Lubin/NBC) (CNN) Not exactly bold in going where \"American Crime Story\" went before, NBC plunges into dramatizing true crime under the \"Law & Order\" banner. Despite the me-too-ism of it all, the result is a slick, impressively cast trip down memory lane, saddled with the unwieldy title \"Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders.\" Borrowing elements from its fictional flagship -- down to the on-air graphics and Ka-Chung sound -- the series dredges up parent-killing brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, a sensational 1989 case old enough that their defense attorney, Leslie Abramson (Edie Falco), is actually shown buying a newspaper out of a street vending machine. Still, where the original \"Law & Order\" speeds up the judicial process -- ripped-from-the-headlines investigation, trial, verdict all in an hour -- the \"True Crime\" format has the advantage of slowing it down, fleshing out these characters and some of the more salacious tidbits. The multiple prongs of the case -- from the police investigation to the brothers to their therapist (Josh Charles) and his chatty mistress (Heather Graham) -- add layers to this tawdry tale, even before the lads are arrested and Abramson steps in to represent them. \" allowfullscreen> The brutal murder immediately sets off shock waves in tony Beverly Hills, but detective Les Zoeller (Sam Jaeger) is almost instantly suspicious of the boys, with younger brother Erik (Gus Helper) rushing off to play tennis and Lyle (Miles Gaston Villanueva) quickly embarking on a spending spree after the grisly murders. Moreover, a little digging begins to unearth clues that suggest all was not as idyllic in the Menendez home as outward appearances would suggest. Read More \"Guns, pills and money. What could possibly go wrong here?\" Zoeller muses. Previously turned into a miniseries in the '90s, the Menendez case represents an artifact from the TV movie's bad old days. Yet the morphing of that appetite into a more fleshed-out eight-episode limited series offers the possibility of bringing more depth to the characters, as well as nice little flourishes like casting \"ER's\" Anthony Edwards as the judge. In success, of course, NBC and producer Dick Wolf will face the high-class problem of finding another \"true crime\" worth of similar treatment, as opposed to, say, just an hour of \"Dateline.\" That's no small feat, considering that \"American Crime Story\" and others, including documentarians emboldened by \"Making a Murderer\" and \"The Jinx,\" are hungrily sifting through the same grab bag of notorious trials. For now, though, \"The Menendez Murders\" earns a favorable verdict -- a shrewd choice to inaugurate the latest wrinkle in a well-oiled TV franchise that's as durable as crime and punishment. \"Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders\" premieres Sept. 26 at 10 p.m. on NBC.

That group includes family members / senior advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner as well as departed top aides including Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon. Now, try to remember all the way back to, well, last year when then candidate Trump framed his entire campaign around the idea that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email and private server as secretary of state amounted to criminal conduct. \"She would be under protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial, I would say,\" Trump told a Michigan audience just more than a week before the 2016 election. \"So we'd have a criminal trial of a sitting president.\" The \"Lock Her Up\" chant -- which an audience in Alabama chanted on Friday night, more than 300 days after the 2016 election -- became the defining rallying cry for Trump voters. Trump might be uncouth. He might be make offensive comments about women. But, Clinton was a criminal, Trump supporters claimed! (Neither Clinton nor anyone on her staff were ever charged with a crime.) Ahem. Read More Before we go any further, it's important to note that what Clinton did is not the exact same thing that Jared, Ivanka and others are reportedly doing. Clinton exclusively used her private email address for government business. She had a private email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York. She shared classified materials via that email address although, she has long contended, the materials were not classified at the time. According to the Times, all of the Trump administration officials used their private addresses only occasionally and all had official accounts set up and operating. Still. Think of it this way: You are running a race against someone else through the woods. That person falls in a hole. You win. The next time you run through those same woods, you would think you would make sure to be on the lookout for the hole, right? Like, you would be HYPER sensitive to that pitfall -- and any other ones like it, right? (Yes, I watched the second \"Hunger Games\" movie last night.) What these Trump officials have done is sprint into the same damn hole that swallowed Clinton's campaign whole. And, in so doing, they've raised all of the same questions that Clinton's email use did. Do they think the rules don't apply to them? Do they think they can just do whatever they want because of their position and power? What are they trying to hide in these private accounts? And, it also raises a question that Clinton never had to contend with: Did the Trump campaign actually believe all that stuff they said about the dangers posed by Clinton's email conduct? If so, why did they go anywhere near doing the same thing? The official White House line was surprisingly scoldy about the new email revelations. \"All White House personnel have been instructed to use official email to conduct all government related work,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. \"They are further instructed that if they receive work-related communication on personal accounts, they should be forwarded to official email accounts.\" This story won't be going away any time soon. Not only does it look like rank hypocrisy, it also potentially ties into special counsel Bob Mueller's investigation into Russia influence in the 2016 election. What do these emails on private accounts say? Will they be released publicly? If not, why not? \"The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton,\" Trump proclaimed in January 2016. \"At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgment be our next president?\" Don't be surprised if this latest story prompts some of those same questions to be asked of the men and women in Trump's inner circle.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ben carson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bob mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivanka trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reince priebus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivanka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chappaqua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T19:04:29.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "81098ad6350bbe41c269bcdb532e0ebf7e049ce5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNY2DsRWkVi6Gs35HobnYru_nLh6F0L.l0B0P9YnTatVpU1Weg.9e5TCmr9PyAFca66xgPnfl5XFTA--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Politics", "title": "San Juan mayor to Trump: Hurricane relief, debt crisis are 'two different issues'", "title_full": "San Juan mayor to Trump: Hurricane relief, debt crisis are 'two different issues'", "published": "2017-09-26T16:57:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170921065602-02-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-0921-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1343, "comments": 0, "shares": 1343}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "81098ad6350bbe41c269bcdb532e0ebf7e049ce5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNY2DsRWkVi6Gs35HobnYru_nLh6F0L.l0B0P9YnTatVpU1Weg.9e5TCmr9PyAFca66xgPnfl5XFTA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T16:57:00.000+03:00", "title": "San Juan mayor to Trump: Hurricane relief, debt crisis are 'two different issues'", "text": "Story highlights Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz also shared harrowing details from rescue missions throughout the island Trump on Monday linked Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria to the debt crisis that has wracked the territory Washington (CNN) San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz responded to President Donald Trump's tweets about the island's debt crisis and hurricane relief Tuesday, saying \"these are two different issues.\" On Monday, Trump linked Puerto Rico's recovery from Hurricane Maria to the debt crisis that has wracked the territory since last year. \"Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble ...

The Jones Act, which makes everything that comes into Puerto Rico -- that makes it more expensive, and it can be repealed,\" she said. Asked if a visit by the President to the island would be helpful, the mayor demurred, saying \"we live in a world where you can see any part of the world through your phone.\" \"I am sure that as the United States President, you know, he can come to Puerto Rico if he wants to. He has been not only tweeting, but I know he has been in contact with the governor, and we appreciate that,\" she said. After losing everything in Puerto Rico, resident says: 'We have not lost our faith' Cruz also shared harrowing details of rescue missions throughout the island, repeatedly calling the situation a \"humanitarian crisis\" and emphasizing the lack of available fuel for hospitals and medical providers. \"We are finding dialysis patients that have not been able to contact their providers. We are having to transport them in near-death conditions. We are finding people whose oxygen tanks are running out, because our small generators now don't have any diesel, and disabled people, they live alone and can't just walk somewhere,\" she said. Cruz continued: \"Every time we find a person that is gasping for air -- I am not painting a poetic picture, I am telling you I have seen them and held them in my arms -- and helped them into an ambulance, and every time we do that we get a little frail, and of course we get a little afraid. But we also get a lot more resolve to push on and move on and to do whatever -- our bodies are so tired, but our souls are so full of strength that we will get to everyone we can get to.

Russia says it will ban Facebook in 2018 if the social network fails to comply with local data storage laws. Alexander Zharov, head of communications regulator Roskomnadzor, was quoted by official state media outlets on Tuesday as saying \"the law is obligatory for all.\" \"In all cases we will make sure the law is complied with, or the company will stop working in the Russian Federation,\" he said. \"There are no exceptions here.\" \nRussia's law on personal data storage came into effect in September 2015.

I see nothing viable from the Republicans.\" \"I'm not a fan of any legislation that Washington has come up with,\" said Dr. Keith Smith, who runs a cost-transparent surgical center in Oklahoma City. \"The GOP version of the plan that they would inflict on all of us is like giving gin instead of vodka to an alcoholic and assuming something different will occur.\" Informal surveys show growing concern Read More Insider surveys by physician recruiting firms and websites echo those sentiments. An email survey of 887 physicians released today by MDLinx, a physician news aggregator, found 54.7% oppose or strongly oppose the Graham-Cassidy plan, while only 19.8% support or strongly support it. About 25% of respondents were neutral. Dozens of major medical associations, such as the American Medical Association , American College of Physicians , American Diabetes Association , American Heart Association and American Cancer Society , have released statements opposing the Graham-Cassidy replacement for the Affordable Care Act, and many opposed its predecessor.. In what's considered the final blow for the latest GOP proposal, the Congressional Budget Office released a partial report late Monday which said it would result in \"millions fewer people with comprehensive health insurance that covers high-cost medical events.\" But physician dissatisfaction with the Trump administration health care proposals goes back further than this latest iteration. Released in July as part of the Medicus Firm's 2017 annual report on physician practice and relocation preferences , a random sample of 2,351 doctors from 50 states and more than 20 specialties were asked to more widely grade the Trump administration's impact on health care policy -- 55% of those who responded gave the administration a failing grade. What doctors think about the Affordable Care Act The Great American Physician Survey, done every year by Physicians Practice, which provides information and advice to physicians in private practice, found similar results from the 826 doctors in its survey released earlier this month. \"The highest percentage, 40%, say the Trump administration gets an 'F' in health care so far,\" said Gabriel Perna, Physicians Practice managing editor. \"These aren't scientific surveys,\" warned Dr. Benjamin Sommers, an internist and health economist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, because they don't statistically account for bias. \"Doctors tend to be a difficult group to survey and get their opinions in a really scientific sort of way.\" Because Graham-Cassidy is essentially similar to the prior GOP replacement bills, Sommers said he suspects that most physician views haven't changed. \"Those who dislike the Affordable Care Act and favor less federal oversight in health care and more state control will be happy with it,\" said Sommers. \"Those who worry that cutting ... Medicaid and other health care programs will lead to millions of Americans losing health insurance will be very worried about the damage this bill could cause.\" A move toward single payer? Perhaps more surprising are the results of recent informal surveys that show an increased interest by doctors in a single payer system, such as the \"Medicare for All\" proposal from Bernie Sanders, Vermont's Independent senator and 2016 presidential candidate. The MDLinx survey found just over 48% of physicians polled would support a single payer system, even though they thought it would lower their income and could possibly reduce the quality of care for their patients. The most common pre-existing medical conditions \"I was really surprised,\" said Jim Stone, president of the Medicus Firm, a physician recruiting company. \"Physicians have generally been a fairly independent group, they don't want anything dictated to them, and I find it shocking that we are even seeing this degree of acceptance for a single payer system.\" A national survey released earlier this month by another physician staffing agency, Merritt Hawkins and Associates, also found 56% of 1,033 doctors either strongly or somewhat supported a single payer health care plan. While the poll is non-scientific, it's interesting when compared to past polling by the same group. \"This is a near reversal of a national survey of physicians Merritt Hawkins conducted in 2008, which indicated 58% of physicians opposed single payer at that time,\" said Phillip Miller, vice president of communications for Merritt Hawkins. \"This is not surprising at all to me,\" said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Adam Gaffney, who is also on the board of Physicians for a National Health Program , which supports \"Medicare for All.\" \"The ACA has not taken us where we need to be. And many doctors are unhappy with the wasteful health care system that predated the ACA. \"In my opinion 'Medicare for All' would help by giving us one set of rules. You'd have a national formulary. Regardless of who is in front of you, you'd know how they would be covered without going to their insurance company to see what they would cover.\" Time to start over \"I'm not sure that a single payer is the best way to go, especially since the government has not done a good job so far,\" said Dr. Linda Girgis, a family physician who volunteers for SERMO , a leading social network for physicians. Mother of disabled child: Cassidy 'should know better' In her South River, New Jersey, practice Girgis sees a lot of problems she feels are not addressed by any of the proposed plans. \"Patients are self-rationing their care. We had a mother and child who were both sick at the same time, and the mom canceled her appointment with me and only took her daughter to the pediatrician,\" said Girgis. \"She could only afford the deductible for one of them.\" Girgis places much of the blame on insurance companies, and would like to see any proposal in Washington improve transparency into their systems and oversight of their actions. \"Insurance companies are making poor decisions, denying certain tests and raising prices,\" said Girgis. \"Patients are getting medications that may not be the best choice for them because that is what the insurance company will cover.\" North Carolina's Campbell shares Girgis' concerns about insurance processes. \"I spend a great deal of my time as a cardiologist arguing on the phone with what the insurance companies call 'peer to peer' reviewers, and they are nowhere near my peers,\" said Campbell. \"They will argue if a pacemaker is appropriate and they are not trained in cardiovascular medicine, much less in pacemaker surgery.\" He, too, would like to see additional oversight of insurance companies, but doesn't stop there. \"Nothing has come out of Washington that even talks about regulating the costs of pharmaceuticals, one of the leading drivers of health care costs,\" said Campbell. \"We also have no tort reform on a national level, so we're spending millions upon millions of health care dollars every single year ordering unnecessary tests because physicians are practicing 'defensive medicine' to protect themselves from predatory litigation for malpractice.\" \"I wish they would leave us alone and let the market work,\" added Smith, the Oklahoma City surgeon. \"Central planning from Washington is a disaster. It has distorted free markets and just drives the price up for everyone.\" Smith is part of a entrepreneurial physician movement toward fee-based service, with transparent prices that patients can see online. That, says Smith, allows his patients to shop for the best price and hold their doctor accountable for quality. Join\n\"In my world, if I don't provide a service that is valued, my doors are closed, and that's the discipline every other industry must face,\" said Smith. \"And that's what I see as the problem. We don't have an open, competitive market where the patients know the price before they pay.\" Atlanta urologist Hill agrees. He's developing a version of direct pay care with a reduced administrative burden that he hopes will cover the entire health care \"ecosystem,\" from primary care to specialists, to lab work, tests and medications. \"Right now, I have to negotiate a contract with the insurance companies and hire a back office of coders and billers that I have to run everything through in order to get paid,\" said Hill. \"And then the insurance company has to hire people to fight me trying to get paid. \"What if we do something different and start working directly with our patients?\" asked Hill. \"What if we got all those costs out of my office and I get to have a relationship with you, my patient, the person that I actually went to medical school to take care of?\" Hill's views that a new approach is needed were echoed in the informal MDLinx survey. When asked \"What would be the ideal scenario for US health care?\" nearly 38% said they wanted something completely new because none of the current options were feasible. \"As you can tell, doctors are frustrated,\" said Campbell. \"We feel like our voices are not being heard. Health care reform the first time happened around us. This time it needs to listen to us.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sandee lamotte", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "brian hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda girgis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benjamin sommers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merritt hawkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "girgis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sommers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "phillip miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam gaffney", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cassidy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gabriel perna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim stone", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medicus firm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american medical association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american heart association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american cancer society", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national health program", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "associates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american diabetes association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard t.h. chan school of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional budget office", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american college of physicians", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oklahoma city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south river", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T19:13:47.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d63f15155dae9a30116eceb12c62ff37052aec2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsQVDBKSNTbJ3xL6PuhJNHynS7uKnadwHBnpsKkHfoCNB00xnDR56AtqCx5i4soBawxwRWQNun4P_zNuF2v5w85Q--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_health.rss\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Health", "title": "Nursing home death: 'All they had to do was call 911,' family says", "title_full": "Nursing home death: 'All they had to do was call 911,' family says", "published": "2017-09-26T16:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170915210237-florida-nursing-home-video-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 31, "comments": 0, "shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d63f15155dae9a30116eceb12c62ff37052aec2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsQVDBKSNTbJ3xL6PuhJNHynS7uKnadwHBnpsKkHfoCNB00xnDR56AtqCx5i4soBawxwRWQNun4P_zNuF2v5w85Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T16:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Nursing home death: 'All they had to do was call 911,' family says", "text": "Story highlights Family files lawsuit, claiming nursing home negligent, failed to act properly Deaths of nursing home patients is being investigated by Florida officials (CNN) Erika Navarro said she had been on FaceTime with her grandfather, Miguel Antonio Franco, on September 5 -- his 93rd birthday.

Earlier, the nursing home issued this statement: \"The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills expresses its deepest sympathy to the family members of the residents who passed away following a prolonged outage of our air conditioning system due to Hurricane Irma.\" Nursing home officials have said they were in constant contact with state and local authorities and took steps to provide cooling devices inside. The exact cause of the 11 deaths has not been reported, but a number of the 141 residents who were evacuated were treated for heat-related issues. 'Absolutely stunning' The lawyer for Franco's family, Curtis Miner, said his death was avoidable. Irma wreaked havoc in less developed places in the Caribbean, but none recorded a tragedy on the level of the nursing home, he said. \"It is absolutely stunning to us the nursing home was so unprepared for what would inevitably happen with Hurricane Irma and it is absolutely stunning to us they did not take emergency action when this tragedy began to unfold,\" Miner said. \"This is something that could have been prevented,\" said Pedro Franco, the deceased man's son. \"All they had to do was call 911.\" Doctor: Nursing home deaths show the risks of being old in Florida The deaths are part of an ongoing criminal investigation, the Hollywood Police Department said. Meanwhile, state and federal agencies are conducting administrative investigations.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan called the desperate conditions in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria \"a humanitarian crisis\" shortly before President Donald Trump announced plans to visit the island on Tuesday. As images of complete devastation and millions struggling to recover with major power outages days after the storm hit Ryan made a point to say that those in Puerto Rico \"need to know they are in our thoughts and our prayers.\" \"This is our own country and these are our fellow citizens. They need our help and they are going to get our help,\" Ryan pledged. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York pushed for a vote this week on disaster aid for the US territory. \"The administration should prepare an immediate and interim emergency aid request and the majority leader should put that package on the floor of the Senate before we leave this week. Anything less would be an abject failure of our duty to come to the aid of our fellow US citizens,\" Schumer said Tuesday. Read More Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell echoed Ryan's message that more help would be on the way but said Congress needed to determine details about what is needed. \"We want the people of Puerto Rico and the islands to know that we are thinking of them and - more importantly - we want them to know that we will continue to work with FEMA, the Department of Defense, and the rest of the administration to help in the recovery,\" he said on the Senate floor. \"And I expect we'll hear more soon on what additional resources will be necessary in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the paths of the storms.\" Ryan maintained that the victims there will get the same help that those in Texas and Florida received. Last week, when visiting a neighborhood flooded outside Houston by Hurricane Harvey, the speaker said he expected Congress to approve two emergency funding bills to help victims in several states and Puerto Rico. GOP aides tell CNN they expect an official request from the Trump administration in mid-October. But Florida Republican Rep. Carlos Curbelo told reporters on Tuesday \"none of us have done enough because there is so much to do.\" Curbelo said he spoke this morning with Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, Puerto Rico's sole representative in Congress, who he said was emotional \"because the island has been wrecked.\" Asked if it hurts the island that they don't have the same status as the 50 states in Congress, Curbelo said, \"it would be hard to argue that they are not.\" And speaking on CNN, Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-New York, said Trump should tweet less and focus on Puerto Rico crisis or it will \"be Mr. Trump's Katrina.\" CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report. Correction: Rep.

Cory Booker: Trump's team has worked to try discredit Robert Mueller in public eye He says he and Lindsey Graham proposed bill to protect special counsels from interference Cory Booker is a Democratic US senator from New Jersey. The views expressed solely those of the author.\n(CNN) There is a consensus among experts across party lines and throughout the intelligence community that the Russian government, under President Vladimir Putin, poses an active threat to the American electoral process. Not only did Russia interfere in the US presidential election in 2016 , but if left ignored and undeterred, its operatives will also try and likely succeed in doing so again.\nThat the Justice Department deemed it necessary to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government -- and any matters that may arise as a result of that investigation -- underscores the seriousness and gravity of this threat. Cory Booker Yet as Mueller's investigation has progressed and scrutinized members of the Trump campaign , the President and his legal team have intensified efforts to try to discredit the special counsel and erode public confidence in his investigation. While Mueller and his team have been working to get to the bottom of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials, President Donald Trump and his legal team have apparently been working to create an eventual rationale for terminating the Mueller investigation. Any attempt by the Trump administration to sabotage the investigation is more than just a threat to Mueller's job -- it also poses a serious threat to the integrity of our democracy and the system of checks and balances in government that has sustained our nation for centuries. Before we approach the point of no return -- a constitutional crisis triggered by presidential abuse of power -- it is time for Congress to act decisively to fortify our system of checks and balances by passing a law to protect Mueller and any future special counsel from political interference. Read More That's why this summer I co-authored the bipartisan Special Counsel Independence Protection Act with Sen. Lindsey Graham. Our bill will ensure that any firing of a special counsel would be subject to judicial review for cause by a three-judge panel, that only the attorney general has the authority to fire a special counsel and that a termination must be for legitimate, not political or ethically conflicted, reasons. Sens. Chris Coons and Thom Tillis have introduced similar legislation, and on Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee will be holding a hearing on both proposals. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nMueller's independent investigation is a matter of America's national security and democratic stability, and there is no room here for partisan or political interference. In fact, a group of more than a dozen former administration officials, presidential ethics czars and scholars who have served at the highest levels of government in both Democratic and Republican administrations recently joined together to urge Congress to support our efforts to protect Mueller and any future special counsels from political interference. It is imperative that Congress follow Tuesday's hearing with swift action to pass legislation to safeguard Mueller's ability to do his job effectively and to free him from retaliation from the President so that the system of checks and balances and separation of powers can continue to guarantee our democratic stability. It's time to pass a law that protects both special counsel Mueller and the integrity of our democratic system.

It's a way to make employees communicate better. The world's largest employer announced on Tuesday it has signed up for Facebook Workplace, the version of the social network that's optimized for businesses. \nWorkplace launched in October 2016, connecting colleagues and allowing them to message each other, share images and broadcast live videos. Like Facebook's flagship service, it has a Newsfeed of updates. But there's no friending of anyone -- and what's in your feed depends on who you work for. \nWalmart, in an attempt to transform itself into more of a digital company, began experimenting with Workplace this summer. A Walmart spokesman said the platform is appealing because its employees are already so familiar with Facebook's products. Little training is required. \nThe company said it will also use Workplace to distribute company news and broadcast town halls. \nSome Walmart employees have already used Workplace to coordinate emergency efforts during   struck Texas and Florida. Walmart's emergency operations center used Workplace to exchange updates and photos with associates in the field, supplementing its existing communication tools. \nMeanwhile, Sam's Club employees have used Workplace to share information about store product displays. \nRelated: Facebook wants to invade your office \nWalmart plans to roll out Workplace in phases and hasn't determined yet how many of its 2.2 million employees will use the service. \nFacebook said that more than 14,000 companies are using Workplace today. At Starbucks, 80% of its store managers use Workplace on a weekly basis. Meanwhile, Norweigan retailer REMA uses the platform to make employees immediately aware of product recalls. \nWorkplace costs from $1 - 3 per user, depending on how many employees a company signs up. There's also a free version with limited features. \nWorkplace is Facebook's first major push into enterprise software, which competes with services from Slack, Microsoft and others. \nCNNMoney (Washington)   12:12 PM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wal-mart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "walmart", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook workplace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "microsoft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "slack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T19:29:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8bb4a490fb76d26d868b7c1e27253c79bf6a8cd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsNH3I4nv3oARoNTn2cTAaJMl2ykAKzB4UU7VlbC4Cuv.IPzqZ9FeHRNlZMy3MD.Ckt1zCW73pWxo-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_showbiz.rss&author=CNN&title=Entertainment", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Entertainment", "title": "'Fixer Upper' coming to an end", "title_full": "'Fixer Upper' coming to an end", "published": "2017-09-26T19:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926085517-chip-and-joanna-gaines-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7588, "comments": 7, "shares": 7588}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8bb4a490fb76d26d868b7c1e27253c79bf6a8cd9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsNH3I4nv3oARoNTn2cTAaJMl2ykAKzB4UU7VlbC4Cuv.IPzqZ9FeHRNlZMy3MD.Ckt1zCW73pWxo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T19:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Fixer Upper' coming to an end", "text": "'Fixer Upper' will end after season five 01:37 (CNN) Sad news for anyone dreaming of one day having their home fixed up by Chip and Joanna Gaines on \"Fixer Upper\": that shiplap has sailed. The couple has announced their HGTV series, which followed the couple as they renovated homes in Waco, Texas, will conclude after Season 5. The new season is set to premiere in November. \"While we are confident that this is the right choice for us, it has for sure not been an easy one to come to terms with,\" the parents of four wrote in a blog post on their official site. \"Our family has grown up alongside yours, and we have felt you rooting us on from the other side of the screen. How bittersweet to say goodbye to the very thing that introduced us all in the first place.\" The pair said the decision to end the series stemmed from a desire to focus on their businesses and family. They also denied any claims that the show's conclusion has anything to do with a \"fraudulent skincare line\" to which Joanna Gaines had falsely been said to be tied. Read More A post shared by Chip Gaines (@chippergaines) on Sep 26, 2017 at 8:02am PDT Gaines dispelled those incorrect reports in an instagram post back in July. \"This is just us recognizing that we need to catch our breath for a moment,\" the blogpost said. \"Our plan is to take this time to shore up and strengthen the spots that are weak, rest the places that are tired and give lots of love and attention to both our family and our businesses.\" Since its debut in 2013, \"Fixer Upper\" has become something of a cult favorite among HGTV loyalists and turned the Gaines's quaint lifestyle in a sleepy central Texas town into must-watch aspirational TV.' \"Chip and Jo are devoted parents and have been dedicated and hard working partners with HGTV and High Noon over five seasons and nearly 80 amazing home transformations,\" said Jim Berger, CEO of High Noon Entertainment, which produces the show. \"We respect and are in full support of their decision to take time to focus on their family and their many projects through Magnolia. Everyone here at High Noon is so proud of the upcoming fifth season and we can't wait for fans to experience it.\" The show's success spurred one spin-off series, \"Fixer Upper: Behind the Design,\" a magazine and a home collection. The Season 4 finale garnered more than 5 million viewers and was among the top cable telecasts in the second quarter of 2017, according to Variety . The couple, who own a number of businesses in Waco, including the popular Magnolia Market, called the announcement \"bittersweet\" in an accompanying video. \"Thank you from the bottom of our hearts for letting our family become apart of your family,\" Chip Gaines said.

We know this.\nBut, what Bannon, who until last month was a senior strategist to President Donald Trump, said about the Senate majority leader -- and House Speaker Paul Ryan -- on Monday night in Alabama was over-the-top even for Bannon. Here's a sampling: \"Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country. They think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes. They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do.\" \"I told (Trump) I was going to go after the establishment, go after the establishment first and the Democrats later. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have allowed three investigative committees on Capitol Hill with full subpoena power, they're going after President Trump every day.\" \" Mitch McConnell ... Karl Rove, all the instruments that tried to destroy Roy Moore and his family: Your day of reckoning is coming. \" The backdrop for Bannon's comments was a rally for Roy Moore, the former Alabama state Supreme Court justice who is running in Tuesday's special election runoff for the unexpired term of US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Moore's opponent is appointed Sen. Luther Strange, who has the endorsement of Trump, McConnell and virtually every member of the GOP's political establishment. Read More Strange's allies -- led by a McConnell-aligned super PAC -- have dumped more than $9 million into the race to boost the incumbent , who finished second behind Moore in the August GOP primary . Bannon, Farage say Roy Moore can save Trump from himself Bannon is known for his bluster and for grandiose verbiage describing the stakes of, well, everything. He's also known to loathe the Republican political establishment -- a view that led him to ally with Trump long before anyone knew the real estate mogul was serious about running for president in 2016. What's clear from Bannon's comments on Monday night, however, is that he doesn't believe the war against his own party ended with Trump's election. He thinks it's only just begun. Bannon said as much. \"I told (Trump) I was going to go after the establishment, go after the establishment first and the Democrats later,\" he told the crowd. (A question: Did Trump bless that approach?) Think about this: The former top political strategist for the Republican President of the United States called the two top Republicans in Congress \"the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country.\" He added that they are \"going after President Trump every day.\" And, most ominously, Bannon promised McConnell and former Bush White House political Svengali Rove that \"your day of reckoning is coming.\" Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Imagine for a second if David Axelrod, who held a similar role in Barack Obama's White House, not only campaigned against the president's chosen candidate in a primary but also savaged Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi -- and told them their day of reckoning was coming. It would be a MASSIVE story -- and rightly so. Because we have been so inoculated to the oddities of every day in the Trump administration, there's a tendency to just skip over Bannon's comments. We shouldn't. A prominent member of Trump's inner circle is blasting the top leaders of his party and promising retribution.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech on the European Union at the amphitheater of the Sorbonne University on September 26, 2017 in Paris. (CNN) French President Emmanuel Macron has laid out a sweeping plan to relaunch the European Union, calling for greater harmonization in key policy areas and raising the prospect that the UK could rejoin a reformed bloc. In a marathon, 90-minute speech at the Sorbonne in Paris, Macron sought to present a new vision for the EU as it reels under the rise of far-right nationalism, mass migration and Brexit. Macron called for a joint military \"rapid response force,\" a common defense budget, a single asylum system and an EU border force. He said the single-currency eurozone should have its own budget and finance minister. \"The Europe we know is too weak, too slow, too inefficient, but only Europe gives us the capacity to act on the world stage in the face of the big, contemporary challenges,\" he said. We can say goodbye to a stable Germany Macron campaigned for the French presidency on a forcefully pro-European platform. But his vision has been complicated by the German election results and the bloody nose they inflicted on Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose cooperation will be vital to achieving his aims. Read More Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union party and its sister grouping, the Christian Social Union, obtained just 33% of the vote and will need to forge a deal with other parties to govern. The CDU was already resistant to handing more budgetary powers to Brussels. One of her likely coalition partners, the pro-business FDP, is even more hostile to the idea. In his speech, Macron called for a single EU corporate tax band by 2020, saying members who refused to implement it should have their aid from Brussels cut. Macron urged reform of the controversial Common Agricultural Policy farm subsidy system, including tougher measures to fight fraud within it. Traditionally, France has been the biggest beneficiary and staunch defender of the CAP. French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech on the European Union at the amphitheater of the Sorbonne University on September 26, 2017 in Paris. He also suggested an increase in development aid for Africa, which he said should no longer be treated as a problem \"but as a partner.\" He proposed to finance this by extending the UK's system of taxing property transactions, known as stamp duty. to across the EU and increasing taxes on carbon fuels as a means of transforming the economic model to a more environmentally friendly system. \"The only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic,\" Macron said. The French President's speech echoed one given 25 years ago by former EU Commission President and architect of the single market Jacques Delors. It was lauded by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who said the EU needed \"courage\" to move forward. \"A very European speech by my friend Emmanuel Macron. Europe needs courage. Thank you for your support for the work of the EU institutions,\" Juncker, the head of the EU's executive arm, said on Twitter. Marcon suggested the UK might want to rejoin the EU after his grand plan had been pushed through: \"In a few years, if they want, the United Kingdom could find its place... In this reformed and simplified EU that I'm proposing, I can't imagine that the United Kingdom could not find its place.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hilary clarke", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu macron", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "angela merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merkel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-claude juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jacques delors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "juncker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sorbonne university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian democratic union party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christian social union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cdu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brussels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sorbonne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T19:48:31.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "077ec96b132819e1bebe5838a46e1415dc20d6b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7e_iV3fcVL5AX3PjYw0wxPznt0hJzfdIvjpobV0Lj0tpumv07PbcfBzsJo6kSspr87PZXKNMQ0Cr0_QngjwEgho-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - App International Edition", "title": "Six jobs you (wrongly) thought were extinct", "title_full": "Six jobs you (wrongly) thought were extinct", "published": "2017-09-26T15:37:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170907095331-handmade-gramercy-typewriters-06-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 282, "comments": 0, "shares": 282}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 19}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "077ec96b132819e1bebe5838a46e1415dc20d6b0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7e_iV3fcVL5AX3PjYw0wxPznt0hJzfdIvjpobV0Lj0tpumv07PbcfBzsJo6kSspr87PZXKNMQ0Cr0_QngjwEgho-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T15:37:00.000+03:00", "title": "Six jobs you (wrongly) thought were extinct", "text": "The cursor blinks. \"Wonder what's happening on Twitter?\" A precious half hour later, you're back to the assignment and really laser-focused now, until ...

CNN In a cramped workshop/showroom in the shadow of the Flatiron Building, a father and son are two of the last typewriter caretakers in New York City. Like the surviving knights of an ancient order, they grab their tools and answer the calls of boomer luddites who just really love the feel of a 1972 IBM Selectric and millennial hipsters craving a break from glass screens.

Gallagher Guitars I wonder ... in a digital world, can digits with calluses still compete? In a corporate world, can a three-man shop still survive? And in a hurried world, how many customers are willing to wait? And wait. And wait ... before they can unwrap something as common as a new guitar? While a big factory might put 20 man hours into a decent six-string, at this a dusty little workshop in Wartrace, Tennessee, they'll put in 60.

Sheila Jackson Lee said Trump's comments were racist She said the protest falls under the players' First Amendment rights Washington (CNN) Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, took a knee on the House floor Monday night in solidarity with NFL players who knelt during the National Anthem following President Donald Trump's criticism of the protest. \"There is no basis in the First Amendment that says that you cannot kneel on the National Anthem or in front of the flag,\" she said. Lee said Trump had a \"lack of judgment\" to comment on the players' freedom of speech. The national anthem in sports (spoiler: it wasn't always this way) \"There is no regulation that says that these young men cannot stand against the dishonoring of their mothers by you calling them to fire the son of a B,\" she said. \"You tell me which of those children's mothers are a son of a B. That is racism.\" At a rally for Alabama Republican Sen. Luther Strange on Friday, Trump said NFL team owners should respond to the protest against police brutality by saying, \"Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he's fired. He's fired!\" His comments -- and repeated tweets on the matter -- have escalated a nationwide controversy that has significant racial and cultural undertones.

Maybe. \nFingerlings from WowWee are interactive baby monkeys that cling to fingers and hang by their tails. They react to sound, motion and touch through two sensors on the top of their heads.

Mark Warner says the \"million-dollar question\" still unanswered about the Facebook election ads sold to Russian-linked accounts was how the Russians knew whom to target on Facebook. Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told CNN the committee expects this week to begin viewing the 3,000 Russian-linked Facebook ads, which Facebook earlier this month disclosed were connected to more than 450 inauthentic accounts. Facebook agreed last week to turn the ads over to the House and Senate intelligence committees. Warner's burning question involves not just the content of the ads but how they were deployed. \"Did they know this just by following political news in America? Did they geo-target both geography and by demographics in ways that at least at first blush appear pretty sophisticated? These are the kind of questions that we need to get answered and that's why we need them in a public hearing,\" Warner said. The Virginia Democrat said it was \"too early to tell\" whether any Trump campaign officials were associated with the ads. Read More \"I raised this issue back last winter at that point Facebook was dismissive that there was anything there. We've now seen that there was a lot there in terms of paid advertising, fake accounts, pushing people towards rallies, trying to sow division and chaos,\" Warner said. \"And that's why I'm anxious to review the materials they are sending in to the committee.\" But Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, said there's \"no evidence yet\" that Russians and Trump officials colluded on the Facebook ads, though he said it's an area the committee continues to investigate. Burr said the effort appeared to be more about sowing chaos on both sides of the political spectrum. \"The social media platforms look to be a tool that were utilized by a foreign power to impact the 2016 elections,\" Burr said. \"Is there collusion? None that anybody can see.\" The Senate intelligence panel has met with Facebook officials in a closed session, and Twitter officials are coming to talk to the intelligence panel on Thursday in a closed session. \"A lot of the same claims that have been made about Facebook, have also been made about Twitter,\" Warner said, adding that it was \"too early\" to tell if they would be cooperative with congressional efforts to determine the scope of Russian attempts to use social media in the 2016 election. Burr says he wants to have a public hearing with Facebook and other social media companies as early as next month. But the North Carolina Republican does not think it's the committee's job to make the ads public when they are given to the committee. \"We don't routinely release any information that's shared with the committee and I'd like to keep the committee in that mode,\" he said.

At least four top current and former White House officials occasionally used private email in their official capacity as White House officials, sources told CNN. The New York Times reported Monday night that that \"at least six\" officials used private email to conduct White House business after Politico first reported that Jared Kushner , the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, periodically used a private email account. The use of private email was a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election, when then-candidate Trump frequently slammed his opponent Hillary Clinton's use of a private server during her time as secretary of state. Several of the emails Clinton sent or received were later determined to be classified by various government agencies , though Clinton had said that none of the emails were marked classified at the time she sent them. Hillary Clinton's email controversy, explained There was no indication that the White House officials who used personal email maintained their accounts on a private server or that they shared classified information. Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and others occasionally used personal email during their time at the White House, two sources with knowledge of the emails told CNN. Read More Kushner's lawyer Abbe Lowell also confirmed to CNN on Sunday that Kushner occasionally used a private email account for correspondence with fellow administration officials. \"Mr. Kushner uses his White House email address to conduct White House business,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"Fewer than a hundred emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr. Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account.\" Lowell said that the emails on Kushner's private account were \"usually forwarded news articles or political commentary and most often occurred when someone initiated the exchange by sending an email to his personal, rather than his White House, address.\" White House officials are advised to use their official White House email addresses for official business and though it is not illegal to use personal email, federal law requires all White House records -- including emails -- be preserved. Attorney: Kushner used private email account to talk to WH officials \"All White House personnel have been instructed to use official email to conduct all government related work,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"They are further instructed that if they receive work-related communication on personal accounts, they should be forwarded to official email accounts.\" While the White House has not issued any new warnings or guidance, one source said lawyers in the Office of the White House Counsel periodically remind White House staff to forward any personal emails to their official account to ensure they are recorded in accordance with the Presidential Records Act. Kushner did just that, Lowell said, noting that \"all non-personal emails were forwarded to his official address, and all have been preserved, in any event.\" Ivanka Trump, an assistant to the President, also used her private email to correspond with administration officials about working on policy issues before she was officially named to a White House position in March. According to The New York Times, Stephen Miller, a top adviser and presidential speechwriter, and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn also used private email accounts. CNN has not independently verified this reporting. Documents obtained by watchdog group American Oversight via a Freedom of Information Act request found two emails sent by Ivanka Trump's private email address to Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon on the topic of women's entrepreneurship.

It's an interesting time to launch a yogurt-making machine. Yomee, a new countertop kitchen gadget, makes yogurt in six hours from milk and a block of powdered cultures. The product, priced at $149, debuted on Kickstarter on Tuesday. The Yomee looks like a small blender. You fill the container with any kind of milk, even almond or soy, and push a Yomee pod into the top of the machine. \nEach pod is filled with what resembles a stub of chalk and comes in Greek, regular and stirred (also known as Swiss) varieties. It costs $0.99 each and produces two servings. That's less than what you'll likely pay at the supermarket. \nThe launch, more than a year in the making, comes barely a month after the epic fall of Juicero, the $400 connected juicer. \nBoth are hardware startups selling a healthier way to make a common food item easily found in stores. Juicero and Yomee come with accompanying apps and require you to buy a custom ingredient to work, similar to Keurig coffee machines. \nJuicero's individual juice bags ran between $7 and $10 -- the juicer itself originally cost $700 and was later lowered to $400. \nBefore the industry realized you could just squeeze the bags with your hands, Juicero raised an incredible $120 million from big name Silicon Valley investors. \nWhile Lecker Labs -- maker of Yomee -- hasn't quite neared that amount, it's raised $350,000 dollars so far, primarily from angel Investors Michael Berro, SOSV and Girish Mithran. \n\"We are more traditional than [Juicero],\" said founder and CEO Ashok Jaiswal. \"We're going the Kickstarter route. Crowdfunding allows you to validate your idea before you blow up millions of dollars.\" \nWhen he was a kid up in Delhi, India, Jaiswal's mother made yogurt from scratch. Years later, while living Hong Kong, he was inspired to make his own for his daughter. \nBut making it was harder than his mom led him to believe. Jaiswal said store-bought yogurt, filled with sugar and preservatives, has fewer active cultures -- and tastes different when not fresh. Even with existing yogurt machines, you typically have to heat the milk separately first. \nFive protoytpes later, Jaiswal has a machine and the ingredients he thinks does it all. \nRelated: Startup behind ridiculed $400 juicer shuts down \nEach Yomee pod contains a combination of rice powder, yogurt culture and a binding agent. Jaiswal says the cultures can be stored at room temperature for up to six months. \nA copper probe, which dips into the milk, controls the temperature and does all the work. After six hours of heating, cooling and boiling off water, the Yomee had made two servings of yogurt. You can add honey and sugar to taste, or keep it tart. The company plans to add flavored pods in the future. \nThe app includes recipes and keeps track of the yogurt making process, how much yogurt you've consumed and your pod orders. \nJaiswal and Lecker Labs co-founder Tu-Hien Le are still planning out the next steps. Currently part of the Food X accelerator in New York, the startup wants to raise $28,000 on Kickstarter and possibly another round of funding. Eventually, it intends to sell Yomee on Amazon and hit retail stores by the end of 2018. \nBut one thing Jaiswal is not too worried is about: becoming another Juicero. \n\"How do you get $120 million and burn it all?\" he said. \"I don't know.\" CNNMoney (San Francisco) First published September 26, 2017: 12:59 PM ET Mortgage ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T20:35:20.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "98f4faab62e14b19b226cb95a46e7021f0123db0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdpzrlanK_9eiJ5whLQlMBymoaPmRl1ZAHftTcjSsk7du5UOvK7BYqkB_EAlCcKpohXNCgoDCmDNZQ--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Microsoft Office 2019 is coming next year", "title_full": "Microsoft Office 2019 is coming next year", "published": "2017-09-26T20:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170613170556-microsoft-critical-security-update-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 749, "comments": 0, "shares": 749}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1451}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "98f4faab62e14b19b226cb95a46e7021f0123db0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdpzrlanK_9eiJ5whLQlMBymoaPmRl1ZAHftTcjSsk7du5UOvK7BYqkB_EAlCcKpohXNCgoDCmDNZQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T20:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Microsoft Office 2019 is coming next year", "text": "Microsoft Office 2019 is coming next year by Selena Larson @selenalarson September 26, 2017: 1:09 PM ET Microsoft and Adobe form cloud partnership Microsoft's next big update for Office is coming soon.

While Microsoft's cloud-based Office suite, Office 365, has been steadily adding subscribers, not everyone wants to make the leap. The 2019 suite is for people who don't want their apps and services in the cloud. It will include the standard apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook, and server versions of Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint and Skype for Business. \nRelated: Microsoft brings back developer behind Word and Excel \nOffice 2019 will include more IT features and server upgrades to improve usability, voice and security, the company said at its Microsoft Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida. Pricing has not yet been announced. \nExcel users will notice updated formulas and charts, and PowerPoint will get new animation features. The apps will also come with better inking capabilities for mobile devices -- such as pressure sensitivity and tilt effects. \nMicrosoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) said previews of its new products will start shipping in the middle of next year. \nMicrosoft is hyping the cloud this week, but the company says the standalone suite will be valuable for businesses who want to keep apps and servers on-site. \nThe last major update to the suite was Microsoft Office 2016, which came out in 2015.

The New York Times reported Monday night that that \"at least six\" officials used private email to conduct White House business after Politico first reported that Jared Kushner , the President's son-in-law and senior adviser, periodically used a private email account. The use of private email was a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election, when then-candidate Trump frequently slammed his opponent Hillary Clinton's use of a private server during her time as secretary of state. Several of the emails Clinton sent or received were later determined to be classified by various government agencies , though Clinton had said that none of the emails were marked classified at the time she sent them. Hillary Clinton's email controversy, explained There was no indication that the White House officials who used personal email maintained their accounts on a private server or that they shared classified information. Former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and others occasionally used personal email during their time at the White House, two sources with knowledge of the emails told CNN. Read More Kushner's lawyer Abbe Lowell also confirmed to CNN on Sunday that Kushner occasionally used a private email account for correspondence with fellow administration officials. \"Mr. Kushner uses his White House email address to conduct White House business,\" Lowell said in a statement. \"Fewer than a hundred emails from January through August were either sent to or returned by Mr. Kushner to colleagues in the White House from his personal email account.\" Lowell said that the emails on Kushner's private account were \"usually forwarded news articles or political commentary and most often occurred when someone initiated the exchange by sending an email to his personal, rather than his White House, address.\" White House officials are advised to use their official White House email addresses for official business and though it is not illegal to use personal email, federal law requires all White House records -- including emails -- be preserved. Attorney: Kushner used private email account to talk to WH officials \"All White House personnel have been instructed to use official email to conduct all government related work,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"They are further instructed that if they receive work-related communication on personal accounts, they should be forwarded to official email accounts.\" While the White House has not issued any new warnings or guidance, one source said lawyers in the Office of the White House Counsel periodically remind White House staff to forward any personal emails to their official account to ensure they are recorded in accordance with the Presidential Records Act. Kushner did just that, Lowell said, noting that \"all non-personal emails were forwarded to his official address, and all have been preserved, in any event.\" Ivanka Trump, an assistant to the President, also used her private email to correspond with administration officials about working on policy issues before she was officially named to a White House position in March. According to The New York Times, Stephen Miller, a top adviser and presidential speechwriter, and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn also used private email accounts. CNN has not independently verified this reporting. Documents obtained by watchdog group American Oversight via a Freedom of Information Act request found two emails sent by Ivanka Trump's private email address to Small Business Administrator Linda McMahon on the topic of women's entrepreneurship. The emails were sent February 28, nearly a month before Trump formally stepped into her White House role as assistant to the President. However, she referred to White House staffer Julie Radford as \"my chief of staff\" in one of the emails.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gary cohn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reince priebus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "julie radford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen miller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abbe lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda mcmahon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivanka trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lowell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah sanders", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "multiple white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "politico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american oversight", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national economic council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of the white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T20:44:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a51a68df0ede3d6517b7281016a4344b02dbc986", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEQvEhNbxVmHwABhayDm_MyiIAfxyWyxAa6TmOnbevLxHHVg71D0Sx7k7Zmbxs6wxk-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Who is Cardi B? - CNN", "title_full": "Who is Cardi B? - CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926101752-cardi-b-rapper-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 634, "comments": 0, "shares": 634}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a51a68df0ede3d6517b7281016a4344b02dbc986", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEQvEhNbxVmHwABhayDm_MyiIAfxyWyxAa6TmOnbevLxHHVg71D0Sx7k7Zmbxs6wxk-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Respers France", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Who is Cardi B? - CNN", "text": "Story highlights She made history on the charts (CNN) To borrow a word that Cardi B is now somewhat famous for, she's looking to be a part of the music industry \"forever.\" \nThe rapper is off to a pretty good start. She made history on Monday by bumping singer Taylor Swift from the no. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Cardi B, whose birth name is Belcalis Almanzar, became the first female rapper to achieve that milestone as a solo artist since since Lauryn Hill in 1998. The song she did it with, \"Bodak Yellow (Money Moves),\" has become one of the jams of the year -- an ear worm that's almost impossible to escape these days. Read More Here's what you need to know about Cardi B: She don't dance now, she makes money moves A former exotic dancer, she first came to fame via her no-holds-barred social media presence. Fans got to see a lot of Cardi B in the early days of her Instagram account, and she was proud to show off -- and discuss -- her plastic-surgery-enhanced body. Not to mention her sexuality, her profanity-laden comments and her desire to become famous and make lots of money. Which brings us to how she got on the path to music stardom. Love & Hip Hop Her viral presence helped secure her a spot on VH1's popular reality series \"Love & Hip Hop: New York\" during Season 6 in 2015. Tension between Cardi B and the girlfriend of fellow cast member DJ Self figured prominently in the season's storyline and resulted in Cardi B uttering one of the show's most famous lines ever. \"A girl have beef with me, she gonna have beef with me,\" she said with a pause and a dramatic turn.\"Forever.\" Speaking of catchphrases Cardi B has a way with words and one in particular has become linked to her. If you hear someone referring to money as \"schmoney,\" they may have gotten it from her. Rapper Bobby Shmurda did the \"Schmoney Dance\" song, but Cardi B helped to make it even more popular. By the way, the word refers to making money quietly as in \"shhh money.\" The reverse \"Despicito\" The Bronx born artist is Dominican and Trinidadian and paid homage to her Latina roots by doing a Spanish language version of \"Bodak Yellow.\" Latin rap star Messiah joins her on the track, which she said on social media was inspired by her family. \"A lot of my family members on my dad['s] side of the family don't understand English,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"I wanted to make them proud. S I did BODAK YELLOW IN SPANISH!!!\" Ok sooo here it is GUYS ! On ITUNES NOW !!!

Daddy Yankee, was first recorded in Spanish and then a second version was released with some English lyrics and Justin Bieber. She's getting so much love Some folks may have taken her as a joke when she first came into the rap game, but Cardi B is making everyone a believer now. She's earned nine nominations for this year's BET Hip Hop Awards, including best new artist and single of the year. That puts her in company with producer DJ Khaled and rapper Kendrick Lamar, who also have nine nominations. Vogue followed her as she got ready for the \"Mothership\" Vogueing Ball that kicked off New York Fashion Week. One of the biggest marks of Cardi B's arrival was the seal of approval from fellow raptress Nicki Minaj, who congratulated Cardi B on nabbing the top of the charts.

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \n(CNN) The painful debate about the causes and cures for racial injustice in America flares periodically to capture the nation's attention. It did again over the weekend when many NFL players locked arms or knelt in protest during the playing of the National Anthem at football games across the country.\nThe protests were triggered by President Donald Trump's comments at an Alabama rally on Friday and subsequent tweets challenging the patriotism of athletes who kneel during the playing of the anthem. He suggested that these \"son of a \" athletes had dishonored the flag and deserve to be fired by their NFL employers. On Monday the President defended his attacks, even after team owners issued their own angry responses to his temper tantrum. This conflict has stirred impassioned debate around the nation about larger questions: the right to protest peacefully in a manner that many Americans, nonetheless, perceive as a form of disrespect for the flag or our troops, and the concern held by many that our President was focused on a few protesting football players instead of on the North Korean crisis, health care or Puerto Rico's recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Trump's ugly battles with the NFL go way back One often-heard, but inaccurate, refrain among the talking heads was that the athletes had a \"legal right\" to peacefully protest in football stadiums across the country because the US Constitution guarantees freedom of speech. \"It's a free country\" this line of thinking goes, and American soldiers have fought and lost their lives to preserve this sacred right. The fact is, these athletes do not have the \"right\" to protest at football games unless their employers consent to the conduct. Their private employers have a legal right under the US Constitution to fire or suspend players who engage in acts of protest on the field during the playing of the National Anthem and the display of Old Glory. Imagine what would happen if some of the TV anchors or commentators decided to \"take a knee\" during their shows in an act of protest. Read More My bet is that in most places they would be fired or suspended -- as would protesting bank tellers, store clerks, security guards, restaurant workers or anyone else with a job to do. As an attorney, I would likely be held in contempt of court if I interrupted my presentation to a judge to protest racial injustice in America by kneeling. Finally, a reason to watch the NFL again Yes, America is a \"free country,\" whose citizens enjoy greater liberty and \"freedom of speech\" than any place on Earth, but even here there are limitations to these rights. The courts have repeatedly affirmed restrictions on time and place in the legitimate exercise of our Constitutional rights. Try shouting your opposition to the Trump administration during a Broadway show and see what happens. You'll have to ask a friend how the show ended. You can explain your inaccurate concept of free speech as the usher throws you out of the theater. The First Amendment of the US Constitution outlines both the extent and limitation of our most important rights. It states: \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" Notice the words \"Congress shall make no law...\" The Founding Fathers made no mention of restricting the right of the National Football League or any other private employer to \"prohibit\" or \"abridge\" the freedom of speech. Colin Kaepernick should please take notice of the wording the next time he claims that his right to protest was violated when no team would sign him after he became a free agent. He had no \"on the field\" free speech rights under the Constitution. Perhaps he should consider registering to vote if he really wants to change public policy. What Trump's NFL, Curry remarks should signal to his base The First Amendment restricts only the government from abridging \"the freedom of speech.\" Private employers can do as they please. Thus, kneeling during the National Anthem can never be legally prohibited by the government, but can always be prohibited by private employers. NFL owners have so far made no attempt to create a league-wide rule on the matter of these protests. Much will undoubtedly depend on how the controversy affects ticket sales and whether the President continues to stir the pot with early morning tweets. A Reuters poll conducted last year when Kaepernick's protest methodology was a hot topic suggested that 72% of Americans viewed Colin Kaepernick's protest actions as \"unpatriotic,\" despite his stated rationale. The same poll, however, concluded that only 40% of minorities disagreed with the Kaepernick's form of protest, suggesting a big racial divide on the issue -- and potentially among sports fans as well. Join us on Twitter and Facebook \n\n\nWhichever side of the issue is a winner for sports fans, they should be clear about one thing.

Mark Warner says the \"million-dollar question\" still unanswered about the Facebook election ads sold to Russian-linked accounts was how the Russians knew whom to target on Facebook.\nWarner, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel, told CNN the committee expects this week to begin viewing the 3,000 Russian-linked Facebook ads, which Facebook earlier this month disclosed were connected to more than 450 inauthentic accounts. Facebook agreed last week to turn the ads over to the House and Senate intelligence committees. Warner's burning question involves not just the content of the ads but how they were deployed. \"Did they know this just by following political news in America? Did they geo-target both geography and by demographics in ways that at least at first blush appear pretty sophisticated? These are the kind of questions that we need to get answered and that's why we need them in a public hearing,\" Warner said. The Virginia Democrat said it was \"too early to tell\" whether any Trump campaign officials were associated with the ads. Read More \"I raised this issue back last winter at that point Facebook was dismissive that there was anything there. We've now seen that there was a lot there in terms of paid advertising, fake accounts, pushing people towards rallies, trying to sow division and chaos,\" Warner said. \"And that's why I'm anxious to review the materials they are sending in to the committee.\" But Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the committee, said there's \"no evidence yet\" that Russians and Trump officials colluded on the Facebook ads, though he said it's an area the committee continues to investigate. Burr said the effort appeared to be more about sowing chaos on both sides of the political spectrum. \"The social media platforms look to be a tool that were utilized by a foreign power to impact the 2016 elections,\" Burr said. \"Is there collusion? None that anybody can see.\" The Senate intelligence panel has met with Facebook officials in a closed session, and Twitter officials are coming to talk to the intelligence panel on Thursday in a closed session. \"A lot of the same claims that have been made about Facebook, have also been made about Twitter,\" Warner said, adding that it was \"too early\" to tell if they would be cooperative with congressional efforts to determine the scope of Russian attempts to use social media in the 2016 election. Burr says he wants to have a public hearing with Facebook and other social media companies as early as next month. But the North Carolina Republican does not think it's the committee's job to make the ads public when they are given to the committee. \"We don't routinely release any information that's shared with the committee and I'd like to keep the committee in that mode,\" he said.

The debate that Sessions will enter has in recent months become a violent one. In February, on the campus of the University of California, Berkeley, black-clad agitators smashed windows and hurled Molotov cocktails ahead of a planned appearance by far-right controversialist Milo Yiannopoulos. At Middlebury College in Vermont in March , protests outside the speech of a conservative political scientist devolved into a shoving match that left one professor hospitalized. Flashpoints around hot-button speakers, alongside a trend of trigger warnings and safe spaces, have fueled reputations that places of higher education are hostile to the First Amendment. More US adults surveyed by Gallup last year thought that Americans' ability to exercise their free speech rights is weaker today than 20 years ago (40%), than those who thought it was stronger (31%). Read More Sessions has a strong interest in First Amendment protection and has discussed publicly remarking on university turbulence for months, according to the source familiar with the speech. Students and faculty members of Georgetown's law school say they plan on protesting the attorney general's speech. \"I find it hypocritical for a member of the Trump administration to act as a champion for free speech while the President has consistently mocked and insulted those trying to exercise the very same rights,\" said Richard Hand, a third-year law student at the university. \"I think we understand those things without him having to tell us that, \" added third-year student Spencer McManus. \"I don't deny that he has the right to say what he wants and what he thinks -- I certainly believe that very strongly. It's the irony of him coming here.\" The law students, who helped organize a rally expected to draw hundreds, point towards Trump's recent fight with NFL players who have protested civil rights abuses during National Anthem performances and the Justice Department's decision to prosecute a woman who laughed at Sessions during his confirmation hearing as examples of the hypocrisy. The woman, Desiree Fairooz, faces a November trial over charges of unlawful conduct after she rejected a plea deal offered by prosecutors earlier this year. Sessions has regularly faced small groups of protestors outside his speeches around the country, many denouncing his views on criminal justice and policing issues. A Georgetown Law spokeswoman said Monday night that the campus has \"designated protest areas for high-profile speaker events\" and that entry into the law school buildings are restricted to members of the school community and their invited guests. \"We are committed to upholding the values of academic freedom and serving as a forum for the free exchange of ideas, even when those ideas may be difficult, controversial or objectionable to some,\" spokeswoman Tanya Weinberg said. Some on Monday also criticized the university's ticketing of the address, which is only open to a small group of students that have in the past signed up to attend at least one event held by its host organization, The group, the Georgetown Center for the Constitution, says it hosts programs to examine \"how best to remain faithful to the Constitution's text.\" Professor Randy Barnett, the right-leaning law professor who leads the group and is slated to speak Tuesday after Sessions, also invited students from his classes, Weinberg said. Both policies, she said, are in line with university policy \"given limited capacity.\" Sessions will be met before his Georgetown appearance also with a statement signed by 44 members of the university law school faculty rebuking his remarks and saying that \"a man who fails to recognize paradigmatic violations of the First Amendment is a poor choice to speak about free speech on campuses.\" Prof. Alicia Plerhoples, one of the law professor organizers of the statement, said many of her colleagues planned to protest Sessions and the administration's views on free speech by \"taking a knee\" outside the auditorium where the attorney general is scheduled to speak -- a reference to the growing NFL National Anthem protests.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "milo yiannopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard hand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alicia plerhoples", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "randy barnett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spencer mcmanus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanya weinberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "desiree fairooz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "weinberg", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "university of california, berkeley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown university law center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl national anthem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown law", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national anthem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middlebury college", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgetown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgetown center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T20:44:25.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6ec3c885e57fccf59d917c7149e0313fd5e82223", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEu4F_XEy.sdnheL.RtE3a3iK7a94NvYNTFTU7o1TBqLTV_N.aJSdSSCW_N84As823x_gE8Q.9UJDnlS_Lxntpp", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Macron lays out grand plan for relaunched European Union - CNN", "title_full": "Macron lays out grand plan for relaunched European Union - CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926100852-01-macron-speech-0926-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 338, "comments": 0, "shares": 338}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 41}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6ec3c885e57fccf59d917c7149e0313fd5e82223", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEu4F_XEy.sdnheL.RtE3a3iK7a94NvYNTFTU7o1TBqLTV_N.aJSdSSCW_N84As823x_gE8Q.9UJDnlS_Lxntpp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Bu Hilary Clarke, CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Macron lays out grand plan for relaunched European Union - CNN", "text": "(CNN) French President Emmanuel Macron has laid out a sweeping plan to relaunch the European Union, calling for greater harmonization in key policy areas and raising the prospect that the UK could rejoin a reformed bloc.\nIn a marathon, 90-minute speech at the Sorbonne in Paris, Macron sought to present a new vision for the EU as it reels under the rise of far-right nationalism, mass migration and Brexit. Macron called for a joint military \"rapid response force,\" a common defense budget, a single asylum system and an EU border force. He said the single-currency eurozone should have its own budget and finance minister. \"The Europe we know is too weak, too slow, too inefficient, but only Europe gives us the capacity to act on the world stage in the face of the big, contemporary challenges,\" he said. We can say goodbye to a stable Germany Macron campaigned for the French presidency on a forcefully pro-European platform. But his vision has been complicated by the German election results and the bloody nose they inflicted on Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose cooperation will be vital to achieving his aims. Read More Merkel's conservative Christian Democratic Union party and its sister grouping, the Christian Social Union, obtained just 33% of the vote and will need to forge a deal with other parties to govern. The CDU was already resistant to handing more budgetary powers to Brussels. One of her likely coalition partners, the pro-business FDP, is even more hostile to the idea. In his speech, Macron called for a single EU corporate tax band by 2020, saying members who refused to implement it should have their aid from Brussels cut. Macron urged reform of the controversial Common Agricultural Policy farm subsidy system, including tougher measures to fight fraud within it. Traditionally, France has been the biggest beneficiary and staunch defender of the CAP. French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech on the European Union at the amphitheater of the Sorbonne University on September 26, 2017 in Paris. He also suggested an increase in development aid for Africa, which he said should no longer be treated as a problem \"but as a partner.\" He proposed to finance this by extending the UK's system of taxing property transactions, known as stamp duty. to across the EU and increasing taxes on carbon fuels as a means of transforming the economic model to a more environmentally friendly system. \"The only path that assures our future is the rebuilding of a Europe that is sovereign, united and democratic,\" Macron said. The French President's speech echoed one given 25 years ago by former EU Commission President and architect of the single market Jacques Delors. It was lauded by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, who said the EU needed \"courage\" to move forward. \"A very European speech by my friend Emmanuel Macron. Europe needs courage. Thank you for your support for the work of the EU institutions,\" Juncker, the head of the EU's executive arm, said on Twitter.

He worked as an unarmed security officer and had recently reinstated his license. It remains to be seen how he ended up, as police allege, parked in the church lot as Sunday service was ending. In his possession he had two pistols, a tactical vest and three magazines of ammunition (as well as an empty one); in his car he had an AR-15 rifle in its case and a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. His last Facebook post was at 10:26 a.m., about 30 minutes before he arrived at the church, according to an affidavit. \"Everything you've ever doubted or made to be believe as false, is real. & vice versa, B.\" Read More Church members knew him Samson is charged with felony homicide and is being held without bond. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Police say he is accused of killing one woman and injuring seven more in a shooting spree that ended when a church usher intervened. During the altercation, Samson accidentally shot himself in the chest with his own weapon, police said. Police say they are trying to establish his motive. Nashville police said Samson acknowledged opening fire in the church. He also told officers he had attended the church in the past. An usher is hailed as a hero for stopping a church gunman Church members confirmed this, telling police he attended the church about two years ago but that they had not seen him in a while. They did not immediately recognize him because the gunman was masked. Some members of the congregation, who declined to give their names because they did not want to speak for the church beyond its official statement, recalled Samson fondly. They said he was friendly to everyone, including one of the people he allegedly shot. He made mysterious Facebook posts Samson's Facebook account offers fragments of the image he created of himself for social media consumption. Church member William Brimm confirmed the account was Samson's. It lists his name, Emanuel K. Samson, and another name he uses, Bulda. It says he is from Khartoum, Sudan and that he went to Smyrna High School in Smyrna, Tennessee, graduating in 2010. It also says he studied psychology at an unspecified community college. CNN has not independently verified these details. Police initially said Samson is from La Vergne, Tennessee, but on his Facebook page he says he lives in nearby Murfreesboro. His languages are Arabic, English and Acholi, according to the page. He lists no political views. \"Your votes mean nothing,\" reads one post. Shooter kills one, wounds 7 at Tennessee church His favorite quotes include one from Right Said Fred's 1992 party anthem: \"I'm, so sexy for my shirt ... so sexy, it hurts.\" His penultimate quote before the shooting reads, \"Become the creator instead of what's created. Whatever you say goes.\" And, before that, at 10:18 a.m.: \"You are more than what they told us.\" One quote from his personal description now stands out, though it is not known when it was written. \"No need for a life story,\" it says. \"You probably heard about me.\" He quit his job as a security guard On Saturday, the day before the shooting, Samson worked a shift as a security guard for Crimson Security in Nashville, police spokesman Don Aaron said. He sent an email Sunday at 10:01 a.m., within an hour of the shooting, saying he appreciated the opportunity to work but would not be returning. State records indicate Samson had held an unarmed security license between 2014-2016, Nashville police said. It had expired, and Samson had attended a class on Friday to reinstate the unarmed license. He had past encounters with police Police responded to two domestic calls at a Murfreesboro home involving Samson and his former girlfriend. In January, police responded to an address listed as Samson's home in Murfreesboro. During an argument, Jeanna Ambrose told police that Samson punched her TV and broke a small figurine, according to a police report. They were fighting because he believed she had cheated on him, she told police. As she tried to leave the apartment, he demanded to speak to her and took her phone. She called police from a neighbor's home. Motive sought in deadly Tennessee church shooting In March, police returned to the same home. Samson told officers he used to date Ambrose and was trying to break off contact with her but she \"keeps coming around,\" according to a police report. He said that, after a brief conversation at the door, she started to get loud and tried to push his door open as he tried to close it. Samson told police that he was in fear because \"she has struck him in the past\" but said she had not threatened or assaulted him that day. Ambrose told police she had come over to pick up some belongings and said she did not threaten or assault him. Officers helped Ambrose retrieve her belongings and told her not to return to the apartment, the report states. Samson was told that he could no longer have contact with her. His next contact with police was on June 27. Murfreesboro Police responded to the home of Samson's father after a 911 call reporting suicidal threats. His father told police that Samson had texted him shortly after midnight saying he had a gun to his head, according to a police report. Samson's father said he tried unsuccessfully to reach his son on the phone and did not know where he was. Police pinged Samson's phone and found him at the Nashville office of security service provider G4S, Nashville Police said Monday. A police officer met Samson at the office, where Samson told him that he was fine and not thinking of harming himself. The officer was satisfied that he was not a danger and left him.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T20:44:26.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "20c48e53abe8ef74a8fa44bcc0f459b4a0d545cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRRQW0cfh6XBeVnWhy29.NrjpRW9n7LioApGyybyp2K2qDJIr3u7Xqa5ewgvAV7WqBA--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Steve Bannon totally savaged Mitch McConnell in Alabama - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Steve Bannon totally savaged Mitch McConnell in Alabama - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926122447-steve-bannon-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2852, "comments": 0, "shares": 2852}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "20c48e53abe8ef74a8fa44bcc0f459b4a0d545cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRRQW0cfh6XBeVnWhy29.NrjpRW9n7LioApGyybyp2K2qDJIr3u7Xqa5ewgvAV7WqBA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Analysis by Chris Cillizza", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Steve Bannon totally savaged Mitch McConnell in Alabama - CNNPolitics", "text": "(CNN) Steve Bannon isn't a huge Mitch McConnell fan. We know this. \nBut, what Bannon, who until last month was a senior strategist to President Donald Trump, said about the Senate majority leader -- and House Speaker Paul Ryan -- on Monday night in Alabama was over-the-top even for Bannon. Here's a sampling: \"Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country. They think you're a pack of morons. They think you're nothing but rubes. They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do.\" \"I told (Trump) I was going to go after the establishment, go after the establishment first and the Democrats later. Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan have allowed three investigative committees on Capitol Hill with full subpoena power, they're going after President Trump every day.\" \" Mitch McConnell ... Karl Rove, all the instruments that tried to destroy Roy Moore and his family: Your day of reckoning is coming. \" The backdrop for Bannon's comments was a rally for Roy Moore, the former Alabama state Supreme Court justice who is running in Tuesday's special election runoff for the unexpired term of US Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Moore's opponent is appointed Sen. Luther Strange, who has the endorsement of Trump, McConnell and virtually every member of the GOP's political establishment. Read More Strange's allies -- led by a McConnell-aligned super PAC -- have dumped more than $9 million into the race to boost the incumbent , who finished second behind Moore in the August GOP primary . Bannon, Farage say Roy Moore can save Trump from himself Bannon is known for his bluster and for grandiose verbiage describing the stakes of, well, everything. He's also known to loathe the Republican political establishment -- a view that led him to ally with Trump long before anyone knew the real estate mogul was serious about running for president in 2016. What's clear from Bannon's comments on Monday night, however, is that he doesn't believe the war against his own party ended with Trump's election. He thinks it's only just begun. Bannon said as much. \"I told (Trump) I was going to go after the establishment, go after the establishment first and the Democrats later,\" he told the crowd. (A question: Did Trump bless that approach?) Think about this: The former top political strategist for the Republican President of the United States called the two top Republicans in Congress \"the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country.\" He added that they are \"going after President Trump every day.\" And, most ominously, Bannon promised McConnell and former Bush White House political Svengali Rove that \"your day of reckoning is coming.\" Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Imagine for a second if David Axelrod, who held a similar role in Barack Obama's White House, not only campaigned against the president's chosen candidate in a primary but also savaged Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi -- and told them their day of reckoning was coming. It would be a MASSIVE story -- and rightly so. Because we have been so inoculated to the oddities of every day in the Trump administration, there's a tendency to just skip over Bannon's comments. We shouldn't. A prominent member of Trump's inner circle is blasting the top leaders of his party and promising retribution. That's a big deal with real implications for Trump's already-fraught relationship with his party in Congress.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luther strange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karl rove", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry reid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david axelrod", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T20:44:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "91239963abb551ff277358ec0eb673709a96b207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRfbv1MUu0cAqtt_xu6i70Qlhki1ZMQ_qh0oK7DjwshjwHAhT9jGVjTyxuXTFK4BRhA--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Trump: I will go to Puerto Rico next Tuesday - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Trump: I will go to Puerto Rico next Tuesday - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170925112019-03-trump-09-24-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "91239963abb551ff277358ec0eb673709a96b207", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRfbv1MUu0cAqtt_xu6i70Qlhki1ZMQ_qh0oK7DjwshjwHAhT9jGVjTyxuXTFK4BRhA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Betsy Klein", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump: I will go to Puerto Rico next Tuesday - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights President Trump will travel to Puerto Rico next Tuesday The island was devastated by Hurricane Maria Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday he will travel to storm-ravaged Puerto Rico next Tuesday.\nSpeaking in the Oval Office, Trump said it was the earliest date he could reach the devastated island due to first responders' ongoing relief and recovery efforts. Trump said the US territory was \"literally destroyed.\" \"I know many Puerto Ricans, and they're great people and we have to help them. It really was devastated. Some people say, I read it this morning, it's literally destroyed,\" he said, adding, \"The infrastructure was in bad shape as you know in Puerto Rico before the storm, and now in many cases, it has no infrastructure, so it's, you're really starting from almost scratch.\" He said he may also stop in the US Virgin Islands during the Tuesday trip. The number of times Trump has tweeted about the NFL vs Puerto Rico Read More Unlike the efforts following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, Trump said, recovery is more challenging in Puerto Rico due to its geography. \"It's very tough because it's an island. In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there, you know, we've got A-pluses on Texas and Florida and we will also on Puerto Rico, but the difference is this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean, and it's a big ocean, it's a very big ocean, and I think we're doing a really good job.\" He touted FEMA's work, noting the \"hourly\" landing of water and food supplies to Puerto Rico's airport runways, which he described as \"devastated\" and \"broken.\" Earlier Tuesday, Trump vowed that federal assistance is on its way to Puerto Rico, a day after he commented for the first time in days about the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria since it made landfall on the US territory. \"Thank you to Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc. We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way,\" he wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning, moments after Yul\u00edn Cruz appeared on CNN's \"New Day.\" Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 Sharing harrowing details of rescue efforts in her city, Yul\u00edn Cruz praised the Federal Emergency Management Agency's \"great job\" and \"logistics help.\" \"Our bodies are so tired, but our souls are so full of strength that we will get to everyone we can get to,\" she said. Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico last week, whipping the island with Irma-level winds, drenching it in Harvey-level flooding, crippling communications, decimating buildings and damaging a dam that puts downstream residents at risk of catastrophe. Without power and communications for much of the island, millions of people have been cut off from the world since the hurricane hit.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Cardi B backstage at Revolution Live on September 25, 2017 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Story highlights She made history on the charts (CNN) To borrow a word that Cardi B is now somewhat famous for, she's looking to be a part of the music industry \"forever.\" The rapper is off to a pretty good start. She made history on Monday by bumping singer Taylor Swift from the no. 1 spot on Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Cardi B, whose birth name is Belcalis Almanzar, became the first female rapper to achieve that milestone as a solo artist since since Lauryn Hill in 1998. The song she did it with, \"Bodak Yellow (Money Moves),\" has become one of the jams of the year -- an ear worm that's almost impossible to escape these days. Read More Here's what you need to know about Cardi B: She don't dance now, she makes money moves A former exotic dancer, she first came to fame via her no-holds-barred social media presence. Fans got to see a lot of Cardi B in the early days of her Instagram account, and she was proud to show off -- and discuss -- her plastic-surgery-enhanced body. Not to mention her sexuality, her profanity-laden comments and her desire to become famous and make lots of money. Which brings us to how she got on the path to music stardom. Love & Hip Hop Her viral presence helped secure her a spot on VH1's popular reality series \"Love & Hip Hop: New York\" during Season 6 in 2015. Tension between Cardi B and the girlfriend of fellow cast member DJ Self figured prominently in the season's storyline and resulted in Cardi B uttering one of the show's most famous lines ever. \"A girl have beef with me, she gonna have beef with me,\" she said with a pause and a dramatic turn.\"Forever.\" Speaking of catchphrases Cardi B has a way with words and one in particular has become linked to her. If you hear someone referring to money as \"schmoney,\" they may have gotten it from her. Rapper Bobby Shmurda did the \"Schmoney Dance\" song, but Cardi B helped to make it even more popular. By the way, the word refers to making money quietly as in \"shhh money.\" The reverse \"Despicito\" The Bronx born artist is Dominican and Trinidadian and paid homage to her Latina roots by doing a Spanish language version of \"Bodak Yellow.\" Latin rap star Messiah joins her on the track, which she said on social media was inspired by her family. \"A lot of my family members on my dad['s] side of the family don't understand English,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"I wanted to make them proud. S I did BODAK YELLOW IN SPANISH!!!\" A post shared by Cardi B Official IG (@iamcardib) on Aug 18, 2017 at 5:31am PDT Another summer hit, \"Despacito\" by Luis Fonsi ft. Daddy Yankee, was first recorded in Spanish and then a second version was released with some English lyrics and Justin Bieber. She's getting so much love Some folks may have taken her as a joke when she first came into the rap game, but Cardi B is making everyone a believer now. She's earned nine nominations for this year's BET Hip Hop Awards, including best new artist and single of the year. That puts her in company with producer DJ Khaled and rapper Kendrick Lamar, who also have nine nominations. Vogue followed her as she got ready for the \"Mothership\" Vogueing Ball that kicked off New York Fashion Week. One of the biggest marks of Cardi B's arrival was the seal of approval from fellow raptress Nicki Minaj, who congratulated Cardi B on nabbing the top of the charts.

Last week's executive order will penalize any company or person doing business with North Korea by either cutting off their access to the U.S. financial system or freezing their assets -- or potentially both. \nOn Tuesday, the administration designated eight North Korean banks, including Agricultural Development Bank, Cheil Credit Bank and International Industrial Bank. The administration also took the additional step of designating 26 people linked to North Korea's financial network. The Treasury Department said they are North Koreans acting as representatives of North Korean banks in China, Russia, Libya and the United Arab Emirates. \nThe North Korean regime is believed to use a complex network of front companies to do business in China and other countries in order to dodge sanctions. \nRelated: Will latest sanctions make Kim Jong Un sweat \nTrump has been pushing China to use its deep economic ties with North Korea to pressure the country's young leader to back down from developing nuclear weapons. China is estimated to account for roughly 90% of North Korea's foreign trade, with money and goods flowing back and forth across a land border that runs for 880 miles. \nEven though China has supported a series of tough U.N. resolutions targeting North Korea's economy, many experts are skeptical that Chinese officials and companies are fully complying with the sanctions. And it's uncertain how Chinese banks will respond to the latest round of sanctions by both the U.N. and the U.S. \nEarlier this month, China ordered its financial institutions to take a number of steps to comply with U.N. resolutions, including halting business with sanctioned individuals and companies. Employees at some major Chinese banks told CNNMoney that they were no longer opening new accounts for any North Koreans. \n--CNNMoney's Jethro Mullen contributed to this story. \nCNNMoney (Washington)   26, 2017: 1:44 PM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kim jong", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "steven mnuchin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "treasury department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cheil credit bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "agricultural development bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "international industrial bank", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T20:52:59.001+03:00"}], "totalResults": 7873, "moreResultsAvailable": 7773, "next": "/filterWebContent?token=1eee5ef1-4d51-497e-9e88-ed86353bcda9&format=json&ts=1506448379001&q=language%3Aenglish+site%3Acnn.com&sort=crawled", "requestsLeft": 977}
