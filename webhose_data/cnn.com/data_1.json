King Felipe's hardline address was an unusual departure for the Spanish monarch, who used the majority of his speech to castigate Catalan leaders while making no reference to polling day violence that left nearly 900 people injured. He concluded the address with a call for national unity, while continuing to unleash a verbal assault on the Catalan authorities. \"Today Spanish society is fractured and confronted. Those authorities have underestimated the fondness and feelings of solidarity that have united and will unite the whole of the Spanish population, and with their irresponsible attitude they have put the economic and social stability of Catalonia and Spain at risk,\" he said. On Tuesday night Catalonia's leader, Carles Puigdemont, told the BBC in an interview that his government would unilaterally declare independence by \"the end of this week or the beginning of next.\" If Puigdemont follows through on the promise in the interview, recorded before the king's address, it would further deepen the constitutional crisis facing Spain. Read More King Felipe's decision to intervene in the crisis came after 700,000 people gathered in Barcelona, according to City Police, angered by the harsh treatment meted out by national forces who tried to prevent the banned vote from taking place. Many demonstrated in front of the Barcelona headquarters of the Spanish national police. JUST WATCHED Catalonia: What you need to know Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nCatalonia: What you need to know 01:10 Shops were closed, universities halted classes and transport companies ran reduced services as supporters of Catalonia's bid for independence from Spain attempted to maintain the momentum from Sunday's vote. Facing Spain's biggest political crisis in decades, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held talks with opposition parties in Madrid. Spanish authorities have ordered members of the Guardia Civil, the national security force deployed to Catalonia to block the referendum, to remain on standby in the region for the next week. Protesters joined by firefighters raise their hands during the protest in Barcelona called by Catalan unions. 'The streets will always be ours' Protesters gathering in Barcelona said they were motivated by fury at Sunday's violent crackdown -- the Catalan health ministry said 893 people were injured as riot police raided polling stations, dragged away voters and fired rubber bullets. \"This is a protest against police violence and maintaining momentum after Sunday,\" said Victor Noguer, 27, a firefighter. \"The streets will always be ours,\" protesters chanted, some of them draped in the blue, yellow and red Estelada flag used by Catalan separatists. Protesters wave a Catalan pro-independence 'Estelada' flag as they gather at the Placa de la Universitat square in Barcelona during a general strike in Catalonia called by Catalan unions on October 3, 2017. Officers from the Guardia Civil and the Catalan police force stood guard outside the local headquarters of the Spanish government in Barcelona, where hundreds of firefighters gathered. Other groups of protesters gathered outside the headquarters of the national police, shouting \"Spanish police get out!\" In an interview with CNN at a police control center in the city, Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau condemned Rajoy's decision to deploy national security forces as \"seriously irresponsible.\" \"Why is he throwing thousands of police officers against the population,\" asked Colau, who does not support Catalan independence but was in favor of holding the referendum. \"Why is he keeping thousands of police officers on standby in the city of Barcelona and in Catalonia? What is the message of fear he wants to send?\" Protestors gather in front of the Spanish Partido Popular ruling party headquarters in Barcelona, Spain. The presence of the Spanish national police and the Guardia Civil in Catalonia is a source of increasing tension in the city following Sunday's violence. Animosity is also rising between local and national forces. On Tuesday, the Guardia Civil police union, the AUGC, filed a complaint with the Catalan High Court against the Catalan police, or Mossos d'Esquadra, complaining that they failed in their duties by not enforcing the court ruling that banned the referendum. The AUGC also filed a complaint in connection with the eviction of 200 officers from the Hotel Vila in the Calella district of Barcelona. It called for a judicial inquiry into reports the mayor threatened to withdraw the hotel's license if the Guardia Civil remained there. Spanish newspaper El Pais said two hotels in Barcelona and hotels in Reus, 100 kilometers from the city, have ordered Guardia Civil officers to leave following Sunday's referendum. Spain's Interior Minister, Juan Ignacio Zoido, said Madrid would \"take all necessary measures\" to stop the \"intolerable harassment\" of national security forces. The Catalan government says it earned the right to split from Spain, claiming 90% of those who voted in Sunday's poll were in favour of independence. But the result was not decisive: turnout was low, at around 42%. Catalan independence vote caps four centuries of mistrust Catalan authorities blamed the crackdown for the low turnout, but it remains clear that public opinion in Catalonia is deeply split on independence. Catalonia's President Carles Puigdemont stopped short of declaring independence for Catalonia Monday. According to the referendum law passed by the Catalan Parliament -- and declared illegal by Spain's top court -- authorities have 48 hours after the result to declare a split. Catalan authorities have not yet presented a final result to the Parliament in Barcelona. Puigdemont has called for international mediation to resolve the crisis. Spanish PM unrepentant On Monday, an unrepentant Prime Minister Rajoy met Spanish opposition leaders to discuss the government's next moves. A statement released Monday night by the Spanish government described Sunday's events as a \"serious situation of institutional disobedience in this community.\" Protestors throw referendum ballots as they rally in front of Spain's ruling Partido Popular headquarters in Barcelona. It said that during his meetings the Prime Minister \"has strongly defended the actions of the security forces during [Sunday's] events and has reiterated that more than 400 officers needed (medical) attention and 40 needed emergency attention because of their injuries.\" Rajoy's office said Tuesday that he was considering calling a special session of Spain's Congress of Deputies to discuss the crisis. So far, European Union leaders and the European Commission have backed the Spanish government's opinion that the referendum was illegal. The European Parliament, the EU's only elected body, will discuss the crisis on Wednesday. The Catalan cause is likely to find more sympathizers there, especially from the smaller nations. The UN Commissioner for Human Rights has asked to be allowed to send in experts to examine if citizens' rights have been violated.

Music fans of all ages had flooded the grounds opposite the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip to enjoy the sold-out show.\nBut the concert was violently interrupted when a gunman carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. At least 58 people were killed and more than 500 injured. The shooting has once again reignited the debate around gun rights in the US. Here's how America's gun culture compares to the rest of the world. Although America's unique relationship to guns sits at the forefront of the national psyche, gun culture in the US is often seen as an outlier globally. The number of firearms available to American civilians is estimated at around 310 million, according to a 2009 National Institute of Justice (NIJ) report. Read More India is home to the second largest civilian firearm stockpile, estimated at 46 million. The most updated estimates -- now nearly a decade old -- place the worldwide civilian gun cache at around 650 million. According to Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey, the number of civilian guns has most likely risen since 2007. Firearm production continues to proliferate worldwide, outweighing the effects that gun destruction might have. According to the Small Arms Survey, the exact number of civilian-owned firearms is impossible to pinpoint because of a variety of factors including arms that go unregistered, the illegal trade and global conflict. Related: 8 charts that explain US gun culture further Americans own the most guns per person in the world, about four in 10 saying they either own a gun or live in a home with guns, according to a recent Pew Center study . Forty-eight percent of Americans said they grew up in a house with guns. According to the survey, a majority (66%) of US gun owners own multiple firearms, with nearly three-quarters of gun owners saying they couldn't imagine not owning one. Yemen , home to the world's second-largest gun-owning population per capita (and a country in the throes of a two-and-a-half-year civil conflict) trails significantly behind the US in terms of ownership. When it comes to gun massacres, the US is an anomaly. There are more public mass shootings in America than in any other country in the world. Before Sunday, the 2016 Orlando attack was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with 49 people killed. In 2012, Adam Lanza went on a shooting spree in Newtown, Connecticut, killing his mother before murdering 26 students and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School; in 2007, 32 people were killed in the Virginia Tech massacre. Such massacres have prompted debates about gun control, but they also increase demand for guns. And regulations covering the sale of firearms are looser now that they were just a few months ago. In February, US President Donald Trump signed a measure that scrapped a Obama-era regulation aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of some severely mentally ill people. Related: Mass shootings in America - a visual guide The original rule was part of a series of moves taken by the Obama administration to try and curb gun violence after other efforts failed to advance in Congress. Globally, restrictive gun laws have proven to make a difference in curbing massacres. In Australia, for example, four mass shootings occurred between 1987 and 1996. After those incidents, public opinion turned against gun ownership and Parliament passed stricter gun laws. Australia hasn't had a mass shooting since. The US has one of the highest rates of death by firearm in the developed world, according to World Health Organization data. Our calculations based on OECD data from 2010 show that Americans are 51 times more likely to be killed by gunfire than people in the United Kingdom. Related: Guns kill nearly 1,300 US children each year, study says Most American gun owners (two-thirds) say a major reason they own a gun is for their personal protection, according to the Pew study. However, the majority of America's firearm-related deaths are attributed to self-harm. Gun-related suicides are eight times higher in the US than in other high-income nations. Globally, the US sees fewer gun-related murders than many of its southern neighbors. According to the Small Arms Survey, El Salvador is currently home to the most gun-related murders in the world (excluding active war-zones) with guns killing more than 90 people for every 100,000 of population. From 2010-2015, Honduras saw the highest averages of gun-related homicides, with guns killing 67 out of every 100,000 people there. Venezuela and El Salvador also top the charts over the same five-year period, with 52 and 49 gun-related deaths, respectively, for every 100,000 of population.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "henrik pettersson", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam lanza", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy hook elementary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institute of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nij", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newtown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandalay bay resort and casino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T14:41:11.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2d6d7abf63a80839f6c26af347554ba6f997126a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtJiUtMnleYOyj08o7nHHVDmLna7xlWf4K231WLimDEiKJILRLBDEpNuk1LXoxqYACJZEfxF7oslNwHJZECAxfQD", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss&author=CNN&title=Politics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Politics", "title": "Kremlin hopes Huntsman's arrival will warm US-Russia relations", "title_full": "Kremlin hopes Huntsman's arrival will warm US-Russia relations", "published": "2017-10-03T14:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170919150511-jon-huntsman-09-19-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 224, "comments": 0, "shares": 224}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2d6d7abf63a80839f6c26af347554ba6f997126a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtJiUtMnleYOyj08o7nHHVDmLna7xlWf4K231WLimDEiKJILRLBDEpNuk1LXoxqYACJZEfxF7oslNwHJZECAxfQD", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kremlin hopes Huntsman's arrival will warm US-Russia relations", "text": "Facebook 'designed for information warfare?' 06:33 Story highlights Huntsman served as the US ambassador to China during the Obama administration Huntsman took the position as scrutiny has compounded on the US-Russia relationship (CNN) The Kremlin said it hopes Jon Huntsman, the new US ambassador to Russia who is presenting his credentials to President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, will help improve relations between the two nations. \"President Putin is consistently in favor of reviving our bilateral relations, establishing connections and developing bilateral cooperation.

But it's nightlife of a different kind that appeals to the star-chasers of BeirutVersus. When darkness falls, the amateur astrophotography collective regularly heads out of the Lebanese capital to some of the country's remotest locations Their aim? To capture the beauty of the stars, constellations and galaxies above them. \"Everything in the sky screams to you 'take a beautiful photo of me and discover me more',\" BeirutVesus founder Khalil Azar tells CNN. \"The more you concentrate on a single part of the sky, the more information you can build and the more interesting structures you can find. \"It's always a process of discovery.\" The Antares and Cats Paw nebulae are pictured from the town of Akoura, Lebanon. Growing hobby While astrophotography, the photography of astronomical objects, takes place worldwide, its popularity appears to be growing in Lebanon. Roger Hajjar, an associate professor in astrophysics at Notre Dame University-Louaize near Beirut, says Lebanese astrophotography has been \"booming these past few years.\" He puts this down to three things: good quality camera equipment becoming easily available; the rise of collectives such as BeirutVesus; and social media platforms giving their beautiful images a platform. The Milky Way pictured from near Kfardebian, Lebanon. Azar partakes primarily in \"wide-field astrophotography\" -- this technique captures a broad field of view and can be carried out using commercially available cameras such as DSLR s. Azar says his aim is to use the most \"basic cameras (and lenses) possible to take the most advanced photos\" he can. Others, meanwhile, specialize in mounting cameras on telescopes to further hone in on astronomical details. The resulting images of colorful meteor showers and far-off galaxies are stunning. Dark skies There are plenty of astrophotographers operating across the Gulf nations and North Africa, says Hajjar. And Azar, who manages software projects by day, admits that more remoteparts of Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt have \"darker skies\" than Lebanon. But Lebanon, they agree, has a unique mix of factors that make it an appealing astrophotography destination. The country has as many as 300 clear nights each year, Azar says, and possesses areas of high ground -- advantageous for astrophotography -- that are easily accessible from urban locations. Hajjar speaks of \"paved roads all the way up to 2,000 meters (6,500 ft)\" just an hour from Beirut. \"I don't know of many places where you'd find something like that,\" he says. Being up that high also minimizes the issue of light pollution from nearby cities. The night sky above Akoura, northern Lebanon. Access to clear, dark skies alone, however, does not guarantee good photos. Azar notes that patience is required to become a competent astrophotographer. It can take hours to capture just one photo over a long exposure. More time is then required to sift through the vast amount of celestial detail contained within a wide-field picture using image processing software. A decent knowledge of astronomy is also beneficial. Through BeirutVersus, which has about 20 members, Azar runs regular classes and excursions that explain this process. Later this month, he hopes to collaborate with a sound producer and visual artist on a trip to explore new ways of interpreting astrophotography and its processes. The stars of the show, however, will always be in the night sky above. Click or swipe through the gallery at the top of the page to view the astrophotography of BeirutVersus.

Can its sequel do the same? Updated 4th October 2017 Written by Thomas Page , CNN Renee April knew she was playing with fire talking to the press. Over the course of our phone interview the costume designer wrapped her answers in riddles and apologized profusely. \"They'll kill me,\" the French-Canadian added at one point, laughing. She was referring to the producers behind \"Blade Runner 2049,\" 2017's hotly anticipated sequel to Ridley's Scott's sci-fi masterpiece. April, like everyone else involved, is walking a tightrope of nondisclosure agreements. One slip could compromise this unlikely second chapter 35 years in the making. Pressure abounds. \"Blade Runner\" is lauded as one of the most accomplished works of science fiction of all time. It achieved cult status through the years thanks in part to Scott's continued edits, forcing audiences to reevaluate what was once a critical headache -- \" muddled ,\" \" will turn off many \" -- but now a film considered poetic, existential and profound. Three decades after release it stands monolithic, casting a long, intimidating shadow. Who would dare try to succeed it? Not April. At least, not at first. When she was approached by director and long-term collaborator Denis Villeneuve, she didn't want the gig: \"I said 'Oh my God, I'm going to fail. It's too much, I can't.'\" She relented, however, and as its release approaches, she's glad she took the plunge. Raf Simons S/S 2018, as walked in New York's Chinatown, July 2017.Credit: ANGELA WEISS/AFP/AFP/Getty Images Among audiences, April knows there's a certain coterie she needs to satisfy: fashion designers. A week prior to our chat, a friend had showed her pictures of Raf Simons' \"Blade Runner\"-esque Spring-Summer 2018 collection , staged under the lamps of New York's Chinatown, with models walking under umbrellas in deconstructed macs. Simons is just the latest designer to draw inspiration from the film. \"'Blade Runner' is one of the sci-fi films that influenced me the most,\" Jean Paul Gaultier told CNN, one high-profile example and a man not averse to dressing sci-fi movies himself . Related: Why museums around the world are celebrating fashion's great rebels Fashion was integral to the fabric of Scott's Los Angeles, circa 2019. Unlike the homogenous look of sci-fi forebears like \" THX 1138 \" or \" Logan's Run ,\" \"Blade Runner's\" costume design was rich, varied and uncannily familiar. Much of its aesthetic was sourced from the past. Costume designers Charles Knode and Michael Kaplan read into the noir elements of detective narrative and saw Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney and Orson Welles in the beleaguered android assassin Rick Deckard. Costumes for Rachael, the femme fatale played by Sean Young, drew explicitly from that era: Kaplan has cited Adrian (costume designer for Joan Crawford, among others) as the inspiration behind her '30s and '40s-cut skirt suits.

East Asian looks were prominent among the huddled masses; layered, asymmetrical designs reminiscent of Issey Miyake's '80s output littered the city. A seven-year-old Jeremy Scott was transfixed. The American creative director of Moschino and his own namesake label recalls watching alongside his older brother in a small-town cinema in the summer of 1982: \"I was never the same after that.\" \"I was mesmerized by the mix of what was then futuristic with what was already retro,\" wrote Scott in an email. \"That is what makes 'Blade Runner' the gold standard (among) sci-fi dystopian worlds, as it's believable. Because we do not live in a world where everything is from today ... We live in a chaotic world of various decades of architecture, automotive design and fashion, combining and colliding all (in) that same moment.\" Gareth Pugh channeled \"Blade Runner\" in Fall 2016.Credit: Antonio de Moraes Barros Filho/WireImage/WireImage Months after its release, Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren debuted \"Punkature,\" a collection featuring a skirt printed with a smiling geisha -- the same face seen on a billboard several stories high in the film . After this initial homage, fashion's response has largely been self-reflexive towards Kaplan and Knode's work. Take for example Rachael's tailoring: the costume designers exaggerated existing silhouettes, and in a feedback loop, fashion houses amplified Kaplan and Knode's \" whacked-out take \" in turn. Related: What the faces of our robots tell us about ourselves Alexander McQueen's angular, tailored Autumn-Winter 1998 ready-to-wear collection for Givenchy remains a paragon. In the same collection he worked in a pared-down tribute to Rachael's ostensible fur coat, and a year earlier created headdresses halfway between bearskin and backcombed bob, reminiscent of Pris the replicant's hair. (Almost two decades later, Gareth Pugh's skirt suits for his Autumn-Winter 2016 collection traced a line back through McQueen's work at Givenchy to the film that inspired him.) Pris (Daryl Hannah) proved an inspiration for Alexander McQueen (center) and Jean Paul Gaultier (right).Credit: Warner Bros/Kob/REX/Shutterstock; Daniel SIMON/Gamma-Rapho/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images; Alain BENAINOUS/Gamma-Rapho/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images Pris, played by Daryl Hannah, caught Jeremy Scott's eye too. For \"Rampage,\" his second collection in the late '90s, Scott \"wanted to create a wardrobe that appeared to be constructed from trash bags, fish and net\" -- perhaps a call-back to this scene . \"I wanted the feeling of the collection to convey (her) emotion and aggression,\" he added. Similarly, Jean Paul Gaultier remembered Hannah's character \"as a new superwoman, sexy and (an) atomic bomb,\" and he appropriated her \"amazing\" raccoon eye makeup for his Autumn-Winter 2009 Haute Couture collection. Since a \"Blade Runner\" sequel was first mooted in 2011, its predecessor has received increased sartorial attention from the fashion industry. Standing at a crucial juncture in such an influential story, perhaps April was right to be nervous. So what can we expect from her, and from Los Angeles, circa 2049? Concept art for the costume worn by Marriete (Mackenzie Davis).Credit: courtesy Alcon Entertainment \"Denis (Villeneuve) was thinking and thinking at the beginning, and finally he came out and said 'It's the same world, except it's more brutal. It's really brutal,'\" April remembered of their initial discussions. \"The world -- this world -- did not evolve very much, because they're dying. It's bad over there. If you're still on Earth it's because it's not going very well for you ... The ones that stayed behind, it's because they're not healthy enough or they're not rich enough,\" she added. \"The Earth is dying, basically, and they're in survival mode.\" Villeneuve and co. have mined Philip K. Dick's 1968 novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", the source material for \"Blade Runner.\" Set in an irradiated San Francisco in 1992, after a catastrophic global war, the book has more apocalyptic overtones than its film adaptation. Radioactive dust is claiming both bodies and minds. Mental aptitude and financial resources are required to buy a ticket off Earth. Many lack one or both. Conscious of this, April set to work imagining fashion 32 years from now. Officer K (Ryan Gosling) wearing a coat designed by April.Credit: Alcon Entertainment \"I had to restrain myself,\" she said, but there were still opportunities to show some flare. \"We're using a lot of fake fur and plastic and lights... (and) a lot of breathing masks, because it's so polluted.\" The fur is explicitly fake, she added, because the real deal \"hasn't existed for many years\" -- another nod to Dick's novel, in which animal life is scarce. And the shearling jacket worn by Ryan Gosling's Officer K; the one Esquire called \"badass\" and \"the real star\" of the film's trailer? It's fake too. \"Actually it's not shearling,\" April says. \"It's not leather, it's cotton,\" waterproofed and painted. Designs for Officer K's jacket.Credit: courtesy Alcon Entertainment Avid fans will be looking for clues in April's work. Deckard, for one, appears dressed down in a gray t-shirt and cargo pants. April confirms the character has ditched his clashing striped shirt and plaid tie combo. \"It scared me to do that,\" she says, \"but at the end of the day, he didn't change and he's timeless ... we really wanted something timeless.\" Those still arguing whether Deckard is human or replicant, read into that what you will. Related: How artificial intelligence and robots can change your living spaces One character who might know is nefarious replicant designer Niander Wallace, played by a Jared Leto. Wallace's monochrome kosode (similar to a kimono) was inspired by production designer Dennis Gassner's \"so zen, so pure\" sets, April said. \"I wanted something you almost don't notice. I wouldn't say that I was going to dress him like Steve Jobs, (but he probably) wears a new one every day ... like a uniform.\" Niander Wallace, played by Jared Leto. \"I adored him,\" says April.Credit: Warner Bros./IMDB Leto loved the costume, said April -- so much so that the Oscar-winner took it home. Further details are scant, and the costume designer is unable to divulge as much as she would like. Only on Oct. 6 will April's full efforts be revealed. One hopes \"2049\" will leave behind more loose threads for designers to spin into the fabric of their work. Inspiration can be an ephemeral thing, after all: like tears in the rain .

Salish Lodge & Spa: Snoqualmie, Washington Salish Lodge This hotel, owned by the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe and just 30 minutes from Seattle, has a breathtaking location on the very edge of the 268-foot Snoqualmie Falls.

Thanks to an on-site apiary, the hotel is also famous for its honey. You'll find the results at the spa and on the menu -- most famously drizzled atop its homemade biscuits. Its 84 rooms are elegant but understated, in earthen tones -- probably so they don't compete with the views of the forest and river. Each has a fireplace, two-person Whirlpool tub and window seat or balcony. Activities include hiking or paddling your way through the misty Cascade Mountains and nearby waterways. Or maybe you'll just want to perfect your apple, pumpkin or pecan pie at one of the lodge's upcoming culinary classes ($85 per person).

Las Vegas shooting We now know who's responsible for the massacre in Las Vegas and how it happened . But we may never get an answer to the most pressing question: why. Why would a 64-year-old retired accountant, with no history of violence, hole up in a casino hotel room and fire off round after round on innocent concertgoers? The carnage is almost unspeakable -- at least 59 dead and more than 500 injured. It's the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history . The shooter, Stephen Paddock , had amassed an arsenal of 42 firearms . Twenty-three weapons, including a handgun and multiple rifles, were found in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Another 19 firearms were found in his home in nearby Mesquite, Nevada. Material used to make explosives were found in his car. Authorities still think he acted alone. His brother told reporters this was totally out of character for Paddock . And now, we're learning about the victims: people like Sonny Melton, 29, a registered nurse from Tennessee, whose wife said he saved her life before he was shot, and Rachael Parker, 33, a records tech for a police department in California.

Music fans of all ages had flooded the grounds opposite the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip to enjoy the sold-out show. \nBut the concert was violently interrupted when a gunman carried out the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. At least 58 people were killed and more than 500 injured. The shooting has once again reignited the debate around gun rights in the US. Here's how America's gun culture compares to the rest of the world. Although America's unique relationship to guns sits at the forefront of the national psyche, gun culture in the US is often seen as an outlier globally. The number of firearms available to American civilians is estimated at around 310 million, according to a 2009 National Institute of Justice (NIJ) report. Read More India is home to the second largest civilian firearm stockpile, estimated at 46 million. The most updated estimates -- now nearly a decade old -- place the worldwide civilian gun cache at around 650 million. According to Switzerland-based Small Arms Survey, the number of civilian guns has most likely risen since 2007. Firearm production continues to proliferate worldwide, outweighing the effects that gun destruction might have. According to the Small Arms Survey, the exact number of civilian-owned firearms is impossible to pinpoint because of a variety of factors including arms that go unregistered, the illegal trade and global conflict. Related: 8 charts that explain US gun culture further Americans own the most guns per person in the world, about four in 10 saying they either own a gun or live in a home with guns, according to a recent Pew Center study . Forty-eight percent of Americans said they grew up in a house with guns. According to the survey, a majority (66%) of US gun owners own multiple firearms, with nearly three-quarters of gun owners saying they couldn't imagine not owning one. Yemen , home to the world's second-largest gun-owning population per capita (and a country in the throes of a two-and-a-half-year civil conflict) trails significantly behind the US in terms of ownership. When it comes to gun massacres, the US is an anomaly. There are more public mass shootings in America than in any other country in the world. Before Sunday, the 2016 Orlando attack was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with 49 people killed. In 2012, Adam Lanza went on a shooting spree in Newtown, Connecticut, killing his mother before murdering 26 students and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School; in 2007, 32 people were killed in the Virginia Tech massacre. Such massacres have prompted debates about gun control, but they also increase demand for guns. And regulations covering the sale of firearms are looser now that they were just a few months ago. In February, US President Donald Trump signed a measure that scrapped a Obama-era regulation aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of some severely mentally ill people. Related: Mass shootings in America - a visual guide The original rule was part of a series of moves taken by the Obama administration to try and curb gun violence after other efforts failed to advance in Congress. Globally, restrictive gun laws have proven to make a difference in curbing massacres. In Australia, for example, four mass shootings occurred between 1987 and 1996. After those incidents, public opinion turned against gun ownership and Parliament passed stricter gun laws. Australia hasn't had a mass shooting since. The US has one of the highest rates of death by firearm in the developed world, according to World Health Organization data. Our calculations based on OECD data from 2010 show that Americans are 51 times more likely to be killed by gunfire than people in the United Kingdom. Related: Guns kill nearly 1,300 US children each year, study says Most American gun owners (two-thirds) say a major reason they own a gun is for their personal protection, according to the Pew study. However, the majority of America's firearm-related deaths are attributed to self-harm. Gun-related suicides are eight times higher in the US than in other high-income nations. Globally, the US sees fewer gun-related murders than many of its southern neighbors. According to the Small Arms Survey, El Salvador is currently home to the most gun-related murders in the world (excluding active war-zones) with guns killing more than 90 people for every 100,000 of population. From 2010-2015, Honduras saw the highest averages of gun-related homicides, with guns killing 67 out of every 100,000 people there. Venezuela and El Salvador also top the charts over the same five-year period, with 52 and 49 gun-related deaths, respectively, for every 100,000 of population.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam lanza", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organization", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oecd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy hook elementary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national institute of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pew center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nij", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newtown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el salvador", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas strip", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orlando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "honduras", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mandalay bay resort and casino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:28:39.009+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6a581f06a7d61005b449104b2033770c65252d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7ukjHmxUwAUBkFLfmUyrmOZJn7F.vkg8jwoDD_agPhG5jSJv3bD9lQxxIug_dBmw90-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "The Las Vegas heroes who put their lives on the line - CNN", "title_full": "The Las Vegas heroes who put their lives on the line - CNN", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171003094740-las-vegas-shooting-heroes-krystal-goddard-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5737, "comments": 0, "shares": 5737}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6a581f06a7d61005b449104b2033770c65252d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7ukjHmxUwAUBkFLfmUyrmOZJn7F.vkg8jwoDD_agPhG5jSJv3bD9lQxxIug_dBmw90-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "James Masters and Paul P.

Damages plummeted by at least 80%. \n\"It was really amazing,\" said Carlier. \"We barely get any complaints anymore.\" \nVanmoof's bikes cost as much as $3,000 and the 8-year old company wants 90% of its sales to be online by 2020. \nIt had previously tried to reduce damage by changing shipping companies, but that made little difference. \nCarlier points out that there is a notice on every parcel that declares the actual contents, and says customers and couriers have reacted positively to the new packaging. \nRelated: China accused of flooding Europe with cheap e-bikes \nThe only problem is maintaining the deception. \n\"We tried to do that for as long as we could, until a journalist in our store in New York tweeted about it and revealed it to the world,\" said Carlier. \nPublicity naturally followed, but Carlier said he hasn't seen any uptick in transit damage -- he just hopes nobody steals the idea: \"The more companies do this, the less effective it will be.\" CNNMoney (London) First published October 3, 2017: 8:31 AM ET ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vanmoof", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taco carlier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T15:37:19.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3c4bc4ae70ea5f42e49788c188c838d8199c1c8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsLiCAwtD4ZgEY6jzvwlAsM0Djyq3aqqfEfWGbHo_RtnxEYKI.Rl6Tg__XKRqRyj_f", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Las Vegas heroes: They risked their lives to save strangers", "title_full": "Las Vegas heroes: They risked their lives to save strangers", "published": "2017-10-03T14:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171003094740-las-vegas-shooting-heroes-krystal-goddard-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5737, "comments": 0, "shares": 5737}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3c4bc4ae70ea5f42e49788c188c838d8199c1c8d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsLiCAwtD4ZgEY6jzvwlAsM0Djyq3aqqfEfWGbHo_RtnxEYKI.Rl6Tg__XKRqRyj_f", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T14:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Las Vegas heroes: They risked their lives to save strangers", "text": "The Las Vegas heroes who stepped up as chaos reigned By James Masters, Jason Hanna and Paul P.

JUST WATCHED Wounded stranger shielded others, survivors recall Couple uses truck to transport injured (CNN) Amy McAslin and roommate Krystal Goddard dived under a table as gunfire rained down on fellow concertgoers in Las Vegas on Sunday night. Eventually, McAslin realized she was being shielded by someone who'd just been shot. \"A gentleman -- I don't know his name -- he completely covered me,\" McAslin told CNN. \"He covered my face. He said, 'I've got you.' \"Just truly incredible, (a) stranger, jumping over me to protect me.\" The man was among the many who attended to others during and after a massacre in which a gunman fired from the 32nd floor of a Vegas hotel into crowds below at the Route 91 Harvest music festival, killing 59 people and injuring another 527 . Before the shooting, McAslin and Goddard were standing by the stage where country music singer Jason Aldean was performing. Then they began to hear gunfire. Read More Krystal Goddard and Amy McAslin lauded the stranger's bravery. Running for their lives through the crowd, the pair sought refuge under a table as the bullets continued to fly by. The man shielded McAslin, who was holding Goddard. It's not clear when the man was wounded. But he \"said that he had been shot in his rear-end area, and that there was a lot of blood,\" McAslin said. Full coverage \nMinute by minute: Bullets rain The roommates said the trio held onto one another tightly, while chanting: \"Everything is going to be OK.\" While under the table, McAslin, who had trained as an emergency medical technician, examined a woman who had been grazed by a bullet in the neck. \"There was a lot of blood. But she seemed OK -- it didn't hit her artery,\" she said. Eventually, they say, a woman told them to come out. The man was helped to a triage area, and McAslin and Goddard ran with others toward an exit. McAslin's white shirt was stained by the man's blood. Neither knows his name or how he is doing. \"He's been in my thoughts all day,\" McAslin said. \"He's a truly amazing person for just trying to protect the whole, under, the whole table area where we were.\" 'Load them up. Let's go' Lindsay Padgett and her fianc\u00e9 Mark Jay were at the festival when the shooting started. After initially ducking to the ground, they told CNN affiliate KTNV , they ran with others to an airport hangar for shelter, before making it back to their parked truck near the concert venue. They were driving away in their pickup, taking stock of what happened, when a stranger hailed them. \"Right now, we need your truck. We just need to get people over to the hospital, OK?\" the stranger tells Padgett, as people moved the injured on makeshift stretchers behind him, in a video widely viewed on Facebook. The couple pulled over. \"We (said), 'Load them up. Let's go.' (We) loaded as many as we could,\" Jay told KTNV. Lindsay Padgett and Mark Jay, both of Las Vegas, used their pickup truck to take gunshot victims away from the site of Sunday night's shooting spree. After people loaded a number of wounded in the back of the truck, the pair said, they drove over road blocks and curbs until they found an ambulance at a freeway entrance. Some victims were transferred to the ambulance. A couple others remained in the truck, and Jay and Padgett drove them to a hospital, following the ambulance. One of the passengers, Jay said, had been shot in the chest and was using his fingers to fill the holes. Padgett played down couple's role in ferrying the injured out of danger. \"I just feel like that's what you do,\" she told KTNV. \"When people need help, you have to take them to the hospital.\" Wounded hockey coach helped by brother University of Nevada, Las Vegas assistant hockey coach Nick Robone was at the concert with his brother, Anthony, a paramedic with the Henderson Fire Department . Anthony initially thought he heard firecrackers. \"The real moment I realized that it was gunshots was when I heard my brother say, 'I got hit.' I turned around and I saw him coughing up blood,\" Anthony Robone told CNN.

Anthony and a friend escorted him down a street. Seeing no ambulance, they stopped at a police car, and an officer gave them a first aid kit. \"We just took a little piece of plastic -- it appeared to be a sucking chest wound ... (so) we put the plastic piece on his chest over the wound\" and secured it with three adhesive bandages, Anthony Robone said. Nick Robone eventually was put onto an ambulance. Anthony said he and his friend stayed, helping a number of off-duty firefighters, medics, doctors, nurses and other bystanders triage wounded people on the side of a street. They treated the injured while they waited for ambulances, and helped decide which injured should go on ambulances first. \"It was a group effort between everybody, whether they were trained medically or not,\" Anthony Robone said. He said his brother was in a hospital's intensive care unit late Monday. \"I think he's going to make it out, because he's tough,\" Anthony Robone said.

The 15 Cuban diplomats selected by the US will have a week to leave, a State Department official said. The move drew an angry rebuke from Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla. \"Cuba has never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any sort against diplomatic officials or their relatives,\" Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla said at a news conference in Havana. The reductions are just the latest step in the rapidly unraveling US-Cuban relations that were restored in 2015 by former President Barack Obama. McClatchy first reported the decision. Read More There was no immediate response from the Cuban government, which has denied any role in the incidents that have sickened at least 22 US diplomats and family members stationed in Cuba. On Tuesday, a State Department official said they had confirmed an additional American diplomat was affected by an attack back in January but had only been re-examined recently. For months, starting late last year, US diplomats in Havana complained of incidents, often late at night in their homes or hotel rooms, that left them feeling ill. State Department orders nonessential diplomats and families out of Cuba following mysterious attacks Often the sudden wave of nausea, dizziness and headaches were accompanied by strange sounds the diplomats compared to loud insects or metal dragging across the floor. US officials said they are convinced someone has been targeting the diplomats and they are investigating whether some type of sonic weapon could have been used in the attacks. As many as 50 attacks are believed to have been carried out against the diplomats, a senior US official has told CNN. Diplomats have been treated for ear complaints, hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, balance problems, visual complaints, headaches, fatigue, cognitive issues and difficulty sleeping, a senior US official said. Canada is also looking into whether their officials were targeted after some of their diplomats and families in Havana experienced similar health problems. Top Cuban officials, including Cuban President Raul Castro, have denied any Cuban involvement in the incidents and allowed the FBI to travel to the island earlier in the summer to investigate. Cuban officials said US investigators had visited the island on three separate occasions. The FBI did not find any devices in the diplomats' homes or hotels where they were staying and are still investigating who was behind the attacks and the type of weapon that was used, two senior US officials have said. At the news conference Tuesday, Rodr\u00edguez Parilla said Cuban investigators had no evidence that any attacks had taken place and that the US needed to allow the Cubans access to affected diplomats and the doctors in the US that have treated them. He also said Cuban investigators have not been allowed by the US to examine the residences in Havana where the American diplomats reported the alleged attacks. In March, the US asked two Cuban diplomats to leave the US as a reciprocal measure after two US diplomats injured in the attacks were unable to return to their posting. Last week, State Department officials said Cuba had failed to keep US diplomats safe and the US would reduce the embassy staff by 60%, suspending consular services for tens of thousands of Cubans seeking visas to visit or move to the US. While the US did not directly blame Cuba for the attacks, a State Department official said Cuban officials needed to provide greater assurances that diplomats will no longer be attacked before both countries could resume regular diplomatic operations. Diplomats in Havana that handle American citizen services, analyze Cuba's political system and handle outreach to the island's dissident community were also leaving. The US as well issued a travel warning for Americans thinking of visiting the communist-run island. The expected staff reductions at the Cuban embassy in Washington would also likely impact the thousands of Cubans in the US applying for Cuban passports to return to the island to visit family there. Only one Cuban diplomat would be left to handle consular affairs in Washington, Rodr\u00edguez Parilla said. The US diplomats leaving the island spent the weekend holding garage sales where they sold everything from American craft beer to plastic Christmas trees. Several complained that their families, who had evacuated ahead of Hurricane Irma, were not allowed by the State Department to return to the island to help them pack up. Most of the departing diplomats would leave Cuba by the end of the week, a US official said.

As well as the lack of supplies, Ebola has affected trade this year in Dakar. Despite the fact that there has only been one confirmed case of Ebola, tourists are wary of traveling to Africa because of the seriousness of the disease across other areas. \"We probably have 15% of the people we had last year,\" said Mouritzen \"We've had no tourists at all.\" Marta of Malika surf camp agrees; \"This year is quite strange because of the Ebola problem in West Africa. A lot of surfers and tourists in general didn't come. So this year it's quite quiet compared to last winter.

The police department has done such an incredible job,\" Trump said at the White House before he left for Puerto Rico. The President was asked about a gun bill currently making its way through the House that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers. Trump said that he would talk about that later. He was also asked if the massacre, which killed at least 59 and injured hundreds of others, could have been prevented. Though he didn't answer the question directly, he characterized the shooter as \"a sick man, a demented man\" and added that \"we're looking into him very, very seriously.\" He didn't answer when reporters pressed him about whether the shooting was an act of \"domestic terrorism.\" Read More Trump previously addressed the nation in a somber speech on Monday morning, labeling the shooting \"pure evil.\" On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders became emotional when discussing the shooting but dismissed talk of gun control when pressed by reporters. \"There's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country,\" Sanders said. \"There's currently an open and ongoing law enforcement investigation, a motive is yet to be determined and it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don't fully know all the facts or what took place last night.\" The shooting is unlikely to sufficiently shake up well-worn gun politics to produce meaningful changes in the nation's gun laws, even though public support for more regulation typically spikes after mass shootings.

The move drew an angry rebuke from Cuban Minister of Foreign Affairs Bruno Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla. \"Cuba has never perpetrated, nor will it ever perpetrate attacks of any sort against diplomatic officials or their relatives,\" Rodr\u00edguez Parrilla said at a news conference in Havana. The reductions are just the latest step in the rapidly unraveling US-Cuban relations that were restored in 2015 by former President Barack Obama. McClatchy first reported the decision. Read More There was no immediate response from the Cuban government, which has denied any role in the incidents that have sickened at least 22 US diplomats and family members stationed in Cuba. On Tuesday, a State Department official said they had confirmed an additional American diplomat was affected by an attack back in January but had only been re-examined recently. For months, starting late last year, US diplomats in Havana complained of incidents, often late at night in their homes or hotel rooms, that left them feeling ill. State Department orders nonessential diplomats and families out of Cuba following mysterious attacks Often the sudden wave of nausea, dizziness and headaches were accompanied by strange sounds the diplomats compared to loud insects or metal dragging across the floor. US officials said they are convinced someone has been targeting the diplomats and they are investigating whether some type of sonic weapon could have been used in the attacks. As many as 50 attacks are believed to have been carried out against the diplomats, a senior US official has told CNN. Diplomats have been treated for ear complaints, hearing loss, dizziness, tinnitus, balance problems, visual complaints, headaches, fatigue, cognitive issues and difficulty sleeping, a senior US official said. Canada is also looking into whether their officials were targeted after some of their diplomats and families in Havana experienced similar health problems. Top Cuban officials, including Cuban President Raul Castro, have denied any Cuban involvement in the incidents and allowed the FBI to travel to the island earlier in the summer to investigate. Cuban officials said US investigators had visited the island on three separate occasions. The FBI did not find any devices in the diplomats' homes or hotels where they were staying and are still investigating who was behind the attacks and the type of weapon that was used, two senior US officials have said. At the news conference Tuesday, Rodr\u00edguez Parilla said Cuban investigators had no evidence that any attacks had taken place and that the US needed to allow the Cubans access to affected diplomats and the doctors in the US that have treated them. He also said Cuban investigators have not been allowed by the US to examine the residences in Havana where the American diplomats reported the alleged attacks. In March, the US asked two Cuban diplomats to leave the US as a reciprocal measure after two US diplomats injured in the attacks were unable to return to their posting. Last week, State Department officials said Cuba had failed to keep US diplomats safe and the US would reduce the embassy staff by 60%, suspending consular services for tens of thousands of Cubans seeking visas to visit or move to the US. While the US did not directly blame Cuba for the attacks, a State Department official said Cuban officials needed to provide greater assurances that diplomats will no longer be attacked before both countries could resume regular diplomatic operations. Diplomats in Havana that handle American citizen services, analyze Cuba's political system and handle outreach to the island's dissident community were also leaving. The US as well issued a travel warning for Americans thinking of visiting the communist-run island. The expected staff reductions at the Cuban embassy in Washington would also likely impact the thousands of Cubans in the US applying for Cuban passports to return to the island to visit family there. Only one Cuban diplomat would be left to handle consular affairs in Washington, Rodr\u00edguez Parilla said. The US diplomats leaving the island spent the weekend holding garage sales where they sold everything from American craft beer to plastic Christmas trees. Several complained that their families, who had evacuated ahead of Hurricane Irma, were not allowed by the State Department to return to the island to help them pack up. Most of the departing diplomats would leave Cuba by the end of the week, a US official said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mcclatchy", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "us state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:34:36.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "520d88939d64546c2aed425003d5b47a41a260d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4IN_FCRRkIdRR9BMN7qKseIZ2bPPb9ilbZsPJGKHfHfPZAPAFdi5X9uKPZUS8R64K6ndNwSDB4YEu.p5R0xnGyw20y1JUgjHGDUVtEIa1Uy_.c-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Puerto Rican town finally sees FEMA aid", "title_full": "Puerto Rican town finally sees FEMA aid", "published": "2017-10-03T16:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171003073833-guayanilla-puerto-rico-aerial-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 203, "comments": 0, "shares": 203}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "520d88939d64546c2aed425003d5b47a41a260d7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4IN_FCRRkIdRR9BMN7qKseIZ2bPPb9ilbZsPJGKHfHfPZAPAFdi5X9uKPZUS8R64K6ndNwSDB4YEu.p5R0xnGyw20y1JUgjHGDUVtEIa1Uy_.c-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Puerto Rican town finally sees FEMA aid", "text": "MUST WATCH Puerto Rican town finally sees FEMA aid The town of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, finally received FEMA aid weeks after two hurricanes devastated the island.

Shares in Rovio Entertainment, the Finnish company behind Angry Birds, traded as much as 5% below their initial price of \u20ac11.50 ($13.50) on Tuesday. \nThe mobile gaming firm, which listed on the Nasdaq Helsinki, is now valued at just over $1 billion. \nHannu Verkasalo, founder of digital behavior consultancy Verto Analytics, said that investors had been excited by Rovio's status as a new 'national stock' in Finland, like Nokia was a decade ago. \nThe company's hit game series -- Angry Birds -- has been downloaded over 3.7 billion times. But other investors are worried about its ability to churn out new hit games. \nRichard Holway, chairman of TechMarketView, said the fear is that Rovio will turn out to be another \"one-hit wonder.\" \nOther hit gaming companies serve as cautionary tales. \nKing Digital Entertainment, the company behind Candy Crush , targeted a $7 billion valuation when it went public in 2014. But the company disappointed investors after its other games didn't become hits. \nThe game maker was purchased last year by Activision for $18 a share -- 20% bellow its IPO price. \nThe 2011 IPO of Zynga, the maker of games like Words with Friends and FarmVille , has also turned out to be a disappointment. \nThe company failed to deliver popular new games and lost millions of users. Its share price has fallen from $10 to roughly $4. \nRelated: Nintendo shares are up 30% thanks to Switch \nRovio may turn out to be different, however. It has built a licensing empire around Angry Birds, allowing the brand to be used in toys, clothes and even an animated 3-D movie. \nThe film helped Rovio bounce back from a low point. \nIn 2015, the company was forced to lay off 40% of its workers and swap CEOs as it struggled to change its business model amid fierce competition. \nThen came The Angry Birds Movie, which grossed nearly $350 million in ticket sales worldwide, according to box office tracker Box Office Mojo. \nRevenue from the movie, and a strong performance from its games division, fueled revenue growth of 94% in the second quarter compared to 2016. A sequel is planned for 2019. \nKati Levoranta, the company's CEO, told CNNMoney that there is now a clear vision of how to move forward. \n\"Well to be honest we're in extremely good shape, we have a clear strategy,\" she said. \"It's all about the execution now.\" \n-- Samuel Burke and Emma Bowden contributed to this article. \nCNNMoney (London)   3, 2017: 9:07 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "samuel burke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannu verkasalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rovio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard holway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kati levoranta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma bowden", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "farmville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasdaq helsinki", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nintendo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zynga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rovio entertainment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "verto analytics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "king digital entertainment", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nokia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "candy crush", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "finland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T16:45:40.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a00121ed6d41d77450b214c297caee3bda0027e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtIUlFgwviQf3Mw8vTx_HE.aDRBXEfxRr1rqviQezI7q0rhwlE0FYVeYUJ8KD4Wn_MYePVqOtwKB3Q--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - App International Edition", "title": "Trump: US will 'be talking about gun laws as time goes by'", "title_full": "Trump: US will 'be talking about gun laws as time goes by'", "published": "2017-10-03T16:24:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171002155917-04-donald-trump-1002-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2450, "comments": 1, "shares": 2450}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a00121ed6d41d77450b214c297caee3bda0027e8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtIUlFgwviQf3Mw8vTx_HE.aDRBXEfxRr1rqviQezI7q0rhwlE0FYVeYUJ8KD4Wn_MYePVqOtwKB3Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T16:24:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump: US will 'be talking about gun laws as time goes by'", "text": "Presidents react again and again to shootings 02:15 Story highlights Trump characterized the shooter as \"a sick man, a demented man\" Trump previously addressed the nation in a somber speech on Monday morning Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the US will \"be talking about gun laws as time goes by\" in the wake of the Las Vegas shooting, the nation's deadliest in modern history. \"Look, we have a tragedy ... and what happened in Las Vegas is in many ways a miracle. The police department has done such an incredible job,\" Trump said at the White House before he left for Puerto Rico. The President was asked about a gun bill currently making its way through the House that would loosen restrictions on purchasing gun silencers. Trump said that he would talk about that later. He was also asked if the massacre, which killed at least 59 and injured hundreds of others, could have been prevented. Though he didn't answer the question directly, he characterized the shooter as \"a sick man, a demented man\" and added that \"we're looking into him very, very seriously.\" He didn't answer when reporters pressed him about whether the shooting was an act of \"domestic terrorism.\" Read More Trump previously addressed the nation in a somber speech on Monday morning, labeling the shooting \"pure evil.\" On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders became emotional when discussing the shooting but dismissed talk of gun control when pressed by reporters. \"There's a time and place for a political debate, but now is the time to unite as a country,\" Sanders said. \"There's currently an open and ongoing law enforcement investigation, a motive is yet to be determined and it would be premature for us to discuss policy when we don't fully know all the facts or what took place last night.\" The shooting is unlikely to sufficiently shake up well-worn gun politics to produce meaningful changes in the nation's gun laws, even though public support for more regulation typically spikes after mass shootings. In fact, with Republicans monopolizing power in the White House and in Congress, chances of reform appear less promising for Democrats than when President Barack Obama failed to do so after the Sandy Hook school massacre in 2012.

Many cases against women, however, have been reported this year. Several lawmakers have called for restrictions on the sale of acid-based products in recent months.

Puerto Rico was not a healthy island before the hurricanes devastated its infrastructure and lines of communication. Diabetes is rampant, and residents are older and poorer than on the mainland. Add an economic recession and a shortage of medical specialists, and you have the perfect storm. There may be 10s of thousands of hardy people who survived the hurricane and are now struggling to stay alive in its aftermath. They are teetering on the edge, with hardly any reserve. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Puerto Rico has medical supplies -- why must doctors fight for them? I don't think I will ever understand or accept meaningless suffering. As a doctor and a journalist who has worked in disaster zones for 15 years, it is one of the most frustrating things on which I report. As a human, it makes me question what we hold most important and dear. A few days ago, 62-year-old Josefina Alvarez lay sweltering on a cot in a shelter not far from San Juan. It was suffocating in there. The humidity was so thick I could barely breathe. No food, and just a few bottles of water. I saw one filled with urine on a windowsill. JUST WATCHED Fear of health crisis in Puerto Rico grows Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nFear of health crisis in Puerto Rico grows 03:58 For 10 days before my visit, she had battled unstable blood sugars, progressively lower oxygenation to her lungs and an infection that now required IV antibiotics. She survived the hurricane but was now quickly deteriorating and at real risk of developing sepsis: an overwhelming body infection that could kill her. As I saw her laying on that cot full of tears, pleading for help, I found myself suddenly crying with her, physically hurting with her. And suddenly I could not help but imagine my own family -- my own mother, dignified and hardworking -- begging for a simple medication that could save her life. You try it. Think of your own family in the horror of a situation like that. It will knock the wind out of you. Patients trapped in shelters in Puerto Rico can't get to hospitals Luckily, we were able to help Josefina evacuate to a hospital, where she needed antibiotics and an operation to clear the infection that caused her to be so sick. The very next day, I traveled to Barrio Melilla outside Loiza, again not far from San Juan, with a team of medical volunteers from Project Hope, an international non-governmental organization. There we found more of the hurricane's walking wounded. People like Jobita Cumaquita, battling both cancer and diabetes, but more concerned with how her 22-year-old granddaughter, Estefani, will manage without her father. A couple of days before the storm hit, he went to the hospital for an elective visit to address his blood sugar. He had made similar visits many times before, Estefani said, and he had always come home healthy shortly after treatment. But in the immediate aftermath of Maria, when they went to check on him, they were shocked to discover that he had died days before. Citizens band together to get mainland help to Puerto Rico In the chaos that has gripped Puerto Rico following the storm, the family has struggled to get details about the circumstances of his death -- a sadly common byproduct of everything the storm turned upside-down. But the routine nature of his visit has the family wondering: Was his death due to fallout from the storm? We may never know. What we do know is there are thousands of Josefinas, Jobitas and Estefanis here in Puerto Rico. They are too bed-ridden to leave their homes, or lack gasoline, or the ability to communicate with the outside world. They are mourning the loss of a loved one, or at the very least lamenting the terrible damage to their homes, their livelihoods, their way of life.

It was also a stirring call to action as Kimmel urged members of Congress to do something -- anything -- about the wave of gun violence in the country. \"When someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls, we take every precaution to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" Kimmel said. \"When an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, we say there's nothing we can do about that.\" Kimmel veered between breaking down in tears and angrily denouncing the National Rifle Association for its refusal to budge on what he described as \"common sense\" measures to limit these mass catastrophes committed with guns. Of Republican lawmakers who voted against gun control measures in the wake of last year's shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that left 49 people dead, Kimmel said: \"They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.\" (Kimmel showed pictures on screen of many of the senators and House members who voted against that legislation.) Read More While Kimmel's anger -- and lines like the one above -- will likely draw most of the attention (and criticism from Republicans), the most striking moment of his monologue for me came when he expressed his weariness with the predictable repetitiveness of this cycle of gun violence. Here's that moment: \"We'll pray for Las Vegas ... bills will be written, they'll be watered down, they'll fail, the NRA will smother it all with money and over time we'll get distracted and will move on to the next thing. And then it will happen again. And again.\" That cycle is already playing itself out. A handful of Democratic senators, including Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a leading voice pushing for gun control , are set to hold a news conference in Washington Tuesday pushing for closing the \"gun show loophole\" and expanding background checks. President Donald Trump, en route to Puerto Rico to view the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, gave a vague statement: \"We'll be talking about gun laws.\" Rinse. Wash. Repeat. As I documented Monday, views on guns are tied very closely not only to partisanship but also to culture . Gun owners believe owning a gun is a fundamental freedom that, if curtailed, is a slippery slope to losing that right (and others with it) entirely. Gun control supporters see the claims of 2nd Amendment rights as a catch-all for avoiding any real debate on the matter. Unfortunately, Kimmel's comments are already being sliced and diced by the political machine. Republicans, citing his opposition to their attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare -- and the fact he consulted with Senate Democrats on some talking points -- dismiss him as just another liberal Hollywood type, out of touch with real America. But people should watch Kimmel's full monologue -- whether you agree with him or not. His anger, his sadness, his frustration, his confusion, his real and honest emotion are not something that should be so easily dismissed as just more political pablum. There is more we can do, and we need to do it.

What's worse: She never knows when supplies and aid will arrive in her hometown of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. It's a hillside community dotted with coffee and plantain farms on the island's southwest coast and like many other cities and towns across the island, it was heavily damaged by Hurricane Maria. \"The lines are endless,\" Rivera, a 37-year-old mother of two, told CNN as 90-degree heat and a blazing sun bore down on her and dozens of others waiting for food. \"There are towns where aid still hasn't arrived.\" Puerto Rico's National Guard arrived in Guayanilla on Monday with food and water provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. Read More It was the first time since Hurricane Maria tore across the island two weeks ago that FEMA supplies had come directly to Guayanilla. Local officials previously had been going to the capital, San Juan, to pick up FEMA aid. This time, National Guard members made the two-hour drive around the island to deliver the aid: more than 6,000 bottles of water and more than 3,500 meals. Criticism continues to grow over the Trump administration's response to the disaster in Puerto Rico. President Trump says any talk of a slow response is fake news. In Guayanilla, where almost no one has electricity at home yet and few have running water, residents say the delay feels very real. The response \"is fast in the San Juan area but the south is forgotten,\" says Lisa Marie Estrada, 38, who was with her daughter and granddaughter waiting for food and water. Like Rivera and many others who spoke to CNN, Estrada stumbled upon the FEMA supplies by chance. She was walking by, saw people gathering and asked what was going on. Even local officials in Guayanilla said neither FEMA nor the Puerto Rico Army National Guard gave them any notice they were coming. Cell service is nearly nonexistent on this part of the island, two weeks after the storm. \"That's one of the biggest problems we have: the lack of communication,\" says Carlos Jirau, a contracted organizer working for the municipality's government. Even little things weren't made clear on Monday to residents desperate for aid. Some waited several minutes in the food line when they wanted to be in the water line, and vice versa. At a bigger level, the steps between start and finish show why this response by the federal government has been more dogged than others, according to a FEMA official in San Juan. The necessities to complete those steps -- cell phone service -- make each one that much more difficult to accomplish. In the mainland United States, FEMA and National Guard troops typically hand out aid -- food and water -- directly to residents at a local distribution center. Pretty simple. Not so in Puerto Rico. First, aid arrives either at the airport or sea port. Then truckers deliver it to FEMA's supply base in San Juan. After that, FEMA and the National Guard bring aid to one of several distribution centers on the island. From there, local mayors, police or authorized leaders can pick up the aid -- sometimes driving two hours each way -- and then bring it back to their towns to distribute. That extra, critical step with local government requires communication, which is extremely difficult, especially in the island's less populated areas. Only 35% of Puerto Rico now has phone service, according to government figures. Rivera, who got in line for water, then had to get in line for food, expressed a common frustration. \"There isn't any communication,\" Rivera said.

Read More They are \"walls of alienation, frustration or anger\" and behind those walls there is \"deep mistrust of democracy and its representatives,\" Steinmeier said. Without mentioning the AfD by name, Steinmeier warned that Germany's progress since 1990, becoming a democratic, peaceful and strong country at the heart of Europe, could be lost if politicians and ordinary Germans do not work together to fight the party's far-right ideology and to respond to the concerns of its supporters. The appeal of the far right The AfD -- originally an anti-European Union and anti-euro party that has since turned its focus to immigration and Islam -- won 12.6% of the vote in the elections on September 24 and became the third largest party in the German parliament, according to preliminary results. Like many other far-right parties across Europe, the AfD has branded itself as an anti-establishment party of protest, appealing to those citizens previously disillusioned by or uninterested in politics. And their strategy seemed to work: nearly 700,000 votes for the AfD came from former non-voters, according to preliminary data from political polling firm Infratest Dimap. Germans celebrate the \"Day of German Unity\" at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. The monument stood in no-man's land, between East and West Berlin, until 1989. Support for the AfD was particularly high in the former East Germany, where 21.5% of votes went to the far-right party, according to Infratest Dimap. Speaking to CNN on the night of the election results, Jasna Zajcek, an expert on rise of the far right in eastern Germany, said one of the reasons the AfD had performed better than expected was that many voters in the east do not feel integrated into modern Germany. She said these voters feel they still suffer from the loss of the more socialist state system that the former East Germany once provided. Those voters don't understand why economic benefits are \"thrown\" at migrants while they suffer from high unemployment, small pensions and drug and alcohol problems, Zajcek added. Concessions on immigration? Steinmeier addressed this issue in his speech Tuesday, saying many Germans from the former East no longer feel at home in their own country, and question if anyone is looking out for them. Four graphics that explain how a far-right party won third place in Germany \"This desire for a home, a homeland -- we mustn't leave that to the nationalists,\" said Steinmeier. \"There must never be a route back to nationalism,\" he insisted, a statement that was met with a sustained ovation. Steinmeier did, however, suggest Germany should consider stricter immigration controls in what can be seen as a bid to draw AfD voters back to the mainstream parties. Germany should give asylum to those who are eligible, he said, but must also consider \"which forms of and how much immigration we want ... and need.\" \"Migration should be controlled according to our requirements,\" he continued, insisting that people who come to Germany must learn the language and abide by the country's laws and values. \"That cannot be up for discussion.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "frank-walter steinmeier", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "walter steinmeier", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jasna zajcek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zajcek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steinmeier", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "infratest dimap", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west berlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "german unity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mainz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brandenburg gate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:14:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "42f474258d7401bfd816bd6a61fedfe90e3c46a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7v3FNn28DkPKViho3gmqqz9lMwuxXjeZS7x_EAOJTNs2GCVkjbGdewQ", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Acid attacks: UK government to ban acid sales to minors - CNN", "title_full": "Acid attacks: UK government to ban acid sales to minors - CNN", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170921131056-01-amber-rudd-0921-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1424, "comments": 0, "shares": 1424}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "42f474258d7401bfd816bd6a61fedfe90e3c46a3", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7v3FNn28DkPKViho3gmqqz9lMwuxXjeZS7x_EAOJTNs2GCVkjbGdewQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Angela Dewan", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Acid attacks: UK government to ban acid sales to minors - CNN", "text": "(CNN) The UK government plans to ban the sale of acid to minors and prevent people from carrying corrosive liquids in public, in response to a dramatic increase in acid attacks across the country.\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd announced the decision Tuesday, describing the growing trend as \"absolutely revolting.\" \"You have all seen the pictures of victims that never fully recover, endless surgeries, lives ruined.

Police say that acid attacks in London were once typically carried out by men against women close to them but are now predominantly used between young males, often in the context of urban gangs. Many cases against women, however, have been reported this year. Several lawmakers have called for restrictions on the sale of acid-based products in recent months.

Even Democrats who have been central to past efforts to overhaul the country's gun laws offered little hope that they would be able to forge a bipartisan solution in a Republican-controlled Congress. What are Democrats are saying? CNN's Ashley Killough caught up with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and author of an assault weapons ban in the mid-1990s, and she spoke about the prospects -- or lack thereof -- for gun reforms in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history. The gun debate, again Read More While Feinstein described the shooting as \"extraordinary,\" \"extreme\" and \"heartbreaking,\" she offered little to no optimism that things would change. \"You know, I thought Sandy Hook would. I thought Columbine would. I thought 101 California would,\" she said, referring to a 1993 San Francisco shooting that left nine dead. \"None of that did.\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who was central to fighting for universal background checks after Sandy Hook, has said he wants to continue fighting for background checks. The Sandy Hook senator has a blunt message: 'It's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something' \"Background checks still (are) the most likely piece of legislation to get passed through Congress because it enjoys widespread public approval and it frankly is probably most dispositive on the amount of gun violence that happens every day across this country,\" he said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Monday she wants Speaker Paul Ryan to create a select committee on gun violence. So Democrats want to see movement. What should we expect? This Congress is controlled by Republicans and that matters here. Remember, even when Democrats had control of the Senate after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, they still could not pass a bill to ensure every gun purchased in this country underwent a background check. That had some of their own red-state members voting against that. In a lot of ways, Monday was a bizarre day on Capitol Hill. Concerned citizens might ask the questions about what should happen after Vegas, but congressional observers know how senators are going to answer the questions based on the \"R\" or \"D\" behind their names. Both sides are very dug in here and the prospects for change are virtually non-existent. What about the gun suppressor bill? The \"Hearing Protection Act,\" which aims to loosen rules around gun silencers, was added to a broader bill called the \"Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act\" that passed through committee last month. RELATED: Clinton talks gun legislation immediately following massacre 8 charts that explain America's gun culture A senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN that there are \"unresolved issues with the larger package and it is not on the schedule.\" This aide wouldn't say when it might come up for a full House vote, but said until the broader issues are taken care of there was no move to bring it up for a vote. South Carolina GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan, the lead sponsor of the bill, took issue with how people are characterizing the bill, saying, \"nothing is silent about it. Even a 22 long rifle, one of the smallest calibers, isn't silent. It's about the same decibel level as a jackhammer. Nobody would say a jackhammer is silent.\" He said to those saying that the bill would make it harder for law enforcement to hear gunfire in the case of a mass shooting, \"get out of the theaters, get away from James Bond because what Hollywood depicts and reality are two different things.\" Duncan said he has not talked to top GOP leaders personally about when the House would consider the bill, but said he anticipated the bill would be on the floor next week and his staff believed it would come up sometime this month.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ashley killough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james bond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dianne feinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy hook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "feinstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff duncan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duncan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paul ryan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "capitol hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sandy hook elementary school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "connecticut", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "las vegas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:29:01.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d64b5fa1d6a47f382267cc3c521900ccd6d51b56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7uIK5UsKEIsVJDYOy74EQ2sgtDHoSLwGTiXoRutaH7JeFM.oX5JU_Hz2UgK7ETjmhRq9ZtRIVIP.Q--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Iraq's first non-Arab president, Jalal Talabani, has died - CNN", "title_full": "Iraq's first non-Arab president, Jalal Talabani, has died - CNN", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/121219024954-irq-president-jalal-talabani-story-top.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 317, "comments": 0, "shares": 317}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d64b5fa1d6a47f382267cc3c521900ccd6d51b56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7uIK5UsKEIsVJDYOy74EQ2sgtDHoSLwGTiXoRutaH7JeFM.oX5JU_Hz2UgK7ETjmhRq9ZtRIVIP.Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Tamara Qiblawi and Mohammed Tawfeeq, CNN", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Iraq's first non-Arab president, Jalal Talabani, has died - CNN", "text": "Erbil, Iraq (CNN) Former Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, the country's first non-Arab president, has died at the age of 83, his family said.\nHis niece, Alaa Talabani, an Iraqi member of parliament, confirmed his death to CNN, after it was reported by Iraqi state TV and Kurdish media. Talabani, who was Kurdish, was elected was head of state in the wake of the United States-led invasion of the country. He served as president from 2005 to 2014 and oversaw the implementation of a new constitution that strengthened the autonomy of the Kurdish region of Iraq. Talabani's death comes a week after Iraqi Kurds voted to secede from Iraq in a controversial referendum. The last seven years of his tenure were marked by multiple episodes of illness.

(File photo) Iraqi President Jalal Talabani,pictured here on January 23, 2010 in Baghdad, Iraq. Read More Born in the village of Kelkan in Iraqi Kurdistan, Talabani was an advocate for the rights of the Kurdish minority in Iraq since his adolescence. At age 14, he joined the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), which began a rebellion in northern Iraq in the 1960s. In 1975, he founded the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), an organization striving to promote the autonomy and independence of the Kurdish people from the rest of Iraq. As Secretary General of the PUK, he became involved in armed resistance against the government of Saddam Hussein. Two years after Hussein was deposed by the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Talabani was elected president by the transitional national assembly. Jalal Talabani Fast Facts During his tenure, the 2005 Iraqi constitution upheld Iraqi Kurdistan's autonomy -- first established in 1991 by the US, the United Kingdom and France -- which barred Iraqi forces from operating within the northern Kurdish region of the country. In 2006, Talabani won a second term as president as part of an interim Iraqi government. In November 2010, he was re-elected president by the new Iraqi parliament. Marking the end of the US military presence in Iraq in December 2011, Talabani conferred upon coalition officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, the \"shield of commitment medal.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jalal talabani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talabani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaa talabani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hussein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "kdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdish democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patriotic union of kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "erbil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states-led", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelkan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:29:04.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "58e2ceecbf8ee35fc2a043b82b188287f542b7b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnLCGY5DER9yKP29JS7RyLS0JRicfelzkREIgRrA3l7NUWP09oYaTgjoQqW3deYfFzov1F8feDtqyQ--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Warren Buffett trolls Trump and GOP on tax cuts", "title_full": "Warren Buffett trolls Trump and GOP on tax cuts - Oct. 3, 2017", "published": "2017-10-03T18:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170224201825-trump-buffett-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 917, "comments": 0, "shares": 917}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 26}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "58e2ceecbf8ee35fc2a043b82b188287f542b7b8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnLCGY5DER9yKP29JS7RyLS0JRicfelzkREIgRrA3l7NUWP09oYaTgjoQqW3deYfFzov1F8feDtqyQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Egan", "published": "2017-10-03T18:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "Warren Buffett trolls Trump and GOP on tax cuts", "text": "Inside the GOP's tax blueprint Warren Buffett is poking fun at President Trump and Republicans in Congress over doubts that they can come together on taxes. \"Any politician that can't pass a tax cut is probably in the wrong line of business,\" Buffett told CNBC on Tuesday. \nThe world's second-richest person said Republicans \"don't want a shutout\" in their first year controlling both houses of Congress and the White House. \nFor those reasons, Buffett thinks tax cuts are likely. \nBut Buffett, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign, isn't so sure that American businesses need the tax cuts that Trump is calling for. \nRelated: The stocks set to win under Trump's tax plan \nThe GOP tax framework rolled out last week proposes slashing the corporate tax rate to 20% from the current 35%. Republicans say reducing taxes will make the United States more competitive with other major economies. \nBuffett said that his Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) holding company owns 60 or 70 businesses, but none of them are \"noncompetitive in the world because of the corporate tax rate.\" He noted that American businesses earn \"extraordinary\" returns compared with history and other countries. \nThe billionaire didn't dispute that tax cuts would make many businesses even more profitable -- and lift their stock prices. Then again, he joked that a \"negative tax rate for corporations would really be great.\" \nRelated: Is the Trump tax plan a big win for middle class? Not so much \nBut Buffett told CNBC he worries about a plan to offer companies a one-time low tax rate to entice them to bring home the cash they are hoarding overseas. \nBuffett says that might just encourage more companies to stash money outside the United States in hopes of getting a tax break. \n\"People may find their nose growing\" after making some of the arguments for repatriation, Buffett said. \nBuffett also knocked the GOP's plans to eliminate the estate tax, saying such a move would be a \"terrible mistake\" and could lead to dynasty-building. The tax applies only to estates worth more than about $5.5 million, or $11 million for couples. \n\"The wealthy now are so much wealthier than they were 25 years ago,\" he said. \nCNNMoney (New York) First published October 3, 2017: 10:29 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "details of gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:37:08.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f6d3a01059fb7687d1e90586489bfe37390e1ef1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnIpK8oWfEi3CPYLm1aZOHGznZvfoixRgWCnFzSg92FjRw--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Why Equifax will continue to profit by selling your personal information", "title_full": "Why Equifax will continue to profit by selling your personal information - Oct. 3, 2017", "published": "2017-10-03T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170908091001-equifax-hack-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1318, "comments": 0, "shares": 1318}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 193}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f6d3a01059fb7687d1e90586489bfe37390e1ef1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnIpK8oWfEi3CPYLm1aZOHGznZvfoixRgWCnFzSg92FjRw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Katie Lobosco", "published": "2017-10-03T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Why Equifax will continue to profit by selling your personal information", "text": "Timeline: Equifax data breach Equifax is facing a major backlash over a last month's security breach. But the company, and its core business -- selling your information -- probably isn't going anywhere. Equifax makes money by selling your personal information to banks, credit card companies, and basically any financial institution that would lend consumers money. \nThe system proved flawed earlier this year when the company was hacked, potentially exposing sensitive information of more than 145 million consumers. Criminals can use the information to steal your identity and rack up debt in your name. \nEquifax may face government fines and is named in several lawsuits filed by consumers and lenders. But the business of collecting and selling information on consumers is just too valuable to go away. \n\"I think, frankly, it's not in the interest of the industry or even regulators to shut down Equifax. They provide an essential service for consumer lending,\" said Brett Horn, a senior equity analyst for Morningstar. \nRelated: Former Equifax CEO apologizes \nThe three big credit rating agencies -- Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion -- aggregate data into credit reports and scores that financial institutions use to evaluate how risky it is to lend money to an individual. They show whether someone has ever been late paying a credit card bill, for example, or has ever defaulted on a loan. \nThat information exchange makes it easier for consumer to access credit. It also makes it easier for lenders to run their business. That gives lenders a big incentive to work with the agencies. \n\"Most major lenders have relationships with all three agencies so that they get the most accurate information about the consumer,\" Horn said. \nIn some cases, like when loaning a mortgage backed by Fannie Mae , a company is required to check with all three agencies. \nWhile lenders are the credit rating agencies' primary customers, they are also the ones providing the data -- for free. \nCutting off this pipeline would certainly harm Equifax's bottom line. The company reported $489 million in profit last year. In its financial filings, it said it relies \"extensively\" on the \"voluntary contribution on credit data from most lenders in the U.S.\" \nBut it's not in the interest of lenders to stop sharing information with the credit rating agencies, Horn said . It could hurt the accuracy of the credit reports they buy back. \nLenders say that it would also harm consumers if some of their information was left off a credit report. \n\"By and large, financial institutions are erring on the side of continuing to report information so that accurate information gets to the credit bureaus,\" said Doug Johnson, senior vice president, payments and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association. \nRelated: Why the Equifax hack has small business owners worried \nLenders may not stop sharing information with Equifax, but they could put pressure on the company with a lawsuit. \nThe Summit Credit Union, which has 34 branch locations in Wisconsin, is suing Equifax, asking that it cover any financial loss it will incur due to the breach. \nIn most cases, it's the financial institution that's responsible for fraudulent charges made to a customer's account -- regardless of where their personal information was hacked. The credit union can also face costs associated with canceling compromised credit cards and issuing new numbers, as well as monitoring for new account fraud, according to the lawsuit. \nStill, lawsuits and fines are one-time costs. Beefing up security could have a longer-term impact, Horn said. \nRegulatory changes could require strengthened security. Currently, the rating agencies are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and consumers' rights are governed by a patchwork of state laws. \nSome members of Congress have already called for a change to regulation ahead of grilling former Equifax CEO Richard Smith at four separate hearings scheduled for this week. \n\"It's very difficult to say when new regulations will come down. But we would expect Equifax's earnings to take a slight hit at that time,\" said Anthony Gambardella, an analyst at IBISWorld. \nIt would hit the company financially at first, but he predicts Equifax would adjust, and possibly use a strengthened security system to its advantage. \nOn Tuesday, Smith is expected to tell Congress that there should be an industry-wide standard that would require agencies to offer consumers free credit locks for life . It's one of the offers Equifax has made in the wake of the breach. \nCNNMoney (New York) First published October 3, 2017: 10:01 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony gambardella", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brett horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug johnson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american bankers association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fannie mae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "summit credit union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morningstar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "experian", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "transunion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T17:37:10.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14c32572b8ecbbc7660ccc630b2bdbca9402021d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnIw6PGXBMIz3x48NqX8O7RFZAAs4BDHjo9orPbzs3gY9W4K6UqcDOc5RJuhEU73Xvo-", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Former Equifax CEO testifies before Congress", "title_full": "Former Equifax CEO testifies before Congress - Oct. 3, 2017", "published": "2017-10-03T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170919111550-equifax-legal-issues-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 155, "comments": 0, "shares": 155}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14c32572b8ecbbc7660ccc630b2bdbca9402021d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnIw6PGXBMIz3x48NqX8O7RFZAAs4BDHjo9orPbzs3gY9W4K6UqcDOc5RJuhEU73Xvo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Seth Fiegerman and Donna Borak", "published": "2017-10-03T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Former Equifax CEO testifies before Congress", "text": "Former Equifax CEO testifies before Congress by Seth Fiegerman and Donna Borak @CNNMoney October 3, 2017: 4:40 PM ET Legislators grill former Equifax CEO Equifax just got grilled by Congress for the first time over its breach. Or at least one of its former executives did. Richard Smith, the former CEO of Equifax ( EFX ) , testified Tuesday morning before the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the credit reporting firm's massive security breach . Smith apologized numerous times throughout the hearing for the breach and said it was the result of \"human error and technological error.\" \n\"The criminal hack happened on my watch... I take full responsibility,\" he said in opening remarks. \"I'm here today to say to each and every person affected by this breach I'm truly and deeply sorry for what happened.\" \nCongress members were unsatisfied with Smith's apologies. \"You're just required to notify everybody and say, 'So sorry, so sad,'\" Rep. Joe Barton told Smith. \nBarton said it's time \"some teeth\" be imposed on the federal level, possibly by requiring credit agencies to pay consumers when their accounts are hacked. \nOn Monday, Equifax said its breach potentially affected 2.5 million more people than it had previously stated. The total number of people involved may now be as much as 145.5 million. \nRelated: How the Equifax data breach happened: What we know now \nFederal agencies, state officials and members of Congress are currently probing Equifax over its data security practices, customer service response and the possibility of insider trading from executives. \nThe breach compromised some of our most sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, addresses, and driver's license numbers. \nSmith was pressed early in the hearing about executive stock sales that took place before the hack was disclosed to the public. He said the three executives who sold stock were not aware of the breach. \n\"I don't know exactly the date they were informed, but to the best of my knowledge they had no knowledge at the time,\" he said. \nIn another exchange, Smith said he had \"no indication of a breach\" prior to the date of the stock sales, only of \"suspicious activity.\" \nSmith faced questions from legislators about Equifax's botched response to the breach, the months-long delay in announcing it and whether consumers will be compensated for damage caused by identity theft. \nRep. Greg Walden, the Republican chairman of the House subcommittee, pledged Tuesday to hold Equifax and Smith accountable. But he said, \"I don't think I can pass a law that, excuse me for saying, fixes stupid.\" \n\"How could a major U.S. company like Equifax, which holds the most sensitive personal data on Americans, so let them down?\" Walden said in opening remarks at the hearing. \"It's like the guards at Fort Knox forgot to lock the doors and failed to notice thieves emptying the vaults.\" \nSmith said he would expect Equifax to \"cooperate\" with \"particular legislation that arises out of this horrific breach.\" \nThe former CEO's appearance Tuesday marks the first in a series of Equifax hearings in Washington. On Wednesday, Smith will testify twice -- before the Senate Banking Committee and a Senate Judiciary subcommittee on privacy. And on Thursday he will appear before the House Financial Services committee. \nSmith stepped down as CEO three weeks after the breach was announced to the public. \nAfter three hours of grilling, Democrats said today's hearing was not sufficient, pressing for additional hearings with the current Equifax executives, including the CIO and chief legal officer. \n\"I don't think this is resolved,\" said Rep. Anna Eshoo.

She had been worried sick about when she would be able to reach family in Pennsylvania to tell them about the devastation that Hurricane Maria brought on her home in Guayama, Puerto Rico. This weekend she was finally able to use a satellite phone provided by a CNN reporter to call her son and relay her harrowing experience. \n\"I lost my house, I lost my house,\" she told him in Spanish. \"You don't know the suffering that we have gone through.\" \nShe and her boyfriend, Natividad Figueroa, were alive. But their lives were in disrepair. The roof of her house had been ripped off by the storm. She had to convert her laundry room into a makeshift bedroom. Relief workers were nowhere to be seen. \nAnd without reliable communication lines, she had been cut off from the outside world. \n\"I didn't have any way of communicating with you,\" she told her son. \"If it weren't for these girls, I wouldn't have been able to call.\" \nNearly two weeks after Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, the U.S. territory is still reckoning with the aftermath. And among the biggest obstacles is a paralyzing inability for many people on the island to call anyone else. \nAccording to the Federal Communications Commission, about 88% of cell sites on the island were still out of service on Monday. Only 40% of people on the island have wifi, cell service or internet access, according to Puerto Rican officials . \nRelated: Trump's FCC criticized for hurricane response \nCell phone companies are working to restore service. T-Mobile ( TMUS ) told CNNMoney on Sunday that it is \"making progress with repairs and seeing more sites coming back online, but it's going to be a long road to recovery.\" \nSprint said Monday that it has sent equipment to the island, including a chartered cargo flight this week that delivered generators, satellite equipment and other supplies. \nAT&T ( T , Tech30 ) has sent at least four chartered planes with supplies and personnel to the island, and plans to send more soon. \nThe company added that it is powering its equipment using more than 50 generators on the island. AT&T said Monday that it is connecting more than 8 million calls and 4 million texts a day over its network on the island. \n(AT&T has agreed to acquire Time Warner, the parent company of CNN. The deal is pending regulatory approval.) \nThe island faces an immense challenge to get the power back on and communications up again. \nCell sites in Puerto Rico are running on generators that need diesel fuel.

It's not about politics,'\" Yul\u00edn Cruz said. \"That's all the interaction that mayors had with him.\" Read More At the event, Trump praised Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, saying the governor wasn't \"playing politics\" -- an apparent swipe at the San Juan mayor. \"I just want to tell you that right from the beginning this governor was not playing politics,\" Trump said as he huddled with local and federal officials on the island for a briefing on recovery efforts. \"He was giving us the highest grades.\" Trump attacked Yul\u00edn Cruz on Saturday for criticizing the White House's hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, accusing her of \"poor leadership\" and suggesting that the island's residents are not doing enough to help themselves. Trump attacks San Juan mayor over hurricane response \"The mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,\" the President tweeted from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he spent the weekend. \"Such poor leadership ability by the mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. Earlier Tuesday morning, Trump appeared to soften his criticism, saying Yul\u00edn Cruz \"acknowledged\" the work the White House has done on the island. \"Well I think she's come back a long way,\" he said. \"I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done. And people are looking at that. In Texas and in Florida, we get an A-plus. I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico and it's actually a much tougher situation ... Whether it's her or anybody else, they're all starting to say it.\" In the interview following the event, Yul\u00edn Cruz said she would have preferred Trump listen to herself and the other mayors about the situation on the ground, but she said the second portion of the event -- the part without Trump -- was productive. \"I saw a real connection between the reality and the White House staff,\" Yul\u00edn Cruz said. At the event, Trump made a remark about the size of the response needed for the crisis in Puerto Rico that Yul\u00edn Cruz said she found insensitive. \"I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack,\" Trump said jokingly, adding: \"That's fine. We've saved a lot of lives.\" Yul\u00edn Cruz said Trump's comments prove a \"lack of sensibility\" on the part of the President. \"It doesn't make you feel good,\" she said. \"It's about respect for the Puerto Rican people, and it's about saving lives.\" The spectacle of Trump's comments over the weekend slamming Yul\u00edn Cruz and others on their own response efforts as Puerto Rico struggles to deal with a disaster that left millions without power and with limited access to water -- and as Trump comes under fire for what some have called a slow federal reaction -- sparked a firestorm of reaction online. In an interview with MSNBC, Yul\u00edn Cruz said she wasn't making \"nasty comments\" about Trump, adding that her only goal was to save lives. \"I was asking for help,\" she said. \"I wasn't saying anything nasty about the President.\" Yul\u00edn Cruz told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Saturday that she works out of a building that has two Federal Emergency Management Agency envoys and she feels there had been sufficient cooperation. In contrast, Rossell\u00f3 praised the administration on Saturday, saying it had done a good job of responding to Puerto Rico's concerns after the hurricane. \"We need to do a lot more in order for us to get out of the emergency,\" Rossell\u00f3 said in San Juan. \"But the other thing that's also true is that the administration has answered and has complied with our petitions in an expedited manner.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen yul\u00edn cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yul\u00edn cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose cruz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:26:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e309f6b95750249f0e513680cf1df0f6556baf39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiXH9_vyjJq7a1ZheduTyHHiCiVKRbaF.XpFw.C6oNmnVDvmhtRhHsdg--", "site_full": "rss.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["advertising", "business"], "section_title": "", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Puerto Rico's new preventable deaths | Buzz AffCart", "title_full": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Puerto Rico's new preventable deaths | Buzz AffCart", "published": "2017-10-03T17:08:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.709, "main_image": "https://buzz.affcart.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/170928182243-gupta-hospital-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 111}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e309f6b95750249f0e513680cf1df0f6556baf39", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/WOapK6QZrmmCyAK3WcZowOz.E9FWISoiXH9_vyjJq7a1ZheduTyHHiCiVKRbaF.XpFw.C6oNmnVDvmhtRhHsdg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Buzz Affcart", "published": "2017-10-03T17:08:00.000+03:00", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Puerto Rico's new preventable deaths | Buzz AffCart", "text": "Facebook 6.4 shares \u2018);$vidEndSlate.removeClass(\u2018video__end-slate\u2013inactive\u2019).addClass(\u2018video__end-slate\u2013active\u2019);}};CNN.autoPlayVideoExist = (CNN.autoPlayVideoExist === true) ?

aid delivery 02:19 Story highlights The town of Guayanilla was ravaged by Hurricane Maria two weeks ago The National Guard arrived on Monday with food and water provided by FEMA Guayanilla, Puerto Rico (CNN) Cely Rivera can't take the lines anymore. Lines for cash, lines for food, lines for water and lines for gas. What's worse: She never knows when supplies and aid will arrive in her hometown of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico. It's a hillside community dotted with coffee and plantain farms on the island's southwest coast and like many other cities and towns across the island, it was heavily damaged by Hurricane Maria. \"The lines are endless,\" Rivera, a 37-year-old mother of two, told CNN as 90-degree heat and a blazing sun bore down on her and dozens of others waiting for food. \"There are towns where aid still hasn't arrived.\" Puerto Rico's National Guard arrived in Guayanilla on Monday with food and water provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. Read More It was the first time since Hurricane Maria tore across the island two weeks ago that FEMA supplies had come directly to Guayanilla. Local officials previously had been going to the capital, San Juan, to pick up FEMA aid. This time, National Guard members made the two-hour drive around the island to deliver the aid: more than 6,000 bottles of water and more than 3,500 meals. Criticism continues to grow over the Trump administration's response to the disaster in Puerto Rico. President Trump says any talk of a slow response is fake news. In Guayanilla, where almost no one has electricity at home yet and few have running water, residents say the delay feels very real. The response \"is fast in the San Juan area but the south is forgotten,\" says Lisa Marie Estrada, 38, who was with her daughter and granddaughter waiting for food and water. Like Rivera and many others who spoke to CNN, Estrada stumbled upon the FEMA supplies by chance. She was walking by, saw people gathering and asked what was going on. Even local officials in Guayanilla said neither FEMA nor the Puerto Rico Army National Guard gave them any notice they were coming. Cell service is nearly nonexistent on this part of the island, two weeks after the storm. \"That's one of the biggest problems we have: the lack of communication,\" says Carlos Jirau, a contracted organizer working for the municipality's government. Even little things weren't made clear on Monday to residents desperate for aid. Some waited several minutes in the food line when they wanted to be in the water line, and vice versa. At a bigger level, the steps between start and finish show why this response by the federal government has been more dogged than others, according to a FEMA official in San Juan. The necessities to complete those steps -- cell phone service -- make each one that much more difficult to accomplish. In the mainland United States, FEMA and National Guard troops typically hand out aid -- food and water -- directly to residents at a local distribution center. Pretty simple. Not so in Puerto Rico. First, aid arrives either at the airport or sea port. Then truckers deliver it to FEMA's supply base in San Juan. After that, FEMA and the National Guard bring aid to one of several distribution centers on the island. From there, local mayors, police or authorized leaders can pick up the aid -- sometimes driving two hours each way -- and then bring it back to their towns to distribute. That extra, critical step with local government requires communication, which is extremely difficult, especially in the island's less populated areas.

The group includes Italy's Sacred Convent of Assisi, the School Sisters of Notre Dame and the Bishops' Conference of Belgium. \n\"Catholic institutions' decision to remove their support for fossil fuels is based on both their shared value of environmental protection and the financial wisdom of preparing for a carbon-neutral economy,\" the Global Catholic Climate Movement, which coordinated the effort, said in a statement. \nCecilia Dall'Oglio, the group's European programs coordinator, said the total number of Catholic organizations committed to ditching fossil fuel investments has now surpassed 60. Early members of the group include the U.S.-based Wheaton Franciscans and the Italian Jesuits. \nDall'Oglio said the organizations were divesting from the largest 200 public coal, oil and gas companies, a list that includes BP ( BP ) , Chevron ( CVX ) and Exxon ( XOM ) . She said they were responding to Pope Francis' call to action on climate change. \n\nFrancis, who leads the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, said in a landmark encyclical in 2015 that there is \"a clear, definitive and ineluctable ethical imperative to act on climate change.\" \n\"The Earth, our home, is beginning to look more and more like an immense pile of filth,\" he said. \"In many parts of the planet, the elderly lament that once beautiful landscapes are now covered with rubbish.\" \nPope Francis: Worship of money helps terrorism to grow \nThe divestment announcement was timed to coincide with the feast day of Saint Francis of Assisi, which is observed on Wednesday. \nFather Enzo Fortunato, director of the press office of the Sacred Convent of Assisi, said divestment from fossil sources is a way to put the pope's message into motion. Francis of Assisi is associated with environmental causes. \n\"Pope Francis affirms that St. Francis is a beautiful example that motivates respect for the planet earth,\" he said. \n-- Valentina Di Donato contributed reporting. \nCNNMoney (London)   3, 2017: 11:41 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oglio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pope francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "-- valentina di donato", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cecilia dall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enzo fortunato", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "exxon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.-based wheaton franciscans", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chevron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global catholic climate movement", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belgium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "notre dame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assisi", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:58:19.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1440c49372962ea9aebf871735d4114d8c41137e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnLCGY5DER9yKHWJOSGwiHTpemLhQclaK7aqOMdaF5SrLi1VXs4o2RQbXDfNWjrZmFQvhC3JZQxCorpKLwsGpv5tZpGWexbsbgo-", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Warren Buffett gets into the truck stop business", "title_full": "Warren Buffett gets into the truck stop business - Oct. 3, 2017", "published": "2017-10-03T18:58:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171003090424-warren-buffett-pilot-flying-j-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 214, "comments": 0, "shares": 214}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1440c49372962ea9aebf871735d4114d8c41137e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnLCGY5DER9yKHWJOSGwiHTpemLhQclaK7aqOMdaF5SrLi1VXs4o2RQbXDfNWjrZmFQvhC3JZQxCorpKLwsGpv5tZpGWexbsbgo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Paul R.

La Monica @lamonicabuzz October 3, 2017: 10:58 AM ET Buffett: Dow will hit 1 million in 100 years Warren Buffett loves trains, planes and automobiles. It looks like he has a thing for trucks, too. Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKA ) , the conglomerate controlled by Buffett, announced Tuesday it was buying a 38.6% stake in Pilot Flying J, the truck stop operator run by Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam. Haslam will remain CEO of the company, which has more than 750 locations in 44 states and generated more than $20 billion in sales last year. \nBut Berkshire ( BRKB ) will eventually become the majority owner of Pilot Flying J. As part of the deal, Berkshire will buy an additional 41.3% stake in the company in 2023, bringing its stake to just under 80%. The Haslam family will own the remaining 20%. \nBerkshire also owns railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and it is a big investor in airlines Delta ( DAL ) , American ( AAL ) , Southwest ( LUV ) and United Continental ( UAL ) as well as Big 3 car company GM ( GM ) . \nIt's also the parent company of auto insurer Geico and airplane engine parts maker Precision Castparts. \nBuffett is famous for investing in businesses that he can easily understand and that can benefit from a strong U.S. economy. Transportation clearly fits that bill. \n\"Jimmy Haslam and his team have created an industry leader and a key enabler of the nation's economy,\" Buffett said in a statement about the Pilot Flying J deal. \"[He] has a smart growth strategy in place and we look forward to a partnership that supports the trucking industry for years to come.\" \nJimmy Haslam praised Berkshire as a good partner in a release. \n\"We knew that any potential partner would need to share our commitment and have a proven track record as a long-term investor,\" Haslam said. \"We have that in Berkshire Hathaway -- they believe in our strategy, support our team and are excited to see Pilot Flying J grow. We are honored and humbled to partner with them.\" \nRelated: Buffett trolls Trump and GOP about tax cuts \nHaslam's father James, the company's founder and chairman, added that he was pleased Berkshire will keep the company's headquarters in Knoxville, Tennessee. \nAnother Haslam son, Bill, is the Republican governor of Tennessee. Buffett, a Democrat, supported Hillary Clinton in her run for president in 2016. \nBut Buffett has made it no secret that he's more interested in money than politics. After all, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, a longtime friend of Buffett, is a Republican.   3, 2017: 10:58 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "warren buffett", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jimmy haslam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie munger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "dow", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ual", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "southwest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "precision castparts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burlington northern santa fe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united continental", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland browns", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "geico", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "knoxville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "berkshire hathaway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T18:58:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54265f5eb580d4ba4b69d54e4aa8078e51bcb7cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnJ2A4RuTpWUkUu1OAwyizf6gir00WgPxFyo1EDZffPAUBKHHtnaoYA9RA1rVwBHn44Jlo1OJbQ7mA--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Vegas worries: Will international tourists stay away?", "title_full": "Vegas worries: Will international tourists stay away? - Oct. 3, 2017", "published": "2017-10-03T18:50:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171003154735-las-vegas-crime-tape-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 2, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 259, "comments": 0, "shares": 259}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54265f5eb580d4ba4b69d54e4aa8078e51bcb7cc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnJ2A4RuTpWUkUu1OAwyizf6gir00WgPxFyo1EDZffPAUBKHHtnaoYA9RA1rVwBHn44Jlo1OJbQ7mA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Alanna Petroff", "published": "2017-10-03T18:50:00.000+03:00", "title": "Vegas worries: Will international tourists stay away?", "text": "Vegas worries: Will international tourists stay away? by Alanna Petroff @AlannaPetroff October 4, 2017: 11:28 AM ET Mass shooting in Vegas: What happened Will international tourists keep coming? It's a key question to be answered as Las Vegas grapples with the aftermath of the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history. More than a quarter-million people work in the city's hotels , restaurants, bars and casinos. Their jobs are supported by 43 million tourists a year, a fifth of whom come from abroad. Put another way: 1 in 10 international visitors to the U.S. stops in Vegas. \n\"The recovery time [for Las Vegas tourism] will depend on media coverage of the aftermath and the authorities' ability to spread a feeling of improved security,\" said Olivier Jager, CEO of travel intelligence firm ForwardKeys. \nTravel experts say that Americans will continue coming to Vegas since the gunman appears to have been working alone, with no known connections to terrorist groups. The public generally interprets this as a sign that future attacks are unlikely. \n\"Visitors are resilient when it comes to this kind of isolated incident and do not relate it to the destination,\" said the World Travel & Tourism Council. \"Although this attack is unprecedented in its scale and tragic impact, we believe that travel and tourism to Las Vegas will hold up.\" \nBut there are more concerns about how international travelers may react. \n\"I think it's more international [tourists who] might cancel because they're afraid of the gun violence in the United States,\" said Diane Bean, a travel agent based in Maine who runs her own company, Off On Vacation. \nAmericans own the most guns per person in the world, with about four in 10 saying they either own a gun or live in a home with guns, according to a recent Pew Center study. There are more public mass shootings in America than any other country. \nBut those statistics have been true for years. \n\"There are so few places in the world that are untouched [by violence or danger],\" said Bean. \"Not everyone can afford to go to Tahiti.\" \nCanadians, Brits, Mexicans and Germans are most likely to travel to Las Vegas, according to ForwardKeys. Like Americans, they visit the desert city for the gambling, weddings, theater performances, conferences, hot weather and lavish night life. \nPatrick Surry, chief data scientist at travel firm Hopper, said demand for Vegas trips should rebound even if there are a flurry of cancellations this week. \n\"People have short memories and it's probably not a long-lasting impact on travelers,\" he said. \nRelated: Tourists are returning to Paris after attacks \nParis and London, for example, have remained resilient in the face of violence. \nFewer visitors came to Paris following a major terror attack in 2015. But numbers have rebounded in a big way, with hotel stays increasing by 10% in the first half of this year. \nDemand for trips to London, which welcomes about 19 million travelers a year, has held up following the June attack near London Bridge. Overseas visitors to Britain surged by 6% in July over the previous year, setting a new record for the month. \nRelated: What the Las Vegas killing spree could mean for the gun industry \nVegas has one more card up its sleeves: Conventions and conferences, which attracted 6.3 million people to the city last year. \nOne good sign: Trade show organizer IMEX Group said in a statement that it plans to go ahead with a conference scheduled for next week.

Foot traffic to Amazon's new grocery store jumped 17% during the week that Whole Foods cut its prices , compared to the same week a year earlier, according to data analytics firm Thasos Group. Walmart ( WMT ) and Kroger ( KR ) accounted for a combined 40% of new customers to Whole Foods between August 28 to September 3. Regular shoppers of Sprouts and Target also shifted loyalty, but it was Trader Joe's that was hit the hardest: Nearly 10% of its regular customers went to Whole Foods that week. \nAfter completing its $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods in late August, Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) slashed the prices of dozens of items at all 460 of its new grocery stores. From fresh fish to produce, prices were down across the board. \nOrganic bananas got a 30-cent price cut. Avocados are $1.50 less. Organic brown eggs, butter, fresh Atlantic salmon, apples, almond butter and rotisserie chickens also got major price cuts. \nRelated: Whole Foods just got a whole lot cheaper \nCustomers appear to be sticking around after the price cut. Although the initial surge to Whole Foods has slipped, foot traffic remains up 4% for the week ending on Sept. 16. \nThe price cuts didn't attract customers from lower incomes, however. Whole Foods may have shed its' \"whole paycheck\" moniker, but its new shoppers are still coming from the wealthiest demographics. \nThasos gathered the information using customers' mobile phone locations. The company was founded at MIT and is used by hedge funds to analyze data trends.

That's roughly half of all Americans. And the personal information exposed could be used by thieves to steal your identity. That's even worse than someone stealing your credit card number. \nIDENTITY THEFT NIGHTMARE \nJust ask William Burnett. He doesn't know how or when cybercriminals got his personal information, but he continues to receive evidence that fraudulent accounts have been opened in his name. \nSo far he has not lost any money as a result of the fraud, but his credit has taken a steep and fast nosedive.

Putting a lock on your credit will stop anyone from opening a fraudulent account in your name. But you'll have to temporarily \"unlock\" your credit report if you want to open a new line of credit yourself. \nYou can lock your credit with Equifax now by enrolling in their credit monitoring service TrustedID Premier, which the company made free for one year. The \"free for life\" credit lock service isn't expected to launch until January. \nCREDIT LOCK VS. CREDIT FREEZE \nBut consumer advocates are questioning the company's decision to offer a lifelong credit lock instead of a state-regulated credit freeze.

New York's alleged 'Chelsea bomber' goes on trial Monday \"By some miracle, no one was killed that day,\" Crowley said. Meantime, Rahimi's attorney, Meghan Gilligan, cast the 29-year-old as a family man who grew up in New Jersey, worked for his father and was a father himself. If convicted, Rahimi could face life in prison . Testimony continues Tuesday in the case. Read More Rahimi, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, faces charges in other jurisdictions in connection with bombs found within hours of the Chelsea blast in a wastebasket near a rail station in Elizabeth and near the start of a Marine Corps charity run in Seaside Park, New Jersey, as well as with crimes tied to a shootout that led to his arrest, according to a criminal complaint. Jurors promised a look at defendant's notebook US District Judge Richard Berman had warned Rahimi on Monday to stop interrupting Crowley. The defendant later returned to court -- after the jury had been ushered out -- and apologized for speaking out of turn. He also told the judge he'd been allowed too few family visits, noting that visits with his children had been infrequent and that it had been more than a year since he'd seen his wife Bomb suspect: FBI got interviews under misleading circumstances Berman said he would look into the complaints. Crowley, in her opening statement, said Rahimi believed he was a soldier in a holy war and had been influenced by Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda and ISIS, citing his Internet search history. She also told jurors they would see Rahimi's notebook, which includes the phrases, \"the sound of bombs will be heard in the streets\" and \"death to your oppression,\" along with an entry about attacking non-believers. Jurors on Monday also saw surveillance video of the blast from several businesses in Chelsea, and were introduced to survivors of the explosion . An architect described experiencing a \"deafening sound and blinding light\" that thrust her to her knees as she walked home. A hotel manager said the scene had \"that same smell of 9/11: burning plastic and burning wood.\" A woman testified that she had to have metal shards removed from her chest and legs as a result of the explosion. 911 call likely saved lives, prosecutors say Jurors also heard the 911 call Jane Schreibman made when she came across \"a suspicious package\" blocks away from the Chelsea blast site -- a pressure cooker in a plastic bag covered in duct tape with wires sticking out. \"I knew it was a pressure cooker and people make bombs out of pressure cookers,\" she said.

In a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in June , 94%(!) of Americans supported the idea of all gun purchases being subject to background checks -- including 92% of people who live in a home with a gun. A Pew poll from this past summer showed that 89% of gun owners and 89% of non-gun owners support preventing mentally ill people from buying guns. Typically, on issues where nine in 10 Americans agree, Congress find a way to act. After all, the job of members of Congress, broadly speaking, is to represent the interests of their constituents. And, in raw political terms, doing something that 90%+ of the public wants is a smart move. So, why has no major -- or, really, even minor -- gun control passed Congress since the assault weapons ban in the mid-1990s? And why, in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, did Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy's legislation to close the gun show loophole and ban firearms sales over the Internet fail -- with all but one Republican opposing it and three Democrats also voting against it? The most-common answer is the National Rifle Association. There's no question that the NRA has built a very powerful lobbying and political machine in Washington -- and shown a willingness to support those who support them and go after those who don't. Read More But it isn't the NRA's lobbying or political donations that are responsible for why nothing gets done. It's the broader idea -- which the NRA and lots of Republican elected officials push -- that, at root, any attempt to make gun laws stricter amounts to the first step on a slippery slope that eventually leads to liberals coming to your house and confiscating your guns. \"Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment,\" Donald Trump said at a rally in North Carolina in August 2016. It was a claim he repeated time and again on the campaign trail as a way of amping up the stakes -- and the threat -- in the election. Trump has continued to beat that drum in office. \"If Crooked Hillary got elected, you would not have a 2nd Amendment, believe me,\" Trump told a rally in Alabama last month . JUST WATCHED Trump in Alabama in September: You'd turn over your rifles to Clinton Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTrump in Alabama in September: You'd turn over your rifles to Clinton 00:48 This claim is not true. Clinton expressly stated that she believes \"gun ownership is part of the fabric of many law-abiding communities\" while also noting \"too many families in America have suffered from gun violence.\" She has said that while gun ownership is a constitutional right it should be subject to \"reasonable regulation.\" And she is, without question, a supporter of stricter gun laws, including closing the gun show loophole, banning online sales of guns and reversing the immunity granted gun manufacturers and sellers. But none of that is the same thing as Clinton calling for a mass round-up of guns or repealing the 2nd Amendment. This accusation is not unique to Clinton. Former President Barack Obama who, like Clinton openly favored more restrictive gun laws, was regularly accused of wanting to collect everyone's guns. Here's what he said about that last year: \"First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks' guns is just not true. And I don't care how many times the NRA says it. I'm about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I have been president than just about any time in US history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever, ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it's just not true.\" What's difficult is that no matter how many times Clinton or Obama -- or any other prominent gun control supporter -- insists publicly that they have no interest in some sort of mass gun seizure, it doesn't change the minds of those who believe the idea. Those folks think that Democrats have a secret plan -- that the likes of Clinton and Obama deny publicly -- to get rid of all guns in the country. Their evidence? Obama's expressed disdain in a private setting for those who \"cling to guns .\" Audio of Clinton's comments at a private fundraiser in which she said that the Supreme Court was \"wrong\" on the 2nd Amendment. (Clinton was referring to a specific case in which Washington's handgun ban was struck down .) While these comments are surely sentiments with which gun rights supporters disagree, they don't amount to any sort of broad-scale conspiracy within the Democratic Party to round up all the guns in the country. (Aside from the lack of actual evidence of this plan, the sheer logistics of such an effort would be mind-bogglingly complex.) But, conspiracy theories are not built on rational evidence. They are built on irrational fear. Fear, of course, is a hugely powerful political motivator. The idea of roving bands of liberals grabbing for your guns and robbing you of a fundamental freedom is scary to lots of people. And so, when a group or a politician suggests that any attempt to restrict gun rights or close loopholes is the first step in the execution of the broader gun-collection plan they have always warned you about, it's easy to see why so many gun rights supporters react the way they do. But conspiracy theories aren't facts. And the facts make clear that the idea of some sort of national gun seizure isn't something any politician is interesting in.

She died shortly before the end of World War II at the age of 15 in a concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen, Germany. She was survived by Otto, who returned to publish her diary in 1947. In the aftermath of the war, Dutch police launched probes into the betrayal of the Frank family at the insistence of Otto Frank, who suspected a warehouse worker of having disclosed their location, but the investigations were inconclusive. Read More Last year, research conducted by the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam suggested that the location of the secret annex could have been uncovered by the Gestapo by accident, and not as part of a mission to find and arrest its residents based on a tip-off from an informant, as previously thought. Anne Frank's arrest might not have stemmed from betrayal This new investigation, however, will reconstruct the events prior to the discovery and look at all 30 suspects who have been accused over time of betraying the Frank family, hoping to solve the mystery that has puzzled historians. The data generated from Frank's diary and the archives available from that period will be scanned by specialist software to narrow down the suspects. The multidisciplinary investigative team of 20 includes detectives, data analysts, profilers, historians and criminologists. The experts are also seeking tips from members of the public and using actors to reenact witness and suspect statements obtained in the past. The Anne Frank House has opened its doors and archives to the \"Cold Case Diary\" project, which is being filmed and is relying on crowd-funding to pay for its investigation. \"Every school aged-child knows about Anne Frank and so did I. I remember that once in 2005, I was in Amsterdam on a mission, and my Dutch colleague drove me through Amsterdam. While passing the Anne Frank House he told me that this case has never been solved. That surprised me,\" Pankoke said in a statement provided to CNN by Proditione Media, the production company behind the project. \"I must say that I always had a keen interest since my father and his two brothers fought in WW2,\" Pankoke added. \"My father once told me that his unit liberated a concentration camp near Mittenwald and he never could forget the sight of this place and its prisoners.\" Rare handwritten Anne Frank poem smashes auction estimate Xomnia, an Amsterdam-based software company specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), will be providing the software for processing data from various archives. \"There is simply far too much data available nowadays for a human brain to analyze,\" a spokesperson for Xomnia said in a statement provided by Proditione Media. \"Our software allows [researchers] to search the data and visualize it new ways. This has already led to a few new traces.\" \"The Anne Frank House's new investigation [in 2016] does not refute the possibility that the people in hiding were betrayed, but illustrates that other scenarios should also be considered,\" Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House, said in a statement to CNN. \"We are pleased that 'Cold Case Diary' is also carrying out research into the arrest and following new leads, and we are interested to see the results.\" Pankoke, who was awarded a medal by the Colombian government for his success in tracking drug cartels, will be detailing the progress of the investigation online. He hopes to unveil the project's findings on the 75th anniversary of the discovery of the Frank family in hiding, on August 4, 2019. \"Considering the amount of data to review, normally I would be pessimistic, but now with these great experts in the team and the AI component, I am really optimistic,\" he said. \"To choose that specific date feels like honoring the victims.

She is vice president of communications and strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Follow her at @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. \n(CNN) While the failure of the Obamacare repeal, the mishandling of the hurricane in Puerto Rico and the dangerous threats made toward North Korea are making national headlines, there is another story that could be more damaging to Trump in 2020.\nJen Psaki Behind the scenes, Donald Trump is not draining the swamp. He is the lead swamp monster. And he has created a cabinet that is ready and willing to take advantage of the taxpayer dollar. Take his former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price as an example. His resignation is cause for celebration for members of both political parties, opponents and advocates for Obamacare. When given the opportunity to work with Democrats on fixing Obamacare, even with some openness expressed by President Trump, he did not pursue it. And twice he went along with Senate leadership as they tried and failed to repeal Obamacare. For a former orthopedic surgeon and long serving members of Congress, his short record of service at the head of the health care agency will be marked by his complete inability to improve the quality or cost of healthcare for Americans. But his reason for departing is not about his failure as a leader or a policy maker. It is about his shocking use of private jets on the taxpayer dime. He reportedly took multiple chartered flights for official business with a combined cost of over $1 million . Price has said he will reimburse the government for the cost of his seat on those flights, but that only amounts to $51,887.31 . The wrong scandal cost Tom Price his job Read More No, this is not normal. I can only speak for Obama Administration officials in the exact same position. But Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Secretary Sylvia Burwell only took commercial flights. Why? We worked for the American people and did not want to waste their money on unnecessary extravagances. In response, Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, issued new guidelines for cabinet travel. Moving forward, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly must pre-approve all \"travel on government-owned, rented, leased, or chartered aircraft.\" But Price's flights are just the tip of the iceberg. Price is not the only member of Trump's cabinet who has used private charter flights paid for by the American taxpayer. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin reportedly asked the White House about using a government jet for his honeymoon, which he claims was just one of many options \"to ensure he had access to secure communications ... as he traveled.\" Meanwhile, Mnuchin's flight to Fort Knox, where he, his wife Louise Linton and Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell watched the solar eclipse, is currently under review by the Treasury Department's Inspector General. Meanwhile, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has used private planes for trips to his hometown and the Caribbean. He told CNN he only used private planes when several Interior professionals advised him no other options were available. But the Department of the Interior's inspector general's office has now opened a full investigation. And Trump himself may have been padding his own pockets -- or, to be more exact, the pockets of his family businesses -- with American taxpayer money for months. Trump's rich Cabinet needs private jets. Don't we all? He kicked off his 2020 campaign with a re-election fundraiser hosted at none other than the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. While there have not been specific numbers released on how much the property made off of the event, the publicity was no doubt a benefit and the Trump team was projected to pocket $10 million in the process for the campaign fund. Members of his White House staff have repeatedly used their platform to promote family businesses. The director of the Office of Government Ethics even called for White House Senior Advisor Kelllyanne Conway to be disciplined after encouraging viewers to \"go buy Ivanka's stuff\" during an interview with Fox News earlier this year. But the most egregious is Trump's use of travel as a means of promoting his properties and providing a reason to make entry more exclusive and expensive. Mar-a-Lago, one of the most infamous of the Trump properties, has upped its member fee to $200,000 since the election. That is twice the previous fee. And the club's profits in the first quarter have more than doubled from just over $15 million in 2014-2015 to more than $35 million from January 2016 to spring 2017. He has also not drawn a line when it comes to profiting from foreign governments enjoying the glitz and glamour of his hotels. Saudi government lobbyists spent more than $200,000 at the Washington, DC property this year alone. My Instagram beef with Linton: #Deplorable Before resigning in protest, the head of the Government Ethics office, Walter Schaub, stated , \"I can't know what their intention is. I know that the effect is that there is an appearance that the businesses are profiting from his occupying the presidency. And appearance matters as much as reality.\" This is all learning on the job, right? No. Instead of apologizing and paying back taxpayer money, Zinke has called the accusations \"a little BS.\" Mnuchin, for his part, has refused to commit to taking only commercial flights during his time in office. Shorthand: Taxpayers, your money is my money, and I will use it as I see fit. I am old enough to remember when then-candidate John McCain couldn't remember how many houses he owned and then-candidate Mitt Romney stated that \"47% of the Americans pay no income tax.\" These moments didn't end their presidential campaigns, but they showed how these two nominees were completely disconnected from the struggles of working Americans. How could Mitt Romney or John McCain fight to make life better for Americans who needed help the most? They didn't get it. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \nBut as with almost any recent debate between prominent members of both parties, today we are in an entirely unprecedented situation. The rampant abuse of taxpayer money, combined with the arrogant responses from Trump and his cabinet members, should send a chill down the spine of the Republican party. But it should especially unnerve those who elected him to drain the swamp. After all, this isn't just about Tom Price.

Angus King asked Mattis: \"Do you believe it is in our national security interest at the present time to remain in the (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action)? That is a yes or no question.\" Mattis replied, \"Yes, senator, I do.\" \"The point I would make is if we can confirm that Iran is living by the agreement, if we can determine that this is in our best interests then clearly we should stay with it,\" Mattis added. \"I believe at this point in time absent indications to the contrary, it is something the President should consider staying with.\" But Mattis went on to explain that he also supports a rigorous review of national security issues related to Iran that may fall outside the exact terms of the agreement. Read More \"The President has to consider more broadly things that rightly fall under his portfolio of looking out for the American people in areas that go beyond the specific letters of the JCPOA -- in that regard I support the rigorous review that he has got going on right now,\" he said. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal, most recently during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month. \"We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,\" Trump told the assembly. The President and administration officials have said the deal doesn't address Iran's missile development or its activities in the region, including support for Houthi rebels in Yemen and for the regime of Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Money flowing to Iran because of sanctions relief is allowing Tehran to fund these destabilizing activities, the administration argues. During his own address at the UN General Assembly , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said it would be a \"great pity\" if \"rogue newcomers\" destroy the international nuclear deal that lifted sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran's nuclear program. \"It will be a great pity if this agreement were destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,\" he added in a clear reference to US President Donald Trump, who addressed the General Assembly the day before. \"I declare to you the Islamic Republic of Iran will not be the first country to violate the agreement, but it will respond decisively and resolutely to its violation by any party,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mattis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hassan rouhani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus king", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james mattis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate armed services committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "defense", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "un general assembly", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic republic of iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yemen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tehran", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T19:16:36.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3927409d1eebbbb983fd9004db0e03ac093ea375", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtKlcGqa0ZflWiP0NanvIwXSE94nwIcMzC4fqQtMsY8NxW866hlchkY4g8ikfmt.AKBVn3EU_fyP0Q--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Gun control state of play: Strong words, little action in Congress - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Gun control state of play: Strong words, little action in Congress - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-10-03T17:25:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.036, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 568, "comments": 0, "shares": 568}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3927409d1eebbbb983fd9004db0e03ac093ea375", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtKlcGqa0ZflWiP0NanvIwXSE94nwIcMzC4fqQtMsY8NxW866hlchkY4g8ikfmt.AKBVn3EU_fyP0Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lauren Fox", "published": "2017-10-03T17:25:00.000+03:00", "title": "Gun control state of play: Strong words, little action in Congress - CNNPolitics", "text": "Kimmel gives an emotional plea to lawmakers 01:43 Story highlights Democrats were pessimistic on gun control options in a GOP Congress Both sides are dug in and the prospects for change are nearly non-existent (CNN) Republican and Democratic members were reeling Monday in the wake of the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas, which left at least 59 people dead and hundreds injured. But on Capitol Hill, the sense that something can be done to stop future shootings was almost non-existent. Even Democrats who have been central to past efforts to overhaul the country's gun laws offered little hope that they would be able to forge a bipartisan solution in a Republican-controlled Congress. What are Democrats are saying? CNN's Ashley Killough caught up with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and author of an assault weapons ban in the mid-1990s, and she spoke about the prospects -- or lack thereof -- for gun reforms in the wake of the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history. The gun debate, again Read More While Feinstein described the shooting as \"extraordinary,\" \"extreme\" and \"heartbreaking,\" she offered little to no optimism that things would change. \"You know, I thought Sandy Hook would. I thought Columbine would. I thought 101 California would,\" she said, referring to a 1993 San Francisco shooting that left nine dead. \"None of that did.\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat who was central to fighting for universal background checks after Sandy Hook, has said he wants to continue fighting for background checks. The Sandy Hook senator has a blunt message: 'It's time for Congress to get off its ass and do something' \"Background checks still (are) the most likely piece of legislation to get passed through Congress because it enjoys widespread public approval and it frankly is probably most dispositive on the amount of gun violence that happens every day across this country,\" he said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Monday she wants Speaker Paul Ryan to create a select committee on gun violence. So Democrats want to see movement. What should we expect? This Congress is controlled by Republicans and that matters here. Remember, even when Democrats had control of the Senate after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, they still could not pass a bill to ensure every gun purchased in this country underwent a background check. That had some of their own red-state members voting against that. In a lot of ways, Monday was a bizarre day on Capitol Hill. Concerned citizens might ask the questions about what should happen after Vegas, but congressional observers know how senators are going to answer the questions based on the \"R\" or \"D\" behind their names. Both sides are very dug in here and the prospects for change are virtually non-existent. What about the gun suppressor bill? The \"Hearing Protection Act,\" which aims to loosen rules around gun silencers, was added to a broader bill called the \"Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act\" that passed through committee last month. 8 charts that explain America's gun culture A senior House GOP leadership aide told CNN that there are \"unresolved issues with the larger package and it is not on the schedule.\" This aide wouldn't say when it might come up for a full House vote, but said until the broader issues are taken care of there was no move to bring it up for a vote. Ryan said Tuesday morning the SHARE Act is not scheduled for a vote on the House floor. \"That bill is not scheduled right now. I don't know when it will be scheduled,\" Ryan said at his news conference, adding that the present focus is on the budget and tax reform. Asked about what Congress can do to prevent shootings in the wake of Las Vegas, the speaker focused on mental health. \"It is important as we see the dust settle and see what is behind these tragedies that mental health is a critical ingredient,\" the Wisconsin Republican said. South Carolina GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan, the lead sponsor of the bill, took issue with how people are characterizing the bill, saying, \"nothing is silent about it. Even a 22 long rifle, one of the smallest calibers, isn't silent. It's about the same decibel level as a jackhammer.

Kimmel's raw emotion -- something rarely seen on television and even more unique for a late-night comedian -- made for a remarkably compelling moment amid the national mourning for the victims of the attack outside the Mandalay Bay casino late Sunday night. It was also a stirring call to action as Kimmel urged members of Congress to do something -- anything -- about the wave of gun violence in the country. \"When someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls, we take every precaution to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" Kimmel said. \"When an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, we say there's nothing we can do about that.\" Kimmel veered between breaking down in tears and angrily denouncing the National Rifle Association for its refusal to budge on what he described as \"common sense\" measures to limit these mass catastrophes committed with guns. Of Republican lawmakers who voted against gun control measures in the wake of last year's shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that left 49 people dead, Kimmel said: \"They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.\" (Kimmel showed pictures on screen of many of the senators and House members who voted against that legislation.) Read More While Kimmel's anger -- and lines like the one above -- will likely draw most of the attention (and criticism from Republicans), the most striking moment of his monologue for me came when he expressed his weariness with the predictable repetitiveness of this cycle of gun violence. Here's that moment: \"We'll pray for Las Vegas ... bills will be written, they'll be watered down, they'll fail, the NRA will smother it all with money and over time we'll get distracted and will move on to the next thing. And then it will happen again. And again.\" That cycle is already playing itself out. A handful of Democratic senators, including Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a leading voice pushing for gun control , are set to hold a news conference in Washington Tuesday pushing for closing the \"gun show loophole\" and expanding background checks. President Donald Trump, en route to Puerto Rico to view the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria, gave a vague statement: \"We'll be talking about gun laws.\" Rinse. Wash. Repeat. As I documented Monday, views on guns are tied very closely not only to partisanship but also to culture . Gun owners believe owning a gun is a fundamental freedom that, if curtailed, is a slippery slope to losing that right (and others with it) entirely. Gun control supporters see the claims of 2nd Amendment rights as a catch-all for avoiding any real debate on the matter. Unfortunately, Kimmel's comments are already being sliced and diced by the political machine. Republicans, citing his opposition to their attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare -- and the fact he consulted with Senate Democrats on some talking points -- dismiss him as just another liberal Hollywood type, out of touch with real America. But people should watch Kimmel's full monologue -- whether you agree with him or not. His anger, his sadness, his frustration, his confusion, his real and honest emotion are not something that should be so easily dismissed as just more political pablum. There is more we can do, and we need to do it.

Clinton expressly stated that she believes \"gun ownership is part of the fabric of many law-abiding communities\" while also noting \"too many families in America have suffered from gun violence.\" She has said that while gun ownership is a constitutional right it should be subject to \"reasonable regulation.\" And she is, without question, a supporter of stricter gun laws, including closing the gun show loophole, banning online sales of guns and reversing the immunity granted gun manufacturers and sellers. But none of that is the same thing as Clinton calling for a mass round-up of guns or repealing the 2nd Amendment. This accusation is not unique to Clinton. Former President Barack Obama who, like Clinton openly favored more restrictive gun laws, was regularly accused of wanting to collect everyone's guns. Here's what he said about that last year: \"First of all, the notion that I or Hillary or Democrats or whoever you want to choose are hell-bent on taking away folks' guns is just not true. And I don't care how many times the NRA says it. I'm about to leave office. There have been more guns sold since I have been president than just about any time in US history. There are enough guns for every man, woman and child in this country. And at no point have I ever, ever proposed confiscating guns from responsible gun owners. So it's just not true.\" What's difficult is that no matter how many times Clinton or Obama -- or any other prominent gun control supporter -- insists publicly that they have no interest in some sort of mass gun seizure, it doesn't change the minds of those who believe the idea. Those folks think that Democrats have a secret plan -- that the likes of Clinton and Obama deny publicly -- to get rid of all guns in the country. Their evidence? Obama's expressed disdain in a private setting for those who \"cling to guns .\" Audio of Clinton's comments at a private fundraiser in which she said that the Supreme Court was \"wrong\" on the 2nd Amendment. (Clinton was referring to a specific case in which Washington's handgun ban was struck down .) While these comments are surely sentiments with which gun rights supporters disagree, they don't amount to any sort of broad-scale conspiracy within the Democratic Party to round up all the guns in the country. (Aside from the lack of actual evidence of this plan, the sheer logistics of such an effort would be mind-bogglingly complex.) But, conspiracy theories are not built on rational evidence. They are built on irrational fear. Fear, of course, is a hugely powerful political motivator. The idea of roving bands of liberals grabbing for your guns and robbing you of a fundamental freedom is scary to lots of people. And so, when a group or a politician suggests that any attempt to restrict gun rights or close loopholes is the first step in the execution of the broader gun-collection plan they have always warned you about, it's easy to see why so many gun rights supporters react the way they do. But conspiracy theories aren't facts. And the facts make clear that the idea of some sort of national gun seizure isn't something any politician is interesting in.

But the day began with an awkward roundtable with federal and local officials, where Trump touted the federal response and offered praise for those who have been most complimentary to his administration, even as many residents on the island continued to lack access to basic services and criticized the federal response. The President also appeared to jokingly blame the island and its 3.5 million residents for throwing the federal budget \"a little out of whack.\" Read More \"I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack,\" Trump said with a grin. \"Because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that's fine, we've saved a lot of lives.\" The President also told officials they should be \"very proud\" that only 16 people died in the hurricane -- comparing the death toll to the more than a thousand who died in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . And even as he praised some of the island's local officials, he focused squarely on the positive comments made about him and his administration's response. Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rosselo was called out for praise for \"appreciating what we did.\" The island's representative in Congress, Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon, was thanked for saying \"such nice things\" -- and asked to repeat her praise on Tuesday. \"Right from the beginning this governor did not play politics,\" Trump said. \"He was saying it how it was and he was giving us the highest ratings.\" One official Trump did not call out for praise was the mayor of Puerto Rico's capital San Juan, Carmen Yulin Cruz, whom Trump criticized on Twitter over the weekend after she expressed frustration with the pace of the federal response. Returning from Puerto Rico aboard Air Force One, Trump again suggested locals need to step up more to speed up the pace of recovery efforts, though he acknowledged the difficulty given that \"a lot of them lost their homes.\" \"We need more help at a local level,\" Trump said, pointing to the need to distribute supplies throughout the island. \"We need local help. And they're helping. They're really gearing up to help.\" As he thanked Gonzalez-Colon earlier on Tuesday, Trump asked her to \"say a little something about what you said about us today,\" before quickly catching himself and adding: \"And it's not about me, it's about all of these incredible people from the military to FEMA to the first responders, I've never seen anyone work so hard.\" Trump did get the opportunity to see some of the damage Hurricane Maria wrought firsthand and met with some of the storm's survivors. After his roundtable meeting with federal and local officials, Trump headed to Guaynabo, Puerto Rico -- just outside the capital of San Juan -- where he walked from home to home, greeting residents in one of the more affluent neighborhoods where homes suffered no major damage, but piles of debris and downed trees littered the streets. \"We're going to help you out,\" Trump pledged to some of the residents. Next, Trump arrived at Calvary Chapel, where he held up, handed out and tossed supplies while shaking hands with local residents -- everything from a can of tinned chicken breast and a pack of batteries to a flashlight. \"There's a lot of love in this room,\" Trump said before he moved to handing out a pile of rice bags. Then, offering his best basketball shot, the President began softly shooting rolls of paper towels into the crowd. Trump's trip to Puerto Rico came as frustration on the island mounted with the federal response to the storm as the island remained without power. Residents continue to struggle to get access to food and fuel nearly two weeks after the storm hit. But in and around San Juan, much of the area was returning to a sense of normalcy, with power being reestablished in parts of the capital. As he handed out supplies -- including flashlights -- just outside the capital, Trump remarked: \"Flashlights. You don't need 'em anymore.\" That comment broke with the reality most of Puerto Rico still faces, where 93% of residents still had no power.

As I saw her laying on that cot full of tears, pleading for help, I found myself suddenly crying with her, physically hurting with her. And suddenly I could not help but imagine my own family -- my own mother, dignified and hardworking -- begging for a simple medication that could save her life. You try it. Think of your own family in the horror of a situation like that. It will knock the wind out of you. Patients trapped in shelters in Puerto Rico can't get to hospitals Luckily, we were able to help Josefina evacuate to a hospital, where she needed antibiotics and an operation to clear the infection that caused her to be so sick. The very next day, I traveled to Barrio Melilla outside Loiza, again not far from San Juan, with a team of medical volunteers from Project Hope, an international non-governmental organization. There we found more of the hurricane's walking wounded. People like Jobita Cumaquita, battling both cancer and diabetes, but more concerned with how her 22-year-old granddaughter, Estefani, will manage without her father. A couple of days before the storm hit, he went to the hospital for an elective visit to address his blood sugar. He had made similar visits many times before, Estefani said, and he had always come home healthy shortly after treatment. But in the immediate aftermath of Maria, when they went to check on him, they were shocked to discover that he had died days before. Citizens band together to get mainland help to Puerto Rico In the chaos that has gripped Puerto Rico following the storm, the family has struggled to get details about the circumstances of his death -- a sadly common byproduct of everything the storm turned upside-down. But the routine nature of his visit has the family wondering: Was his death due to fallout from the storm? We may never know. What we do know is there are thousands of Josefinas, Jobitas and Estefanis here in Puerto Rico. They are too bed-ridden to leave their homes, or lack gasoline, or the ability to communicate with the outside world. They are mourning the loss of a loved one, or at the very least lamenting the terrible damage to their homes, their livelihoods, their way of life. Join the conversation\nThese are the people we must help now, the people for whom we can make a huge difference as doctors, nurses, politicians, humans. We cannot take our attention off of what is happening here in Puerto Rico. Know this. When you hear the death toll has increased from the current official number of 16, know that most every additional death need not have happened.

He served as president from 2005 to 2014 and oversaw the implementation of a new constitution that strengthened the autonomy of the Kurdish region of Iraq. \nThe last seven years of his tenure were marked by multiple episodes of illness. He had a stroke 2012 and spent time in Germany for 18 months of treatment just before the end of his presidency. (File photo) Iraqi President Jalal Talabani,pictured here on January 23, 2010 in Baghdad, Iraq. \nBorn in the village of Kelkan in Iraqi Kurdistan, Talabani was an advocate for the rights of the Kurdish minority in Iraq since his adolescence. At age 14, he joined the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), which began a rebellion in northern Iraq in the 1960s. \nIn 1975, he founded the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), an organization striving to promote the autonomy and independence of the Kurdish people from the rest of Iraq. \nAs Secretary General of the PUK, he became involved in armed resistance against the government of Saddam Hussein. \nTwo years after Hussein was deposed by the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, Talabani was elected president by the transitional national assembly. \nDuring his tenure, the 2005 Iraqi constitution upheld Iraqi Kurdistan's autonomy -- first established in 1991 by the US, the United Kingdom and France -- which barred Iraqi forces from operating within the northern Kurdish region of the country. \nIn 2006, Talabani won a second term as president as part of an interim Iraqi government. In November 2010, he was re-elected president by the new Iraqi parliament. \nMarking the end of the US military presence in Iraq in December 2011, Talabani conferred upon coalition officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, the \"shield of commitment medal.\" ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tamara qiblawi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mohammed tawfeeq", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jalal talabani", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "saddam hussein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talabani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe biden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaa talabani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hussein", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kdp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdish democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patriotic union of kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "cnn iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states-led", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erbil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelkan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:09:57.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b933c2e5e21ca9ba6ce0cab0c7c784927a51be1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtJOs7lCiH8vUUTKer9bSAd6EEROY5LEwPV2KyYqYmXR7lxvBg2vALe1VX_ZLcZpEY0XY4gIRXKoAp0IG8zr4wR7", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://news-headlines-today.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - App International Edition", "title": "Report: Ivanka Trump, Kushner used third email account for White House business", "title_full": "Report: Ivanka Trump, Kushner used third email account for White House business", "published": "2017-10-03T19:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170721163651-jared-kushner-ivanka-trump-split-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 16233, "comments": 0, "shares": 16233}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 21}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b933c2e5e21ca9ba6ce0cab0c7c784927a51be1c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls5XbBPo0BjtJOs7lCiH8vUUTKer9bSAd6EEROY5LEwPV2KyYqYmXR7lxvBg2vALe1VX_ZLcZpEY0XY4gIRXKoAp0IG8zr4wR7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Report: Ivanka Trump, Kushner used third email account for White House business", "text": "Kushner didn't disclose personal email account to Senate 02:47 Story highlights White House officials sent hundreds of emails to the private addresses The White House Counsel's Office last week launched an internal review Washington (CNN) White House accounts sent internal White House documents to an email address shared by Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner and their household staff, Politico reported Monday . The President's daughter and son-in-law, who are among his top advisers, had previously exchanged emails with White House officials about government business using their personal email addresses. The Politico report revealed that they also used a third email address on their private domain to communicate with White House officials. White House officials sent hundreds of emails that included \"nonpublic travel documents, internal schedules and some official White House materials\" to the email address shared by Kushner and Trump, Politico reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. It was not clear how sensitive the documents were. CNN has not independently confirmed the report. A White House spokesman referred requests for comment on the report to the couple's attorney Abbe Lowell, who declined to comment. White House probing top officials' private email use The White House Counsel's Office last week launched an internal review of White House officials' use of private email, but a person familiar with the review told CNN that the inquiry is not expected to delve deep into officials' use of private email. Read More \"It's gone a little bit quiet,\" the person said of the inquiry, saying the review would be \"less formal\" than originally suggested. Instead, the White House Counsel has become much more focused on Cabinet officials' use of private air charter travel, which led to the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on Friday . The Counsel's Office, alongside the Office of Management and Budget and the chief of staff's office, are working this week on crafting guidance outlining the new approval process for agencies' use of private planes, two sources said. The White House Counsel's Office last week forwarded guidance to White House officials, reminding them to use their official email addresses for official business and to forward any work-related emails from their personal accounts to their White House addresses, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The guidance is aimed at ensuring White House officials don't run afoul of the Presidential Records Act. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said last week that \"all White House personnel have been instructed to use official email to conduct all government-related work\" and to forward \"work-related communication on personal accounts\" to their official account.

The choice of this out-of-fashion guitar, along with Petty's late-Beatles haircut, betrays a dedication to an earlier time in rock and pop. After all, hadn't The Byrds' Roger McGuinn used a Rickenbacker 12-string on \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" in 1965, after seeing George Harrison play one in \"A Hard Day's Night\" in 1964? The songs on \"Damn the Torpedoes,\" which would become staples of album-oriented radio -- \"Refugee,\" \"Don't Do Me Like That,\" \"Even the Losers\" and \"Here Comes My Girl\" (which prominently features the electric 12-string) -- firmly underscore the '60s musical passions of Petty and his band. When Tom Petty emerged on the scene in the late 1970s, many of us thought he was among the new wave artists who were using 1960s musical and fashion styles in a markedly ironic way. The cover of the band's second album, \"You're Gonna Get It!\" features the band members' faces in half shadow, much like the \"With the Beatles/Meet the Beatles!\" sleeve.

Hide Caption 16 of 16 As it turned out, there was nothing ironic at all about Petty's dedication to mid-1960s pop and rock values -- he simply thought that '60s music was better than the styles of rock and pop music that took hold after \"Sgt. Pepper.\" Petty's music had been that way before punk or new wave began to hit the big time, as is clear on the Heartbreaker's debut album from 1976. McGuinn affectionately remarked that when he first heard \"American Girl\" on the radio, he thought it was a Byrds record. At a time when epic tracks, concept albums, virtuosic guitar solos, and hippie hair, beads and bell bottoms were all the rage, the Heartbreakers delivered nine songs on their third studio album, many of which clocked in at less than four minutes. The music focused squarely on the songs themselves: Petty's singing is the center of our attention. JUST WATCHED Tom Petty's most memorable songs\nTom Petty's most memorable songs 01:24 There are no lengthy or flashy guitar or keyboard solos vying for the listener's attention. Guitarist Mike Campbell, working in the tradition of George Harrison or Keith Richards, provides just what the song needs and no more, while keyboardist Benmont Tench keeps the piano and organ sounds spare and tasteful, with a hint of Al Kooper's playing for Dylan. Tom Petty had remained faithful to the values of the Byrds, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, even as those artists moved on to other styles in the first half of the 1970s. As he continued to do what he been doing all along, the new trend in late '70s rock circled back to him -- he did not chase it, even if he did benefit enormously from it. Petty was not a new waver, however, and didn't think of himself that way. As someone moving forward while earnestly embracing rock's history, he was instead a new traditionalist.

Anne Frank was sent to a concentration camp after her family was discovered by the Gestapo. (CNN) A new investigation into the circumstances surrounding the discovery of Anne Frank's hiding place in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam, which eventually led to her death, has been launched by a retired FBI agent. Led by Vince Pankoke, who formerly worked with the FBI to track Colombian drug cartels, the project will use cold case investigative techniques and data analysis software developed in the last decade to unravel one of history's greatest mysteries: Who betrayed Anne Frank? The German teenager was best known for her diary documenting her time in the \"Secret Annex,\" a hidden enclave at the back of her father Otto Frank's former office, at 263 Prinsengracht in the Dutch capital. The Franks and another Jewish family spent more than two years in hiding before they were discovered by the Gestapo, the German secret police, in August 1944 and sent off to concentration camps.

Three days later, she was arrested with her family in the \"secret annex\" of a house in Amsterdam, Netherlands, where they had hidden for two years. She later died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp when she was 15. In her diary, Anne describes a1942 picture of herself: \"This is a photo as I would wish myself to look all the time.

She brought it with her into hiding and began writing in it in 1942. After her death, her father, Otto Frank, edited and compiled the diary. It was published in the Netherlands in 1947 as \"The Secret Annex.

Hide Caption 8 of 8 Anne's diary, nicknamed \"Kitty,\" provided a moving and in-depth documentation of the rise of anti-Semitic laws in Netherlands as well as the pangs of spending an adolescence in captivity. She died shortly before the end of World War II at the age of 15 in a concentration camp in Bergen-Belsen, Germany. She was survived by Otto, who returned to publish her diary in 1947. In the aftermath of the war, Dutch police launched probes into the betrayal of the Frank family at the insistence of Otto Frank, who suspected a warehouse worker of having disclosed their location, but the investigations were inconclusive. Read More Last year, research conducted by the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam suggested that the location of the secret annex could have been uncovered by the Gestapo by accident, and not as part of a mission to find and arrest its residents based on a tip-off from an informant, as previously thought. Anne Frank's arrest might not have stemmed from betrayal This new investigation, however, will reconstruct the events prior to the discovery and look at all 30 suspects who have been accused over time of betraying the Frank family, hoping to solve the mystery that has puzzled historians. The data generated from Frank's diary and the archives available from that period will be scanned by specialist software to narrow down the suspects. The multidisciplinary investigative team of 20 includes detectives, data analysts, profilers, historians and criminologists. The experts are also seeking tips from members of the public and using actors to reenact witness and suspect statements obtained in the past. The Anne Frank House has opened its doors and archives to the \"Cold Case Diary\" project, which is being filmed and is relying on crowd-funding to pay for its investigation. \"Every school aged-child knows about Anne Frank and so did I. I remember that once in 2005, I was in Amsterdam on a mission, and my Dutch colleague drove me through Amsterdam. While passing the Anne Frank House he told me that this case has never been solved. That surprised me,\" Pankoke said in a statement provided to CNN by Proditione Media, the production company behind the project. \"I must say that I always had a keen interest since my father and his two brothers fought in WW2,\" Pankoke added. \"My father once told me that his unit liberated a concentration camp near Mittenwald and he never could forget the sight of this place and its prisoners.\" Rare handwritten Anne Frank poem smashes auction estimate Xomnia, an Amsterdam-based software company specializing in Artificial Intelligence (AI), will be providing the software for processing data from various archives. \"There is simply far too much data available nowadays for a human brain to analyze,\" a spokesperson for Xomnia said in a statement provided by Proditione Media. \"Our software allows [researchers] to search the data and visualize it new ways. This has already led to a few new traces.\" \"The Anne Frank House's new investigation [in 2016] does not refute the possibility that the people in hiding were betrayed, but illustrates that other scenarios should also be considered,\" Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House, said in a statement to CNN. \"We are pleased that 'Cold Case Diary' is also carrying out research into the arrest and following new leads, and we are interested to see the results.\" Pankoke, who was awarded a medal by the Colombian government for his success in tracking drug cartels, will be detailing the progress of the investigation online. He hopes to unveil the project's findings on the 75th anniversary of the discovery of the Frank family in hiding, on August 4, 2019. \"Considering the amount of data to review, normally I would be pessimistic, but now with these great experts in the team and the AI component, I am really optimistic,\" he said. \"To choose that specific date feels like honoring the victims. But of course, in no way will we let the deadline jeopardize the integrity of the research.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "manisha ganguly", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "anne frank", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "otto frank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pankoke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ronald leopold", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xomnia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francine prose", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vince pankoke", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "frank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "margot", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anne frank house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "proditione media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the anne frank house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gestapo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bergen-belsen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amsterdam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mittenwald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bergen-belson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:13:31.014+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d4e911385dc024a5e1827dae1f7ce54abfbc22cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsxuZ.4skdd_7Ch0nXlDg1ib9pJkN2xUammlU0hBmpiOckZQyMaPNmnLqI252CNQMfgDec8IfEKuVxOXyJyyRa4g--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://news-headlines-today.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - App International Edition", "title": "Trump is the swamp monster", "title_full": "Trump is the swamp monster", "published": "2017-10-03T18:26:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "blogs", "country": "", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170929165353-03-price-trump-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1023, "comments": 0, "shares": 1023}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d4e911385dc024a5e1827dae1f7ce54abfbc22cd", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsxuZ.4skdd_7Ch0nXlDg1ib9pJkN2xUammlU0hBmpiOckZQyMaPNmnLqI252CNQMfgDec8IfEKuVxOXyJyyRa4g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump is the swamp monster", "text": "Story highlights Jen Psaki: Tom Price's resignation is not just about his use of taxpayer money to pay for chartered flights It is about the growth of the swamp at the expense of the American people, writes Psaki Jen Psaki, a CNN political commentator, was the White House communications director and State Department spokeswoman during the Obama administration. She is vice president of communications and strategy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Follow her at @jrpsaki. The opinions expressed hers.\n(CNN) While the failure of the Obamacare repeal, the mishandling of the hurricane in Puerto Rico and the dangerous threats made toward North Korea are making national headlines, there is another story that could be more damaging to Trump in 2020.\nJen Psaki Behind the scenes, Donald Trump is not draining the swamp. He is the lead swamp monster. And he has created a cabinet that is ready and willing to take advantage of the taxpayer dollar. Take his former Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price as an example. His resignation is cause for celebration for members of both political parties, opponents and advocates for Obamacare. When given the opportunity to work with Democrats on fixing Obamacare, even with some openness expressed by President Trump, he did not pursue it. And twice he went along with Senate leadership as they tried and failed to repeal Obamacare. For a former orthopedic surgeon and long serving members of Congress, his short record of service at the head of the health care agency will be marked by his complete inability to improve the quality or cost of healthcare for Americans. But his reason for departing is not about his failure as a leader or a policy maker. It is about his shocking use of private jets on the taxpayer dime. He reportedly took multiple chartered flights for official business with a combined cost of over $1 million . Price has said he will reimburse the government for the cost of his seat on those flights, but that only amounts to $51,887.31 . The wrong scandal cost Tom Price his job Read More No, this is not normal. I can only speak for Obama Administration officials in the exact same position. But Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Secretary Sylvia Burwell only took commercial flights. Why? We worked for the American people and did not want to waste their money on unnecessary extravagances. In response, Mike Mulvaney, director of the Office of Management and Budget, issued new guidelines for cabinet travel. Moving forward, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly must pre-approve all \"travel on government-owned, rented, leased, or chartered aircraft.\" But Price's flights are just the tip of the iceberg. Price is not the only member of Trump's cabinet who has used private charter flights paid for by the American taxpayer. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin reportedly asked the White House about using a government jet for his honeymoon, which he claims was just one of many options \"to ensure he had access to secure communications ... as he traveled.\" Meanwhile, Mnuchin's flight to Fort Knox, where he, his wife Louise Linton and Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell watched the solar eclipse, is currently under review by the Treasury Department's Inspector General. Meanwhile, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has used private planes for trips to his hometown and the Caribbean. He told CNN he only used private planes when several Interior professionals advised him no other options were available. But the Department of the Interior's inspector general's office has now opened a full investigation. And Trump himself may have been padding his own pockets -- or, to be more exact, the pockets of his family businesses -- with American taxpayer money for months. Trump's rich Cabinet needs private jets. Don't we all? He kicked off his 2020 campaign with a re-election fundraiser hosted at none other than the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. While there have not been specific numbers released on how much the property made off of the event, the publicity was no doubt a benefit and the Trump team was projected to pocket $10 million in the process for the campaign fund. Members of his White House staff have repeatedly used their platform to promote family businesses. The director of the Office of Government Ethics even called for White House Senior Advisor Kelllyanne Conway to be disciplined after encouraging viewers to \"go buy Ivanka's stuff\" during an interview with Fox News earlier this year. But the most egregious is Trump's use of travel as a means of promoting his properties and providing a reason to make entry more exclusive and expensive. Mar-a-Lago, one of the most infamous of the Trump properties, has upped its member fee to $200,000 since the election. That is twice the previous fee. And the club's profits in the first quarter have more than doubled from just over $15 million in 2014-2015 to more than $35 million from January 2016 to spring 2017. He has also not drawn a line when it comes to profiting from foreign governments enjoying the glitz and glamour of his hotels. Saudi government lobbyists spent more than $200,000 at the Washington, DC property this year alone. My Instagram beef with Linton: #Deplorable Before resigning in protest, the head of the Government Ethics office, Walter Schaub, stated , \"I can't know what their intention is. I know that the effect is that there is an appearance that the businesses are profiting from his occupying the presidency. And appearance matters as much as reality.\" This is all learning on the job, right? No. Instead of apologizing and paying back taxpayer money, Zinke has called the accusations \"a little BS.\" Mnuchin, for his part, has refused to commit to taking only commercial flights during his time in office. Shorthand: Taxpayers, your money is my money, and I will use it as I see fit. I am old enough to remember when then-candidate John McCain couldn't remember how many houses he owned and then-candidate Mitt Romney stated that \"47% of the Americans pay no income tax.\" These moments didn't end their presidential campaigns, but they showed how these two nominees were completely disconnected from the struggles of working Americans. How could Mitt Romney or John McCain fight to make life better for Americans who needed help the most? They didn't get it. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nBut as with almost any recent debate between prominent members of both parties, today we are in an entirely unprecedented situation. The rampant abuse of taxpayer money, combined with the arrogant responses from Trump and his cabinet members, should send a chill down the spine of the Republican party. But it should especially unnerve those who elected him to drain the swamp. After all, this isn't just about Tom Price.

The choice of this out-of-fashion guitar, along with Petty's late-Beatles haircut, betrays a dedication to an earlier time in rock and pop. After all, hadn't The Byrds' Roger McGuinn used a Rickenbacker 12-string on \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" in 1965, after seeing George Harrison play one in \"A Hard Day's Night\" in 1964? The songs on \"Damn the Torpedoes,\" which would become staples of album-oriented radio -- \"Refugee,\" \"Don't Do Me Like That,\" \"Even the Losers\" and \"Here Comes My Girl\" (which prominently features the electric 12-string) -- firmly underscore the '60s musical passions of Petty and his band. When Tom Petty emerged on the scene in the late 1970s, many of us thought he was among the new wave artists who were using 1960s musical and fashion styles in a markedly ironic way. The cover of the band's second album, \"You're Gonna Get It!\" features the band members' faces in half shadow, much like the \"With the Beatles/Meet the Beatles!\" sleeve.

Pepper.\" Petty's music had been that way before punk or new wave began to hit the big time, as is clear on the Heartbreaker's debut album from 1976. McGuinn affectionately remarked that when he first heard \"American Girl\" on the radio, he thought it was a Byrds record. At a time when epic tracks, concept albums, virtuosic guitar solos, and hippie hair, beads and bell bottoms were all the rage, the Heartbreakers delivered nine songs on their third studio album, many of which clocked in at less than four minutes. The music focused squarely on the songs themselves: Petty's singing is the center of our attention. JUST WATCHED Tom Petty's most memorable songs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTom Petty's most memorable songs 01:24 There are no lengthy or flashy guitar or keyboard solos vying for the listener's attention. Guitarist Mike Campbell, working in the tradition of George Harrison or Keith Richards, provides just what the song needs and no more, while keyboardist Benmont Tench keeps the piano and organ sounds spare and tasteful, with a hint of Al Kooper's playing for Dylan. Tom Petty had remained faithful to the values of the Byrds, Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, even as those artists moved on to other styles in the first half of the 1970s. As he continued to do what he been doing all along, the new trend in late '70s rock circled back to him -- he did not chase it, even if he did benefit enormously from it. Petty was not a new waver, however, and didn't think of himself that way. As someone moving forward while earnestly embracing rock's history, he was instead a new traditionalist. And as his songs began to influence younger artists, he passed those values on in ways that continue to shape rock music.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "john covach", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom petty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "george harrison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff lynne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rickenbacker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy orbison", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benmont tench", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike campbell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "keith richards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcguinn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty rock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty tom petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dylan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "al kooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roger mcguinn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "regina spektor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony dimitriades", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom petty petty", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "byrds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolling stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood walk of fame", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "traveling wilburys", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of rochester's institute for popular music", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eastman school of music", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gainesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rochester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malibu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco bay area", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "santa cruz", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:14:02.005+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4eea27de5d7b0d7b04666f02eb4b758d80d3b976", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7tXd.RdWPfTMeXIVyIOCt6X3wuQ4ulhgHy9ySlwL2GvfK3cwgCnoAK4dRjfDfJsUIo-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Mattis: Trump backs diplomacy to solve North Korea - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Mattis: Trump backs diplomacy to solve North Korea - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170927115244-mattis-india-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 314, "comments": 0, "shares": 314}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4eea27de5d7b0d7b04666f02eb4b758d80d3b976", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7tXd.RdWPfTMeXIVyIOCt6X3wuQ4ulhgHy9ySlwL2GvfK3cwgCnoAK4dRjfDfJsUIo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Ryan Browne", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Mattis: Trump backs diplomacy to solve North Korea - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Trump tweeted Sunday that Tillerson was \"wasting his time trying to negotiate\" with North Korea \"President Trump's guidance to both Secretary Tillerson and me has been very clear that we would pursue the diplomatic effort,\" Mattis said Tuesday Washington (CNN) Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Congress Tuesday that President Donald Trump still backs diplomatic efforts to curb North Korea's nuclear and missile activity.\n\"President Trump's guidance to both Secretary Tillerson and me has been very clear that we would pursue the diplomatic effort,\" Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee during a hearing on the administration's new strategy for Afghanistan and South Asia.

The Politico report revealed that they also used a third email address on their private domain to communicate with White House officials. White House officials sent hundreds of emails that included \"nonpublic travel documents, internal schedules and some official White House materials\" to the email address shared by Kushner and Trump, Politico reported, citing three people familiar with the matter. It was not clear how sensitive the documents were. CNN has not independently confirmed the report. A White House spokesman referred requests for comment on the report to the couple's attorney Abbe Lowell, who declined to comment. White House probing top officials' private email use The White House Counsel's Office last week launched an internal review of White House officials' use of private email, but a person familiar with the review told CNN that the inquiry is not expected to delve deep into officials' use of private email. Read More \"It's gone a little bit quiet,\" the person said of the inquiry, saying the review would be \"less formal\" than originally suggested. Instead, the White House Counsel has become much more focused on Cabinet officials' use of private air charter travel, which led to the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price on Friday . The Counsel's Office, alongside the Office of Management and Budget and the chief of staff's office, are working this week on crafting guidance outlining the new approval process for agencies' use of private planes, two sources said. The White House Counsel's Office last week forwarded guidance to White House officials, reminding them to use their official email addresses for official business and to forward any work-related emails from their personal accounts to their White House addresses, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The guidance is aimed at ensuring White House officials don't run afoul of the Presidential Records Act. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said last week that \"all White House personnel have been instructed to use official email to conduct all government-related work\" and to forward \"work-related communication on personal accounts\" to their official account. JUST WATCHED Attorney: Kushner used private email account to talk to WH officials Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nAttorney: Kushner used private email account to talk to WH officials 01:28 Top White House officials' use of personal email came under scrutiny last week after reports revealed that Kushner, Ivanka Trump, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and former chief strategist Steve Bannon exchanged emails with White House officials using their private accounts. The private email use prompted cries of hypocrisy due to President Donald Trump's sustained 2016 campaign attacks on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's use of private email during her time as secretary of state. Trump also attacked Clinton's top aide, Huma Abedin, whose emails were backed up onto a private computer she shared with her husband, disgraced ex-congressman Anthony Weiner. A few of the emails Clinton sent or received on her private server were later marked as classified. There is no indication as of yet that any emails exchanged by Trump White House officials -- including those forwarded to the Ivanka Trump and Kushner's jointly shared account -- contained classified information. Lowell, Kushner's attorney, previously told CNN, \"It is perfectly normal that the committees would want to make sure that they received all pertinent records. We did review this account at the time and there were no responsive or relevant documents there.

It's not about politics,'\" Yul\u00edn Cruz said. \"That's all the interaction that mayors had with him.\" Read More At the event, Trump praised Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, saying the governor wasn't \"playing politics\" -- an apparent swipe at the San Juan mayor. \"I just want to tell you that right from the beginning this governor was not playing politics,\" Trump said as he huddled with local and federal officials on the island for a briefing on recovery efforts. \"He was giving us the highest grades.\" Trump attacked Yul\u00edn Cruz on Saturday for criticizing the White House's hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico, accusing her of \"poor leadership\" and suggesting that the island's residents are not doing enough to help themselves. Trump attacks San Juan mayor over hurricane response \"The mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,\" the President tweeted from his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he spent the weekend. \"Such poor leadership ability by the mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help. They want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. Earlier Tuesday morning, Trump appeared to soften his criticism, saying Yul\u00edn Cruz \"acknowledged\" the work the White House has done on the island. \"Well I think she's come back a long way,\" he said. \"I think it's now acknowledged what a great job we've done. And people are looking at that. In Texas and in Florida, we get an A-plus. I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico and it's actually a much tougher situation ... Whether it's her or anybody else, they're all starting to say it.\" In the interview following the event, Yul\u00edn Cruz said she would have preferred Trump listen to herself and the other mayors about the situation on the ground, but she said the second portion of the event -- the part without Trump -- was productive. \"I saw a real connection between the reality and the White House staff,\" Yul\u00edn Cruz said. At the event, Trump made a remark about the size of the response needed for the crisis in Puerto Rico that Yul\u00edn Cruz said she found insensitive. \"I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack,\" Trump said jokingly, adding: \"That's fine. We've saved a lot of lives.\" Yul\u00edn Cruz said Trump's comments prove a \"lack of sensibility\" on the part of the President. \"It doesn't make you feel good,\" she said. \"It's about respect for the Puerto Rican people, and it's about saving lives.\" The spectacle of Trump's comments over the weekend slamming Yul\u00edn Cruz and others on their own response efforts as Puerto Rico struggles to deal with a disaster that left millions without power and with limited access to water -- and as Trump comes under fire for what some have called a slow federal reaction -- sparked a firestorm of reaction online. In an interview with MSNBC, Yul\u00edn Cruz said she wasn't making \"nasty comments\" about Trump, adding that her only goal was to save lives. \"I was asking for help,\" she said. \"I wasn't saying anything nasty about the President.\" Yul\u00edn Cruz told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Saturday that she works out of a building that has two Federal Emergency Management Agency envoys and she feels there had been sufficient cooperation. In contrast, Rossell\u00f3 praised the administration on Saturday, saying it had done a good job of responding to Puerto Rico's concerns after the hurricane. \"We need to do a lot more in order for us to get out of the emergency,\" Rossell\u00f3 said in San Juan. \"But the other thing that's also true is that the administration has answered and has complied with our petitions in an expedited manner.\" CNN's Elizabeth Landers, Monica Serrano and Jen Hauser contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elizabeth landers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen yul\u00edn cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "monica serrano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yul\u00edn cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anderson cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jen hauser", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jose cruz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal emergency management agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san juan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bedminster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "texas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:19:29.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54a61534a5a067450494a7ccd8104a7e18a42ff2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnINhQ6QTk2frlgbnDcJdci6Xy3iiKtPrzgeTa77LlE.YjB5yBbCpbiqN85zWCv5WhkD_Lx66zX3WAyler1z8bW6", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Walmart eyes same-day delivery in New York City", "title_full": "Walmart eyes same-day delivery in New York City", "published": "2017-10-03T19:12:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171003103629-walmart-parcel-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 179, "comments": 0, "shares": 179}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 70}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54a61534a5a067450494a7ccd8104a7e18a42ff2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnINhQ6QTk2frlgbnDcJdci6Xy3iiKtPrzgeTa77LlE.YjB5yBbCpbiqN85zWCv5WhkD_Lx66zX3WAyler1z8bW6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T19:12:00.000+03:00", "title": "Walmart eyes same-day delivery in New York City", "text": "by Sara Ashley O'Brien @saraashleyo October 3, 2017: 12:12 PM ET Meet Jet.com's unlikely shareholder Walmart may soon launch same-day delivery in New York City. The retail giant announced on Tuesday that it acquired startup Parcel, a delivery service that operates 24 hours a day. Parcel, which delivers groceries and other items from third-party retailers, intends to help Walmart with last-mile delivery, known as the final steps in getting packages to consumers. \n\"We plan to leverage Parcel for last mile delivery to customers in New York City -- including same-day delivery -- for both general merchandise as well as fresh and frozen groceries from Walmart and Jet,\" Walmart said in a blog post about the deal. \nWalmart acquired Jet.com in 2016, an Amazon competitor that offers everything from fresh groceries to household supplies. \nParcel already has experience delivering perishables to consumers, with clients that include meal-kit delivery businesses, as well as retail outlets like Bonobos, a Walmart-owned company. Parcel CEO Jesse Kaplan \nCEO Jesse Kaplan launched Parcel in 2014 to solve a very New York City problem. For residents without a doorman, the process of accepting packages when not at home can be difficult. Packages are often sent back to the post office, which tend to close in the early evening. If not picked up in a timely manner, packages are returned to retailers. \nKaplan's idea was to have shipments delivered to Parcel's warehouse. The startup then schedules a time to deliver packages to your apartment when you're home -- for a small fee. \nThe company will still offer delivery services to other companies aside from Walmart and its brands. \nRelated: Walmart's Jet launches private label brand \nWalmart has continued to ramp up its online shopping business to compete with Amazon. In 2016, it bought Amazon rival Jet for $3 billion in cash. Jet.com is reportedly testing same-day delivery in the city . \nThis year, Walmart acquired online men's clothing brand Bonobos for $310 million, and indie and vintage women's clothing brand ModCloth for an estimated $50 million to 75 million. \nAlthough the Parcel acquisition price was not disclosed, Walmart said in a blog post it cost less than other deals this year. \nRelated: Cool or creepy? Walmart to delivery food and put it in fridge \nParcel's seven full-time employees and 45 to 50 part-time workers will join the Walmart team, Kaplan told CNN Tech. \nIn addition to its workforce, Parcel operates an in-house fleet of leased and rented vehicles to manage delivery needs.

Rivera, 38, lined up with her daughter for water in Guayadilla on Monday -- the first time she came across aid workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Then they lined up for food. Rivera had already waited in line to buy gas over the weekend. But waiting in line for basic necessities isn't the only obstacle, Rivera said. \n\"There isn't cash to buy anything,\" she told CNN. \nRivera lives on the south side of the island, where operating banks and ATMs are in far shorter supply than in the capital, San Juan. \nIt's yet another problem for Puerto Ricans who are already scrambling to find food, water, fuel and shelter. Much of the island still lacks power after the local utility's transmission and distribution lines were knocked out in the storm. Cell service is also out for a vast majority of residents. \nChristian Sobrino, a member of the Financial Oversight and Management Board of Puerto Rico, told CNN Espa\u00f1ol on Sunday that 180 commercial bank branches and credit unions were up and running, double the number from two days earlier. \nBut about a third of those are located in and around San Juan. All told, only about 40% of all bank branches on the island have opened since the storm hit, said Zoime Alvarez, the vice president of the Association of Banks of Puerto Rico. \nRelated: The people of Puerto Rico are in a desperate scramble for cash \nThere are also 300 open ATMs, but some municipalities have only one or two operational, Sobrino said. That's making it hard to people to get enough cash. \nMany merchants aren't accepting credit cards because they have no electricity to power the machines that process them. \nBanking officials have cited a litany of problems that are preventing them from opening more banks and ATMs. \nThere haven't been enough drivers to transport cash. Because of widespread power outages, banks have to rely on generators to function. And employees often don't have enough gas to get to work. \n\"Communications and electrical power are our biggest challenges,\" said Iris Gonz\u00e1lez-Bonilla, the public relations vice president for FirstBank, a major bank in Puerto Rico. The island has been focusing first on routing power to hospitals and government operations before it reaches other places, she said. \nGonz\u00e1lez-Bonilla said Monday that 27 of FirstBank's 48 branches are in service, along with its three main buildings. The company only has about 20% of its ATM network running, though. \nBanco Santander, another major bank, this week listed about a dozen branches that were open -- about double the number from last week. \nThe company's U.S. operation also announced it would donate $2 million to relief efforts, adding that it would match mainland employee charitable giving up to $1,250 per donation. \nSantander added that it has taken additional steps to help customers, including allowing them to voluntarily defer personal loan and credit card payments for three months.

Ricardo Rossell\u00f3. \"17?\" \"16,\" Rossell\u00f3 answered. \"16 people certified,\" Trump said. \"Sixteen people versus in the thousands.

Before Trump arrived Tuesday, Rossell\u00f3 said he expected the death count to rise. \"I've established from the get-go that due to the magnitude of this event it is likely that that number is going to go up,\" Rossell\u00f3 told reporters at a news conference Tuesday. The White House has pushed back on the notion that Maria is this administration's version of Katrina, and the President praised relief efforts in Puerto Rico as he departed Washington Tuesday. \"I think we've done just as good in Puerto Rico and it's actually a much tougher situation,\" Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House. \"But now the roads are clear, communications starting to come back.\" On the ground in Puerto Rico, Trump also appeared to blame the island and its 3.5 million residents for throwing the federal budget \"a little out of whack.\" \"I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack,\" Trump said with a grin. \"Because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico and that's fine, we've saved a lot of lives.\" But the bulk of Trump's remarks on Tuesday focused on praising his administration's response to the destructive hurricane, even as more than half of the island's roughly 3.5 million residents still lack access to potable water and as nearly all of the island remains without power.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sara murray", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossell\u00f3", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fema", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south lawn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T20:37:43.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "07c6e5fc7e7146dcb5646af505e0732968d887e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwddEY4q06R7qu9xyH7VH0xbsuU5c4o1mVromT0M1hpWROYzPIaaRc94UAyG3RjubKRli._JGUz1nPmYRckY8xM1", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Weapons you can purchase legally in the US - CNN Video", "title_full": "Weapons you can purchase legally in the US - CNN Video", "published": "2017-10-03T18:33:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.025, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 197, "comments": 0, "shares": 197}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "07c6e5fc7e7146dcb5646af505e0732968d887e7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwddEY4q06R7qu9xyH7VH0xbsuU5c4o1mVromT0M1hpWROYzPIaaRc94UAyG3RjubKRli._JGUz1nPmYRckY8xM1", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T18:33:00.000+03:00", "title": "Weapons you can purchase legally in the US - CNN Video", "text": "MUST WATCH Weapons you can purchase legally in the US Americans have the largest supply of civilian-owned firearms in the world.

Petty, especially later on in his career, never shied away from political activism. Anti-war sentiment was a recurring theme in his songs and he donated to charity the proceeds of his track, \"Peace in L.A,\" which was written and recorded in a fury after the Rodney King riots in 1992. Later on, he would object -- sending a cease-and-desist letter -- to right-wing Republican former Rep. Michele Bachmann after she used his song, \"American Girl,\" to kick off her 2012 presidential bid. Former President George W. Bush also heard from Petty after he played another hit, \"I Won't Back Down,\" on the stump. As recently as this past summer, after President Donald Trump on July 26 tweeted that he would reinstate a US military ban on transgender people , Petty protested the decision during a concert in New York. As detailed in a Page Six report at the time, Petty performed \"an encore finale of the song 'American Girl,' with the screen behind him lit up with a massive photo of the late transgender actress Alexis Arquette, who died of AIDS complications in 2016, and other diverse women.\" Read More Thank you #tompetty for your #americangirl tribute that included #alexisarquette and thank you @faderfam for finding it and @rosannaarquette for getting it in there \nA post shared by David Arquette (@davidarquette) on Jul 27, 2017 at 8:58am PDT \nThe flag controversy began in 1985, when Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released a record called \"Southern Accents.\" The first single and most enduring track was \"Don't Come Around Here No More,\" but other songs, like \"Rebels,\" were written as what was initially intended to be a concept album about his Southern roots. \"But the concept part slipped away probably 70% or so into the album,\" Petty said in the Rolling Stone interview . \"I just let it go, but the Confederate flag became part of the marketing for the tour. I wish I had given it more thought. It was a downright stupid thing to do.\" The song refers to \"a character,\" as Petty later explained, being born \"in Dixie,\" and includes the refrain, \"with one foot in the grave and one foot on the pedal, I was born a rebel.\" Confederate flag's half-century at South Carolina Capitol ends Over time, though, some fans began to associate Petty with the Confederate emblem. Here's how Petty recalled the moment when he began to push back -- and how his fans responded: \"I used it onstage during that song ('Rebels'), and I regretted it pretty quickly. When we toured two years later, I noticed people in the audience wearing Confederate flag bandanas and things like that. One night, someone threw one onstage. I stopped everything and gave a speech about it. I said, 'Look, this was to illustrate a character. This is not who we are. Having gone through this, I would prefer it if no one would ever bring a Confederate flag to our shows again because this isn't who we are.' It got a mixed reaction. There were some boos and some cheers. But honestly, it's a little amazing to me because I never saw one again after that speech in that one town.\" Other acts, like Lynyrd Syknyrd, have been less willing to denounce the flag. In 2012, guitarist Gary Rossington, in an interview with CNN , expressed some reservations over what it represented. \"Through the years, people like the KKK and skinheads kinda kidnapped the Dixie or Southern flag from its tradition and the heritage of the soldiers,\" he said. \"We didn't want that to go to our fans or show the image like we agreed with any of the race stuff or any of the bad things.\" Singer Johnny Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd performs onstage during day 1 of 2014 Stagecoach: California's Country Music Festival at the Empire Polo Club on April 25, 2014 in Indio, California. (Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Stagecoach/Getty Images) But the backlash was fierce and Rossington, in a Facebook post , sought to clarify his position. \"I only stated my opinion that the confederate flag, at times, was unfairly being used as a symbol by various hate groups, which is something that we don't support the flag being used for,\" he wrote. \"The Confederate flag means something more to us, Heritage not Hate.\" For Petty, though, especially in the aftermath of the Charleston church killings and nationwide uproar over the flag, the question was effectively settled. \"Lowering the flag from the statehouse grounds was the right decision,\" he said in the Rolling Stone interview. \"That flag shouldn't have any part in our government. It shouldn't represent us in any way.\" Petty was also critical of the people who still fly the flag and defend it as a cultural signifier. \"When they wave that flag, they aren't stopping to think how it looks to a black person. I blame myself for not doing that,\" he said. \"It's just awful. It's like how a swastika looks to a Jewish person. It just shouldn't be on flagpoles.\" JUST WATCHED Tom Petty's most memorable songs Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTom Petty's most memorable songs 01:24 Petty finished his mea culpa with a look ahead -- including more pointed criticism of, as he put it, police \"targeting black men and killing them for no reason\" and America's use of for-profit prisons. \"That's a bigger issue than the flag,\" he said. \"Years from now, people will look back on today and say, 'You mean we privatized the prisons so there's no profit unless the prison is full?'

Soon, two people joined her. \"I sat there with him for an hour, and then we heard his cell phone ringing. And so, the gentleman that was sitting with me pulled it out of his pocket. I answered the call. It was a friend who had heard about what was going on,\" she said. Gooze told the caller that his friend was no longer breathing. And while on the line, she learned his name: Jordan McIldoon. He was 25 and from Maple Ridge, British Columbia. Portraits of the Las Vegas victims She asked the friend to contact McIldoon's parents. \"I went on my phone. I went into Facebook, and I looked up his name, and he came up.

Gooze called the woman, who was in lockdown at the nearby Tropicana hotel. \"She broke down, and she said, 'You know, he's the love of my life. This can't be happening.' 'You know,' I told her, 'I was here. I've been with him this whole time.' I go, 'I promise you, I will not leave him. I will not let them go anywhere with him or do anything or say anything that I'm not going to tell you about.'\" How to help Las Vegas shooting victims Gooze stayed with McIldoon's body for four hours, she said, until 3:30 in the morning. All the while, she kept in contact with Jordan's mother and his girlfriend. \"There was another guy that was by us,\" Gooze told CNN. \"His wife had been shot and killed, the mother of his three kids.

JUST WATCHED Police release image of bombing suspect 01:37 Story highlights \"The sound of bombs will be heard in the streets,\" defendant wrote, prosecutor says Survivors recount \"deafening sound and blinding light,\" \"that same smell of 9/11\" New York (CNN) The suspect in the blast that shook New York's Chelsea neighborhood last year, injuring 30 people, was escorted out of federal court Monday after he interrupted the lead prosecutor on the first day of his trial on charges that include using a weapon of mass destruction and bombing a public place. Ahmad Khan Rahimi, who also goes by Rahami, watched via live video stream from another room as Assistant US Attorney Shawn Crowley told jurors that DNA evidence, fingerprints and surveillance footage would link Rahimi to bombs placed last September in Manhattan , including the one that exploded and another one that police found blocks away. New York's alleged 'Chelsea bomber' goes on trial Monday \"By some miracle, no one was killed that day,\" Crowley said. Meantime, Rahimi's attorney, Meghan Gilligan, cast the 29-year-old as a family man who grew up in New Jersey, worked for his father and is a father himself. If convicted, Rahimi could face life in prison . Testimony continues Tuesday in the case. Read More Rahimi, of Elizabeth, New Jersey, faces charges in other jurisdictions in connection with bombs found within hours of the Chelsea blast in a wastebasket near a rail station in Elizabeth and near the start of a Marine Corps charity run in Seaside Park, New Jersey, as well as with crimes tied to a shootout that led to his arrest, according to a criminal complaint. Jurors promised a look at defendant's notebook US District Judge Richard Berman had warned Rahimi on Monday to stop interrupting Crowley. The defendant later returned to court -- after the jury had been ushered out -- and apologized for speaking out of turn. He also told the judge he'd been allowed too few family visits, noting that visits with his children had been infrequent and that it had been more than a year since he'd seen his wife Bomb suspect: FBI got interviews under misleading circumstances Berman said he would look into the complaints. Crowley, in her opening statement, said Rahimi believed he was a soldier in a holy war and had been influenced by Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda and ISIS, citing his Internet search history. She also told jurors they would see Rahimi's notebook, which includes the phrases, \"the sound of bombs will be heard in the streets\" and \"death to your oppression,\" along with an entry about attacking non-believers. Jurors on Monday also saw surveillance video of the blast from several businesses in Chelsea, and were introduced to survivors of the explosion . An architect described experiencing a \"deafening sound and blinding light\" that thrust her to her knees as she walked home. A hotel manager said the scene had \"that same smell of 9/11: burning plastic and burning wood.\" A woman testified that she had to have metal shards removed from her chest and legs as a result of the explosion. 911 call likely saved lives, prosecutors say Jurors also heard the 911 call Jane Schreibman made when she came across \"a suspicious package\" blocks away from the Chelsea blast site -- a pressure cooker in a plastic bag covered in duct tape with wires sticking out. \"I knew it was a pressure cooker and people make bombs out of pressure cookers,\" she said. That unexploded bomb was almost identical to the devices used in the Boston Marathon attacks three years earlier, authorities have said. Prosecutors said Schreibman's call to authorities probably saved lives. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.

Story highlights Prosecutors say Sen. Menendez personally pressured Sebelius to intervene in a multimillion-dollar Medicare dispute She recalled meeting was \"unusual\" but could not pinpoint the senator's precise request Newark, New Jersey (CNN) Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius described an \"unusual\" 2012 meeting with Sen. Robert Menendez at the New Jersey Democrat's federal corruption trial Tuesday, but its details proved to be a mixed bag for prosecutors and the defense team. \"I don't exactly know what he wanted other than for me to do something ,\" Sebelius told jurors. Prosecutors accuse Menendez of personally pressuring Sebelius and other federal officials to intervene in a multimillion-dollar dispute his friend, Salomon Melgen, had with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over his billing practice for the eye drug Lucentis. The indictment charges Menendez with accepting political donations and other perks from Melgen in return for helping him with the dispute. The two men maintain they broke no laws and that Menendez was genuinely concerned about both the fairness of CMS' billing practices and how the rules gave drug companies a windfall. Sebelius told the jury Tuesday that the 2012 meeting with Menendez was arranged by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and involved Menendez's \"unhappiness that there was a CMS policy that Sen. Menendez felt was unclear and unfair to providers.\" Read More It stood out to her, however, because it was the only instance she could recall Reid asking her to come to a meeting involving another member of Congress in 5\u00bd years at the agency. But she also could not recall Menendez or Reid directly mentioning Melgen's name in the meeting. \"I think (Menendez) wanted me to do something differently than the (CMS) staff had previously done -- which was take some action to clarify this procedure or change some action that had been taken on the billing issue,\" Sebelius explained. \"It was an issue I was urged not to discuss with directly with Sen. Menendez until out of our department,\" she added, stating that an individual billing dispute was not something she generally dealt with as the head of an agency of roughly 90,000 employees and a budget just under $1 trillion. At the time, Melgen was in the process of contesting the $8.9 million Medicare overbilling charge, and the general counsel of HHS advised Sebelius she could safely take the meeting because it was on appeal with an independent agency -- a point the defense team tried to emphasize to show Sebelius had no power to change the result of the dispute and the senator didn't present her with a formal \"ask.\" \"I think it was not a very satisfactory meeting,\" she said. \"There wasn't a mutual resolution -- we came in with a dispute and left with the same dispute after about 30 minutes.\" Witness describes 'hostile' conversations with Menendez, Reid, Sebelius The core of the dispute surrounds Melgen's so-called \"multi-dosing\" of Lucentis. Federal regulations at the time approved the drug for \"single-use\" only, meaning that each vial should only be used for a single patient, but the doctor used the \"overfill\" from the vials to treat up to three patients -- and then billed Medicare three times, as if a separate vial was purchased for each dose. Earlier Tuesday, former CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner testified about a separate 2012 meeting and phone call she also had with Menendez about the agency's policy on multi-dosing, which she understood would \"benefit\" Melgen if changed. Tavenner told jurors that her staff had given her a heads-up about Menendez's interest in Melgen's case, leading her to \"connect the dots\" between Melgen's case and the policy even though Menendez never mentioned Melgen's name in their conversations. Tavenner said she warned Sebelius, her boss, that Menendez had \"not been happy\" with CMS' determination that the billing policy was clear and would likely escalate the issue to Sebelius next. She told the jury that she couldn't remember another time in the five years that she served in CMS that a US senator elevated an issue of this kind to her boss.

The new program seeks to establish a \"reporting pipeline\" for survivors of harassment to report abuse and raise awareness about the issue more generally. The department will begin piloting the program in Washington and western Virginia as a start, with plans for expansion to other jurisdictions in the near future. It will be led by officials within the housing and civil enforcement section of DOJ's civil rights division in conjunction with local law enforcement and other legal services providers. Sexual harassment is a prohibited form of sex discrimination under federal housing law, but some studies suggest victims are less likely to come forward than those facing other forms of harassment because of less public awareness of the legal protections available and because they may fear repercussions for reporting it. The department has resolved a number of cases involving sexual harassment in housing over the last several months, including a $150,000 settlement involving a rental property owner accused of sexual harassment in Michigan and $365,000 settlement on behalf of 14 residents and applicants who were subjected to harassment by officials at the Housing Authority in Kansas City, Kansas.

Eric Dreiband, Trump's pick to lead the division, came under a wave of criticism by certain civil rights groups given his past work defending major corporations against discrimination lawsuits, but he has said that he fully supports \"protections against discrimination and our core civil rights laws,\" and vows to enforce anti-discrimination laws, if confirmed. \"I fully support our nation's civil rights laws, including protections for women against sex discrimination, and I fully agree that these protections are important, and have always believed as much,\" Dreiband wrote in responses to questions for the record submitted by senators after his confirmation hearing last month.

There are no electoral votes for Puerto Rico. Things did not get off to a great start when Trump told Puerto Rican officials Tuesday, \"I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack.\" \"But that's fine,\" Trump said. He seemed to be joking. What are Puerto Ricans supposed to do about it? This is the cruel irony of their position -- they are citizens, yes, but they do not have the governmental voice, power or voting rights of other citizens. Read More Trump tells Puerto Rico 'You've thrown our budget a little out of whack' If Puerto Rican residents really wanted to vote for president, they could. But they'd have to leave Puerto Rico and move to a state. Puerto Rican natives in Florida and New York are actually a key and growing voting bloc, but only so long as they're registered to cast a ballot there. Likewise, if a Floridian, or any other American, moved to Puerto Rico on a permanent basis, they'd no longer vote for an elector and so they'd no longer have a vote for US president. (Puerto Ricans can vote in party primaries; they opted for Sen. Marco Rubio in the March GOP primary and Hillary Clinton in the June Democratic caucus). There are many reasons -- many of them logistical, others less clear -- why the Puerto Rico hurricane response seemed distinct from and less effective than the massive responses engaged for Texas and Florida. 3 storms, 3 responses: Comparing Harvey, Irma and Maria How could this be? As CNN and others pointed out, Puerto Rico has a larger population than 21 US states. But the simple, stark fact is this: Puerto Ricans are essentially only half-citizens in the eyes of the federal government. While it is true that Puerto Ricans are American citizens, it is also true that their voice in the US government is worth less than other Americans', a sad but true fact of the American version of democracy. Witness: Puerto Rico had no senator hollering from the rooftops about the slow-to-arrive aid. It relied on the able work of some other senators, like Rubio of Florida, who also advocated for his own state. Democrat Bob Menendez of New Jersey is another strong advocate for the island. But he is currently on trial for corruption and so has been otherwise engaged. (His office reached out after publication to point out Menendez's advocacy, despite his trial, on behalf of relief funding and his trip to Puerto Rico after the hurricane. \"Sen. Menendez has played a leading role in Congress fighting to ensure that the federal government provides the necessary resources and assistance to the more than 3.5 million American citizens living in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands who were impacted by Hurricanes Maria and Irma,\" said spokesman Juan Pachon in an email.) What Puerto Rico does have, not unlike Washington, DC,'s non-voting delegate, is a resident commissioner -- a liaison to Congress who has some of the benefits of being a member but who cannot vote. None of these territories or districts has representation in the Senate. That's a big deal when it comes to things like funding bills. Given the outsize power of a senator on things like funding and, in this case, disaster aid, Puerto Rico starts off far behind. Puerto Rico is by far the largest non-state territory. About a half a million people, combined, live in American Samoa, Guam, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. But Puerto Rico has well more than 3 million residents. It's bigger than 21 US states with members of Congress, two senators each and presidential electoral votes on the line every four years. The Puerto Rican playwright Jose Rivera, long one of the minority of Puerto Ricans who supported independence from the US, wrote eloquently about all of this in the LA Times recently , dubbing his home a \"zombie state.\" (Some) Puerto Ricans voted for US statehood back in June \"Puerto Rico is effectively a zombie state,\" he said. \"A US territory with no true self-governing power, expressing its 'will' in periodic toothless plebiscites, most recently in June with a nonbinding referendum in favor of statehood.\" He said the hurricane and its aftermath has him rethinking his support for independence. Puerto Ricans are grateful to be US citizens, Rivera said. They are eligible for Medicare and Social Security benefits but not SSI benefits for the disabled, for some reason. Rivera pointed out that for all the responsibilities of citizenship, the island is denied some of the key perks. It's hard to imagine the Republicans who control Washington getting behind a Puerto Rico statehood initiative anytime soon. The voters there, largely Hispanic, would theoretically be more likely to support Democrats. Things are slightly better for the nearly 700,000 residents of Washington, DC, who have access to the governing class but don't have voting representation in Congress. Denizens of the District, unlike Puerto Ricans, do have the ability to vote for electors (3 -- the same as the least populous US state) in presidential races, but only because the 23rd Amendment to the Constitution expressly gave it to them in 1992. If Puerto Rico had electors to equal its population, which is a bit larger than Connecticut, it would have 7 or more. The hurricane and its aftermath have not yet sparked a Puerto Rico statehood debate. It could, however, still impact future US elections if there is an exodus of Puerto Ricans to Florida -- where memories of these past few weeks could shape a new generation of voters.

Menendez personally pressured Sebelius to intervene in a multimillion-dollar Medicare dispute She recalled meeting was \"unusual\" but could not pinpoint the senator's precise request Newark, New Jersey (CNN) Former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius described an \"unusual\" 2012 meeting with Sen. Robert Menendez at the New Jersey Democrat's federal corruption trial Tuesday, but its details proved to be a mixed bag for prosecutors and the defense team.\n\"I don't exactly know what he wanted other than for me to do something ,\" Sebelius told jurors. Prosecutors accuse Menendez of personally pressuring Sebelius and other federal officials to intervene in a multimillion-dollar dispute his friend, Salomon Melgen, had with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over his billing practice for the eye drug Lucentis. The indictment charges Menendez with accepting political donations and other perks from Melgen in return for helping him with the dispute. The two men maintain they broke no laws and that Menendez was genuinely concerned about both the fairness of CMS' billing practices and how the rules gave drug companies a windfall. Sebelius told the jury Tuesday that the 2012 meeting with Menendez was arranged by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, and involved Menendez's \"unhappiness that there was a CMS policy that Sen. Menendez felt was unclear and unfair to providers.\" Read More It stood out to her, however, because it was the only instance she could recall Reid asking her to come to a meeting involving another member of Congress in 5\u00bd years at the agency. But she also could not recall Menendez or Reid directly mentioning Melgen's name in the meeting. \"I think (Menendez) wanted me to do something differently than the (CMS) staff had previously done -- which was take some action to clarify this procedure or change some action that had been taken on the billing issue,\" Sebelius explained. \"It was an issue I was urged not to discuss with directly with Sen. Menendez until out of our department,\" she added, stating that an individual billing dispute was not something she generally dealt with as the head of an agency of roughly 90,000 employees and a budget just under $1 trillion. At the time, Melgen was in the process of contesting the $8.9 million Medicare overbilling charge, and the general counsel of HHS advised Sebelius she could safely take the meeting because it was on appeal with an independent agency -- a point the defense team tried to emphasize to show Sebelius had no power to change the result of the dispute and the senator didn't present her with a formal \"ask.\" \"I think it was not a very satisfactory meeting,\" she said. \"There wasn't a mutual resolution -- we came in with a dispute and left with the same dispute after about 30 minutes.\" Witness describes 'hostile' conversations with Menendez, Reid, Sebelius The core of the dispute surrounds Melgen's so-called \"multi-dosing\" of Lucentis. Federal regulations at the time approved the drug for \"single-use\" only, meaning that each vial should only be used for a single patient, but the doctor used the \"overfill\" from the vials to treat up to three patients -- and then billed Medicare three times, as if a separate vial was purchased for each dose. Earlier Tuesday, former CMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner testified about a separate 2012 meeting and phone call she also had with Menendez about the agency's policy on multi-dosing, which she understood would \"benefit\" Melgen if changed. Tavenner told jurors that her staff had given her a heads-up about Menendez's interest in Melgen's case, leading her to \"connect the dots\" between Melgen's case and the policy even though Menendez never mentioned Melgen's name in their conversations. Tavenner said she warned Sebelius, her boss, that Menendez had \"not been happy\" with CMS' determination that the billing policy was clear and would likely escalate the issue to Sebelius next. She told the jury that she couldn't remember another time in the five years that she served in CMS that a US senator elevated an issue of this kind to her boss.

It quickly became clear that the Senate judiciary committee members present were dissatisfied by the officials' answers, as well as the administration more broadly, as Congress tries to come up with a solution for the hundreds of thousands of immigrants in limbo before March, when DACA permits will start expiring. DACA deal: Here are just some of the things that could go wrong \"I'm looking for a little more meat on the bones,\" said Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy during a lengthy back-and-forth pressing DHS for specifics. \"Tell me, if you would, sir, what the Trump administration would like us to do with respect to so-called Dreamers?\" The target of his questions, DHS Assistant Secretary Michael Dougherty, gave a general outline of what Trump would like to see, including a resolution for DACA recipients, border security, stronger deportation authority, enhanced vetting of immigrants, overhauling some visas and transforming the immigration system to favor high-skilled immigrants. Read More But Kennedy wasn't satisfied. \"Let me answer it this way,\" Dougherty began, with Kennedy cutting him off. \"How about you just answer it?\" Kennedy said, continuing to ask Dougherty under which conditions DACA recipients should be allowed to stay in the US. \"I don't have those details for you, sir,\" Dougherty said. The hearing revealed how much interest there is in Congress for some sort of deal on immigration and DACA -- and also how deep the divisions between parties remain. Senate Republicans float new DACA proposal Little consensus was achieved by the hearing over what a specific deal should like, and the Kennedy exchange typified many of the interactions between the senators and the witnesses, which happened with both Republicans and Democrats. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a Democrat, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, have both sponsored legislation that would provide a permanent pathway to citizenship for DACA-eligible immigrants, with slightly different approaches. Both also expressed frustration with Dougherty's list of the administration's priorities. Durbin referenced his efforts to write comprehensive immigration reform legislation in 2013 that passed the Senate on a large bipartisan basis, but died in the House. He noted more than 500 amendments were offered, quipping \"the most prolific person to offer amendments is our current attorney general.\" \"We addressed virtually every issue that you mentioned in your long list as part of comprehensive immigration reform,\" he said, referring to Dougherty's response to Kennedy. \"I hope the administration doesn't use your list ... Your list was the entirety of the comprehensive immigration reform.\" Committee to weigh McCaul border security bill amid DACA debate He said it was \"too much\" to \"put the burden\" on a DACA bill to answer all of the questions. \"It's too much to ask ... and I hope you'll take that message back,\" Durbin said. He got backup from his Republican colleague, Tillis, who used five minutes of questioning to deliver a statement to the gathered officials, instead. \"I know you can't get into the President's head, but that's one of the benefits of social media and tweets,\" he said, proceeding to read aloud most of the President's tweets about DACA. Tillis said it was clear to him that Trump was interested in a deal with border security and compassionate response to DACA, rather than everything Dougherty listed. \"It reads like a laundry list for comprehensive immigration reform, and if Congress has proven an extraordinary ability to do anything, it's to fail at comprehensive immigration reform,\" Tillis said. \"We know what the problem is, we know what a reasonable solution is, and we should provide it.\" There were other tense exchanges as well, including from the former top Democrat on the committee, Vermont Sen. Pat Leahy, who especially took issue with the Justice Department representative. At the outset of the hearing Chairman Chuck Grassley noted that DOJ had not submitted written testimony for the hearing, and acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler, of the civil division, said he was limited in speaking outside of what was already public because of ongoing lawsuits over the administration's termination of DACA. 983 would lose protection per day: What a DACA phase-out would look like Leahy pressed Readler on Attorney General Jeff Sessions' letter about the rescission of DACA, which suggested lax immigration enforcement was responsible for crime, violence and even terrorism. \"Can you provide this committee with any examples of Dreamers being involved in terror activity? ... You don't have to give me hundreds, just give me one!\" Leahy said, raising his voice. \"I'm not aware of any examples,\" Readler said. \"Neither is the attorney general when he said that,\" Leahy said. After further back-and-forth about what Sessions meant, Readler noted he would be testifying before this committee himself this month. \"He's taken longer than any attorney general since I've been here, but I've only been here 42 years,\" Leahy said. Under questioning from Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, who has co-sponsored Durbin's bill, the DHS officials did say they supported a pathway to citizenship for DACA-eligible individuals in an eventual solution -- and said they were largely the type of people the US should want. \"They're a benefit to the country as are many immigrants coming in,\" Dougherty said. \"They are a valuable contribution to our society, we need to regularize their status through legislative means.\" He also said DHS did not support the notion of creating a permanent visa status that would never allow people to be naturalized -- saying the White House would be of the same mind. \"I think creating second-class citizens or people who are never able to naturalize is not a good model,\" Dougherty said, adding \"I do\" when asked if he thinks the President agrees.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chuck grassley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leahy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dougherty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thom tillis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durbin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chad readler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick durbin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccaul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat leahy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "readler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael dougherty", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "daca", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "deferred action for childhood arrivals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of justice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dhs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doj", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T21:49:19.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a9f9323a84593b98924cdacec1ae28b1848b92d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7tXd.RdWPfTMT0qPhqOVEjacD2eGZw_K8RLjIUWrKY2pF_npwQq_cWXphdS8o2WEEoLT2pyc6UGWm6EsVkFjzQx", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "News conference tells us everything about gun control - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "News conference tells us everything about gun control - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/171003125343-scalise-house-republican-meeting-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 941, "comments": 0, "shares": 941}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a9f9323a84593b98924cdacec1ae28b1848b92d9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXzxPB69SPn7tXd.RdWPfTMT0qPhqOVEjacD2eGZw_K8RLjIUWrKY2pF_npwQq_cWXphdS8o2WEEoLT2pyc6UGWm6EsVkFjzQx", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lauren Fox", "published": "2017-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "News conference tells us everything about gun control - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Majority Whip Steve Scalise spoke Tuesday at a Republican leader news conference Scalise and his colleagues addressed the Las Vegas shooting but not gun control (CNN) A tragedy strikes, and the country's predictable gun debate barely begins in the halls of Congress before it's over.\nIt was a routine news conference for GOP leadership, with one notable exception. This was the first time Majority Whip Steve Scalise stood behind the podium at the weekly leadership presser and delivered remarks since he was shot at congressional baseball practice in June. He was introduced by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Washington Republican, saying Scalise's return was a bright spot with \"everything that's going on in the world.\" As Scalise approached the lectern, the cameras captured a hand reach out and pat his shoulder. His colleagues --visibly moved -- recounted devastating memories: Scalise in a coma, Scalise's wife telling doctors not to underestimate the strength of her husband as he fought for his life. \"It's great to see all of you and it's great to be back,\" Scalise said. Read More It was a proud moment for a legislative body that was rocked by gun violence just months ago. The gun debate, again \"Just Steve being back here today, it's evidence of the power of miracles. The power of prayer of us healing and getting back together,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan said. Even with Scalise on stage, however, Ryan noted \"this is not a good day because we had an awful day two days ago.\" RELATED: Steve Scalise returns to Congress Scalise's return to the presser came just two days after a shooting in Las Vegas killed 59 Americans , injured hundreds more and assumed the gruesome distinction as the deadliest shooting in modern US history. As Republican leaders spoke Tuesday morning about their friend and colleague Scalise, as they offered condolences to victims and spoke about ways Americans could help by donating blood, it was what no one was saying that revealed the future of the gun debate in Congress. The Las Vegas shooting has left Congress once again struggling to find a consensus way to stop future attacks. Even for Republicans -- who spoke eloquently Tuesday about how they experienced the heartache of gun violence firsthand with Scalise -- the politics of guns on Capitol Hill have not changed. Taking a question Tuesday about how Ryan could make Americans feel safer, the speaker talked about the House's efforts to reform mental health in the country. The GOP-controlled House passed bipartisan mental health reforms last year and the mental health package was signed by President Barack Obama in 2016. Ryan said Tuesday that the victims of the Vegas shooting would \"need to heal. They need to grieve. They need to pray and we need to come together. and It's just important that we reflect the fact that our hearts are with them.\" While GOP leaders didn't announce any plans for a legislative action to the shooting, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced he and Nevada GOP Rep. Mark Amodei would be traveling on Air Force One on Wednesday to visit Las Vegas with President Donald Trump. On the floor of the Senate, Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer was taking a different tact. 8 charts that explain America's gun culture \"We can't banish evil or madness from the earth, but we sure can do what we can in our power to make our country a safer place. We need commonsense reforms and these reforms have broad public support in the face of tens of thousands of gun deaths every year,\" Schumer said. RELATED: Democrats are desperate to do something -- anything -- on gun control The fact is no one on Capitol Hill is under any allusions that the aftermath of Las Vegas will change congressional politics on guns. No one will tell you that Republicans and Democrats are going to see eye to eye now. Even advocates who have been at the center of these debates before, don't hide behind a forced tone of optimism that Congress is on the verge of changing its position on the issue. \"You know, I thought Sandy Hook would.

Steny Hoyer of Maryland -- repeatedly admitted he was \"confounded\" that opinion polls show majorities of Americans support several new restrictions on gun purchases, but that it hasn't become a major issue in national political campaigns. \"This is not something that ought to stay in Las Vegas,\" he told reporters. Hoyer vowed he and others would continue to press for background checks and pressed for Ryan to appoint a bipartisan task force to address gun violence.

During a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Angus King asked Mattis: \"Do you believe it is in our national security interest at the present time to remain in the (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action)? That is a yes or no question.\" Mattis replied, \"Yes, senator, I do.\" \"The point I would make is if we can confirm that Iran is living by the agreement, if we can determine that this is in our best interests then clearly we should stay with it,\" Mattis added. \"I believe at this point in time absent indications to the contrary, it is something the President should consider staying with.\" But Mattis went on to explain that he also supports a rigorous review of national security issues related to Iran that may fall outside the exact terms of the agreement. Read More \"The President has to consider more broadly things that rightly fall under his portfolio of looking out for the American people in areas that go beyond the specific letters of the JCPOA -- in that regard I support the rigorous review that he has got going on right now,\" he said. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford also reiterated his stance on the Iran deal during Tuesday's hearing. \"Iran is not in material breach of the agreement, and I do believe the agreement to date has delayed the development of a nuclear capability by Iran,\" he said. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Iran deal, most recently during his address to the United Nations General Assembly last month. \"We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program,\" Trump told the assembly. The President and administration officials have said the deal doesn't address Iran's missile development or its activities in the region, including support for Houthi rebels in Yemen and for the regime of Syria's Bashar al-Assad. Money flowing to Iran because of sanctions relief is allowing Tehran to fund these destabilizing activities, the administration argues. During his own address at the UN General Assembly , Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said it would be a \"great pity\" if \"rogue newcomers\" destroy the international nuclear deal that lifted sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran's nuclear program. \"It will be a great pity if this agreement were destroyed by rogue newcomers to the world of politics,\" he added in a clear reference to US President Donald Trump, who addressed the General Assembly the day before. \"I declare to you the Islamic Republic of Iran will not be the first country to violate the agreement, but it will respond decisively and resolutely to its violation by any party,\" he said. At the UN last month, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, made clear that European parties to the deal aren't interested in revisiting the agreement, which took two years to finalize. \"There is no need to reopen the agreement because it's fully delivering\" and Iran is abiding by it, Mogherini said. \"This is an agreement that prevented a nuclear program and potentially prevented a military intervention,\" Mogherini said. \"Let's not forget that.\" She said that, \"it's not for one party or the other to certify this.\" That's a job for the International Atomic Energy Agency, \"with its technical independent role\" to verify that Iran is sticking to the agreement. Trump told reporters at the UN that he had made a decision about how to proceed when he next has to certify in mid-October that Iran is in compliance.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. \"There must never be a route back to nationalism,\" German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said in a speech to mark the country's Day of German Unity. (CNN) Germany's president Frank-Walter Steinmeier has warned of the fractures in its society -- highlighted by the electoral success of the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD) -- on the nation's Day of German Unity. On October 3, a national holiday, Germans mark the reunification of East and West Germany in 1990, following the fall of the Berlin Wall the previous year. \"It is right that we celebrate this day, like every year,\" Steinmeier told a large gathering of politicians and citizens in Mainz, western Germany. \"But something is different this year ... we must not go on as if nothing has happened.\" We can say goodbye to a stable Germany \"Other walls have gone up,\" he said, \"less visible and without barbed wire and death strips, but still walls that stand in the way of our collective 'we.'\" Steinmeier spoke of walls between cities and rural areas, between rich and poor, old and young, and online and offline communities. Read More They are \"walls of alienation, frustration or anger\" and behind those walls there is \"deep mistrust of democracy and its representatives,\" Steinmeier said. Without mentioning the AfD by name, Steinmeier warned that Germany's progress since 1990, becoming a democratic, peaceful and strong country at the heart of Europe, could be lost if politicians and ordinary Germans do not work together to fight the party's far-right ideology and to respond to the concerns of its supporters. The appeal of the far right The AfD -- originally an anti-European Union and anti-euro party that has since turned its focus to immigration and Islam -- won 12.6% of the vote in the elections on September 24 and became the third largest party in the German parliament, according to preliminary results. Like many other far-right parties across Europe, the AfD has branded itself as an anti-establishment party of protest, appealing to those citizens previously disillusioned by or uninterested in politics. And their strategy seemed to work: nearly 700,000 votes for the AfD came from former non-voters, according to preliminary data from political polling firm Infratest Dimap. Germans celebrate the \"Day of German Unity\" at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. The monument stood in no-man's land, between East and West Berlin, until 1989. Support for the AfD was particularly high in the former East Germany, where 21.5% of votes went to the far-right party, according to Infratest Dimap. Speaking to CNN on the night of the election results, Jasna Zajcek, an expert on rise of the far right in eastern Germany, said one of the reasons the AfD had performed better than expected was that many voters in the east do not feel integrated into modern Germany. She said these voters feel they still suffer from the loss of the more socialist state system that the former East Germany once provided. Those voters don't understand why economic benefits are \"thrown\" at migrants while they suffer from high unemployment, small pensions and drug and alcohol problems, Zajcek added. Concessions on immigration? Steinmeier addressed this issue in his speech Tuesday, saying many Germans from the former East no longer feel at home in their own country, and question if anyone is looking out for them. Four graphics that explain how a far-right party won third place in Germany \"This desire for a home, a homeland -- we mustn't leave that to the nationalists,\" said Steinmeier. \"There must never be a route back to nationalism,\" he insisted, a statement that was met with a sustained ovation. Steinmeier did, however, suggest Germany should consider stricter immigration controls in what can be seen as a bid to draw AfD voters back to the mainstream parties. Germany should give asylum to those who are eligible, he said, but must also consider \"which forms of and how much immigration we want ... and need.\" \"Migration should be controlled according to our requirements,\" he continued, insisting that people who come to Germany must learn the language and abide by the country's laws and values. \"That cannot be up for discussion.\" CNN's Lauren Said-Moorhouse contributed to this article.

As a victim of identity theft more than 20 years ago, when several retail cards were opened in her name and checks written from her account, Giltner, 69, spent years rebuilding her financial life. \nWhen she learned that she was one of the 145 million Americans affected by the recent Equifax data breach , in which personal and financial data were accessed including Social Security numbers, dates of birth and addresses, she was cast back to the fear, frustration and anger she felt as a victim of identity fraud. \nNow, she has trouble sleeping at night. \n\"It's the fear of losing money,\" says Giltner, a retired registered nurse in Albia, Iowa. \"And the fear I might have to go through this all over again.\" \nThat's why she was crying in her banker's office. She hadn't lost any money yet, but she was afraid she might. \n\"We don't have a lot of money,\" she said, which is why she went in to ask about protecting her savings account. Her 50th wedding anniversary is coming up and she and her husband are planning a trip to Hawaii. \"We've been saving for that for a long time,\" she said. \nWhile she was reassured that her money was safe, her banker got something out of it, too. \n\"She hadn't heard about the breach,\" Giltner said. They looked at the Equifax security breach website , where you can find out if your information was compromised. \nTo no one's surprise, the banker was affected, too. \nFinding the fraud \nGiltner realized that her identity had been taken when credit cards she didn't apply for began arriving at her house. \nThis was in 1993, a time before online payments were a way of life and the murky digital heists of data were a routine threat. She knew exactly how her identity got lifted: someone broke into the glove-box of her car and stole her checkbook, with Social Security number written down inside. It was not uncommon at that time in Iowa for retailers to ask for your Social Security number and put it on your check. \nThe thieves first tried to write checks from her checkbook, but thanks to a personal relationship with her bankers, they were never cashed. \n\"It was a small bank in a small town,\" she said. \"They knew my signature.\" \nShe closed that checking account, but the charges to newly opened retail credit cards kept rolling in: Best Buy, Kohls, a local farm-supply store, a local lumberyard. \n\"The thief opened and maxed out several credit cards and even went back to one store the next day, increased the credit card max and maxed it out as well,\" she said. \nThousands of dollars of debt were piling up in Pam Giltner's good name. \nShutting down the thieves \nGiltner was fortunate that her bank had seen the red flags on checks she didn't write. \"The bigger banks wouldn't have paid any attention,\" Giltner says. \nBut convincing retailers that she was not the one who had maxed out the cards took a long time to resolve. \"It was weeks of work,\" Giltner says, \"that turned into months that turned into years.\" \nShe filed police reports locally because she needed the report numbers in the dispute process with creditors and the credit rating agencies. She followed up with the companies and challenged the reports to her credit. \nBoth Giltner and her husband placed freezes on their credit -- and essentially stopped using credit for years. \n\"We didn't use any credit because I was scared to death,\" she said. \"We paid cash for almost everything and just lived day to day.\" \nShe had stopped the fraudulent cards and adjusted to this new credit-less reality when, seven years after the original theft, she received a notice that someone was writing bad checks in her name again. This time at a drug store in Iowa City. \n\"I got a letter in the mail saying that I need to pay this and go to check writing classes,\" Giltner recalls, still incredulous. \"I called the county attorney and explained what had happened. Then I had to dig up all the case numbers and get those to him so that he could clear me of this check issue.\" \nIn the end, Giltner said, there was no justice against the thieves. The companies opted not to press charges because it was cheaper for them to eat the loss of the thefts. \nHearing about Equifax \nWhen Giltner heard about the Equifax data breach on the news, she said to herself: \"Not again.\" \nHaving lived for years with her credit under a freeze, she felt brave enough to lift it a few years ago. \n\"I was not thrilled with the freeze,\" she said. In her state it was $10 to freeze her credit and $10 to thaw it so she could get credit. She had been happy with the credit alert system she used. \n\"But as I soon as I heard about the problem, I paid for Lifelock,\" she said. \"That's $40 a month for the 2 of us. That's a lot of money, but I'm scared and frustrated and angry.\" \nShe also placed a credit alert on her credit with each of the bureaus, which alerts lenders to possible fraud on her account before any new credit is extended to her. \nShe is now the town crier on identity theft. She's made sure that her grown children, their spouses and their children have checked to be sure they know if they are affected. Half of them have been. \n\"I tell them to check right away,\" she said. \"I tell everyone I see. I want people to know! l wish this would never happen to other people.\" \nCNNMoney (New York) First published October 3, 2017: 2:47 PM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pam giltner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "giltner", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "equifax", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lifelock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "social security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kohls", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "iowa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hawaii", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "albia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iowa city", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-10-03T22:00:23.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ffe55d22207593223a2ece64c1cf7ab41941347", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnLqwAGPDXWXTzzhMGj66IunTl55FopDynMFUSKfZhOq_SoNs2Qjn1bK", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Tom Petty's daughter angered over death report", "title_full": "Tom Petty's daughter angered over death report - Oct. 3, 2017", "published": "2017-10-03T22:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171003105943-jason-merritt-getty-images-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1926, "comments": 0, "shares": 1926}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ffe55d22207593223a2ece64c1cf7ab41941347", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGMsvJmEcaCnLqwAGPDXWXTzzhMGj66IunTl55FopDynMFUSKfZhOq_SoNs2Qjn1bK", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-10-03T22:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Tom Petty's daughter angered over death report", "text": "Musician Tom Petty dies at age 66 Tom Petty died on Monday night, but inaccurate news of his death made its way around the internet much earlier in the day.
