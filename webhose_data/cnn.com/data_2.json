Tim Scott It's another blow to President Trump's legislative agenda Washington (CNN) The Senate will not vote on the Graham-Cassidy bill to repeal Obamacare, Republican leaders announced Tuesday, dealing a devastating blow to President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers who tried to make a last-ditch attempt to deliver on the party's years-long campaign promise.\nMajority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the decision at a lunch with fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill, conceding what had become clear Monday night: They didn't have the votes. \"We haven't given up on changing the American health care system. We are not going to be able to do that this week,\" McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \"But it still lies ahead of us, and we haven't given up on that.\" JUST WATCHED Graham: Coming back to health bill after taxes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nGraham: Coming back to health bill after taxes 01:18 Even as McConnell and his colleagues vowed that their goal of overhauling the country's health care system was far from over, Tuesday marked a clear end to the latest campaign to try to jam through a partisan bill to gut the Affordable Care Act. The budget vehicle Republicans were using to move the bill forward without any Democratic support was set to expire at the end of this week. The sponsors of Graham-Cassidy said they were disappointed but would try again -- next time through a more transparent process. The new plan, they said, is to take another crack at health care through the 2019 budget reconciliation process (which would again only require 50 votes for passage) and hold committee hearings, markups and reach out to Democrats. Read More Collins to vote 'no' on Graham-Cassidy bill, likely killing latest Obamacare repeal The political calculation leading up to Tuesday was agonizing for McConnell. Putting a controversial bill on the floor without the votes would have exposed members to political fallout and attack ads. Many Republicans hadn't even taken a public position on Graham-Cassidy, a bill that the Congressional Budget Office said Monday would drastically cut Medicaid and lead to millions of people not having health insurance compared to the status quo. In the end, three Republicans had publicly opposed the bill: Sens. John McCain, Susan Collins and Rand Paul. McConnell \"didn't try to explain the decision\" during the lunch, GOP Sen. Tim Scott said. \"It's obvious -- we don't have the votes right now, you don't vote until you have them.\" Working with Democrats? At a bipartisan White House meeting, the President warned Republicans Tuesday that he would work with Democrats on health care if they fail to act. Trump mentioned how much he liked the deal he negotiated recently with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi on raising the debt ceiling and government spending, according to a source familiar with the discussion and with Democratic lawmakers. The Republican zombie repeal and replace effort just died. Again. Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez told reporters that Trump told the group he was \"disappointed\" in those Republican senators who came out against the Senate bill. She said he \"chided\" the GOP members there that he could end up working with Democrats on health care legislation JUST WATCHED Watch highlights from CNN's health care debate Replay More Videos ...

Richard Neal, ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, said \"clearly\" when asked if the President was making a threat. \"He made that clear that if he didn't get what he wanted, he was going to work with Democrats on a plan,\" Neal told reporters. Graham, however, brushed off the suggestion that Trump might once again catch Republicans off-guard by striking a deal with Democrats. \"I think the President is not going to do anything that doesn't repeal and replace Obamacare in a substantial way -- don't sell him short,\" he told CNN. Will Republicans really move on? What's not clear is whether Republican lawmakers will truly move on from Obamacare repeal for the time being -- or attempt to find another way to try again.

That may well be very unwelcome news to members of the House and Senate up for re-election next November, according to a new CNN national poll , which paints a very grim picture for incumbents -- especially on the Republican side. Asked whether \"most members of Congress\" deserve re-election, just 22% of Americans say they do while 68% think they don't. Among registered voters, only 20% want most members re-elected while 70% would rather the majority of members not return to Congress. What's even more striking is how low those \"yes, deserves re-election\" numbers are among Republicans and self-identified conservatives who, presumably, should be pleased with the Republican majorities in Congress. In fact, the opposite is true. Just 3 in 10 Republicans say they want to see most members reelected while only 25% of conservatives say the same. (Just 1 in 5 Democrats want to see most members reelected -- not surprising given the GOP Congressional majorities.) It's worth noting that when it comes to the question of whether their own member of Congress deserves to be re-elected, people are far more supportive, with 44% saying they think their guy or a gal deserves another term. (The difference between the responses to those two questions is consistent historically; people may totally hate Congress but they tend to feel much more warmly about their own member.) Read More Still, the 22% of people -- and 20% of registered voters -- who say they want most members of Congress not to be reelected is the lowest ever measured in CNN polling, dating all the way back to 1991. That includes polling done in August 2010 (31% wanted most members re-elected) and October 2006 (42% wanted most members re-elected). In the former election, Republicans won 63 seats and control of the House. In the latter, Democrats picked up 30 seats and re-took the House majority. Both of those elections were Midterms -- like 2018 will be -- and functioned as a punishment for the party who controlled the White House. And, in both cases, the president wasn't terribly popular. In fact, according to Gallup calculations , the average seat loss for the president's party in Midterm elections dating back to 1946 is 36 seats -- when the president's approval is under 50% nationally. Trump is currently at 39% in the latest Gallup tracking poll. The problem for Republicans is even if the \"toss the bums out\" attitude is directed at elected officials more generally rather than at their party in particular, they still stand to suffer losses. Republicans currently control 240 seats, to 194 for Democrats. (A single seat -- in a strongly GOP Utah district will be decided in November.) Inside Elections, a non-partisan political handicapping site, lists 48 Republican held-seats in jeopardy as compared to just 14 Democratic seats. In addition, there are 23 Republicans who hold seats that Hillary Clinton carried over Donald Trump in 2016 . (There are 12 Democrats who hold seats where Trump beat Clinton last November.) Before Democrats begin eyeing the majority -- and the committee chairmanships that come with it -- though it's worth noting that it's (still) no easy road for the party to pick up the 24 seats it needs to retake control. This, per the Cook Political Report's House editor David Wasserman , is telling: \"Even if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points \u2014 a pretty good midterm by historical standards \u2014 they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats.\" The reason for this? Republicans controlled the decennial congressional line-drawing process in lots and lots of states in 2010/2011. And they drew districts across the country that are just very hard for any Democrat to win. What the new CNN polling suggests is that way out in the ocean, a wave is building. Some waves that form that far out disappear into nothing by the time they make shore. Some develop into decent swells but nothing to be concerned about. And some build into true monsters that overwhelm even the bulwarks built against them. Which kind of wave will 2018 be?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chris cillizza", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david wasserman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midterm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop congressional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T21:04:16.019+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "714e1e34cc8ce1d255a5ad4c4dbbaa61ee9df43a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwfLP24YtKw5pvqM8jh4poptLOrEKrajWo4lRdbxmww8vWv3flr7ocKdMzC8wa0YC_k-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - World", "title": "'Afghan girl' photographer on lifelong career - CNN Video", "title_full": "'Afghan girl' photographer on lifelong career - CNN Video", "published": "2017-09-26T21:04:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926184934-intv-amanpour-steve-mccurry-00022606-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 113, "comments": 0, "shares": 113}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "714e1e34cc8ce1d255a5ad4c4dbbaa61ee9df43a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwfLP24YtKw5pvqM8jh4poptLOrEKrajWo4lRdbxmww8vWv3flr7ocKdMzC8wa0YC_k-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T21:04:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Afghan girl' photographer on lifelong career - CNN Video", "text": "MUST WATCH 'Afghan girl' photographer on lifelong career Photographer Steve McCurry speaks to Christiane Amanpour about capturing the Afghan girl that mesmerized the world and a career that spans over four decades.

We are not going to be able to do that this week,\" McConnell told reporters Tuesday. \"But it still lies ahead of us, and we haven't given up on that.\" JUST WATCHED Graham: Coming back to health bill after taxes Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nGraham: Coming back to health bill after taxes 01:18 Even as McConnell and his colleagues vowed that their goal of overhauling the country's health care system was far from over, Tuesday marked a clear end to the latest campaign to try to jam through a partisan bill to gut the Affordable Care Act. The budget vehicle Republicans were using to move the bill forward without any Democratic support was set to expire at the end of this week. The sponsors of Graham-Cassidy said they were disappointed but would try again -- next time through a more transparent process. The new plan, they said, is to take another crack at health care through the 2019 budget reconciliation process (which would again only require 50 votes for passage) and hold committee hearings, markups and reach out to Democrats. Read More Collins to vote 'no' on Graham-Cassidy bill, likely killing latest Obamacare repeal The political calculation leading up to Tuesday was agonizing for McConnell. Putting a controversial bill on the floor without the votes would have exposed members to political fallout and attack ads. Many Republicans hadn't even taken a public position on Graham-Cassidy, a bill that the Congressional Budget Office said Monday would drastically cut Medicaid and lead to millions of people not having health insurance compared to the status quo. In the end, three Republicans had publicly opposed the bill: Sens. John McCain, Susan Collins and Rand Paul. McConnell \"didn't try to explain the decision\" during the lunch, GOP Sen. Tim Scott said. \"It's obvious -- we don't have the votes right now, you don't vote until you have them.\" Working with Democrats? At a bipartisan White House meeting, the President warned Republicans Tuesday that he would work with Democrats on health care if they fail to act. Trump mentioned how much he liked the deal he negotiated recently with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi on raising the debt ceiling and government spending, according to a source familiar with the discussion and with Democratic lawmakers. The Republican zombie repeal and replace effort just died. Again. Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez told reporters that Trump told the group he was \"disappointed\" in those Republican senators who came out against the Senate bill. She said he \"chided\" the GOP members there that he could end up working with Democrats on health care legislation JUST WATCHED Watch highlights from CNN's health care debate Replay More Videos ...

Richard Neal, ranking member on the Ways and Means Committee, said \"clearly\" when asked if the President was making a threat. \"He made that clear that if he didn't get what he wanted, he was going to work with Democrats on a plan,\" Neal told reporters. Graham, however, brushed off the suggestion that Trump might once again catch Republicans off-guard by striking a deal with Democrats. \"I think the President is not going to do anything that doesn't repeal and replace Obamacare in a substantial way -- don't sell him short,\" he told CNN.

People are waiting in a main terminal that -- because it is running on limited emergency power -- has no air conditioning. \"Everyone is in the same boat, trying to get out,\" Leyla Colon, standing in line at the airport Monday, told Reuters. She said she couldn't buy tickets before she arrived at the airport, because she didn't have Internet or cellphone service. \"At this point I'll buy a ticket on any flight to get out of here,\" Colon told Reuters.

Sarita Mongelli's parents, in their 80s, were on the flight. \"I can't describe the feeling after five days (of) not talking to them,\" Mongelli told CNN affiliate WABC . \"I can't tell you what they've gone through -- horrible, horrible conditions -- and at this age, it's very hard for them.\" Mongelli said her parents want to return to Puerto Rico but won't be going back anytime soon. \"Whatever's left of their life right now, they need to be safe with their children, not alone,\" she told the TV station. \"We can't ask for more, I got them home -- I'm taking them home with me now.\" 'We're on a mission' Ryan says Puerto Rico will get aid, calls situation 'a humanitarian crisis' At Atlanta's international airport, aid workers were preparing Tuesday to board a charter flight to San Juan. Among them were 31 members of the New York City Fire Department, many of whom are of Puerto Rican descent. \"As Puerto Rican New York City firefighters with family that live in Puerto Rico, devastated by Hurricane Maria, we're on a mission to do what we can as best as we can, to get to all the people we can,\" said Lt. Joe Montalvo, a fireman from Battalion 57 in Brooklyn. The firefighters loaded supplies onto the plane, including special cases of blood in refrigerated containers. Montalvo said he had yet to speak with relatives living on the island. \"Phone service is still down, cellphone service is limited,\" Montalvo said. \"My family (lives) in the southwest corner of the island, and we haven't heard anything from anybody.\" He added, \"We're hopeful they're OK.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities":

just over a year away!\nThat may well be very unwelcome news to members of the House and Senate up for re-election next November, according to a new CNN national poll , which paints a very grim picture for incumbents -- especially on the Republican side. Asked whether \"most members of Congress\" deserve re-election, just 22% of Americans say they do while 68% think they don't. Among registered voters, only 20% want most members re-elected while 70% would rather the majority of members not return to Congress. What's even more striking is how low those \"yes, deserves re-election\" numbers are among Republicans and self-identified conservatives who, presumably, should be pleased with the Republican majorities in Congress. In fact, the opposite is true. Just 3 in 10 Republicans say they want to see most members reelected while only 25% of conservatives say the same. (Just 1 in 5 Democrats want to see most members reelected -- not surprising given the GOP Congressional majorities.) It's worth noting that when it comes to the question of whether their own member of Congress deserves to be re-elected, people are far more supportive, with 44% saying they think their guy or a gal deserves another term. (The difference between the responses to those two questions is consistent historically; people may totally hate Congress but they tend to feel much more warmly about their own member.) Read More Still, the 22% of people -- and 20% of registered voters -- who say they want most members of Congress not to be reelected is the lowest ever measured in CNN polling, dating all the way back to 1991. That includes polling done in August 2010 (31% wanted most members re-elected) and October 2006 (42% wanted most members re-elected). In the former election, Republicans won 63 seats and control of the House. In the latter, Democrats picked up 30 seats and re-took the House majority. Both of those elections were Midterms -- like 2018 will be -- and functioned as a punishment for the party who controlled the White House. And, in both cases, the president wasn't terribly popular. In fact, according to Gallup calculations , the average seat loss for the president's party in Midterm elections dating back to 1946 is 36 seats -- when the president's approval is under 50% nationally. Trump is currently at 39% in the latest Gallup tracking poll. The problem for Republicans is even if the \"toss the bums out\" attitude is directed at elected officials more generally rather than at their party in particular, they still stand to suffer losses. Republicans currently control 240 seats, to 194 for Democrats. (A single seat -- in a strongly GOP Utah district will be decided in November.) Inside Elections, a non-partisan political handicapping site, lists 48 Republican held-seats in jeopardy as compared to just 14 Democratic seats. In addition, there are 23 Republicans who hold seats that Hillary Clinton carried over Donald Trump in 2016 . (There are 12 Democrats who hold seats where Trump beat Clinton last November.) Before Democrats begin eyeing the majority -- and the committee chairmanships that come with it -- though it's worth noting that it's (still) no easy road for the party to pick up the 24 seats it needs to retake control. This, per the Cook Political Report's House editor David Wasserman , is telling: \"Even if Democrats were to win every single 2018 House and Senate race for seats representing places that Hillary Clinton won or that Trump won by less than 3 percentage points \u2014 a pretty good midterm by historical standards \u2014 they could still fall short of the House majority and lose five Senate seats.\" The reason for this? Republicans controlled the decennial congressional line-drawing process in lots and lots of states in 2010/2011. And they drew districts across the country that are just very hard for any Democrat to win. What the new CNN polling suggests is that way out in the ocean, a wave is building. Some waves that form that far out disappear into nothing by the time they make shore. Some develop into decent swells but nothing to be concerned about. And some build into true monsters that overwhelm even the bulwarks built against them. Which kind of wave will 2018 be?", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david wasserman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midterm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop congressional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gallup", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T21:35:27.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "176008645648dbffe68967ff029416f907246ff1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRcXVi.kUTpE69kgOU7czR.UuJwqoR3K7Da0H5ImzEt17hPAOokPhFNCqQkso5NlVhw--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Obama: Sending Malia to college was 'rough' - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Obama: Sending Malia to college was 'rough' - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170823193255-malia-obama-starts-harvard-orig-00000000-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 133397, "comments": 0, "shares": 133397}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "176008645648dbffe68967ff029416f907246ff1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRcXVi.kUTpE69kgOU7czR.UuJwqoR3K7Da0H5ImzEt17hPAOokPhFNCqQkso5NlVhw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jennifer Hansler", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Obama: Sending Malia to college was 'rough' - CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) Former President Barack Obama revealed Monday night how emotional it was to say goodbye to his eldest daughter, Malia, when she went away to college this fall. \n\"For those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast.

As CNN previously reported, among the people Mueller has expressed interest in speaking with are former and current White House staffers whom investigators consider witnesses, including former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former press secretary Sean Spicer, communications director Hope Hicks, White House counsel Don McGahn, communications adviser Josh Raffel and associate counsel James Burnham. Mueller's team also approached the White House about interviewing staffers who were aboard Air Force One for the creation of the initial response to news of Donald Trump Jr.'s Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer, sources previously told CNN . Mueller's investigators are looking for documents and emails relating to the dismissals of national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey, according to the sources. In addition, one source confirms that Mueller's team wants information connected to the Oval Office meeting Trump had with Russian officials in which he bragged about firing Comey, saying it eased pressure on his White House.

He steps down three weeks after the credit reporting bureau disclosed the massive data breach, which left customers feeling helpless and vulnerable to identify theft. The company's botched response made things even worse. \nDuring the hearing, Warner questioned whether the company \"even has the right to continue providing these services with the level of sloppiness and lack of attention to cybersecurity.\" \nRelated: Equifax CEO Richard Smith is out after stunning data breach \nEquifax ( EFX ) is one three major companies that track the credit histories of Americans and sell the information to banks, credit card companies and other clients. \nSmith is expected to testify before the Senate Banking Committee next Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the committee said the hearing schedule has not changed. \n\"I hope he still comes before the committee,\" Sen. Jon Tester of Montana said at the hearing. \"It's less about spending time with his family, and more about not spending time with us.\" \nOn Tuesday, Democrats repeatedly pressed Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton on whether he would investigate Equifax and take enforcement action if necessary. \nClayton, a Trump nominee who was confirmed in May, would neither confirm or deny any plans by the SEC to investigate the matter. \nEquifax learned of the hack in late July, but only disclosed it on September 7. At first, Equifax couldn't say whose data had been breached and it initially asked customers to give up their right to sue the company in exchange for credit monitoring services. \nBefore the public learned about the hack, three Equifax executives sold large chunks of stock. The company has said those executives did not know about the breach. \nClayton said he wouldn't comment on whether he thought Equifax should have disclosed the breach sooner. \nRelated: Equifax turned its hack into a public relations nightmare \nHe said in general companies should be doing a betterjob of \"promptly\" disclosing when \"a breach is a material to investors.\" \nStill, Tester kept pushing Clayton for an answer. \"The six-week delay seems bizarre to me, especially if in fact these folks dumped stock. Why would they wait six weeks?\" \n\"They're good questions, These are valid questions. Their questions that Americans should have,\" said Clayton. \nTester pressed Clayton further on whether he would use his powers to address wrongdoing by any current or former executive of Equifax by possibly slapping fines on executives or other penalties. \nTo which, Clayton replied: \"That's my job.\" \n-- CNNMoney's Matt Egan contributed to this story.

The ride-hailing giant on Tuesday said it will exit the Canadian province on Saturday, October 14, if the Ministry of Transportation implements proposed new regulations. \nUber has been operating in Quebec during the past year under a government pilot project. Last week, Quebec renewed the project for another year, but with stricter requirements. For example, the province wants drivers to complete 35 hours of training -- the same requirement its taxi drivers must undergo in Montreal. \nAn Uber spokesman in Quebec told CNN Tech the new driver training requirement is not feasible for many of its drivers who only work for the company part time and have other jobs. As a result, there could be fewer drivers available in the region and longer wait times for customers. \nRelated: Uber CEO apologizes to Londoners: 'We got things wrong' \n\"The proposed rules would impose onerous training obligations developed for a different industry on ridesharing drivers, without taking into account the benefits that come with new technology such as in-app safety features, GPS tracking of every trip, a two-way rating system, and 24/7 support,\" Jean-Nicolas Guillemette, general manager of Uber Quebec, said in a statement. \nHowever, Uber said it's willing to work with the government on a solution. But if no compromise is met, Uber is prepared to pull out of Montreal and Quebec City. \nUber has about 50 employees in the Quebec province and 10,000 drivers have worked for the company there under the pilot program. \nQuebec's transport ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nThe announcement came less than a week after London's transport authority said it wouldn't renew Uber's license , calling the service not \"fit and proper\" to operate in the city. It cited Uber's approach to reporting serious criminal offenses and how the company used software to dodge regulators and law enforcement. \nCNNMoney (New York)   26, 2017: 2:24 PM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kaya yurieff", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jean-nicolas guillemette", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ministry of transportation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uber", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "quebec", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quebec city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montreal", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T21:49:23.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "564755a0bd47e1056e4e0a66abb5afec5b9a245d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LskZrS8Ud0VtsayFsZ724sBxbtd_51mUY6GW3lgdauDtaY5Kn8AaoFxYqAj4ivSfUEyLiQHjpfI1g-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/edition.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - App International Edition", "title": "Kurdish leader claims victory for 'yes' vote", "title_full": "Kurdish leader claims victory for 'yes' vote", "published": "2017-09-26T21:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926141336-masoud-barzani-0922-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5628, "comments": 0, "shares": 5628}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "564755a0bd47e1056e4e0a66abb5afec5b9a245d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LskZrS8Ud0VtsayFsZ724sBxbtd_51mUY6GW3lgdauDtaY5Kn8AaoFxYqAj4ivSfUEyLiQHjpfI1g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T21:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kurdish leader claims victory for 'yes' vote", "text": "Who are the Kurds? 01:40 Irbil, Iraq (CNN) Iraqi Kurds have voted in favor of declaring independence from Iraq in a controversial referendum, Kurdistan Regional Government President Masoud Barzani announced Tuesday. The official results have not yet been released by the Independent High Elections and Referendum Commission, the body supervising the vote. But the Kurdish Minister of Foreign Relations, Falah Mustafa, told CNN that preliminary results show a majority of Iraqi Kurds voted for independence. \"Honored people of Kurdistan, by your resistance, you didn't allow your will to be broken. And now, after your 'yes' vote, which was a yes to independence and no to Anfal and chemical attacks, a new phase is ahead of us,\" Barzani said in a televised speech, referring to the massacre of thousands of Kurds by Saddam Hussein's forces in 1988. \"Respect the will of the people of Kurdistan. Let's engage in a serious dialogue and become good neighbors,\" Barzani added.

On Monday the Iraqi parliament authorized use of force against Kurdistan. Barzani's KRG, however, says the referendum will give it a mandate for talks to secede from Iraq, but Baghdad has already ruled out such talks. Nearly all neighboring regional powers objected to the referendum, warning that independence could further destabilize the region. Iran and Turkey both opposed the vote over fears it could galvanize Kurdish independence movements in their countries. Iran closed its air space to northern Iraq on Sunday, and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan threatened to cut off oil exports from the region on Monday. The United States, United Kingdom and the United Nations also warned the KRG against holding the referendum, citing fears that it could detract from the campaign against ISIS.

Luther Strange in Alabama He's not the first politician to take a high-profile public horseback ride (CNN) Some have compared elections to horse races -- and Alabama Senate Republican primary candidate Roy Moore is literally galloping to the finish line of his runoff campaign. The GOP candidate and his wife arrived to their polling place in Gallant, Alabama, Tuesday on horseback. Moore, sporting a cowboy hat and boots, rode a horse named Sassy, while his wife Kayla arrived on a horse named Sundance, according to Getty. Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Moore faces off against Sen. Luther Strange in the special election for Attorney General Jeff Sessions' former seat in the US Senate. Strange currently holds the seat after being appointed by then-Gov. Robert Bentley to finish out Sessions' term; he has the backing of President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Moore is seen as the anti-establishment candidate and has been a lightning rod for controversy. He was removed from his state Supreme Court job twice and has a long history of making highly contentious comments about race and sexual orientation . In 2015, he shared a video promoting the conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim.

When there's a shortage of water and sanitation issues, it will come out. We are expecting something like that to happen.\" Lack of fuel is the key problem at San Jorge Children's Hospital in San Juan, according to its executive director, Domingo Cruz Vivaldi. \"We are dealing with a crisis right now. The hospital is needing diesel every day -- 2,000 gallons a day. Yesterday, we ran out of diesel at 6 a.m. and we were without electricity at the hospital from 6 a.m. through 2 p.m. Eight hours without electricity.\" Without power, lifesaving machines like ventilators have to run on emergency backup power. Fears for the future are playing out across Puerto Rico. Misery is stalking each and every one of the more than 3 million Americans there. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz sees a growing need for help for increasingly desperate people. \"We are finding dialysis patients that have not been able to contact their providers. We are having to transport them in near-death conditions,\" the mayor said. \"We are finding people whose oxygen tanks are running out because our small generators now don't have any diesel.\" Most alarming are the SOS messages, she said, \"the ones that say 'Can anyone hear me?' The ones that say 'I have no more food and I'm out in the street.'\" Cruz and her teams are out on the streets trying to find the neediest people. But in the mountains south of her city, help is less likely to come. JUST WATCHED Vet in Puerto Rico: Hurricane worse than war Replay More Videos ...

And even that may spoil in his refrigerator with no power. The mayor of his town, Javier Garcia, believes help will come from the mainland and the federal government. The question is when, and whether it will be too late for Olivera and others. Lines of people are hoping to get a flight off the island. The main airport in San Juan is crippled, barely functioning . Those there are hoping to escape a crowded terminal with no air conditioning. On Tuesday, only 10 flights were scheduled. Check-in desks were packed with people waiting in line, hoping for a flight off the island. Fans were running, but keeping no one cool. Hopeful travelers sat in chairs on line and others lay nearby, using their suitcases as pillows. A mother rocked a stroller back and forth to try to calm a child. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was food and water on the way to Puerto Rico and added that he would visit the island next week . Until aid arrives, Garcia and his fellows in Aguas Buenas are reverting to an older way of life -- hacking coconuts to eat and collecting water from mountain streams. But that can only sustain so many for so long. Twenty-first century help is needed for many, like Miguel Olivera, who rely on medication. And the situation can so easily get worse -- mosquito-borne diseases like Zika and Dengue fever are very real fears here. A massive power tower that was toppled in Aguas Buenas will take a helicopter to restore. That's one very obvious problem. But Puerto Rico's power grid was a mess well before the storm and it will be months -- several months -- before electricity is restored across the island.

Gas stations around San Juan do have some supply, but the demand is overwhelming. Long lines of vehicles queue up at the pumps and men with red plastic gas cans wait for up to six hours, hoping to get a few precious gallons. Similar lines grow outside any open grocery store and anywhere that has ice. Lines for gas stretched for hours in many parts of Puerto Rico. It's hot. And it's humid. Temperature were set to rise to the low 90s on Tuesday. Showers are forecast later this week but they will barely make it any cooler. Puerto Rico's leaders and many of its people say they are resilient, they will survive, they will rebuild. But signs of desperation are beginning to show. A reporter climbing out of a helicopter is grabbed in a bear hug by a weeping woman in Quebradillas, a cut-off town. The woman doesn't know who the reporter is, but she is a person from the outside, perhaps someone with news of supplies, who can take a message to family, who can offer something.

Floods, storm debris and the ever-present lack of power mean a fleeting phone conversation may be their only link to the rest of the island for some time. Residents in Quebradillas are trying to begin cleanup on their own. The same struggle evident in Quebradillas is playing out across Puerto Rico. Utuado suffered several deaths in the storm itself and saw homes washed away. Rosario Heredia lost her home. She is diabetic and just had surgery. She's still there, hoping for help, from anyone. But so far, no one has come. Utuado residents are using a pipe in the highway to get water for cleaning and drinking. Now this community of 30,000 is turning to a pipe, tapped into a mountain spring alongside a highway, for water. Harry Torres said the water is all they have for cleaning and drinking until help comes. He and his fellow residents are just \"trying to survive.\" \"We're desperate,\" Torres said.

The hurricane brought mudslides here, leaving some unable to get to the highway due to blocked roads or lack of gas. Lydia Rivera has two cars, but no gas and cannot reach that pipe for water. Now she's trying to keep her two grandchildren alive on a ration of crackers and survive on rainwater. In Yauco, already a remote town, all the roads are blocked. The only way in is climbing up a hill, and over many downed trees. Coffee growers Gaspar Rodriguez and Doris Velez have lost just about everything they've worked for. But their biggest worry now is how they will survive. Residents in Utuado, Puerto Rico collect rain water from mountain springs and carry it through streams across broken roads. They are in desperate need of food. Most of what they have has gone bad. In Yabucoa, which took a direct hit, there is no power and residents say they have also been without fresh water for days. The little food in town is being shared by neighbors. Every single part of Puerto Rico took a hit. From the air it looks brown, not the verdant green of the tropical island it is. Nothing is normal and there is little sign of when any sense of normality will return -- from schools opening to hospitals being able to care for the sick. Millions don't know when they'll be able to turn on a tap and get water, or flick the switch and have light or cooler air. San Juan resident Sebasti\u00e1n P\u00e9rez showed CNN how he's surviving without running water and power. His fridge is useless for keeping anything cold and he hasn't driven his car since the storm, wanting to keep the gas for emergencies.

Moore, sporting a cowboy hat and boots, rode a horse named Sassy, while his wife Kayla arrived on a horse named Sundance, according to Getty. Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Moore faces off against Sen. Luther Strange in the special election for Attorney General Jeff Sessions' former seat in the US Senate. Strange currently holds the seat after being appointed by then-Gov. Robert Bentley to finish out Sessions' term; he has the backing of President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Moore is seen as the anti-establishment candidate and has been a lightning rod for controversy. He was removed from his state Supreme Court job twice and has a long history of making highly contentious comments about race and sexual orientation . In 2015, he shared a video promoting the conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim.

The state and local tax deduction is one of many tax breaks under consideration in Washington as a way to offset the cost of tax cuts that the GOP are proposing. The tax break lets tax filers who itemize deductions write off their property taxes as well as their state and local income taxes or general sales taxes. Republican tax negotiators stress how much they want tax reform to help the middle class. And they note that the highest income households tend to benefit most from the state and local deduction. \nThat's true. But an updated study released this week finds that millions in the middle class also could be affected by the repeal of the tax break. \nThe study, conducted by the Government Finance Officers Association using IRS data, found that nearly 40% of tax filers making between $50,000 and $75,000 in 2015 claimed the deduction. That is nearly 7.6 million households. \nOf those making between $75,000 and $100,000 (6.9 million households), 53% claimed it, as did 76% of those making between $100,000 and $200,000 (13.9 million households). \nRelated: Who pays if Congress kills the state and local tax deduction \nSome will argue that a six-figure income up to $200,000 should never be considered \"middle class.\" But the truth is a lot depends on how large your household is and where you're located. A $150,000 income for a family of five in a high-cost, high-tax city, for instance, would most likely be considered middle class for that area. \nConversely, a single person bringing in $75,000 in a low-cost, low-tax city might be considered very well off relatively speaking. \nThe data from the state financial officials doesn't indicate household size in its income breakdown. But an analysis of 2014 IRS data by the Tax Policy Center found that of all itemizers making between $50,000 and $75,000, nearly half were single, while only about a third were single in the $75,000 to $100,000 category, and just 16% were never married in the $100,000 to $200,000 group. \nTax filers in all states would be affected by repeal, including Republican states with no income tax, the report said. For instance, a family of three in Conroe, Texas, making $100,000 saves $2,450 on their federal tax bill because of the state and local tax deduction. \nThat said, it's impossible to know if that family's total tax bill would go up or stay the same because tax reform would involve other changes to the tax code. For instance, Republicans have said they want to double the standard deduction. That could lessen the bite for them of losing the state and local deduction. \nBut the report by the state and local finance officers notes that that might still not be enough to offer them actual tax relief: Even if the standard deduction was tripled, \"a significant portion of taxpayers would still end up with tax increases.\" \nThe group, along with several others representing state and local finance and budget officials, are part of an umbrella group lobbying against repeal. \nAdvocates for preserving the tax break argue that it avoids double taxation on the same income and it helps provide a stronger revenue base for local governments to provide essential services. But those arguing for repeal say the deduction forces people in low-tax states to subsidize people living in high-tax states.

When there's a shortage of water and sanitation issues, it will come out.

The hospital is needing diesel every day -- 2,000 gallons a day. Yesterday, we ran out of diesel at 6 a.m. and we were without electricity at the hospital from 6 a.m. through 2 p.m. Eight hours without electricity.\" Without power, lifesaving machines like ventilators have to run on emergency backup power. Fears for the future are playing out across Puerto Rico. Misery is stalking each and every one of the more than 3 million Americans there. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz sees a growing need for help for increasingly desperate people. \"We are finding dialysis patients that have not been able to contact their providers. We are having to transport them in near-death conditions,\" the mayor said. \"We are finding people whose oxygen tanks are running out because our small generators now don't have any diesel.\" Most alarming are the SOS messages, she said, \"the ones that say 'Can anyone hear me?' The ones that say 'I have no more food and I'm out in the street.'\" Cruz and her teams are out on the streets trying to find the neediest people.

MUST WATCH\nVet in Puerto Rico: Hurricane worse than war 03:23 Combat war veteran Miguel Olivera has less than two days' supply of his lifesaving insulin left . And even that may spoil in his refrigerator with no power. The mayor of his town, Javier Garcia, believes help will come from the mainland and the federal government. The question is when, and whether it will be too late for Olivera and others. Lines of people are hoping to get a flight off the island. The main airport in San Juan is crippled, barely functioning . Those there are hoping to escape a crowded terminal with no air conditioning. On Tuesday, only 10 flights were scheduled. Check-in desks were packed with people waiting in line, hoping for a flight off the island. Fans were running, but keeping no one cool. Hopeful travelers sat in chairs on line and others lay nearby, using their suitcases as pillows. A mother rocked a stroller back and forth to try to calm a child. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was food and water on the way to Puerto Rico and added that he would visit the island next week . Until aid arrives, Garcia and his fellows in Aguas Buenas are reverting to an older way of life -- hacking coconuts to eat and collecting water from mountain streams. But that can only sustain so many for so long. Twenty-first century help is needed for many, like Miguel Olivera, who rely on medication. And the situation can so easily get worse -- mosquito-borne diseases like Zika and Dengue fever are very real fears here. A massive power tower that was toppled in Aguas Buenas will take a helicopter to restore. That's one very obvious problem. But Puerto Rico's power grid was a mess well before the storm and it will be months -- several months -- before electricity is restored across the island.

Gas stations around San Juan do have some supply, but the demand is overwhelming. Long lines of vehicles queue up at the pumps and men with red plastic gas cans wait for up to six hours, hoping to get a few precious gallons. Similar lines grow outside any open grocery store and anywhere that has ice. Lines for gas stretched for hours in many parts of Puerto Rico. It's hot. And it's humid. Temperature were set to rise to the low 90s on Tuesday. Showers are forecast later this week but they will barely make it any cooler. Puerto Rico's leaders and many of its people say they are resilient, they will survive, they will rebuild. But signs of desperation are beginning to show. A reporter climbing out of a helicopter is grabbed in a bear hug by a weeping woman in Quebradillas, a cut-off town. The woman doesn't know who the reporter is, but she is a person from the outside, perhaps someone with news of supplies, who can take a message to family, who can offer something.

Floods, storm debris and the ever-present lack of power mean a fleeting phone conversation may be their only link to the rest of the island for some time. Residents in Quebradillas are trying to begin cleanup on their own. The same struggle evident in Quebradillas is playing out across Puerto Rico. Utuado suffered several deaths in the storm itself and saw homes washed away. Rosario Heredia lost her home. She is diabetic and just had surgery. She's still there, hoping for help, from anyone. But so far, no one has come. Utuado residents are using a pipe in the highway to get water for cleaning and drinking. Now this community of 30,000 is turning to a pipe, tapped into a mountain spring alongside a highway, for water. Harry Torres said the water is all they have for cleaning and drinking until help comes. He and his fellow residents are just \"trying to survive.\" \"We're desperate,\" Torres said.

The hurricane brought mudslides here, leaving some unable to get to the highway due to blocked roads or lack of gas. Lydia Rivera has two cars, but no gas and cannot reach that pipe for water. Now she's trying to keep her two grandchildren alive on a ration of crackers and survive on rainwater. In Yauco, already a remote town, all the roads are blocked. The only way in is climbing up a hill, and over many downed trees. Coffee growers Gaspar Rodriguez and Doris Velez have lost just about everything they've worked for. But their biggest worry now is how they will survive. Residents in Utuado, Puerto Rico collect rain water from mountain springs and carry it through streams across broken roads. They are in desperate need of food. Most of what they have has gone bad. In Yabucoa, which took a direct hit, there is no power and residents say they have also been without fresh water for days. The little food in town is being shared by neighbors. Every single part of Puerto Rico took a hit. From the air it looks brown, not the verdant green of the tropical island it is. Nothing is normal and there is little sign of when any sense of normality will return -- from schools opening to hospitals being able to care for the sick. Millions don't know when they'll be able to turn on a tap and get water, or flick the switch and have light or cooler air. San Juan resident Sebasti\u00e1n P\u00e9rez showed CNN how he's surviving without running water and power. His fridge is useless for keeping anything cold and he hasn't driven his car since the storm, wanting to keep the gas for emergencies.

(CNN) After spending the weekend feuding with football players and trashing Sen.

Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 Just what is wrong with the President's tweets about these areas struggling through a tremendous recovery? Everything. Let's begin with Puerto Rico, an island of 3.4 million American citizens (more than many states) that has been plunged into darkness for the foreseeable future. But it wasn't until Tuesday, six days after Maria hit Puerto Rico, that Trump made a substantive late-to-the-disaster statement during a press conference with the Spanish foreign minister at the White House. Read More \"All available resources, including the military, are being marshaled to save lives,\" he said. And \"we have been really treated very, very nicely by the governor and everyone else.\" He allowed that the people of Puerto Rico \"are important to all of us.\" That would have been more convincing had Trump to that point not been essentially silent about the chaos there, though he did also note in a tweet Monday: \"its old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape was devastated.\" ...It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars.... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 Taken with his , and his vice president's , failure to visit the island thus far (Trump announced Tuesday that he would go next week -- \"some people say, I read it this morning, it's literally destroyed\") this seems to be an attempt to deflect accountability away from his administration's role in the recovery effort. As of Monday, according to an article in New York magazine, party leaders \"were waiting for a formal disaster request from the Trump administration.\" But Trump tweeted on: \"Much of the island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.\" ...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 These comments are unconscionable given that Puerto Rico -- right now -- has limited communication and is on the verge of a massive humanitarian crisis . The island may be without power for months . The devastation there has been described as \" apocalyptic \" -- and Trump is concerned about what the territory owes to Wall Street and the banks? The lack of empathy is staggering. How ironic that in the wake of a catastrophic disaster, our President feels the need to mention what Puerto Rico owes to its creditor banks, particularly given his own history of multiple bankruptcies. Our fellow Americans on the island are facing unprecedented, horrific living conditions and this is what Trump finds noteworthy. Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, and its people are US citizens, although most Americans do not know that. Although they are Americans, Puerto Ricans on the island do not have a voting member of Congress to advocate for their interests. If only they could count on the President to amplify the fact that they need help -- and they need it quickly. Instead, this past weekend it was left for island officials to plead their case directly to the media, and for former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to call for the US Navy to be sent to the island to assist in relief efforts. Sure, Trump did offer, regarding the disasters, that \"food, water, and medical supplies are top priorities.\" The fact that he tweeted these sentiments made them appear an afterthought. Until Tuesday, days after Maria made landfall, Trump did not mention the plight of the US Virgin Islands, which have been virtually destroyed , at all. Congress, help your fellow Americans in Puerto Rico Which brings us to the states Trump DID mention in his tweets \u2014 although it's unclear whether he knew what he was talking about. Mr. President, Texas and Florida are not \"doing great.\" They were doing great before two hurricanes walloped them, but it will be a long time before they are back to pre-Harvey and pre-Irma conditions. In southeast Texas, many families are coping with the loss of their homes and possessions and figuring out how and where to live now. City and state officials are already sparring over how to fund the ongoing cleanup efforts. And according to news reports , relief has come slowly for smaller towns along the Texas coast. Florida is in a similar predicament. The state, especially Miami, was lucky to dodge the full force of a Category 5 hurricane. Still, thousands of people were without power for days, and they, too, are salvaging their lives and getting to work on rebuilding. Thanks to Irma, Florida's tourism, agriculture , and insurance industries are reeling. Sunshine State residents are facing unexpected property damage and financial losses , with many planning to apply for federal assistance. A FEMA disaster recovery center opened in Miami-Dade County just this week. Trump's casual \u2014 and ludicrous \u2014 pronouncement about how \"great\" Texas and Florida are doing after two severe weather events downplays the long road ahead for these states, and amounts to an abuse of his position as chief executive with the power of the bully pulpit. The risk is that the short-attention-span American public and media will soon move on to the next big story and forget about our fellow Americans' suffering. Though it may come as a shock to the President, this is not all about him; just because he has visited Texas and Florida post-storm does not mean things are going well there.

Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke listens to a question during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on Capitol Hill, on June 20, 2017 in Washington. Story highlights \"I got 30% of the crew that's not loyal to the flag,\" Interior Sec. Zinke said Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell called it a \"cheap shot\" Washington (CNN) Sen. Maria Cantwell blasted Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke Tuesday, calling his recent comments questioning his employees' loyalty to the US a \"cheap shot.\" Cantwell, who represents Washington and is the top Democrat on the Senate energy and natural resources committee, said in a statement that Interior Department employees instead \"deserve respect from the man charged with leading them -- not cheap shots in the press.\" Cantwell was reacting to comments Zinke made Monday in a speech to an oil industry group where he said 30% of employees at his department lack loyalty and were at odds with the Trump administration. Hunting is down in the US. The Trump administration wants to change that \"I got 30% of the crew that's not loyal to the flag,\" Zinke said, according to the Associated Press. \"There's too many ways in the present process for someone who doesn't want to get (a regulatory action) done to put it in a holding pattern.\" The Interior Department did not immediately return a request for comment from CNN. Read More \"Secretary's Zinke's comments yesterday betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of federal civil service,\" Cantwell said in a statement. \"They are non-political employees charged with implementing and enforcing laws passed by Congress and have incredible domain expertise in their areas of responsibility. Replacing them with purely political people will not protect our public lands or protect taxpayers from special interest sweetheart deals.\" Since Zinke took on the role of secretary in March to lead the 70,000-employee department, he's worked to cut regulations on public lands including expanding access to hunters and the fossil fuel industry.

The officials would not go beyond saying a small number of assets had been moved by the regime to a known airfield in the eastern part of the country. The move was seen in US satellite imagery and is viewed by the US as a North Korean effort to boost its military readiness in the eastern sector. It would give the aircraft an ability to fly eastward further than its estimated 900-mile range. North Korea accuses Trump of declaring war Imagery so far has observed Mig-29 aircraft at the site. Some missiles and fuel tanks are on the planes, but for now, no single jet is carrying both the external fuel tanks and the missiles. On Monday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho claimed US President Donald Trump had \"declared a war\" on his country, and threatened to shoot down US aircraft flying off its coastline even if they were in international airspace. Read More The United States flew B-1B bombers from Guam in international airspace to the east of North Korea on Saturday, according to US defense officials, in response to Pyongyang's \"reckless behavior.\" Officials said it was the furthest north of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) US bombers had flown in the 21st Century. Both defense officials said that the US maintains sufficient aerial surveillance and radar capability in the region to know if any military aircraft take off from North Korea. The military and North Korea: What you hear and what it means Speaking alongside Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Trump reiterated that the US is \"totally prepared\" if they have to use the military option, saying military action in North Korea would be \"devastating.\" \"If we take that option it will be devastating -- devastating -- for North Korea,\" Trump said in the Rose Garden during a news conference. \"It's called the military option.\" \"He's acting very badly,\" Trump said of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. \"He's saying things that should never ever be said.\" Trump said the US was responding to Kim's provocations, but insisted his replies were merely in response to rhetoric from Pyongyang. He also decried the situation there, saying he was left a \"mess\" by previous administrations. \"I'll fix the mess,\" Trump said. \"We'll see what happens.\" US: We're not at war with North Korea Both the United States and North Korea have been exchanging increasingly fierce rhetoric throughout the past week, against the background of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Threats of war from North Korea's top diplomat came in response to a provocative tweet sent by President Trump on Sunday, in which he said the rogue state \"won't be around much longer.\" Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 \"In light of the declaration of war by Trump, all options will be on the operating table of the Supreme leadership of DPRK,\" Ri said, using the official name for North Korea, according to his official English translator. Could North Korean, US threats of destruction cause an accidental war? But despite the war of words, there has been no outward moves from either countries indicating preparation for an actual conflict. \"North Korea is strongly pushing their soldiers in the DMZ to report first and then take measures,\" South Korean Liberty Korea Party lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said, quoting intelligence services. \"North Korea is being quite careful so that there is no accidental clash.\" Lee said North Korea had taken no immediate action following the US's weekend flyover and possibly had not even been aware of it. \"I heard that the US disclosed its flight route because they thought North Korea appeared to be unaware of it ... their radar probably did not detect strong signals,\" he said.

It is just the latest in a series of changes that have been rippling through Saudi Arabia since the rise of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince, known casually as \"MBS,\" is spearheading an ambitious plan to reform and transform the Saudi economy by 2030 and, in line with that goal, increase the number of women in the workforce. 'A huge step' Ambassador bin Salman described the step as \"part of Vision 2030, which is a huge step toward a brighter future.\" That plan for the country's economic reinvention rests on a number of pillars, including youth empowerment, social organization and women's empowerment, \"which is an extremely important element of the changes happening in Saudi Arabia,\" the ambassador said. \"We are trying to increase women's participation in the workforce,\" bin Salman said. \"In order to change women's participation in the workforce we need them to be able to drive to work,\" said bin Salman, who is a son of the current king and a brother of the crown prince. \"We need them to move forward, we need them to improve our economy.\" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman viists the White House, March 14, 2017. The crown prince, who was appointed by his father to the position in June, is seen as a major power in the country and is expected by many to be named king before too long. Marwa Abdelghani, media fellow at the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told CNN the new laws wouldn't take effect for another year. \"Saudi Arabian women are going to continue fighting and are going to continue running these campaigns to try to overturn these laws,\" she said. \"At the end of the day these laws are showing how Saudi Arabia has been resisting overturning or relinquishing power to over 50 percent of the population.\" Asked by CNN why the announcement was made now, ambassador bin Salman said, \"there is no wrong time to do the right thing.\" He added that \"it's not religious nor a cultural issue\" and said women \"used to use transportation means during my grandfather's era.\" He said that women will not have to get permission from their male guardians to take driving lessons. \"Legally there's nothing that can prevent it,\" the ambassador said, but he acknowledged that \"there might be social issues.\" Above the oil: Inside a gated US compound in Saudi Arabia He said that the choice will be up to women. \"It's not 'women must drive,' it's 'women can drive.' \" The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia follows a strict form of Wahhabi Islam that bans the mixing of sexes at public events and places numerous curbs on women. These restrictions are enforced by religious police whose powers the crown prince has successfully lobbied to curtail since coming to power. His success on that front is evident in the way Saudi Arabia, which is celebrating the 87th anniversary of its creation this month, has recently been easing some restrictions on women. Women were allowed to enter a sports stadium for the first time on September 23, for a special pageant. In May, King Salman decreed that government agencies should list services women can seek without permission from their husbands, fathers or other male guardian. He also ordered organizations to provide transportation for female employees -- a step that eased one hurdle to women's employment given that public transportation is virtually non-existent. Before May, women weren't able to access government services without getting permission from a male guardian or having him present. There have also been some easing of restrictions on women's ability to work in the fields of law and education. In 2015, women were elected to municipal councils for the first time. Members of the Saudi royal family have been signaling an easing on women's ability to drive for months now. In May, Prince Faisal Bin Abdullah, a former education minister, told a privately owned TV channel that he had \"no doubt\" women would one day be able to drive in his country. When Saudi women first defied the driving ban \"Let me tell you about our leadership's view on women,\" he said. \"Never mind driving a car, which is coming, no doubt ... I want her to drive society.\" Another prominent prince, Alwaleed bin Talal, wrote a December blog post that pushed for authorities to allow women to drive , saying that the ban curtailed their rights and hurt the economy because it made it harder for women to work.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. \n(CNN) After spending the weekend feuding with football players and trashing Sen. John McCain , on Monday night President Donald Trump turned his attention to the devastation still faced by several regions in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. \n\"Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,\" he tweeted to his 39 million followers. Texas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble..\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 Just what is wrong with the President's tweets about these areas struggling through a tremendous recovery? Everything. Let's begin with Puerto Rico, an island of 3.4 million American citizens (more than many states) that has been plunged into darkness for the foreseeable future. But it wasn't until Tuesday, six days after Maria hit Puerto Rico, that Trump made a substantive late-to-the-disaster statement during a press conference with the Spanish foreign minister at the White House. Read More \"All available resources, including the military, are being marshaled to save lives,\" he said. And \"we have been really treated very, very nicely by the governor and everyone else.\" He allowed that the people of Puerto Rico \"are important to all of us.\" That would have been more convincing had Trump to that point not been essentially silent about the chaos there, though he did also note in a tweet Monday: \"its old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape was devastated.\" ...It's old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars....\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 Taken with his , and his vice president's , failure to visit the island thus far (Trump announced Tuesday that he would go next week -- \"some people say, I read it this morning, it's literally destroyed\") this seems to be an attempt to deflect accountability away from his administration's role in the recovery effort. As of Monday, according to an article in New York magazine, party leaders \"were waiting for a formal disaster request from the Trump administration.\" But Trump tweeted on: \"Much of the island was destroyed, with billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with.\" ...owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well. #FEMA \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 These comments are unconscionable given that Puerto Rico -- right now -- has limited communication and is on the verge of a massive humanitarian crisis . The island may be without power for months . The devastation there has been described as \" apocalyptic \" -- and Trump is concerned about what the territory owes to Wall Street and the banks? The lack of empathy is staggering. How ironic that in the wake of a catastrophic disaster, our President feels the need to mention what Puerto Rico owes to its creditor banks, particularly given his own history of multiple bankruptcies. Our fellow Americans on the island are facing unprecedented, horrific living conditions and this is what Trump finds noteworthy. Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States, and its people are US citizens, although most Americans do not know that. Although they are Americans, Puerto Ricans on the island do not have a voting member of Congress to advocate for their interests. If only they could count on the President to amplify the fact that they need help -- and they need it quickly. Instead, this past weekend it was left for island officials to plead their case directly to the media, and for former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to call for the US Navy to be sent to the island to assist in relief efforts. Sure, Trump did offer, regarding the disasters, that \"food, water, and medical supplies are top priorities.\" The fact that he tweeted these sentiments made them appear an afterthought. Until Tuesday, days after Maria made landfall, Trump did not mention the plight of the US Virgin Islands, which have been virtually destroyed , at all. Congress, help your fellow Americans in Puerto Rico Which brings us to the states Trump DID mention in his tweets \u2014 although it's unclear whether he knew what he was talking about. Mr. President, Texas and Florida are not \"doing great.\" They were doing great before two hurricanes walloped them, but it will be a long time before they are back to pre-Harvey and pre-Irma conditions. In southeast Texas, many families are coping with the loss of their homes and possessions and figuring out how and where to live now. City and state officials are already sparring over how to fund the ongoing cleanup efforts. And according to news reports , relief has come slowly for smaller towns along the Texas coast. Florida is in a similar predicament. The state, especially Miami, was lucky to dodge the full force of a Category 5 hurricane. Still, thousands of people were without power for days, and they, too, are salvaging their lives and getting to work on rebuilding. Thanks to Irma, Florida's tourism, agriculture , and insurance industries are reeling. Sunshine State residents are facing unexpected property damage and financial losses , with many planning to apply for federal assistance. A FEMA disaster recovery center opened in Miami-Dade County just this week. Trump's casual \u2014 and ludicrous \u2014 pronouncement about how \"great\" Texas and Florida are doing after two severe weather events downplays the long road ahead for these states, and amounts to an abuse of his position as chief executive with the power of the bully pulpit. The risk is that the short-attention-span American public and media will soon move on to the next big story and forget about our fellow Americans' suffering. Though it may come as a shock to the President, this is not all about him; just because he has visited Texas and Florida post-storm does not mean things are going well there. JUST WATCHED Puerto Rico Gov.: There will be mass exodus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nPuerto Rico Gov.: There will be mass exodus 00:42 In contrast to the very personal ways that Trump often engages in Twitter when he is on the attack, his tweets about storm damage in the country he leads, particularly when it comes to Puerto Rico, have an oddly impassive tone, as though he were an observer. Yet he is the chief executive, with the power to elevate a national discussion or issue, literally, at his fingertips. That he has taken nearly a week to do so in the case of Puerto Rico only adds to the perception that he cares little about Latinos ; no wonder 67% of Latinos disapprove of the job he is doing as President. Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands all deserve continuing attention and concern from our President.

It is just the latest in a series of changes that have been rippling through Saudi Arabia since the rise of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince, known casually as \"MBS,\" is spearheading an ambitious plan to reform and transform the Saudi economy by 2030 and, in line with that goal, increase the number of women in the workforce. 'A huge step' Ambassador bin Salman described the step as \"part of Vision 2030, which is a huge step toward a brighter future.\" That plan for the country's economic reinvention rests on a number of pillars, including youth empowerment, social organization and women's empowerment, \"which is an extremely important element of the changes happening in Saudi Arabia,\" the ambassador said. \"We are trying to increase women's participation in the workforce,\" bin Salman said. \"In order to change women's participation in the workforce we need them to be able to drive to work,\" said bin Salman, who is a son of the current king and a brother of the crown prince. \"We need them to move forward, we need them to improve our economy.\" Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman viists the White House, March 14, 2017. The crown prince, who was appointed by his father to the position in June, is seen as a major power in the country and is expected by many to be named king before too long. Marwa Abdelghani, media fellow at the Muslim Public Affairs Council, told CNN the new laws wouldn't take effect for another year. \"Saudi Arabian women are going to continue fighting and are going to continue running these campaigns to try to overturn these laws,\" she said. \"At the end of the day these laws are showing how Saudi Arabia has been resisting overturning or relinquishing power to over 50 percent of the population.\" Asked by CNN why the announcement was made now, ambassador bin Salman said, \"there is no wrong time to do the right thing.\" He added that \"it's not religious nor a cultural issue\" and said women \"used to use transportation means during my grandfather's era.\" He said that women will not have to get permission from their male guardians to take driving lessons. \"Legally there's nothing that can prevent it,\" the ambassador said, but he acknowledged that \"there might be social issues.\" Above the oil: Inside a gated US compound in Saudi Arabia He said that the choice will be up to women. \"It's not 'women must drive,' it's 'women can drive.' \" The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia follows a strict form of Wahhabi Islam that bans the mixing of sexes at public events and places numerous curbs on women. These restrictions are enforced by religious police whose powers the crown prince has successfully lobbied to curtail since coming to power. His success on that front is evident in the way Saudi Arabia, which is celebrating the 87th anniversary of its creation this month, has recently been easing some restrictions on women. Women were allowed to enter a sports stadium for the first time on September 23, for a special pageant. In May, King Salman decreed that government agencies should list services women can seek without permission from their husbands, fathers or other male guardian. He also ordered organizations to provide transportation for female employees -- a step that eased one hurdle to women's employment given that public transportation is virtually non-existent. Before May, women weren't able to access government services without getting permission from a male guardian or having him present. There have also been some easing of restrictions on women's ability to work in the fields of law and education. In 2015, women were elected to municipal councils for the first time. Members of the Saudi royal family have been signaling an easing on women's ability to drive for months now. In May, Prince Faisal Bin Abdullah, a former education minister, told a privately owned TV channel that he had \"no doubt\" women would one day be able to drive in his country. When Saudi women first defied the driving ban \"Let me tell you about our leadership's view on women,\" he said. \"Never mind driving a car, which is coming, no doubt ... I want her to drive society.\" Another prominent prince, Alwaleed bin Talal, wrote a December blog post that pushed for authorities to allow women to drive , saying that the ban curtailed their rights and hurt the economy because it made it harder for women to work. In 2013, a campaign to defy the government ban on women driving saw dozens get behind the wheel and post photos of themselves driving on social media. They were quickly cut short by authorities and several spoke to CNN about their fear of retaliation in the aftermath.

It would give the aircraft an ability to fly eastward further than its estimated 900-mile range. North Korea accuses Trump of declaring war Imagery so far has observed Mig-29 aircraft at the site. Some missiles and fuel tanks are on the planes, but for now, no single jet is carrying both the external fuel tanks and the missiles. On Monday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho claimed US President Donald Trump had \"declared a war\" on his country, and threatened to shoot down US aircraft flying off its coastline even if they were in international airspace. Read More The United States flew B-1B bombers from Guam in international airspace to the east of North Korea on Saturday, according to US defense officials, in response to Pyongyang's \"reckless behavior.\" Officials said it was the furthest north of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) US bombers had flown in the 21st Century. Both defense officials said that the US maintains sufficient aerial surveillance and radar capability in the region to know if any military aircraft take off from North Korea. The military and North Korea: What you hear and what it means Speaking alongside Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, Trump reiterated that the US is \"totally prepared\" if they have to use the military option, saying military action in North Korea would be \"devastating.\" \"If we take that option it will be devastating -- devastating -- for North Korea,\" Trump said in the Rose Garden during a news conference. \"It's called the military option.\" \"He's acting very badly,\" Trump said of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un. \"He's saying things that should never ever be said.\" Trump said the US was responding to Kim's provocations, but insisted his replies were merely in response to rhetoric from Pyongyang. He also decried the situation there, saying he was left a \"mess\" by previous administrations. \"I'll fix the mess,\" Trump said. \"We'll see what happens.\" US: We're not at war with North Korea Both the United States and North Korea have been exchanging increasingly fierce rhetoric throughout the past week, against the background of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Threats of war from North Korea's top diplomat came in response to a provocative tweet sent by President Trump on Sunday, in which he said the rogue state \"won't be around much longer.\" Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 \"In light of the declaration of war by Trump, all options will be on the operating table of the Supreme leadership of DPRK,\" Ri said, using the official name for North Korea, according to his official English translator. The Trump White House quickly dismissed the idea that war had been declared, with Press Secretary Sarah Sanders saying Monday the idea was \"absurd.\" Could North Korean, US threats of destruction cause an accidental war? But despite the war of words, there has been no outward moves from either countries indicating preparation for an actual conflict. \"North Korea is strongly pushing their soldiers in the DMZ to report first and then take measures,\" South Korean Liberty Korea Party lawmaker Lee Cheol-woo said, quoting intelligence services. \"North Korea is being quite careful so that there is no accidental clash.\" Lee said North Korea had taken no immediate action following the US's weekend flyover and possibly had not even been aware of it. \"I heard that the US disclosed its flight route because they thought North Korea appeared to be unaware of it ... their radar probably did not detect strong signals,\" he said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mariano rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "imagery", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rose garden", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T23:01:53.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d7efc90564ccfb545a841a4622bc32b789574000", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEJdhbOUGVg7dy0Ax5iWrIelpwLl.uJGJGZzXWIB_RnUjdjpzPCpaClrU0wzavw6rhlrwXc.PTK3A--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Suited-up groom jumps into a lake to save a drowning child - CNN", "title_full": "Suited-up groom jumps into a lake to save a drowning child - CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926113518-03-heroic-groom-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 8, "comments": 0, "shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d7efc90564ccfb545a841a4622bc32b789574000", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEJdhbOUGVg7dy0Ax5iWrIelpwLl.uJGJGZzXWIB_RnUjdjpzPCpaClrU0wzavw6rhlrwXc.PTK3A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Laura Diaz-Zuniga, CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Suited-up groom jumps into a lake to save a drowning child - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Not all heroes wear capes.

The billionaire Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) founder told Fox News Sunday's Chris Wallace he recently switched to a mobile device that runs Google's Android software. The company officially killed off its Windows Phone line and software in July, due largely to dwindling consumer interest and a lackluster app store. In the first quarter of 2017, Windows Phones' market share was 0.1%, according to a May report from market intelligence firm IDC. \nNow, Gates haspresumablyput his own device aside in favor of another. \nWhile Gates didn't say which phone he uses, he said it has \"a lot of Microsoft software.\" \n\"So, no iPhone?\" Wallace asked. \n\"No iPhone,\" Gates said. \nRelated: Bill Gates: Sorry about Control-Alt-Delete \nApple and Microsoft have been at odds for years. Its fierce competition goes back decades and was often showcased in TV ads, such as Apple's famous \"I'm a Mac\" and \"I'm a PC\" commercials. More recently, Microsoft has gone after Apple customers with products like the Surface Studio intended for designers. \nGates said it's \"great\" Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) is continuing to do good work, but noted he still uses all Windows-based PCs. In the interview, he praisedlate Apple founder Steve Jobs, despite their famous rivalry. \nRelated: Why Bill and Melinda Gates are spending a lot of time in Washington \n\"The relationship I had with Steve had every aspect you can imagine. Particularly in the last few years, our friendship -- which had always been there -- was greatly strengthened as he was dealing with cancer,\" Gates told Wallace. \"He and I had a lot in common ... Steve was a genius. Absolutely amazing.\" \nRelated: How these young founders define success \nHe also credited Jobs with helping to spur competition in the sector. \n\"The competition in the software and IT space that Steve helped foster, it's phenomenal. And Microsoft's a big part of that. It's been a miraculous industry that he and I got to work in,\" Gates said. \nSeparately, Microsoft on Tuesday announced Microsoft Office 2019 will be available in the second half of next year. The big update will have more IT features and server upgrades to improve usability, voice and security, according to the tech giant.

Bob Corker was in the running to be secretary of state The Tennessee Republican first joined the US Senate in 2007 (CNN) Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker said Tuesday he will retire at the end of 2018.\n\"After much thought, consideration and family discussion over the past year, Elizabeth and I have decided that I will leave the United States Senate when my term expires at the end of 2018,\" Corker said in a released statement. Corker is the Senate's foreign relations committee chairman and had told CNN earlier this month that he was considering whether to run agai n. \"When I ran for the Senate in 2006, I told people that I couldn't imagine serving for more than two terms,\" Corker said in his statement Tuesday. \"Understandably, as we have gained influence, that decision has become more difficult. But I have always been drawn to the citizen legislator model, and while I realize it is not for everyone, I believe with the kind of service I provide, it is the right one for me.\" Corker, who was at one time among those considered a candidate to be President Donald Trump's secretary of state, had been increasingly critical of the President in recent months. Read More \"The President has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful,\" Corker said last month, according to a video posted by local news website Nooga.com , in reference to Trump's handling of violence related to a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Trump and his press secretary responded with their own criticism. Corker later said he had a \"strong\" relationship with the President, and the two had a meeting at the White House on September 15. But sources familiar with private conversations between Trump and Corker told CNN the two made up since their August fight, and that the President wanted Corker to run for reelection. RELATED: Donald Trump met with Bob Corker on Friday. Here's a look back at their relationship Corker, 65, had been struggling and weighing the decision for months. The Tennessee Republican has gained prominence in the Senate as an outspoken leader on not just foreign relations, but also on domestic issues. He's also well-connected to GOP leadership and is only in his second term. In his statement Tuesday, Corker said that he believed \"the most important public service\" he had to offer would come in upcoming months. \"I want to be able to do that as thoughtfully and independently as I did the first 10 years and nine months of my Senate career,\" Corker said. \"Serving the people of Tennessee in this capacity has been the greatest privilege of my life. And as I spent the month of August traveling across our great state, I was reminded that we live in a unique place full of people who care deeply about the direction of our country.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bob corker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "elizabeth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us senate", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "tennessee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "virginia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-26T23:19:36.008+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c585f7b709c3bea5fbabc82aea6d42610da73edc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INxPQ9z6iAbTiEa9pg7C8iJkiLTnVMKiGrmZ.kj.5vDgWxby6yBpwKYxkQ9EdRW6nY7oj6BEiPUlo-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_freevideo", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "'Fixer Upper' will end after season five", "title_full": "'Fixer Upper' will end after season five", "published": "2017-09-26T23:17:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926161109-fixer-upper-ending-orig-lc-00001519-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 73, "comments": 0, "shares": 73}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c585f7b709c3bea5fbabc82aea6d42610da73edc", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INxPQ9z6iAbTiEa9pg7C8iJkiLTnVMKiGrmZ.kj.5vDgWxby6yBpwKYxkQ9EdRW6nY7oj6BEiPUlo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-26T23:17:00.000+03:00", "title": "'Fixer Upper' will end after season five", "text": "MUST WATCH 'Fixer Upper' will end after season five HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines announce the final season of \"Fixer Upper\" will begin in November.

The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease.\n\"This is something new,\" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the study . McKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center. An early step in the right direction McKee also cautioned that this is still early research. \"The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,\" she said. Attorney: Tests show Aaron Hernandez had CTE CTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain. Read More In this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. \"Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,\" said McKee. More exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11 The paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported. CTE found in 99% of studied brains from deceased NFL players Although there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE. \"The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,\" said McKee. \"It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,\" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002. While Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. \"This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,\" he said. While it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. \"This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease ] , but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,\" said McKee. Previous studies have evaluated other potential biomarkers for CTE, including identifying the protein tau using brain imaging. 110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE A recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive. Join\nCTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler , to name a few. In 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma.

In a statement, the Irish government said the referendum would be held in May or June 2018, just months before Pope Francis is due to visit the Catholic-majority country. Ireland's abortion laws are drawn from the 8th amendment to the country's constitution, which places the right to life of an unborn child on equal footing with the right to life of the mother. Ireland's Prime Minister, or Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who came to power in June, pledged to hold a referendum following the non-binding recommendations of a Citizen's Assembly. The group heard harrowing testimony from scores of Irish women and received more than 13,000 individual submissions . In Tuesday's statement, Varadkar said the Citizen's Assembly report was \"currently being considered\" by a parliamentary committee. The precise timetable for the referendum would be defined in legislation that would be brought forward. Read More \"A Bill to amend the Constitution will be prepared in light of the committee's report, and subject to its passage by the Houses of the Oireachtas (Parliament), a referendum will be held in May or June of 2018.\" Varadkar has generally expressed conservative views on abortion, although he has suggested the 8th amendment is too restrictive. \"Any amendment to our Constitution requires careful consideration by the people,\" he said Tuesday. \"They should be given ample time to consider the issues and to take part in well-informed public debate.\" A growing movement Calls to \"Repeal the 8th\" have been steadily growing for years. In March, thousands of activists brought Dublin to a halt during the Strike 4 Repeal rally. #Strike4Repeal: Ireland protests abortion ban on International Women's Day This Saturday, organizers expect tens of thousands to demonstrate in the Irish capital at the sixth annual March for Choice. Many local abortion rights activists applauded Tuesday's announcement, but noted that the terms of the referendum might only be a first step for the repeal movement. Linda Kavanagh, spokesperson for the Abortion Rights Campaign told CNN: \"We welcome the news that the referendum will be in the first half of the 2018. We have all waited long enough to be allowed to make decisions about our own bodies.\" \"However we reserve judgment until we see the wording of the referendum...We fear that the wording of a referendum will offer only very limited abortion access and repeat the failures of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.\" Almost 4,000 Irish women, including women from Northern Ireland, traveled to England and Wales to terminate their pregnancies in 2016, according to UK government statistics . \"We need broad-based legislation so that real and realistic access is given, otherwise thousands will still travel or break the law by importing and taking abortion pills.

(Opinion) - CNN", "text": "Story highlights Michael D'Antonio: A president is measured by his ability to achieve policy goals, unite the nation and maintain America's standing But as Trump's NFL comments prove, he measures success by the amount of media coverage he receives, writes D'Antonio Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book \" Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success \" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. \n(CNN) Proving he considers the presidency similar to his previous job as the host of a \"Lord of the Flies\"-style reality show, Donald Trump said in a Monday night dinner that he was thrilled by the response to his recent race-baiting performance in Alabama. As CNN's Jim Acosta reports , Trump was energized by the effects of his speech, which wounded many of his fellow citizens. \n\"It's really caught on. It's really caught on,\" he reportedly explained to dinner guests. \"I said what millions of Americans were thinking.\" He echoed that sentiment in his Tuesday press conference. Setting aside what millions of Americans may or may not think, Trump's sense that he succeeded because the press is talking about his performance ignores the fact that media coverage is not the measure of a president's success. Achieving certain policy goals, unifying the nation with calls to grace and maintaining America's standing in the world -- three objectives which many of his predecessors strived for -- determine how history writes about presidencies. Trump's gut knows that America agrees with him on NFL controversy Thus far, our 45th President has failed on all counts. He has succeeded, however, in showing that he is the man he has always been -- selfish and bombastic -- and incapable of growing into the responsibilities of the job he now has. The deficiencies of character and intellect that limit the President have been evident throughout his life. This is a man who cried \" reverse discrimination \" when he was asked to obey fair housing laws in the 1970s. He then cast doubt on the tribal identities of American Indians in the 1990s. And he also spent several years in the pursuit of proof that Barack Obama wasn't a legitimate president, an effort that well-known Republicans Michael Steele and Colin Powell deemed racist. Read More In these and many others instances, Trump chose to appeal to the most bigoted parts of Americans' hearts -- and based on a calculation that enough people would support him to make the bigotry worthwhile. In Alabama, the President, who was there to campaign for a Republican senate candidate, veered off his campaign speech. Speaking to a largely white crowd in a state with a tragic history of racism, he chastised a handful of football players who respectfully knelt during the National Anthem. Notably, most of those players are African-American. And while they are concerned about the number of unarmed black men killed in encounters with police, they are also seeking a broader discussion of the longstanding problems of racism and discrimination. Finally, a reason to watch the NFL again Trump ignored their motivations and the quiet nature of their protest, though, choosing to frame it as an unpatriotic attack. \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b-- off the field right now?'\" he said . \"Out. He's fired. He's fired!\" Trump's use of the word \"fired\" echoed the catchphrase he deployed during every episode of his program, \"The Apprentice.\" On the show, Trump's catchphrase was always delivered in a lowered tone of voice, and he used this device in Alabama, where his second \"he's fired\" came with an added growl for theatrical effect. And while other television performers, like Jaleel White, who played Steve Urkel on \"Family Matters,\" consider these catchphrases a potential handicap in future employment, Trump has embraced it. (Urkel, if you don't remember, was famous for saying \"Did I do that?\" in a nasally, high pitched voice.) In fact, Trump loves his catchphrase so much that he looks for opportunities to use it and revels in its delivery. If we set aside the fact that Trump is President and view him as the selfish man that he is, we can begin to make sense of his recent behavior. Throughout his career, Trump has played the same bombastic character -- it's what made him a billionaire and ultimately our President. But none of the theatrics that made him so powerful prepared him for the challenges of governing, which to date include a failed health care plan and an increasingly aggressive investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. Trump's ugly battles with the NFL go way back Not surprisingly, Trump is miserable . But rather than acknowledge his mistakes, he is willing to blame everyone else, from Senator John McCain, who opposes repeal and replace, to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation. A more considerate man in Trump's position would reflect on his condition and change his ways. Other presidents -- Bill Clinton comes to mind -- stumbled badly at the start of their presidencies, but learned to do better. The trouble is that Trump has never been the type to learn something new. Thus, he seeks refuge in the company of people who love his divisive attitude and seemingly support him unconditionally. Like Trump, these people don't want to hear their assumptions and prejudices challenged. They like it when Trump tweets about others who are \"disrespecting our Flag & Country.\" The message is clear -- we own the nation and its symbols. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \nIn time, perhaps when he seeks re-election, Trump may discover that playing to prejudice and dividing a nation that actually gave his opponent the popular vote is a losing proposition. But for now, we can expect more of the same, because this is not a man who has ever demonstrated generosity of spirit or a willingness to work on himself. As the presidency is debased and devalued, those who don't think like Trump's \"millions\" are challenged to maintain hope. In \"Groundhog Day\" fashion, he delivers constant reminders that he is incapable of doing better.

Why was the FBI so focused on keeping Congress in the dark?

The FBI only turned information over to the counsel's office on the grounds it wouldn't be shared with Congress, per the agreement, according to Grassley. Read More The Office of Special Counsel declined to comment. \"Nondisclosure agreements are essentially gag orders -- plain and simple,\" Grassley said. \"They thwart transparency, accountability and seek to obstruct congressional oversight.\" Grassley referenced \"two heavily redacted witness interviews\" the committee obtained that suggested Comey had begun drafting his Clinton statement in advance. He added this is the first time OSC recalled this happening with the FBI or any agency. He reiterated his request for the FBI to turn over all witness interviews and documents related to Comey's decisionmaking on the statement he ultimately delivered mid-campaign clearing Clinton while still calling her behavior deeply concerning.

He's also well-connected to GOP leadership and is only in his second term. In his statement Tuesday, Corker said that he believed \"the most important public service\" he had to offer would come in upcoming months. \"I want to be able to do that as thoughtfully and independently as I did the first 10 years and nine months of my Senate career,\" Corker said. \"Serving the people of Tennessee in this capacity has been the greatest privilege of my life.

In a statement Monday night , Marie Tillman said she hopes her husband inspires Americans to unite \"The very action of self expression and the freedom to speak from one's heart -- no matter those views -- is what Pat and so many other Americans have given their lives for,\" she wrote. Here are five things to remember about Patrick Daniel Tillman: Read More He was small but fierce Arizona State's Pat Tillman assists on a tackle during a November 1996 game against in-state rival Arizona. After leading his San Jose, California, high school to a championship, he attended Arizona State University on a scholarship. At 5-foot-11, he was considered too small to play linebacker at a Division I school, but he proved his detractors wrong. While racking up a bevy of awards for academics, his prowess on the gridiron also earned him accolades. He played four seasons, helping lead his undefeated Sun Devils to the Rose Bowl his junior year. After his senior season in 1997 -- during which he racked up 93 tackles, 15 of them for a loss -- he was named the Pac-10 Conference defensive player of the year, an award that now bears his name. An Academic All-American, he graduated Summa Cum Laude, with a bachelor's degree in marketing, in 3\u00bd years. Cardinals took him with 226th pick Arizona Cardinals safety Tillman smiles during pregame warm-ups in Tempe, Arizona, in 2000. The seventh round of the NFL draft is not generally where teams find premier talent, but Tillman moved to the safety position and defied expectations again, playing in all 48 games for the Arizona Cardinals during his first three seasons, and starting in 27 of them. In 2000, he tallied more than 140 tackles along with a handful of turnovers and quarterback sacks. After the 2001 season, which coincided with the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, Tillman turned down an offer from the Cardinals that would've paid him about $1.2 million year. He opted instead to join the Army for about $1,000 a month, according to reports at the time . He joined the Army with his brother Tillman joined the Army just weeks after returning from his honeymoon with high school sweetheart Marie Tillman. Tillman had two younger brothers, Kevin and Richard. Pat Tillman wasn't the only brother to forgo a career in pro sports to serve his country. Kevin gave up the prospect of a career with the Cleveland Indians, where he played second base in the team's minor league system. After returning from his honeymoon in the spring of 2002, Pat Tillman told the Cardinals he would put his NFL career on hold to join Kevin. They enlisted together on May 31, 2002. The brothers finished basic training together before completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program and joining the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment in Fort Lewis, Washington . They later took part in Operation Iraqi Freedom before returning to Fort Benning, Georgia, where they graduated from Ranger School. After his brother was killed in Afghanistan, Kevin Tillman accompanied Pat Tillman's body back to the United States, according to reports. Army didn't reveal friendly fire initially Tillman, shown in this June 2003 photo, was killed in Afghanistan in 2004. The initial claim was that Tillman died in an ambush outside the village of Sperah, near Afghanistan's border with Pakistan. He received a Silver Star and Purple Heart, and was posthumously promoted. Twenty-six days after his memorial service, amid heavy criticism from Tillman's parents and brother Kevin, the Army publicly acknowledged that Tillman had died from friendly fire while returning to support members of his platoon from whom he and other Rangers had been separated. He died April 22, 2004 , after being shot in the head three times by US soldiers who had mistaken him for the enemy. Later investigations and congressional inquiries included witnesses who said several soldiers and brass were immediately aware of the circumstances, and some sought to cover them up.

The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease. \n\"This is something new,\" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the study . McKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center. An early step in the right direction McKee also cautioned that this is still early research. \"The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,\" she said. Attorney: Tests show Aaron Hernandez had CTE CTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain. Read More In this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. \"Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,\" said McKee. More exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11 The paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported. CTE found in 99% of studied brains from deceased NFL players Although there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE. \"The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,\" said McKee. \"It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,\" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002. While Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. \"This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,\" he said. While it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. \"This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease ] , but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,\" said McKee. Previous studies have evaluated other potential biomarkers for CTE, including identifying the protein tau using brain imaging. 110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE A recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive.

Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler , to name a few. In 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma.

Ireland's abortion laws are drawn from the 8th amendment to the country's constitution, which places the right to life of an unborn child on equal footing with the right to life of the mother. Ireland's Prime Minister, or Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who came to power in June, pledged to hold a referendum following the non-binding recommendations of a Citizen's Assembly. The group heard harrowing testimony from scores of Irish women and received more than 13,000 individual submissions . Report: Irish girl seeking abortion sent to psychiatric clinic instead In Tuesday's statement, Varadkar said the Citizen's Assembly report was \"currently being considered\" by a parliamentary committee. The precise timetable for the referendum would be defined in legislation that would be brought forward. Read More \"A Bill to amend the Constitution will be prepared in light of the committee's report, and subject to its passage by the Houses of the Oireachtas (Parliament), a referendum will be held in May or June of 2018.\" Varadkar has generally expressed conservative views on abortion, although he has suggested the 8th amendment is too restrictive. \"Any amendment to our Constitution requires careful consideration by the people,\" he said Tuesday. \"They should be given ample time to consider the issues and to take part in well-informed public debate.\" A growing movement Calls to \"Repeal the 8th\" have been steadily growing for years. In March, thousands of activists brought Dublin to a halt during the Strike 4 Repeal rally. #Strike4Repeal: Ireland protests abortion ban on International Women's Day This Saturday, organizers expect tens of thousands to demonstrate in the Irish capital at the sixth annual March for Choice. Many local abortion rights activists applauded Tuesday's announcement, but noted that the terms of the referendum might only be a first step for the repeal movement. Linda Kavanagh, spokesperson for the Abortion Rights Campaign told CNN: \"We welcome the news that the referendum will be in the first half of the 2018. We have all waited long enough to be allowed to make decisions about our own bodies.\" \"However we reserve judgment until we see the wording of the referendum...We fear that the wording of a referendum will offer only very limited abortion access and repeat the failures of the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act.\" Almost 4,000 Irish women, including women from Northern Ireland, traveled to England and Wales to terminate their pregnancies in 2016, according to UK government statistics . \"We need broad-based legislation so that real and realistic access is given, otherwise thousands will still travel or break the law by importing and taking abortion pills. It is vital that the government realize that the 30,000 plus people who take to the streets on Saturday for the March for Choice are doing it because they want free, safe and legal abortion access,\" Kavanagh added.

That's more than the number of people who live there, but others outside the zone are also fleeing to evacuation centers on the island, according to the Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency. The official exclusion zone extends 12 kilometers from Mount Agung, which is based on last time the volcano erupted in 1963. People wait inside an evacuation centre in Klungkung regency, on the Indonesian resort island of Bali on September 25, 2017. Then, more than 1,700 people were killed and many villages destroyed, though at that stage there was no early warning system. Around 1,700 houses on the mountain's slopes were destroyed. Read More This time, officials aren't taking any chances. Villagers have been asked to leave the exclusion zone, however visitors are being told it's still safe to go to popular tourist areas south of the volcano. Here's some advice for travelers. Should you cancel your trip? Bali is still a safe destination, according to government and airline officials. \"Denpasar City and most of the touristic destinations in Bali are safe from the eruption or dangerous impact of the eruption,\" Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of Information and data of Indonesian National Disaster Management Agency, said. Travelers should stay away from the exclusion zone and check with their airline or travel agency before traveling. Will flights be affected? Aircraft have been advised to avoid the area but so far no flights have been canceled. Bali International Airport will likely be closed in the case of an eruption, but it'll depend on whether volcanic material is considered to be a hazard to flights. How close is it to holiday destinations? The most dangerous area is within the radial of 12 kilometers from the Mount Agung peak where all activities are closed -- including Pura Besakih, Bali's biggest and holiest Hindu temple located on the slopes of Mount Agung. Bali's artistic hub, the small town of Ubud, is about 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Mount Agung. Denpasar (where the airport is located) and the popular Kuta Beach are more than 63 kilometers (40 miles) from the active volcano. In case of a big eruption, the danger zone could be expanded. A man monitors seismic waves at the Mount Agung monitoring station in Karangasem, September 23. How likely is an eruption? It's hard to tell, experts say. \"Even with all the signs and calculation we have today no one can tell when is the eruption will occur,\" said Surono, an expert of volcanology and former head of Indonesia Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Center.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Story highlights Grassley was referencing the FBI entering a nondisclosure agreement with the Office of Special Counsel Feinstein also revealed that she had asked the CIA to turn over relevant classified intelligence Washington (CNN) The leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday escalated their feud with the FBI and Justice Department, accusing the bureau of obstructing their ability to investigate the firing and actions of former Director James Comey. Republican Chairman Chuck Grassley excoriated the FBI for putting in place what he said amounted to \"gag orders,\" demanding the bureau turn over what his committee has asked for regarding Comey, his firing and statements he made publicly during the campaign about the investigation into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email server. \"Why now? Why was the FBI so focused on keeping Congress in the dark? Why is it so afraid of shining the light of day on the controversial decisions Mr. Comey made in the months before he was fired?\" Grassley said at the beginning of a hearing on legislation that would protect special counsels. Grassley and Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein have flexed their muscle on possibly subpoenaing witnesses and documents related to Russian interference in the election and any possible obstruction of justice. White House stonewalls Capitol Hill over records in Russia probe Grassley was specifically referencing the move by the FBI to enter into a nondisclosure agreement with the Office of Special Counsel before turning over information related to a personnel investigation of him by the Office of Special Counsel (which is unrelated to Special Counsel Robert Mueller.) The FBI only turned information over to the counsel's office on the grounds it wouldn't be shared with Congress, per the agreement, according to Grassley. Read More The Office of Special Counsel declined to comment. \"Nondisclosure agreements are essentially gag orders -- plain and simple,\" Grassley said. \"They thwart transparency, accountability and seek to obstruct congressional oversight.\" Grassley referenced \"two heavily redacted witness interviews\" the committee obtained that suggested Comey had begun drafting his Clinton statement in advance. He added this is the first time OSC recalled this happening with the FBI or any agency. He reiterated his request for the FBI to turn over all witness interviews and documents related to Comey's decisionmaking on the statement he ultimately delivered mid-campaign clearing Clinton while still calling her behavior deeply concerning. Chuck Grassley preparing subpoenas for two FBI officials \"The executive branch cannot avoid congressional oversight by assigning agreements,\" Grassley said. \"If there's any whiff of partisan or political influence in these institutions under any president or any party, this committee has a responsibility to get to the bottom of it.\" Feinstein said she agreed with the \"general thrust\" of what Grassley said -- and said she had asked the CIA to turn over classified intelligence that she believes is relevant to the committee's work. Feinstein noted she sent a letter to CIA Director Mike Pompeo, co-signed by Grassley, on Monday asking for the Judiciary Committee to have access to materials given to the Senate Intelligence Committee for its Russian election interference investigation that she has reviewed from her position on that committee. \"I have been privy to certain pieces of intelligence ... that when I saw it, it was relevant to this committee's oversight and yet this committee cannot receive it,\" Feinstein said.

Joseph Dunford, told Congress Tuesday China is likely to be the \"greatest threat\" of any foe to the US within a decade. \"I think China probably poses the greatest threat to our nation by about 2025,\" Dunford told the Senate Armed Services Committee during a hearing on his re-appointment as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Dunford was responding to a question from Hawaii Democrat Sen. Mazie Hirono, who noted that the general had previously identified Russia, followed by China and North Korea, as representing the greatest military threats to US national security during a 2015 appearance before the same committee. But on Tuesday Dunford took the opportunity to reshuffle his list of national security concerns, saying that North Korea now \"poses the greatest threat today\" due to the \"sense of urgency\" involved as Pyongyang's develops its nuclear and missile programs. Trump warns of 'devastating' military option as North Korea moves jets He also said that Russia remained the greatest threat overall due to its military capabilities in the realms of nuclear weapons and electronic warfare as well as Russian military activity in places like Crimea, which it invaded and annexed in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where Western officials accuse Moscow of backing armed separatists. Read More However, Dunford said that China would become the greatest threat by 2025. \"If I look out to 2025, and I look at the demographics and the economic situation, I think China probably poses the greatest threat to our nation by about 2025,\" he said. Dunford also told the committee that \"China is focused on limiting our ability to project power and weakening our alliances in the Pacific.\" China sends troops to Djibouti, establishes first overseas military base \"Chinese leaders seem committed to increases in defense spending for the foreseeable future,\" the report added, saying \"China's military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core US military technological advantages.\" The Pentagon's 2017 assessment of China's military capabilities noted that Beijing's \"officially disclosed military budget grew at an average of 8.5% per year in inflation adjusted terms from 2007 through 2016.\" \"We use, largely, Russia and China to benchmark our capabilities,\" Dunford said Tuesday, warning that in the face of Russian and Chinese military modernization, the US would need to boost the annual defense budget by somewhere between 3% and 7% for the next five years in order \"to maintain a competitive advantage over those peer competitors\" in the mid 2020s. US, China 'have many difficult issues' Dunford visited Beijing in August where he struck a deal with Chinese military forces ensuring better communications between the two world powers. Speaking at the time, the general said the United States and China \"have many difficult issues where we will not necessarily have the same perspectives,\" and the agreement would reduce the chance of \"miscalculation.\" China's navy expands reach: Ships in Baltic for drills with Russia In August a US destroyer, the USS John S. McCain, sailed close to one of the artificial islands China claims in the South China Sea as part of a freedom of navigation exercise. Beijing said the move was a \"flaunting of force.\" The US regularly conducts similar Freedom of Navigation exercises in the South China Sea, which China claims as its territory but the US insists are international waters. In the East China Sea, US officials have accused Chinese jets of carrying out multiple \"unsafe\" intercepts of American aircraft in recent months. In one incident, a Chinese J-10 fighter jet came within 300 feet (90 meters) of a US plane forcing it to take \"evasive action,\" US officials told CNN. Beijing maintains an Air Defense Identification Zone over a large part of the East China Sea, a zone which the US does not consider valid.

Trump made his threat as members of the House Ways and Means Committee met Tuesday with the President at the White House to discuss an entirely different topic: tax reform. According to members who attended the sit-down, Trump stressed that he wanted a bipartisan effort on tax reform and expressed frustration with his own party for failing to pass a health care bill. Just hours later, Senate Republicans announced they would not hold a vote on the latest iteration of their health care bill, marking yet another failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump told the group at the White House he was \"disappointed\" in Republican senators who came out against the recent Graham-Cassidy bill and doomed its prospects, according to Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez, who was at the White House meeting. Read More Sanchez said Trump \"chided\" the Republican members in attendance, saying he could end up working with Democrats on health care legislation. \"We'll see if that happens,\" Sanchez said, adding that it wasn't a long discussion. Rep. Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, described the President's tone as \"less than strident\" but said \"he made that clear that if he didn't get what he wanted, he was going to work with Democrats on a plan.\" Trump holds his base close despite meetings with Democrats Another source familiar with the discussion said Trump mentioned how much he liked a deal that he recently negotiated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The September 7 agreement, which came as a shock to Republicans , ensured passage of disaster relief funding as well as a raise in the debt ceiling and a measure to continue funding the government into December. New York Republican Rep. Tom Reed who attended the White House meeting Tuesday told CNN he didn't classify the comment from the President as a \"threat,\" but said the President \"wants to govern for the American people and if there are folks on our side who just cannot get to that point than obviously you have no alternative but then to work with folks on the other side who will be good faith negotiators.\" \"There was definitely a clear signal that he's willing to work with legislators who want to govern and I support that wholeheartedly,\" said Reed, the co-chairman of the group known as the \"problem solvers caucus.\" Goals for tax reform revealed The bipartisan meeting came one day before Republicans are set to unveil a framework of their tax reform plan. Trump reiterated that the plan would be \"middle class tax cut\" and said there would be no tax cuts on the wealthy, according to Republican Rep. Jim Renacci of Ohio. Trump was \"pretty adamant\" about wanting to get tax reform done, Renacci said, adding that the President was also passionate about a child care tax credit proposal being pushed by his daughter, Ivanka Trump. \"He wants to make sure that the credits are to a point where single working mothers and fathers can be able to afford childcare while they're working,\" Renacci said. Neal, who took notes during the meeting, showed reporters his notepad with a quote that he wrote down, saying it was from Trump: \"The rich will not benefit.\" It's a promise that Democrats are planning to keep in the spotlight as the tax reform debate continues. While Trump has repeatedly said his tax plan wouldn't benefit the wealthy, Neal said that Trump was prepared to move forward with repealing the estate tax -- which affects estates worth more than $5.49 million -- and indicated that lowering the top individual income tax rate was negotiable. Hill Republicans grapple with Trump's comments on taxing the rich Two Republicans familiar with the plan expect the top income rate will drop to 35% from 39.6%, and the top corporate rate will drop to 20% from 35%. But Republicans working on the plan stress that the rates are still fluid and could change before the release of the framework Wednesday. Democrats argue that a drop in the individual top rate would be a tax cut for the wealthy. \"We want the top rate to stay at 39.6%,\" Neal said. \"It sends the signal that they're entirely true to the statement that was made on the campaign trail, that they intend not to offer any tax relief to the people at the top.\" But even if the rate does decrease, it's not clear yet whether the richest Americans would pay less in federal income taxes overall because other changes could be made in the tax code that could offset the benefits they receive from a lower rate. Trump is expected to address the plan Wednesday in an Indiana speech, while House Republicans will gather for a retreat to discuss some of the details.

As CNN's Jim Acosta reports , Trump was energized by the effects of his speech, which wounded many of his fellow citizens.\n\"It's really caught on. It's really caught on,\" he reportedly explained to dinner guests. \"I said what millions of Americans were thinking.\" He echoed that sentiment in his Tuesday press conference. Setting aside what millions of Americans may or may not think, Trump's sense that he succeeded because the press is talking about his performance ignores the fact that media coverage is not the measure of a president's success. Achieving certain policy goals, unifying the nation with calls to grace and maintaining America's standing in the world -- three objectives which many of his predecessors strived for -- determine how history writes about presidencies. Trump's gut knows that America agrees with him on NFL controversy Thus far, our 45th President has failed on all counts. He has succeeded, however, in showing that he is the man he has always been -- selfish and bombastic -- and incapable of growing into the responsibilities of the job he now has. The deficiencies of character and intellect that limit the President have been evident throughout his life. This is a man who cried \" reverse discrimination \" when he was asked to obey fair housing laws in the 1970s. He then cast doubt on the tribal identities of American Indians in the 1990s. And he also spent several years in the pursuit of proof that Barack Obama wasn't a legitimate president, an effort that well-known Republicans Michael Steele and Colin Powell deemed racist. Read More In these and many others instances, Trump chose to appeal to the most bigoted parts of Americans' hearts -- and based on a calculation that enough people would support him to make the bigotry worthwhile. In Alabama, the President, who was there to campaign for a Republican senate candidate, veered off his campaign speech. Speaking to a largely white crowd in a state with a tragic history of racism, he chastised a handful of football players who respectfully knelt during the National Anthem. Notably, most of those players are African-American. And while they are concerned about the number of unarmed black men killed in encounters with police, they are also seeking a broader discussion of the longstanding problems of racism and discrimination. Finally, a reason to watch the NFL again Trump ignored their motivations and the quiet nature of their protest, though, choosing to frame it as an unpatriotic attack. \"Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that son of a b-- off the field right now?'\" he said . \"Out. He's fired. He's fired!\" Trump's use of the word \"fired\" echoed the catchphrase he deployed during every episode of his program, \"The Apprentice.\" On the show, Trump's catchphrase was always delivered in a lowered tone of voice, and he used this device in Alabama, where his second \"he's fired\" came with an added growl for theatrical effect. And while other television performers, like Jaleel White, who played Steve Urkel on \"Family Matters,\" consider these catchphrases a potential handicap in future employment, Trump has embraced it. (Urkel, if you don't remember, was famous for saying \"Did I do that?\" in a nasally, high pitched voice.) In fact, Trump loves his catchphrase so much that he looks for opportunities to use it and revels in its delivery. If we set aside the fact that Trump is President and view him as the selfish man that he is, we can begin to make sense of his recent behavior. Throughout his career, Trump has played the same bombastic character -- it's what made him a billionaire and ultimately our President. But none of the theatrics that made him so powerful prepared him for the challenges of governing, which to date include a failed health care plan and an increasingly aggressive investigation into possible collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign. Trump's ugly battles with the NFL go way back Not surprisingly, Trump is miserable . But rather than acknowledge his mistakes, he is willing to blame everyone else, from Senator John McCain, who opposes repeal and replace, to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who recused himself from the Russia investigation. A more considerate man in Trump's position would reflect on his condition and change his ways. Other presidents -- Bill Clinton comes to mind -- stumbled badly at the start of their presidencies, but learned to do better. The trouble is that Trump has never been the type to learn something new. Thus, he seeks refuge in the company of people who love his divisive attitude and seemingly support him unconditionally. Like Trump, these people don't want to hear their assumptions and prejudices challenged. They like it when Trump tweets about others who are \"disrespecting our Flag & Country.\" The message is clear -- we own the nation and its symbols. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nIn time, perhaps when he seeks re-election, Trump may discover that playing to prejudice and dividing a nation that actually gave his opponent the popular vote is a losing proposition.

For the first time in history, Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) is changing its character limit. The service announced on Tuesday it is doubling its character count for tweets -- from 140 characters to 280 characters -- for some of its users. The test group will include those who tweet in certain languages, including English, Spanish and Portuguese. \nTwitter cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey has hinted at expanding the character limit before. Earlier this year, Twitter removed user handles -- a person's Twitter name preceded by the @ sign -- from replies to tweets, instead linking them in text above the tweet. \nTwitter says it hopes people will embrace the change. But considering the move strays from its core design, it's likely to cause some backlash. \nThe decision to limit the tweet character to 140 stems from text messaging. SMS messages are capped at 160 characters before they're split in two texts. Dorsey has said founders wanted tweets to be able to fit in a text message: 140 characters for the tweet, and 20 characters for the username. \nRelated: Trump blocking Twitter critics raises First Amendment concerns \nUsers may also argue Twitter should focus less on the length of the tweets, and more on the content. Twitter continues to be rife with harassment and abuse, despite the company's efforts to better police it. Many have called on Twitter to address the U.S. president's use of the platform. \nOn Monday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said President Trump declared war on his country when he tweeted that North Korea \"won't be around much longer.\" \nTwitter said Monday afternoon that it holds all accounts to the same rules, and weighs tweets' newsworthiness and public interest when considering whether accounts violate its rules. \nThe company noted in a blog post that cramming thoughts to fit Twitter character counts is more of a hassle for some users in specific language. Tweets sent in Japanese use 140 characters just 0.4% of the time, while English-language tweets hit 140 characters 9% of the time. \nTwitter explained that in Japanese, Korean and Chinese, people can convey twice as much information as languages like English and Spanish. \n\"Our research shows us that the character limit is a major cause of frustration for people Tweeting in English, but it is not for those Tweeting in Japanese,\" the post reads. \nOnly a \"small group of people\" will get the new limit before Twitter launches it to everyone. But all users will be able to see longer tweets.

Part of the concern centered on the far-reaching and broad requests from Mueller's team. In the case of Manafort, Mueller's investigators are reaching back 11 years as they investigate possible tax and financial crimes, according to search warrant documents. Mueller is bound by a written order issued by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May which allows the special counsel to investigate \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" After several months of being at odds, one source said, the IRS Criminal Investigation division is now sharing information about campaign associates, including Manafort and former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. The sharing happened after the two camps reached an agreement following consultation with officials at the Treasury Department. Special counsel interviews with White House staff could start later this week CNN has learned the IRS Criminal Investigation agents had been working with the FBI to investigate Manafort since before the election in a similar probe that centered on possible money laundering and tax fraud issues, according to the sources. It's unclear if Flynn is now or was previously under investigation by the IRS. CNN has reported that Mueller's team is examining Flynn's payments from Turkey and Russia . A former high-level Justice Department official says the information shared would include anything tax return-related such as real estate and banking records. The former official added the IRS is very restricted in what information it can share under Title 26 US Code and would normally need a specific grand jury subpoena in order to share tax returns with another agency. Read More The new information about the depth of IRS involvement renews questions surrounding the controversial issue of President Donald Trump's tax returns, which he refused to release during the campaign despite decades of precedent by presidential candidates. It is not clear whether the special counsel has asked for or obtained Trump's tax returns. Sources say if Mueller's office does have Trump's returns, then Rosenstein, who oversees the probe, likely would have needed to sign off, given the sensitivity surrounding the matter. White House stonewalls Capitol Hill over records in Russia probe Tension between the IRS and the special counsel played out behind the scenes of the high-profile raid on Manafort's Alexandria, Virginia, home this summer, according to multiple sources. CNN has learned that the IRS did not participate in the July raid by FBI agents in part because of IRS objections that the search would interfere with the separate IRS investigation of Manafort, according to people briefed on the investigations. The special counsel's office decided to proceed with the search on Manafort's home with only FBI agents carrying it out, the sources said. The absence of IRS criminal investigations agents for the raid is unusual for a probe that centers on tax and financial matters. As CNN has previously reported, during the raid the FBI collected tax and other financial documents from Manafort's home , according to search warrant documents in the Manafort raid. The search warrant documents said the scope of the investigation includes possible crimes beginning January 1, 2006, a source told CNN. Exclusive: OGE crafting a new advisory on legal defense funds Manafort has previously denied financial wrongdoing regarding his Ukraine-related payments, his bank accounts in offshore tax shelters and his various real estate transactions over the years. The complications could continue in the event Mueller's team brings charges against Manafort and others under investigation. Mueller's team has warned Manafort that they are working to charge him with possible tax and financial crimes, sources previously told CNN , an indication the investigation could be in an advanced stage. Flynn's lawyers have previously criticized media reports about his connection to the Russia investigation as peddling \"unfounded allegations\" and \"outrageous claims.\" Flynn's lawyer declined to comment for this story. Manafort's lawyer didn't immediately comment for this story. The IRS Criminal Investigation division and the special counsel's office declined to comment.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Emanuel Samson, 25, is charged with felony homicide. Story highlights Emanuel Samson is a native of Sudan and a resident of Tennessee He worked as an unarmed security guard and was into bodybuilding (CNN) As detectives investigate a deadly church shooting at Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, Tennessee, a picture is starting to emerge of accused gunman Emanuel Samson. He's a 25-year-old native of Sudan whose Facebook page is populated with gym selfies and bodybuilding poses. He worked as an unarmed security officer and had recently reinstated his license. It remains to be seen how he ended up, as police allege, parked in the church lot as Sunday service was ending. In his possession he had two pistols, a tactical vest and three magazines of ammunition (as well as an empty one); in his car he had an AR-15 rifle in its case and a .22-caliber semiautomatic pistol. His last Facebook post was at 10:26 a.m., about 30 minutes before he arrived at the church, according to an affidavit. \"Everything you've ever doubted or made to be believe as false, is real. & vice versa, B.\" Read More Church members knew him Samson is charged with felony homicide and is being held without bond. He is scheduled to appear in court Wednesday. Police say he is accused of killing one woman and injuring seven more in a shooting spree that ended when a church usher intervened. During the altercation, Samson accidentally shot himself in the chest with his own weapon, police said. Police say they are trying to establish his motive. Nashville police said Samson acknowledged opening fire in the church. He also told officers he had attended the church in the past. An usher is hailed as a hero for stopping a church gunman Church members confirmed this, telling police he attended the church about two years ago but that they had not seen him in a while. They did not immediately recognize him because the gunman was masked. Some members of the congregation, who declined to give their names because they did not want to speak for the church beyond its official statement, recalled Samson fondly. They said he was friendly to everyone, including one of the people he allegedly shot. He made mysterious Facebook posts Samson's Facebook account offers fragments of the image he created of himself for social media consumption. Church member William Brimm confirmed the account was Samson's. It lists his name, Emanuel K. Samson, and another name he uses, Bulda. It says he is from Khartoum, Sudan and that he went to Smyrna High School in Smyrna, Tennessee, graduating in 2010. It also says he studied psychology at an unspecified community college. CNN has not independently verified these details. Police initially said Samson is from La Vergne, Tennessee, but on his Facebook page he says he lives in nearby Murfreesboro. His languages are Arabic, English and Acholi, according to the page. He lists no political views. \"Your votes mean nothing,\" reads one post. Shooter kills one, wounds 7 at Tennessee church His favorite quotes include one from Right Said Fred's 1992 party anthem: \"I'm, so sexy for my shirt ... so sexy, it hurts.\" His penultimate quote before the shooting reads, \"Become the creator instead of what's created. Whatever you say goes.\" And, before that, at 10:18 a.m.: \"You are more than what they told us.\" One quote from his personal description now stands out, though it is not known when it was written. \"No need for a life story,\" it says. \"You probably heard about me.\" He quit his job as a security guard On Saturday, the day before the shooting, Samson worked a shift as a security guard for Crimson Security in Nashville, police spokesman Don Aaron said. He sent an email Sunday at 10:01 a.m., within an hour of the shooting, saying he appreciated the opportunity to work but would not be returning. State records indicate Samson had held an unarmed security license between 2014-2016, Nashville police said. It had expired, and Samson had attended a class on Friday to reinstate the unarmed license. He had past encounters with police Police responded to two domestic calls at a Murfreesboro home involving Samson and his former girlfriend. In January, police responded to an address listed as Samson's home in Murfreesboro. During an argument, Jeanna Ambrose told police that Samson punched her TV and broke a small figurine, according to a police report. They were fighting because he believed she had cheated on him, she told police. As she tried to leave the apartment, he demanded to speak to her and took her phone. She called police from a neighbor's home. Motive sought in deadly Tennessee church shooting In March, police returned to the same home. Samson told officers he used to date Ambrose and was trying to break off contact with her but she \"keeps coming around,\" according to a police report. He said that, after a brief conversation at the door, she started to get loud and tried to push his door open as he tried to close it. Samson told police that he was in fear because \"she has struck him in the past\" but said she had not threatened or assaulted him that day. Ambrose told police she had come over to pick up some belongings and said she did not threaten or assault him. Officers helped Ambrose retrieve her belongings and told her not to return to the apartment, the report states. Samson was told that he could no longer have contact with her. His next contact with police was on June 27. Murfreesboro Police responded to the home of Samson's father after a 911 call reporting suicidal threats. His father told police that Samson had texted him shortly after midnight saying he had a gun to his head, according to a police report. Samson's father said he tried unsuccessfully to reach his son on the phone and did not know where he was. Police pinged Samson's phone and found him at the Nashville office of security service provider G4S, Nashville Police said Monday. A police officer met Samson at the office, where Samson told him that he was fine and not thinking of harming himself. The officer was satisfied that he was not a danger and left him. CNN's Tina Burnside, Kalenah Arif, Dianne Gallagher and Justin Gamble contributed to this report.

Earlier in the day, Trump approved a change in the island's disaster declaration that increases federal funding for debris removal. Chafing at criticism JUST WATCHED Trump: I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nTrump: I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL 00:58 White House officials say Trump has chafed at criticism that his administration has been slow in responding to the crisis in Puerto Rico, particularly compared to his quick trips to Texas and Florida after storms devastated those states. After his top homeland security adviser Tom Bossert returned from the island, Trump demanded that aides work to schedule a trip there, despite the logistical challenges that persist. One source said the President was told upon Bossert's return that Tuesday was the earliest he could visit the island. The President's decision to visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday came suddenly for some at the White House, who as of Monday afternoon were not planning for Trump to travel there that quickly, a White House official said. The White House on Monday night even announced plans for Trump to welcome the Thai prime minister to the White House next Tuesday -- a meeting now likely to be rescheduled. Staffers on Monday had instead been planning for the President to head to the US Virgin Islands, with a Puerto Rico trip to come later. Instead, Trump will visit both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during his trip next week. White House officials who advance the President's trips were notified only Tuesday morning of the change of plans. The decision to speed up plans for a presidential visit to Puerto Rico came as the media spotlight turned to the unraveling situation on the US territory, where reports of hundreds of thousands of people without sufficient water or access to basic services have emerged. It also came as critics accused the President of focusing more of his attention -- at least on social media -- on the controversy he created by launching a days-long tirade against NFL players who have taken a knee during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. Trump has been insistent about visiting Puerto Rico as quickly as possible, two sources said. And Trump picked next Tuesday after his advisers said it was the earliest date a visit could be possible, one source said. Speaking outside the White House on Tuesday, FEMA administrator Brock Long said that all access to the island should be limited to life-saving activity. \"If you're going to Puerto Rico right now, it should only be for a life-sustaining, life-supporting mission. Everybody who is trying to get in that is not supporting that is getting in the way,\" he said. It wasn't clear whether the President's sense of urgency in making a visit was prompted by the criticism he has faced or the intensifying glare of media scrutiny over the federal response. There has been a growing sense in the West Wing of the need to scale up the White House's efforts, even as the administration insists the federal response to the situation has been above par. Trump touts 'great job' JUST WATCHED Trump says administration preparing for Irma Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\nTrump says administration preparing for Irma 02:33 Trump on Tuesday sharply rebuffed concerns about the federal response to the disaster, bragging that Puerto Rico's elected officials were grateful for the actions his administration has taken to respond so far. \"The governor of Puerto Rico was so thankful for the great job that we're doing,\" Trump said in the Rose Garden during a news conference with the prime minister of Spain. \"It's the most difficult job because it's on an island in the middle of the ocean. It's out in the ocean. You can't just drive your trucks there from other states.\" The situation in Puerto Rico is the third major disaster in the last month Trump and his administration have had to confront, following major hurricanes that led to massive flooding, damage and power outages primarily in Texas and Florida. The US Virgin Islands, which Trump will also visit on Tuesday, were hit by both Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The federal government has deployed thousands of relief workers to Puerto Rico since the storm, according to federal authorities. On Tuesday, the government announced the US military would deploy the Navy hospital ship Comfort to the island, though it won't arrive there for days. The vessel is minimally manned in Norfolk, Virginia, by a crew of about 18 civilian mariners, though additional forces will now be activated to man the ship. It could provide as many as 1,200 hospital beds. On CNN Tuesday, the acting-Homeland Security secretary Elaine Duke said her agency was sufficiently funded to contend with the dire needs on Puerto Rico. \"We are absolutely prepared financially,\" Duke said. \"We are working hand-in-hand with Congress and the White House to ensure that we have the funds to perform these essential missions for all three of the hurricanes.\" As of Monday morning, FEMA had around $5 billion in disaster relief reserves that was allocated after Hurricane Harvey barreled through Texas last month. An additional $6.7 billion will be available on October 1, when funding for the next fiscal year kicks in. Congressional and White House sources said they expected the administration to request additional emergency funding in early- to mid-October.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben sasse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ricardo rossello", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marco rubio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan scavino jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rubio", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of homeland security", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national anthem", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roosevelt room", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west wing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nebraska", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T00:33:20.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dc12d02049484676ae079e156a1fb942e637117c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNbaiwhEOWbLxP1tdIGNjML05F4HFmf0ZWk1YTpPQp3u03RoEzV7l0crPDuozgbMaJ7e3AkX14PqMQ--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Politics", "title": "More Americans live in Puerto Rico than 21 states (and other things to know)", "title_full": "More Americans live in Puerto Rico than 21 states (and other things to know)", "published": "2017-09-27T00:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926140653-restricted-puerto-rico-us-flags-state-t1-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7367, "comments": 0, "shares": 7367}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dc12d02049484676ae079e156a1fb942e637117c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNbaiwhEOWbLxP1tdIGNjML05F4HFmf0ZWk1YTpPQp3u03RoEzV7l0crPDuozgbMaJ7e3AkX14PqMQ--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T00:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "More Americans live in Puerto Rico than 21 states (and other things to know)", "text": "More Americans live in Puerto Rico than 21 states (and other things to know) By Ryan Struyk and graphics by Will Mullery, CNN Updated 2110 GMT (0510 HKT) September 26, 2017 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Hide Caption 36 of 36 Washington (CNN) When Hurricane Maria barreled across Puerto Rico, devastating buildings with wind and flooding and wiping out the power infrastructure, the safety and livelihood of more than 3.4 million Americans hung in the balance. But has Puerto Rico's lack of statehood caused the federal government and broader American public to overlook its fellow citizens? President Donald Trump pledged to visit the island next Tuesday , saying the island was \"literally destroyed\" and making more disaster assistance dollars available. He congratulated the federal government on its response, saying \"I think we've done a really good job\" and citing praise from local government officials. Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 But the main airport on the island is barely functioning and shipments of aid are struggling to keep up with the millions there who need food and shelter. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the devastation on the island a \"humanitarian crisis,\" promising that the victims will get the same help that people in Texas and Florida received. In many ways, like population and gross domestic product, Puerto Rico appears like just any other middle-of-the-road state that may blend in with many you'd see on the American mainland. But its economic problems left it extremely vulnerable to a storm like this. Read More Here's a look at how Puerto Rico ranks up against the 50 states. A state without statehood? Less than a three-hour flight from Miami, the island of just more than 5,000 square miles is smaller than every American state except for Delaware and Rhode Island. Still, in many ways, Puerto Rico is very similar to a US state. It's home to more than 3.4 million people, according to the US Census Bureau -- a population larger than 21 states, including Iowa, Arkansas and Nevada. That number has declined in recent years as more residents move to the US mainland amid economic woes on the island. The Puerto Rico population has steadily declined over the last decade from 3.8 million people. Just in the last year, according to the US Census Bureau, the population declined by a broad 1.8 percentage points. (Only six states had declining populations from 2015 to 2016, but none of the US states' populations were declining as quickly as Puerto Rico's; West Virginia being the worst at just 0.5 points.) Puerto Rico's gross domestic product -- at $103 billion, according to the World Bank -- would rank 37th if Puerto Rico were a state, ahead of places like New Mexico, South Dakota and New Hampshire, according to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Puerto Rico came under US control more than a century ago, and Puerto Ricans have voted a half-dozen times on statehood -- most recently a low-turnout nonbinding vote in June where residents overwhelmingly voted to become to 51st state. Ultimately, however, Congress must pass a law admitting them to the union. For the time being, residents of the island are natural-born citizens just like anyone born in a US state, but they don't have a voting member in Congress or votes in the Electoral College, which elects the president. Like the 50 states, Puerto Rico has hits own constitution, governor and legislature. The economic vulnerability of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has stark economic woes that separate it from most of the 50 states -- and make the island particularly vulnerable to a large storm that wipes out infrastructure and devastates personal property. A broad 44% of its residents live in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. That's more than double the 21% of residents in Mississippi and Louisiana who live in poverty -- the highest in the United States. The island also has been plagued by debt and a declining credit rating amid an economic recession there. Trump had tweeted earlier that Puerto Rico was in \"deep trouble\" after the storm, in part because its electrical grid was \"in terrible shape\" and they have \"billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks.\" Indeed, the median household income on the island is just $19,350, according to the US Census Bureau -- less than half the median household income of those in Mississippi and Louisiana, again at the bottom of the list. The median income for the entire United States is more than triple the island's number, and the median income in the most wealthy states in the country hit nearly four times as much money. Unemployment in Puerto Rico also remains high at 10.1% -- worse than any state and more than double the national unemployment rate in the United States of 4.4%. Still, it's been a slightly improvement over the last several years after it reached a peak of 17.0% in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Hurricane Maria slammed into Puerto Rico last week as a Category 4 storm, the largest storm to hit the US territory in nearly a century.

CNNPolitics", "text": "Washington (CNN) The IRS is now sharing information with special counsel Robert Mueller about key Trump campaign officials, after the two entities clashed this summer over both the scope of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and a raid on former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's home, people briefed on the matter tell CNN.\nPart of the concern centered on the far-reaching and broad requests from Mueller's team. In the case of Manafort, Mueller's investigators are reaching back 11 years as they investigate possible tax and financial crimes, according to search warrant documents. Mueller is bound by a written order issued by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May which allows the special counsel to investigate \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" After several months of being at odds, one source said, the IRS Criminal Investigation division is now sharing information about campaign associates, including Manafort and former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn. The sharing happened after the two camps reached an agreement following consultation with officials at the Treasury Department. Special counsel interviews with White House staff could start later this week CNN has learned the IRS Criminal Investigation agents had been working with the FBI to investigate Manafort since before the election in a similar probe that centered on possible money laundering and tax fraud issues, according to the sources. It's unclear if Flynn is now or was previously under investigation by the IRS. CNN has reported that Mueller's team is examining Flynn's payments from Turkey and Russia . A former high-level Justice Department official says the information shared would include anything tax return-related such as real estate and banking records. The former official added the IRS is very restricted in what information it can share under Title 26 US Code and would normally need a specific grand jury subpoena in order to share tax returns with another agency. Read More The new information about the depth of IRS involvement renews questions surrounding the controversial issue of President Donald Trump's tax returns, which he refused to release during the campaign despite decades of precedent by presidential candidates. It is not clear whether the special counsel has asked for or obtained Trump's tax returns. Sources say if Mueller's office does have Trump's returns, then Rosenstein, who oversees the probe, likely would have needed to sign off, given the sensitivity surrounding the matter. White House stonewalls Capitol Hill over records in Russia probe Tension between the IRS and the special counsel played out behind the scenes of the high-profile raid on Manafort's Alexandria, Virginia, home this summer, according to multiple sources. CNN has learned that the IRS did not participate in the July raid by FBI agents in part because of IRS objections that the search would interfere with the separate IRS investigation of Manafort, according to people briefed on the investigations. The special counsel's office decided to proceed with the search on Manafort's home with only FBI agents carrying it out, the sources said. The absence of IRS criminal investigations agents for the raid is unusual for a probe that centers on tax and financial matters. As CNN has previously reported, during the raid the FBI collected tax and other financial documents from Manafort's home , according to search warrant documents in the Manafort raid. The search warrant documents said the scope of the investigation includes possible crimes beginning January 1, 2006, a source told CNN. Exclusive: OGE crafting a new advisory on legal defense funds Manafort has previously denied financial wrongdoing regarding his Ukraine-related payments, his bank accounts in offshore tax shelters and his various real estate transactions over the years. The complications could continue in the event Mueller's team brings charges against Manafort and others under investigation. Mueller's team has warned Manafort that they are working to charge him with possible tax and financial crimes, sources previously told CNN , an indication the investigation could be in an advanced stage. Flynn's lawyers have previously criticized media reports about his connection to the Russia investigation as peddling \"unfounded allegations\" and \"outrageous claims.\" Flynn's lawyer declined to comment for this story.

That group includes family members / senior advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner as well as departed top aides including Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon.\nNow, try to remember all the way back to, well, last year when then candidate Trump framed his entire campaign around the idea that Hillary Clinton's use of a private email and private server as secretary of state amounted to criminal conduct. \"She would be under protracted criminal investigation and probably a criminal trial, I would say,\" Trump told a Michigan audience just more than a week before the 2016 election. \"So we'd have a criminal trial of a sitting president.\" The \"Lock Her Up\" chant -- which an audience in Alabama chanted on Friday night, more than 300 days after the 2016 election -- became the defining rallying cry for Trump voters. Trump might be uncouth. He might be make offensive comments about women. But, Clinton was a criminal, Trump supporters claimed! (Neither Clinton nor anyone on her staff were ever charged with a crime.) Ahem. Read More Before we go any further, it's important to note that what Clinton did is not the exact same thing that Jared, Ivanka and others are reportedly doing. Clinton exclusively used her private email address for government business. She had a private email server at her home in Chappaqua, New York. She shared classified materials via that email address although, she has long contended, the materials were not classified at the time. According to the Times, all of the Trump administration officials used their private addresses only occasionally and all had official accounts set up and operating. Still. Think of it this way: You are running a race against someone else through the woods. That person falls in a hole. You win. The next time you run through those same woods, you would think you would make sure to be on the lookout for the hole, right? Like, you would be HYPER sensitive to that pitfall -- and any other ones like it, right? (Yes, I watched the second \"Hunger Games\" movie last night.) What these Trump officials have done is sprint into the same damn hole that swallowed Clinton's campaign whole. And, in so doing, they've raised all of the same questions that Clinton's email use did. Do they think the rules don't apply to them? Do they think they can just do whatever they want because of their position and power? What are they trying to hide in these private accounts? And, it also raises a question that Clinton never had to contend with: Did the Trump campaign actually believe all that stuff they said about the dangers posed by Clinton's email conduct? If so, why did they go anywhere near doing the same thing? The official White House line was surprisingly scoldy about the new email revelations. \"All White House personnel have been instructed to use official email to conduct all government related work,\" said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. \"They are further instructed that if they receive work-related communication on personal accounts, they should be forwarded to official email accounts.\" This story won't be going away any time soon. Not only does it look like rank hypocrisy, it also potentially ties into special counsel Bob Mueller's investigation into Russia influence in the 2016 election. What do these emails on private accounts say? Will they be released publicly? If not, why not? \"The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton,\" Trump proclaimed in January 2016. \"At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgment be our next president?\" Don't be surprised if this latest story prompts some of those same questions to be asked of the men and women in Trump's inner circle.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bob mueller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivanka trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared kushner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reince priebus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jared", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivanka", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump white house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "all white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chappaqua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T00:52:35.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "a6d77050e724230780299269d7c6dbe5f3ebb281", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRdrQEG7xdvmuZeK0wup1NdtrdcRRCnPoN.x7wDD6ZCEFBIbL9S9Ik3bVXFIZ4O1wLg--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Trump scales up Puerto Rico response amid criticism - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Trump scales up Puerto Rico response amid criticism - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170925112512-04-trump-09-24-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2826, "comments": 0, "shares": 2826}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "a6d77050e724230780299269d7c6dbe5f3ebb281", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWF7rhGFbxMQRdrQEG7xdvmuZeK0wup1NdtrdcRRCnPoN.x7wDD6ZCEFBIbL9S9Ik3bVXFIZ4O1wLg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jeremy Diamond", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump scales up Puerto Rico response amid criticism - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights \"Puerto Rico is very important to me,\" Trump said Trump announced Tuesday he would visit the island next week (CNN) President Donald Trump on Tuesday intensified his personal involvement in the growing crisis in Puerto Rico amid criticism that his response to the devastation there was lackluster. \nThere was an increased sense of urgency at the White House in confronting the situation, including Trump's announcement -- a surprise to some aides -- that he would travel there in a week to survey damage left over from the storm. \"Puerto Rico is very important to me, and Puerto Rico -- the people are fantastic people,\" Trump said before meeting with lawmakers in the Roosevelt Room on Tuesday. \"I grew up in New York, so I know many people from Puerto Rico.

Earlier in the day, Trump approved a change in the island's disaster declaration that increases federal funding for debris removal. Chafing at criticism JUST WATCHED Trump: I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTrump: I wasn't preoccupied with the NFL 00:58 White House officials say Trump has chafed at criticism that his administration has been slow in responding to the crisis in Puerto Rico, particularly compared to his quick trips to Texas and Florida after storms devastated those states. After his top homeland security adviser Tom Bossert returned from the island, Trump demanded that aides work to schedule a trip there, despite the logistical challenges that persist. One source said the President was told upon Bossert's return that Tuesday was the earliest he could visit the island. The President's decision to visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday came suddenly for some at the White House, who as of Monday afternoon were not planning for Trump to travel there that quickly, a White House official said. The White House on Monday night even announced plans for Trump to welcome the Thai prime minister to the White House next Tuesday -- a meeting now likely to be rescheduled. Staffers on Monday had instead been planning for the President to head to the US Virgin Islands, with a Puerto Rico trip to come later. Instead, Trump will visit both Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands during his trip next week. White House officials who advance the President's trips were notified only Tuesday morning of the change of plans. The decision to speed up plans for a presidential visit to Puerto Rico came as the media spotlight turned to the unraveling situation on the US territory, where reports of hundreds of thousands of people without sufficient water or access to basic services have emerged. It also came as critics accused the President of focusing more of his attention -- at least on social media -- on the controversy he created by launching a days-long tirade against NFL players who have taken a knee during the National Anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. Trump has been insistent about visiting Puerto Rico as quickly as possible, two sources said. And Trump picked next Tuesday after his advisers said it was the earliest date a visit could be possible, one source said. Speaking outside the White House on Tuesday, FEMA administrator Brock Long said that all access to the island should be limited to life-saving activity. \"If you're going to Puerto Rico right now, it should only be for a life-sustaining, life-supporting mission. Everybody who is trying to get in that is not supporting that is getting in the way,\" he said. It wasn't clear whether the President's sense of urgency in making a visit was prompted by the criticism he has faced or the intensifying glare of media scrutiny over the federal response. There has been a growing sense in the West Wing of the need to scale up the White House's efforts, even as the administration insists the federal response to the situation has been above par. Trump touts 'great job' JUST WATCHED Trump says administration preparing for Irma Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nTrump says administration preparing for Irma 02:33 Trump on Tuesday sharply rebuffed concerns about the federal response to the disaster, bragging that Puerto Rico's elected officials were grateful for the actions his administration has taken to respond so far. \"The governor of Puerto Rico was so thankful for the great job that we're doing,\" Trump said in the Rose Garden during a news conference with the prime minister of Spain. \"It's the most difficult job because it's on an island in the middle of the ocean. It's out in the ocean. You can't just drive your trucks there from other states.\" The situation in Puerto Rico is the third major disaster in the last month Trump and his administration have had to confront, following major hurricanes that led to massive flooding, damage and power outages primarily in Texas and Florida. The US Virgin Islands, which Trump will also visit on Tuesday, were hit by both Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The federal government has deployed thousands of relief workers to Puerto Rico since the storm, according to federal authorities. On Tuesday, the government announced the US military would deploy the Navy hospital ship Comfort to the island, though it won't arrive there for days. The vessel is minimally manned in Norfolk, Virginia, by a crew of about 18 civilian mariners, though additional forces will now be activated to man the ship. It could provide as many as 1,200 hospital beds. On CNN Tuesday, the acting-Homeland Security secretary Elaine Duke said her agency was sufficiently funded to contend with the dire needs on Puerto Rico. \"We are absolutely prepared financially,\" Duke said. \"We are working hand-in-hand with Congress and the White House to ensure that we have the funds to perform these essential missions for all three of the hurricanes.\" As of Monday morning, FEMA had around $5 billion in disaster relief reserves that was allocated after Hurricane Harvey barreled through Texas last month.

Hide Caption 36 of 36 Washington (CNN) When Hurricane Maria barreled across Puerto Rico, devastating buildings with wind and flooding and wiping out the power infrastructure, the safety and livelihood of more than 3.4 million Americans hung in the balance.\nBut has Puerto Rico's lack of statehood caused the federal government and broader American public to overlook its fellow citizens? President Donald Trump pledged to visit the island next Tuesday , saying the island was \"literally destroyed\" and making more disaster assistance dollars available. He congratulated the federal government on its response, saying \"I think we've done a really good job\" and citing praise from local government officials. Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz, the Mayor of San Juan, for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way\n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2017 But the main airport on the island is barely functioning and shipments of aid are struggling to keep up with the millions there who need food and shelter. House Speaker Paul Ryan called the devastation on the island a \"humanitarian crisis,\" promising that the victims will get the same help that people in Texas and Florida received. In many ways, like population and gross domestic product, Puerto Rico appears like just any other middle-of-the-road state that may blend in with many you'd see on the American mainland. But its economic problems left it extremely vulnerable to a storm like this. Read More Here's a look at how Puerto Rico ranks up against the 50 states. A state without statehood? Less than a three-hour flight from Miami, the island of just more than 5,000 square miles is smaller than every American state except for Delaware and Rhode Island. Still, in many ways, Puerto Rico is very similar to a US state. It's home to more than 3.4 million people, according to the US Census Bureau -- a population larger than 21 states, including Iowa, Arkansas and Nevada. That number has declined in recent years as more residents move to the US mainland amid economic woes on the island. The Puerto Rico population has steadily declined over the last decade from 3.8 million people. Just in the last year, according to the US Census Bureau, the population declined by a broad 1.8 percentage points. (Only six states had declining populations from 2015 to 2016, but none of the US states' populations were declining as quickly as Puerto Rico's; West Virginia being the worst at just 0.5 points.) Puerto Rico's gross domestic product -- at $103 billion, according to the World Bank -- would rank 37th if Puerto Rico were a state, ahead of places like New Mexico, South Dakota and New Hampshire, according to data from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. Puerto Rico came under US control more than a century ago, and Puerto Ricans have voted a half-dozen times on statehood -- most recently a low-turnout nonbinding vote in June where residents overwhelmingly voted to become to 51st state. Ultimately, however, Congress must pass a law admitting them to the union. For the time being, residents of the island are natural-born citizens just like anyone born in a US state, but they don't have a voting member in Congress or votes in the Electoral College, which elects the president. Like the 50 states, Puerto Rico has hits own constitution, governor and legislature. The economic vulnerability of Puerto Rico Puerto Rico has stark economic woes that separate it from most of the 50 states -- and make the island particularly vulnerable to a large storm that wipes out infrastructure and devastates personal property. A broad 44% of its residents live in poverty, according to the US Census Bureau. That's more than double the 21% of residents in Mississippi and Louisiana who live in poverty -- the highest in the United States. The island also has been plagued by debt and a declining credit rating amid an economic recession there. Trump had tweeted earlier that Puerto Rico was in \"deep trouble\" after the storm, in part because its electrical grid was \"in terrible shape\" and they have \"billions of dollars owed to Wall Street and the banks.\" Indeed, the median household income on the island is just $19,350, according to the US Census Bureau -- less than half the median household income of those in Mississippi and Louisiana, again at the bottom of the list. The median income for the entire United States is more than triple the island's number, and the median income in the most wealthy states in the country hit nearly four times as much money. Unemployment in Puerto Rico also remains high at 10.1% -- worse than any state and more than double the national unemployment rate in the United States of 4.4%. Still, it's been a slightly improvement over the last several years after it reached a peak of 17.0% in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Trump warns of 'devastating' military option as North Korea moves jets He also said that Russia remained the greatest threat overall due to its military capabilities in the realms of nuclear weapons and electronic warfare as well as Russian military activity in places like Crimea, which it invaded and annexed in 2014, and eastern Ukraine, where Western officials accuse Moscow of backing armed separatists.

Dunford also told the committee that \"China is focused on limiting our ability to project power and weakening our alliances in the Pacific.\" China sends troops to Djibouti, establishes first overseas military base \"Chinese leaders seem committed to increases in defense spending for the foreseeable future,\" the report added, saying \"China's military modernization is targeting capabilities with the potential to degrade core US military technological advantages.\" The Pentagon's 2017 assessment of China's military capabilities noted that Beijing's \"officially disclosed military budget grew at an average of 8.5% per year in inflation adjusted terms from 2007 through 2016.\" \"We use, largely, Russia and China to benchmark our capabilities,\" Dunford said Tuesday, warning that in the face of Russian and Chinese military modernization, the US would need to boost the annual defense budget by somewhere between 3% and 7% for the next five years in order \"to maintain a competitive advantage over those peer competitors\" in the mid 2020s. US, China 'have many difficult issues' Dunford visited Beijing in August where he struck a deal with Chinese military forces ensuring better communications between the two world powers. Speaking at the time, the general said the United States and China \"have many difficult issues where we will not necessarily have the same perspectives,\" and the agreement would reduce the chance of \"miscalculation.\" China's navy expands reach: Ships in Baltic for drills with Russia In August a US destroyer, the USS John S. McCain, sailed close to one of the artificial islands China claims in the South China Sea as part of a freedom of navigation exercise. Beijing said the move was a \"flaunting of force.\" The US regularly conducts similar Freedom of Navigation exercises in the South China Sea, which China claims as its territory but the US insists are international waters. In the East China Sea, US officials have accused Chinese jets of carrying out multiple \"unsafe\" intercepts of American aircraft in recent months. In one incident, a Chinese J-10 fighter jet came within 300 feet (90 meters) of a US plane forcing it to take \"evasive action,\" US officials told CNN.

According to members who attended the sit-down, Trump stressed that he wanted a bipartisan effort on tax reform and expressed frustration with his own party for failing to pass a health care bill. Just hours later, Senate Republicans announced they would not hold a vote on the latest iteration of their health care bill, marking yet another failed attempt to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Trump told the group at the White House he was \"disappointed\" in Republican senators who came out against the recent Graham-Cassidy bill and doomed its prospects, according to Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez, who was at the White House meeting. Read More Sanchez said Trump \"chided\" the Republican members in attendance, saying he could end up working with Democrats on health care legislation. \"We'll see if that happens,\" Sanchez said, adding that it wasn't a long discussion. Rep. Richard Neal, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, described the President's tone as \"less than strident\" but said \"he made that clear that if he didn't get what he wanted, he was going to work with Democrats on a plan.\" Trump holds his base close despite meetings with Democrats Another source familiar with the discussion said Trump mentioned how much he liked a deal that he recently negotiated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. The September 7 agreement, which came as a shock to Republicans , ensured passage of disaster relief funding as well as a raise in the debt ceiling and a measure to continue funding the government into December. New York Republican Rep. Tom Reed who attended the White House meeting Tuesday told CNN he didn't classify the comment from the President as a \"threat,\" but said the President \"wants to govern for the American people and if there are folks on our side who just cannot get to that point than obviously you have no alternative but then to work with folks on the other side who will be good faith negotiators.\" \"There was definitely a clear signal that he's willing to work with legislators who want to govern and I support that wholeheartedly,\" said Reed, the co-chairman of the group known as the \"problem solvers caucus.\" Goals for tax reform revealed The bipartisan meeting came one day before Republicans are set to unveil a framework of their tax reform plan. Trump reiterated that the plan would be \"middle class tax cut\" and said there would be no tax cuts on the wealthy, according to Republican Rep. Jim Renacci of Ohio. Trump was \"pretty adamant\" about wanting to get tax reform done, Renacci said, adding that the President was also passionate about a child care tax credit proposal being pushed by his daughter, Ivanka Trump. \"He wants to make sure that the credits are to a point where single working mothers and fathers can be able to afford childcare while they're working,\" Renacci said. Neal, who took notes during the meeting, showed reporters his notepad with a quote that he wrote down, saying it was from Trump: \"The rich will not benefit.\" It's a promise that Democrats are planning to keep in the spotlight as the tax reform debate continues. While Trump has repeatedly said his tax plan wouldn't benefit the wealthy, Neal said that Trump was prepared to move forward with repealing the estate tax -- which affects estates worth more than $5.49 million -- and indicated that lowering the top individual income tax rate was negotiable. Hill Republicans grapple with Trump's comments on taxing the rich Two Republicans familiar with the plan expect the top income rate will drop to 35% from 39.6%, and the top corporate rate will drop to 20% from 35%. But Republicans working on the plan stress that the rates are still fluid and could change before the release of the framework Wednesday. Democrats argue that a drop in the individual top rate would be a tax cut for the wealthy. \"We want the top rate to stay at 39.6%,\" Neal said. \"It sends the signal that they're entirely true to the statement that was made on the campaign trail, that they intend not to offer any tax relief to the people at the top.\" But even if the rate does decrease, it's not clear yet whether the richest Americans would pay less in federal income taxes overall because other changes could be made in the tax code that could offset the benefits they receive from a lower rate. Trump is expected to address the plan Wednesday in an Indiana speech, while House Republicans will gather for a retreat to discuss some of the details.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tom reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard neal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jim renacci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ivanka trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy pelosi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renacci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schumer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "linda sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanchez", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ways and means committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house ways and means committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ohio", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T00:52:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4581925f704d6b215a3f0b2579d86e1c4a32cf9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdoLkvVY9Wzw4TOtXwc0e2h9PLemx1EVsgZb2YywfZPnAUR9fhM9gor_zCNtFpblG5LwMkNpn2zTcm6.j0E8bN9M", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Who will help Puerto Rico?", "title_full": "Who will help Puerto Rico?", "published": "2017-09-27T00:48:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170926122001-puerto-rico-hurricane-costs-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 908, "comments": 0, "shares": 908}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 13}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4581925f704d6b215a3f0b2579d86e1c4a32cf9c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGzSa1rCObCdoLkvVY9Wzw4TOtXwc0e2h9PLemx1EVsgZb2YywfZPnAUR9fhM9gor_zCNtFpblG5LwMkNpn2zTcm6.j0E8bN9M", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T00:48:00.000+03:00", "title": "Who will help Puerto Rico?", "text": "Who will help Puerto Rico? by Jill Disis and Julia Horowitz @CNNMoney September 26, 2017: 6:59 PM ET 2017 hurricanes will cost over $100 billion Puerto Rico is battling a massive economic and humanitarian crisis in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. It's not clear yet how much it will cost to rebuild. One conservative estimate puts total damage at $30 billion -- nearly a third the size of the island's entire economy. Then there's Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. \nThose storms will cost an estimated $150 billion and have already prompted billions in federal aid, insurance payouts and private donations. \nSo what does that leave for Puerto Rico? \nInsurance coverage \nWhen it comes to covering damages, insurers are the first line of defense. \n\"People are expected to fund their own recoveries\" with insurance payouts, said James Kendra, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware. \"FEMA steps in afterward, with supplementary assistance.\" \nAIR Worldwide, which calculates the economic cost of natural disasters, predicts that Caribbean losses covered by insurance will be between $40 billion and $85 billion. More than 85% of those losses are in Puerto Rico. \nBut only 50% of homes in Puerto Rico have insurance that covers wind damage, AIR Worldwide said. \nFlood damage typically isn't part of a standard homeowners insurance policy at all. Homeowners can apply for coverage from the National Flood Insurance Program -- but fewer than 1% of Puerto Rican households have done so, according to FEMA. \nThat means private and public insurance money won't be enough to cover all expenses. \nAdditionally, some people may decide not to pay for repairs at all \u2014 either because they have costly insurance deductibles or because they don't think it's worth it. \nGovernment aid \nThe federal government can also offer help for localities, along with grants and loans to individuals. \nCongress approved around $15 billion for hurricane relief after Harvey hit, and some of that will be used for Puerto Rico. The Trump administration is expected to send another disaster spending request to Congress in mid-October. \nBut it's not yet clear how much more money Puerto Rico needs, and it can take years to pay out all of the relief funds needed to rebuild. \nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency received about half of the $15 billion. \nFEMA funds go directly to the areas hit by a disaster. For example, local governments that spend money giving their citizens food, water and shelter can be fully reimbursed for those costs in the first month after a disaster is declared. \nThe agency also helps people who lose their homes as part of a declared disaster, as well as those who either don't have any insurance or who have only partial coverage. It can also provide temporary financial relief, which can be used to fund necessities like temporary housing. \nFEMA can approve up to $33,300 for people who have lost everything, but most don't get nearly as much. In reality the amount paid out is usually closer to $6,000, said Elizabeth Zimmerman, who was the associate administrator for the agency's office of response and recovery during the Obama administration. \nIt can take time for inspectors to fully assess the damage. But Zimmerman said FEMA has the ability to distribute some money immediately as electronic transfers, to help with gas, food or other emergency needs. \nAs of Monday morning, FEMA had $5.03 billion left in its fund until the end of the month. When the new fiscal year begins October 1, it will get another $6.7 billion, and the agency can request more down the road. \nThe Small Business Administration, which received some of the $15 billion, has paid out $511.6 million in home and business disaster loans for damage from Harvey and Irma. No loans have been approved yet for Hurricane Maria. \nCorporate donations \nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce this week released an initial tally of donations related to Maria relief that totaled $8.1 million. \nAnd corporate donations are still coming in. For example, Starbucks ( SBUX ) , Verizon ( VZ , Tech30 ) and Google ( GOOG ) have pledged a collective $1.75 million for Puerto Rico. \nThe value of other support is difficult to total. AT&T ( T , Tech30 ) and T-Mobile ( TMUS ) are waiving cellphone charges in affected areas, while several major airlines are flying in emergency supplies. \nCompanies have already given $224.9 million to cover damage from Harvey and Irma, according to the Chamber of Commerce. Some of those companies say their donations will also help areas hit by Maria. \nCelebs pitch in \nEntertainers, athletes and other celebs are pitching in with their own recovery efforts. \nSinger and actress Jennifer Lopez, whose parents are from Puerto Rico, announced Sunday that she would donate $1 million from the proceeds of her Las Vegas show to aid efforts. \nLopez also said Sunday that two planes filled with supplies would be on their way to the island. At the time, they were waiting for air clearance. \nHamilton creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda, who is also of Puerto Rican descent, is trying to help too. Thank you all for making noise on behalf of our island. Making more noise/raising more :moneybag: for :flag-pr: as we speak(that you can dance to) #wait4it \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) September 26, 2017 \nMiranda has for days been asking his Twitter followers to donate to the Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit that supports Latinos. \n\"Thanks to your generosity, first responders from NY are on a chartered plane\" to Puerto Rico, he tweeted Saturday . \"Don't stop now.\" \nFive former U.S. presidents -- Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter -- are also teaming up to raise money for hurricane relief. \nTheir fundraising organization, One America Appeal, has been soliciting donations for victims of Harvey and Irma. It recently announced that it would expand its efforts to aid recovery in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

While all of these can be cured by antibiotics, many people go undiagnosed and untreated. This STD is becoming 'smarter' and harder to treat Only those three STDs and HIV are required by law to be reported to the CDC by physicians. When you include herpes and more of the dozens of diseases which can be transmitted sexually but which are not tracked, the CDC estimates there are more than 20 million new cases of STDs in the United States each year. At least half occur in young people ages 15 to 24. \"STDs are out of control with enormous health implications for Americans,\" said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. The coalition represents state, local and territorial health departments who focus on preventing STDs. Read More \"If not treated, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis can have serious consequences, such as infertility, neurological issues, and an increased risk for HIV,\" said Harvey. Common STDs The most common STD is chlamydia. It's caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis , and like most STDs, is easily transmitted by all forms of sexual activity -- oral, vaginal or anal -- as well as during childbirth. Chlamydia is known as a \"silent\" infection, because most people have no symptoms, which means it often goes untreated. In women, it can ultimately cause pelvic inflammatory disease that can scar and affect fertility. In men, it can cause testicular pain and swelling. Research raises hopes for gonorrhea vaccine Gonorrhea is another bacterial STD that can be silent, but often displays symptoms such as burning during urination and vaginal or penile discharge. If caught anally, it can create itching, bleeding and painful bowel movements. If not treated, gonorrhea can cause severe and permanent health problems, including long-term pain and infertility. Syphilis is the most serious bacterial STD. Left untreated, syphilis can affect the brain, heart and other organs of the body, ultimately leading to death. It's called the \"Great Pretender,\" because the symptoms of syphilis which include rashes and chancres, or sores, fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, headaches, muscles aches and fatigue, mimic other diseases. As the disease progresses, the symptoms go away, and progress silently to it's most deadly stage. At one point, the United States had all but eliminated syphilis, turning it into a \"disease of the past,\" said Bolan. \"Back in the '40s, the advent of penicillin, which is quite effective against syphilis, allowed us to dramatically reduce cases,\" she added. \"I remember a professor in medical school explaining what it was to us but then said 'You'll never see it.' \" Record STD rates drive syphilis in newborns However, the new data show that rates of this potentially deadly disease increased almost 18% between 2015 and 2016, with most of the cases in men who have sex with men. There was also a rise of the disease among women who pass it on to their newborns. There were 628 cases of congenital syphilis among newborns reported in 2016, with more than 40 deaths and severe health complications among the babies who survived. \"For the first time in many years, we are now seeing more cases of babies born with congenital syphilis than babies born with HIV,\" said Harvey. \"It means that women are not getting access to prenatal care, testing and treatment for syphilis. It's an unconscionable situation in America today.\" \"This is a completely preventable problem,\" agreed Bolan. \"Every baby born with syphilis represents a tragic public health system failure. All it takes is a simple STD test and antibiotic treatment to prevent this tragedy from occurring.\" What happened? Bolan and Harvey both point to funding deficits as a huge part of the reason STDs are on the rise. \"Several factors are fueling the STD epidemic,\" Harvey said. \"Funding cutbacks for prevention, education and healthcare programs, an on-going debate about sex education for young people, with cutbacks in that arena, particularly from this administration, and a rise in social media dating apps have all contributed to the rise.\" Another reason is the lack of symptoms for these diseases and a failure of practitioners to educate their patients on what to look for. To counter the problem, the CDC has recently published a provider guide for physicians and is creating a network of clinical training centers for doctors.

And we need to re-educate physicians to look for signs of such 'ancient' diseases as syphilis.\" But an even bigger issue to overcome, Harvey said, is the embarrassment of having an STD. \"Unfortunately, STDs carry enormous stigma in this country, and it's hard for people to come forward for treatment,\" said Harvey. \"Ironically, HIV is an STD, but we have a very visible community who advocates and works to tell stories about the impact of HIV on people's lives. We don't have that going for us with gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia. We need a network of voices that say it's OK to get help.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "gail bolan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cdc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "std prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national coalition of std directors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "centers for disease control and prevention", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn health on facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T01:06:46.017+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1bb18a3cdb9dc0912e630a6cc342bdd1d890bd35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEi13mrvK80LBOfjzOEEG4mCn2ZznCu_.on_ZNAaZ8C0bHbSTbJ5IgrkJQ500eG5Ft.OzqwtRQcRvryAcH5wDXf", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Brace yourself, Republicans -- a bumpy ride's coming (Opinion) - CNN", "title_full": "Brace yourself, Republicans -- a bumpy ride's coming (Opinion) - CNN", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170925070739-01-ryan-mcconnell-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 312, "comments": 0, "shares": 312}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1bb18a3cdb9dc0912e630a6cc342bdd1d890bd35", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWEi13mrvK80LBOfjzOEEG4mCn2ZznCu_.on_ZNAaZ8C0bHbSTbJ5IgrkJQ500eG5Ft.OzqwtRQcRvryAcH5wDXf", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Steve Israel", "published": "2017-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Brace yourself, Republicans -- a bumpy ride's coming (Opinion) - CNN", "text": "Story highlights Steve Israel: Whatever happens to GOP efforts to trash Obamacare, their 2018 midterm election prospects are looking eerily like Democrats' in 2010 And as Senate and House Republicans keep discovering with false starts at repeal bills, they need to brace themselves for more, Israel writes Former US Rep. Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York, is a political novelist and CNN contributor. His next book, \"Big Guns,\" will be released in April. This piece is one in a series of columns for CNN Opinion on life after Congress. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author. \n(CNN) It's not repeal and replace, it's rewind.\nNo matter what the outcome of Republican efforts to trash Obamacare, every day of the 2018 midterm election is looking eerily for them like 2010 did for Democrats. Even now, I still have traumatic flashbacks to that electoral tsunami. Steve Israel At about this point in the 2010 midterm election cycle, Democrats had a confident grip on our majority. Sure, we sensed the headwinds against us. We recognized the strength of the Tea Party, signaling an early gathering of energy for our opponents. We even knew we'd lose seats. Yet our 39-vote margin seemed strong enough to retain the gavel -- maybe not a two-fisted hold, but just enough to keep it in our calloused fingers. Then there was the debate on Obamacare. We were caught somewhere on the political map between doom and dread. If we didn't pass the bill, our base would abandon us in the midterms, dampening voter turnout. If we passed it, swing voters in our most competitive districts would abandon us and vote for Republicans. Either would increase our losses. Read More President Obama's approval was, at this point, comfortably over 50% and slid to the mid-40s by the midterms. President Trump's current approval is at 40% and even a strong and improbable rebound gets him no higher than Obama's worst numbers. I remember the faces of some of my colleagues as the vote on Obamacare neared. In caucus meetings, we listened to passionate (and now familiar) arguments about keeping our campaign promises and passing the bill. Democrats who had won historically Republican districts came to the floor as if en route to their political funerals. Some were enraged that their progressive colleagues didn't understand the backlash they were getting back home. Others came to the floor with glints of defiance and girded for battle in the upcoming elections, knowing that passing the bill was the right thing to do. Single payer is the fight Democrats have been waiting for On March 21, the House passed the Senate's Obamacare bill by a 219-212 vote in the House (the Senate's bill had passed on Christmas Eve with a filibuster-proof 60-39 majority). President Obama signed the bill into law two days later. In the ensuing midterms, we lost 63 seats and our majority in the House; we held our Senate majority despite losing six seats. A study by researchers at the University of Denver and North Carolina State University on the impact of the healthcare vote and other legislation singled out 13 seats we lost because of Obamacare, and found that it was the leading reason that House Democrats had been defeated. Recently, I spoke with former Rep. Baron Hill, an Indiana Democrat. I asked whether he sensed that he might lose his seat when he voted for Obamacare. \"We are elected to lead,\" he told me. \"The ACA was and is good for people in Indiana as well for the country. Republicans successfully demonized it for political reasons. But if we are really sincere about doing what's best for the people we represent, especially on an issue as big as ACA, politics needs to be shelved and leadership needs to prevail.\" I've never believed that Obamacare alone was responsible for Baron Hill's defeat, or for the loss of 62 other seats to Republicans in 2010. But it was the tip of the spear. The economy was still reeling from the 2008 meltdown. The middle class felt betrayed and insecure. The Citizens United decision flooded competitive districts with dark money ads from K Street. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \nThere is one difference between the 2010 races and 2018 (so far). Republicans have outflanked Democrats by taking control of redistricting and fortifying their incumbents. But by every other measure, Republicans looking at 2018 should see shades of 2010. The middle class still feels uncertain. The President is historically unpopular. Democrats have the momentum. And as Senate and House Republicans keep discovering with false starts at repeal bills, passing something that has the support of a measly 33% of Americans may be like tying a rodeo rope around their bucking base, but it's also likely to send many voters in search of another horse. Which means Republicans in Congress should brace themselves.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "steve israel", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obamacare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baron hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "citizens united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tea party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of denver and north carolina state university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T01:06:48.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4ff27b8940d612478efb17923c8aa97322ad3dec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNbaiwhEOWbLxD.Rni3HM4pRI5bbUM_QG3NhAFd3CG.pWhzsywNbqfaZQl3XrxbpuJU-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Politics", "title": "EPA chief getting his own $25,000 sound-proof booth", "title_full": "EPA chief getting his own $25,000 sound-proof booth", "published": "2017-09-27T01:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170509115137-epa-pruitt-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 5913, "comments": 3, "shares": 5913}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 59}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4ff27b8940d612478efb17923c8aa97322ad3dec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsOz3JcsHheNbaiwhEOWbLxD.Rni3HM4pRI5bbUM_QG3NhAFd3CG.pWhzsywNbqfaZQl3XrxbpuJU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T01:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "EPA chief getting his own $25,000 sound-proof booth", "text": "EPA moving agents to provide 24/7 security 01:29 Washington (CNN) Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt is known for mandating note-free meetings, he's the only administrator to have requested his 24/7 own security detail and now he's about to have his own sound-proof booth. The EPA is spending close to $25,000 to construct a secure space for Pruitt within the agency, according to government contracting records first obtained and reported by the Washington Post . The booth, also known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), will be a customized model for Pruitt to conduct meetings, calls and other lines of communication undisturbed, according to the Post. The $24,570 contract was granted to Acoustical Solutions in August. The Richmond, Virginia-based company offers soundproof supplies ranging from acoustic panels and fabrics to sound diffusers. \"They had a lot of modifications,\" said Steve Snider, an acoustic sales consultant with the company, told the Post. \"Their main goal was they wanted essentially a secure phone booth that couldn't be breached from a data point of view or from someone standing outside eavesdropping.\" Read More The EPA did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN. Pruitt has taken several unusual steps regarding security and meetings at EPA. It's been reported that the administrator, who prefers to interact with just the political appointees inside the agency, has banned note-taking during meetings and also recently requested funds for round-the-clock bodyguards. While no previous EPA administrators had such a setup, the booth will not be the first SCIF constructed within the agency. According to former EPA employees, the agency has long maintained a private room. \"This seems like the height of paranoia to me. As someone who spent a lot of time in the administrator's office, I can tell you that there was nothing like this,\" Liz Purchia, former head of communications at EPA, told CNN. \"EPA already has a secure room for sharing information classified as secret,\" she added. \"I can't imagine why this taxpayer expense would be necessary and why an extra secure room is needed in his office other than to avoid staff and the Office of Homeland Security from documenting use of the room and the information that warrants protection.\" Former EPA general counsel Avi Garbow also said he was unaware that any modifications or additions needed to be made to the EPA's SCIF. \"EPA has long maintained a SCIF -- which I utilized myself under appropriate circumstances -- and it appeared to be fully serviceable in its limited use,\" he told CNN.

Unmentioned was the President's use of Republican National Committee funds to pay for his personal attorneys' fees stemming from the federal investigation into the Trump campaign's potential role in the Russian meddling during the 2016 election. The RNC confirmed last week it spent more than $230,000 on the President's legal bills in August. Republican donors attending the dinner at the ritzy French restaurant Le Cirque spent at least $35,000 per couple. A $100,000 donation got a couple of donors \"VIP access,\" while anything over $250,000 earned the donors a seat at a table with the President ahead of his remarks, an RNC official said. Attendees at the high-dollar fundraiser, including New York billionaire John Catsimatidis and former NBC CEO Bob Wright, said Trump appeared to feel at home among the crowd, which included many of his former New York City real estate pals. Read More As he delved into his conversations with world leaders, Trump explained that several of his counterparts have tried to dissuade him from his claims that the US is being taken advantage of by other countries, Catsimatidis said. He spoke in particular about an interaction with the Canadian prime minister, saying that Trudeau once argued that the US had an $11 billion trade surplus with Canada -- rather than the deficit Trump has long claimed, a source in the room told CNN. Trump asked one of his staffers to leave the room and check the numbers. The staffer returned to say that while Trudeau was correct, the numbers didn't account for the ways in which Canada has benefited from provisions in NAFTA Trump deems unfair, like on lumber. \"With math like that, we'd all be broke,\" Trump quipped to the crowd of wealthy businessmen, the source said. Trump has vowed to renegotiate or end NAFTA, the free trade agreement between the US and Canada, and has struck a combative tone in the process. Catsimatidis said Trump told attendees he was pushing ahead on tax reform and did not dwell on the health care defeat. Wright, the former NBC executive, said Trump was equally in a good mood during the roundtable portion of the night. Wright said Trump focused in particular on the upcoming unveiling of the GOP's tax reform plan, saying he was excited about the plan. Trump did express in the roundtable portion how he was disappointed over Republicans' failure on tax reform and noted how tough it is to get consensus in Washington. Trump also spoke about the NFL during his speech, largely reiterating his position on the issue of the National Anthem protests and the importance of honoring the flag. He did not speak about the owners who condemned him or launch any new attacks, three attendees said. Notable attendees included Trump's children Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and several of his New York real estate pals, including Howard Lorber. The high-dollar fundraiser came a week after the RNC confirmed it is spending money from its legal fund to pay for Trump's legal bills -- as well as Trump Jr.'s. The RNC has also spent nearly $200,000 to support the legal fees of Trump Jr., who became a focus of the investigation after he admitted to meeting with a Russian attorney last summer he believed would provide him with incriminating information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. RNC covering more than $230,000 in Trump legal fees The Trump campaign is also paying some of Trump Jr.'s legal bills and spent nearly $700,000 in legal consulting fees -- or about 15.5% of its total expenses between April 1 and June 30, according to the latest Federal Election Commission report. The RNC payments to Trump attorneys were drawn from the party's legal expenses account, which allows the party to pay for legal bills stemming from its campaign activities. While donors must elect to donate to the legal fund, wealthy donors who pay to attend high-dollar fundraisers like Tuesday night's typically spread their money into several RNC accounts -- including its legal fund -- to stay in line with contribution limits. A June fundraiser hosted by \"Trump Victory,\" the RNC-Trump campaign joint fundraising apparatus, funneled as much as 30% of its top-dollar donations to its legal proceedings account.

The booth, also known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), will be a customized model for Pruitt to conduct meetings, calls and other lines of communication undisturbed, according to the Post. The $24,570 contract was granted to Acoustical Solutions in August. The Richmond, Virginia-based company offers soundproof supplies ranging from acoustic panels and fabrics to sound diffusers. \"They had a lot of modifications,\" said Steve Snider, an acoustic sales consultant with the company, told the Post. \"Their main goal was they wanted essentially a secure phone booth that couldn't be breached from a data point of view or from someone standing outside eavesdropping.\" Read More The EPA did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN. Pruitt has taken several unusual steps regarding security and meetings at EPA. It's been reported that the administrator, who prefers to interact with just the political appointees inside the agency, has banned note-taking during meetings and also recently requested funds for round-the-clock bodyguards. While no previous EPA administrators had such a setup, the booth will not be the first SCIF constructed within the agency. According to former EPA employees, the agency has long maintained a private room. \"This seems like the height of paranoia to me. As someone who spent a lot of time in the administrator's office, I can tell you that there was nothing like this,\" Liz Purchia, former head of communications at EPA, told CNN. \"EPA already has a secure room for sharing information classified as secret,\" she added. \"I can't imagine why this taxpayer expense would be necessary and why an extra secure room is needed in his office other than to avoid staff and the Office of Homeland Security from documenting use of the room and the information that warrants protection.\" Former EPA general counsel Avi Garbow also said he was unaware that any modifications or additions needed to be made to the EPA's SCIF. \"EPA has long maintained a SCIF -- which I utilized myself under appropriate circumstances -- and it appeared to be fully serviceable in its limited use,\" he told CNN.

Unmentioned was the President's use of Republican National Committee funds to pay for his personal attorneys' fees stemming from the federal investigation into the Trump campaign's potential role in the Russian meddling during the 2016 election. The RNC confirmed last week it spent more than $230,000 on the President's legal bills in August. Republican donors attending the dinner at the ritzy French restaurant Le Cirque spent at least $35,000 per couple. A $100,000 donation got a couple of donors \"VIP access,\" while anything over $250,000 earned the donors a seat at a table with the President ahead of his remarks, an RNC official said. Attendees at the high-dollar fundraiser, including New York billionaire John Catsimatidis and former NBC CEO Bob Wright, said Trump appeared to feel at home among the crowd, which included many of his former New York City real estate pals. Read More As he delved into his conversations with world leaders, Trump explained that several of his counterparts have tried to dissuade him from his claims that the US is being taken advantage of by other countries, Catsimatidis said. He spoke in particular about an interaction with the Canadian prime minister, saying that Trudeau once argued that the US had an $11 billion trade surplus with Canada -- rather than the deficit Trump has long claimed, a source in the room told CNN. Trump asked one of his staffers to leave the room and check the numbers. The staffer returned to say that while Trudeau was correct, the numbers didn't account for the ways in which Canada has benefited from provisions in NAFTA Trump deems unfair, like on lumber. \"With math like that, we'd all be broke,\" Trump quipped to the crowd of wealthy businessmen, the source said. Trump has vowed to renegotiate or end NAFTA, the free trade agreement between the US and Canada, and has struck a combative tone in the process. Catsimatidis said Trump told attendees he was pushing ahead on tax reform and did not dwell on the health care defeat. Wright, the former NBC executive, said Trump was equally in a good mood during the roundtable portion of the night. Wright said Trump focused in particular on the upcoming unveiling of the GOP's tax reform plan, saying he was excited about the plan. Trump did express in the roundtable portion how he was disappointed over Republicans' failure on tax reform and noted how tough it is to get consensus in Washington. Trump also spoke about the NFL during his speech, largely reiterating his position on the issue of the National Anthem protests and the importance of honoring the flag. He did not speak about the owners who condemned him or launch any new attacks, three attendees said. Notable attendees included Trump's children Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and several of his New York real estate pals, including Howard Lorber. The high-dollar fundraiser came a week after the RNC confirmed it is spending money from its legal fund to pay for Trump's legal bills -- as well as Trump Jr.'s. The RNC has also spent nearly $200,000 to support the legal fees of Trump Jr., who became a focus of the investigation after he admitted to meeting with a Russian attorney last summer he believed would provide him with incriminating information about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. RNC covering more than $230,000 in Trump legal fees The Trump campaign is also paying some of Trump Jr.'s legal bills and spent nearly $700,000 in legal consulting fees -- or about 15.5% of its total expenses between April 1 and June 30, according to the latest Federal Election Commission report. The RNC payments to Trump attorneys were drawn from the party's legal expenses account, which allows the party to pay for legal bills stemming from its campaign activities. While donors must elect to donate to the legal fund, wealthy donors who pay to attend high-dollar fundraisers like Tuesday night's typically spread their money into several RNC accounts -- including its legal fund -- to stay in line with contribution limits. A June fundraiser hosted by \"Trump Victory,\" the RNC-Trump campaign joint fundraising apparatus, funneled as much as 30% of its top-dollar donations to its legal proceedings account. An RNC spokeswoman declined to provide the breakdown of how funds raised from Tuesday night's dinner would be allocated.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump jr.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "le cirque", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rnc", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "federal election commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican national committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T01:15:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "35a9764d32e07ee563217ebc762245bd5c2dba1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsQVDBKSNTbJ3911BpAW9d6lAwsWN1NB9DsmcGUWiQd5ZrhsN2kbdYGWJEjWonGSk7Q8NCPCKYENI-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "New STD cases at record high, CDC says", "title_full": "New STD cases at record high, CDC says", "published": "2017-09-27T00:40:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150817105823-vd-poster-tease-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 11159, "comments": 0, "shares": 11159}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 8}, "linkedin": {"shares": 174}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "35a9764d32e07ee563217ebc762245bd5c2dba1e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsQVDBKSNTbJ3911BpAW9d6lAwsWN1NB9DsmcGUWiQd5ZrhsN2kbdYGWJEjWonGSk7Q8NCPCKYENI-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T00:40:00.000+03:00", "title": "New STD cases at record high, CDC says", "text": "Story highlights Dangerous but preventable STDs are on the rise, CDC says 2016 saw the highest number of STDs ever reported (CNN) In 2016, Americans were infected with more than 2 million new cases of gonorrhea, syphilis and chlamydia, the highest number of these sexually transmitted diseases ever reported, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.\n\"Clearly we need to reverse this disturbing trend,\" said Dr. Gail Bolan, director of CDC's Division of STD Prevention. \"The CDC cannot do this alone and we need every community in America to be aware that this risk is out there and help educate their citizens on how to avoid it.\" The agency's annual Sexually Transmitted Disease Surveillance Report shows that more than 1.6 million of the new cases were from chlamydia, 470,000 were from gonorrhea and nearly 28,000 cases were primary and secondary syphilis, the most infectious stages of the disease, according to the CDC. While all of these can be cured by antibiotics, many people go undiagnosed and untreated. This STD is becoming 'smarter' and harder to treat Only those three STDs and HIV are required by law to be reported to the CDC by physicians. When you include herpes and more of the dozens of diseases which can be transmitted sexually but which are not tracked, the CDC estimates there are more than 20 million new cases of STDs in the United States each year. At least half occur in young people ages 15 to 24. \"STDs are out of control with enormous health implications for Americans,\" said David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors. The coalition represents state, local and territorial health departments who focus on preventing STDs. Read More \"If not treated, gonorrhea, chlamydia and syphilis can have serious consequences, such as infertility, neurological issues, and an increased risk for HIV,\" said Harvey. Common STDs The most common STD is chlamydia. It's caused by the bacteria chlamydia trachomatis , and like most STDs, is easily transmitted by all forms of sexual activity -- oral, vaginal or anal -- as well as during childbirth. Chlamydia is known as a \"silent\" infection, because most people have no symptoms, which means it often goes untreated. In women, it can ultimately cause pelvic inflammatory disease that can scar and affect fertility. In men, it can cause testicular pain and swelling. Research raises hopes for gonorrhea vaccine Gonorrhea is another bacterial STD that can be silent, but often displays symptoms such as burning during urination and vaginal or penile discharge. If caught anally, it can create itching, bleeding and painful bowel movements. If not treated, gonorrhea can cause severe and permanent health problems, including long-term pain and infertility. Syphilis is the most serious bacterial STD. Left untreated, syphilis can affect the brain, heart and other organs of the body, ultimately leading to death. It's called the \"Great Pretender,\" because the symptoms of syphilis which include rashes and chancres, or sores, fever, swollen lymph glands, sore throat, headaches, muscles aches and fatigue, mimic other diseases. As the disease progresses, the symptoms go away, and progress silently to it's most deadly stage. At one point, the United States had all but eliminated syphilis, turning it into a \"disease of the past,\" said Bolan. \"Back in the '40s, the advent of penicillin, which is quite effective against syphilis, allowed us to dramatically reduce cases,\" she added. \"I remember a professor in medical school explaining what it was to us but then said 'You'll never see it.' \" Record STD rates drive syphilis in newborns However, the new data show that rates of this potentially deadly disease increased almost 18% between 2015 and 2016, with most of the cases in men who have sex with men. There was also a rise of the disease among women who pass it on to their newborns. There were 628 cases of congenital syphilis among newborns reported in 2016, with more than 40 deaths and severe health complications among the babies who survived. \"For the first time in many years, we are now seeing more cases of babies born with congenital syphilis than babies born with HIV,\" said Harvey. \"It means that women are not getting access to prenatal care, testing and treatment for syphilis. It's an unconscionable situation in America today.\" \"This is a completely preventable problem,\" agreed Bolan. \"Every baby born with syphilis represents a tragic public health system failure. All it takes is a simple STD test and antibiotic treatment to prevent this tragedy from occurring.\" What happened? Bolan and Harvey both point to funding deficits as a huge part of the reason STDs are on the rise. \"Several factors are fueling the STD epidemic,\" Harvey said. \"Funding cutbacks for prevention, education and healthcare programs, an on-going debate about sex education for young people, with cutbacks in that arena, particularly from this administration, and a rise in social media dating apps have all contributed to the rise.\" Another reason is the lack of symptoms for these diseases and a failure of practitioners to educate their patients on what to look for. To counter the problem, the CDC has recently published a provider guide for physicians and is creating a network of clinical training centers for doctors. Join\n\"The fact that so many of these diseases are asymptomatic, which few tell-tale signals, mean that men and women aren't getting into their doctor to be tested,\" said Bolan. \"We need to get the word out that everyone needs a yearly checkup.

Sources with knowledge of the ads tell CNN that they ranged from posts promoting gun rights and the Second Amendment to posts warning about what they said was the threat undocumented immigrants posed to American democracy. Some ads promoted Black Lives Matter while others decried it, as the Washington Post reported Monday . \nThe apparent goal of the ads, the sources who spoke with CNN said, was to amplify political discord and fuel an atmosphere of incivility and chaos around the 2016 presidential campaign, not necessarily to promote one candidate or cause over another. \nRelated: Facebook could still be weaponized again for the 2018 midterms \nSenate Intelligence Committee chair Richard Burr, a Republican, told reporters Tuesday that the use of Facebook and other social media platforms by Russian-linked accounts appears to be about creating chaos on both ends of the political spectrum, not necessarily collusion between the Trump camp and Russian officials. \n\"Listen, I've said I don't think this is about collusion. Facebook is a company that most advertisers rely on Facebook's information to determine what the target is,\" Burr told reporters. \"I think clearly there was an effort to bring some chaos to groups on the right and the left, so there's nothing that, at least preliminary, would lean toward one candidate versus the other. I think there was equal money sent trying to create some type of chaos on both sides of the political or ideological spectrum. We'll find more as we go in.\" \nBurr and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said they had not seen the Facebook ads sold to Russian-linked accounts as of Tuesday afternoon. \nBurr also said he doesn't want the committee to be the one to make the ads public when they are handed over by Facebook. \n\"We don't routinely release any information that's shared with the committee and I'd like to keep the committee in that mode,\" he said. \nFacebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, said in a statement earlier this month that \"the vast majority of ads run by these accounts didn't specifically reference the U.S. presidential election, voting or a particular candidate.\" \n\"Rather,\" Stamos said, \"the ads and accounts appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum -- touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\" \nWarner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said this week that the aim of the ad-buyers \"was to sow chaos.\" \n\"In many cases, it was more about voter suppression rather than increasing turnout,\" he told reporters. \nFacebook has already handed over copies of the ads and information about the relevant accounts to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is conducting an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. It is expected to give the same information to the Senate and House Intelligence Committee later this week. \nStill, for Congress as for the public, many questions remain. \nFacebook has not yet revealed where or how the ads were targeted -- that is, what kinds of people were shown the ads, or where they may have lived. To date, the company has only said that one quarter of the ads were geographically targeted, but they have not disclosed specific locations or said anything about targeting based on demographics or interest groups. \nRelated: Facebook is planning big changes to political ads on its site. Are they enough? \nThe targeting issue is especially important because, if it appears that the targeting was particularly sophisticated, there may be questions raised about how the Russians knew where to direct their ads, and information about the targeting could help investigators determine whether or not there was any collusion between these ad buyers and the Trump campaign. \nThe Senate Intelligence Committee will also hear from Twitter on Thursday about how foreign nationals may have used its ad service to influence the 2016 election. Twitter has declined to shed any light so far on what information it plans to give to Congress. \nMeanwhile, the disclosure that Russians used social media advertising to meddle in American politics has brought new scrutiny on the big tech companies. \nThat scrutiny has forced tech leaders like Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to change their public stances regarding social media's role in the 2016 election. \nIn the days after the election, Zuckerberg said it was \"crazy\" to think that fake news on Facebook played a major role in the outcome of the election. As the Washington Post reported Sunday , Zuckerberg even downplayed the issue after President Obama personally appealed to him last November to take the threat of fake news seriously. \nNow, Zuckerberg is promising a number of changes to the platform to prevent foreign nationals from influencing future elections. \nLast week, he announced that future political ads will include a disclosure about which Facebook page posted them, and visitors to that page will be able to see all the ads a group has run on the platform. \nZuckerberg said Facebook is also strengthening its own review process for political ads, which are often bought through Facebook's automated system without any interaction between buyers and Facebook employees. The company is adding 250 more people to its election integrity team, expanding its partnerships with official election commissions around the world to flag risks, and looking into ways of sharing similar information about bad actors with other tech companies. It is also looking into expanding its anti-bullying system to political harassment.

The FDA is launching a pilot program that will give vetted tech companies pre-approval to work on medical software. The government agency oversees drug and medical device approval, in addition to food and health products. It is working with nine companies, including Apple, Samsung, Alphabet's Verily, FitBit, Roche and Johnson & Johnson. The program is a slight departure from how the process usually works. It is focused on approving companies themselves instead of each individual product. Getting FDA approval for individual products can be a lengthy and expensive process. This could allow companies more leeway to innovate quickly. \nRelated: Apple's newest gadgets include iPhone X and Apple Watch Series 3 \n\"Our method for regulating digital health products must recognize the unique and iterative characteristics of these products,\" said Scott Gottlieb, the FDA commissioner, in a statement . \"We need to modernize our regulatory framework so that it matches the kind of innovation we're being asked to evaluate.\" \nThe FDA will use to the program to determine if its possible for companies to submit less information to the agency when seeking pre-market approval for a product, or if some products can skip the step all together. \nApple has shown interest in the medical space for years, most recently with Heart Study, a new trial that uses the Apple Watch to detect atrial fibrillation. The company said it was working with the FDA on the program. Verily, Alphabet's life sciences division, is working on biomedical medicine, smart contact lenses and glucose monitoring products. \nMore smartphones and wearables are cramming in sensors that can handle medical monitoring, like heart rate, body temperature and activity levels. It makes sense that the companies would consider making the leap from wellness to medical applications. \nApple had no comment on the announcement.
