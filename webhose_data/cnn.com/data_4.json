Despite the me-too-ism of it all, the result is a slick, impressively cast trip down memory lane, saddled with the unwieldy title \"Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders.\"\nBorrowing elements from its fictional flagship -- down to the on-air graphics and Ka-Chung sound -- the series dredges up parent-killing brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez, a sensational 1989 case old enough that their defense attorney, Leslie Abramson (Edie Falco), is actually shown buying a newspaper out of a street vending machine. Still, where the original \"Law & Order\" speeds up the judicial process -- ripped-from-the-headlines investigation, trial, verdict all in an hour -- the \"True Crime\" format has the advantage of slowing it down, fleshing out these characters and some of the more salacious tidbits. The multiple prongs of the case -- from the police investigation to the brothers to their therapist (Josh Charles) and his chatty mistress (Heather Graham) -- add layers to this tawdry tale, even before the lads are arrested and Abramson steps in to represent them. \" allowfullscreen> The brutal murder immediately sets off shock waves in tony Beverly Hills, but detective Les Zoeller (Sam Jaeger) is almost instantly suspicious of the boys, with younger brother Erik (Gus Helper) rushing off to play tennis and Lyle (Miles Gaston Villanueva) quickly embarking on a spending spree after the grisly murders. Moreover, a little digging begins to unearth clues that suggest all was not as idyllic in the Menendez home as outward appearances would suggest. Read More \"Guns, pills and money. What could possibly go wrong here?\" Zoeller muses. Previously turned into a miniseries in the '90s, the Menendez case represents an artifact from the TV movie's bad old days. Yet the morphing of that appetite into a more fleshed-out eight-episode limited series offers the possibility of bringing more depth to the characters, as well as nice little flourishes like casting \"ER's\" Anthony Edwards as the judge. In success, of course, NBC and producer Dick Wolf will face the high-class problem of finding another \"true crime\" worth of similar treatment, as opposed to, say, just an hour of \"Dateline.\" That's no small feat, considering that \"American Crime Story\" and others, including documentarians emboldened by \"Making a Murderer\" and \"The Jinx,\" are hungrily sifting through the same grab bag of notorious trials. For now, though, \"The Menendez Murders\" earns a favorable verdict -- a shrewd choice to inaugurate the latest wrinkle in a well-oiled TV franchise that's as durable as crime and punishment. \"Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders\" premieres Sept. 26 at 10 p.m. on NBC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "zoeller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony edwards", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edie falco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh charles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "les zoeller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik menendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ka-chung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leslie abramson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dick wolf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abramson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam jaeger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "heather graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gus helper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "menendez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miles gaston villanueva", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "beverly hills", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T09:42:59.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4b19840adff41a4b94280d29f8602e5cd416eea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwfLP24YtKw5piVpRsbG_uTwqQ5pWLRxnrBACtupSpCUzPrc13LgL1t6XoCE3xvXCME_9UUsm68wGUL_oxGpkpR9zBYWqpXvx48-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_world.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - World", "title": "Saudi Arabia eases restrictions on women driving - CNN Video", "title_full": "Saudi Arabia eases restrictions on women driving - CNN Video", "published": "2017-09-27T09:51:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926180000-saudi-arabia-agrees-to-let-women-drive-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 26, "comments": 0, "shares": 26}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4b19840adff41a4b94280d29f8602e5cd416eea1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwfLP24YtKw5piVpRsbG_uTwqQ5pWLRxnrBACtupSpCUzPrc13LgL1t6XoCE3xvXCME_9UUsm68wGUL_oxGpkpR9zBYWqpXvx48-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T09:51:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saudi Arabia eases restrictions on women driving - CNN Video", "text": "MUST WATCH Saudi Arabia eases restrictions on women driving Will Saudia Arabia's new law to allow women to drive lead to more freedoms?

Story highlights Jutting initially accepted his guilty verdict, describing it as \"just\" His lawyers said the ea will be heard in December Hong Kong (CNN) Rurik Jutting, the British expatriate banker turned double murderer, is appealing his conviction, his lawyer told CNN. Jutting was found guilty last year by a Hong Kong court of torturing and killing two Indonesian women , Sumarti Ningsih and Seneng Mujiasih, at his home in the city's Wan Chai district in 2014. The jury returned a unanimous verdict on both counts of murder and the 31-year-old Jutting was sentenced to two concurrent mandatory life sentences. At the time, Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said Jutting -- who claimed diminished responsibility on the grounds of psychological problems -- plumbed \"the very depths of depravity\" in the treatment of his victims. Jutting told the court he was \"haunted daily by the memory of my actions\" and accepted the verdict as \"just.\" Read More However, his lawyer Michael Vidler told CNN Wednesday that Jutting is appealing his conviction. The South China Morning Post reported the appeal was filed several months ago. Vidler said Jutting's case will be heard by the Hong Kong Court of Appeals on December 12. Jutting's victims Seneng Mujiasih and Sumarti Ningsih. Simon Young, associate dean of law at the University of Hong Kong, told CNN Jutting's most likely tactic at appeal was to challenge the judge's directions to the jury. \"Alternatively there is always the possibility that new evidence, perhaps new medical evidence that would put his diminished responsibility defence beyond doubt has surfaced,\" he said, adding that the defense team may also rely on subsequent decisions by higher courts on diminished responsibility and other points of law. Two murders in six days Hong Kong sadist: British banker's descent into depravity On October 27, Jutting killed 23-year-old Ningsih after keeping her captive in his flat for three days. He tortured and degraded her, filming the acts on his iPhone, before slashing her throat in the shower. Three days later, on November 1, with Ningsih's body in a suitcase on his balcony, Jutting killed 26-year-old Mujiasih after she wouldn't stop calling for help, minutes after entering his apartment. Over the course of the six days in his apartment, Jutting made numerous videos on his phone, describing his plans for future torture and his fears of being caught. Before the trial began the judge warned prospective jurors the evidence would be \"very disturbing indeed,\" especially the footage recorded on Jutting's iPhone. 'Depraved drug and alcohol addict' During the trial last year, both sides accepted that Jutting had killed the two women. The verdict hinged solely on the issue of \"diminished responsibility,\" whether his mental state at the time of the killings substantially impaired his responsibility. If the jurors believed as much, Stuart-Moore had instructed them to to find for the lesser charge of manslaughter, not murder. Jutting's lawyers argued that he suffered from a debilitating combination of mental problems -- alcohol and cocaine addiction, a narcissistic personality and a sexual sadism disorder. The court rejected that claim however, with Stuart-Moore saying Jutting had failed to show a \"shred of remorse\" and urging \"no one be fooled by (his) superficial charm.\" CNN's Ben Westcott contributed reporting.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rurik jutting", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "simon young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael vidler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mujiasih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seneng mujiasih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael stuart-moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben westcott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumarti ningsih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart-moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vidler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ningsih", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hong kong court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china morning post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn jutting", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wan chai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T10:01:09.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "26b0a0af08387da2ab88082847a82e51334965ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWGXaWaGWOEKT_Ubc.XPSm153no4MpNqLhlmLZC973hwKij.ksjwUmsI0uCakCs2PC4FLiLGiQjl.A--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things", "title_full": "Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170209161556-saudi-arabia-women-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14577, "comments": 0, "shares": 14577}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 22}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "26b0a0af08387da2ab88082847a82e51334965ca", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWGXaWaGWOEKT_Ubc.XPSm153no4MpNqLhlmLZC973hwKij.ksjwUmsI0uCakCs2PC4FLiLGiQjl.A--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamie Tarabay, CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things", "text": "(CNN) In a first for the conservative religious kingdom, Saudi Arabia has declared that women will finally be able to drive , the culmination of years of activism and appeals both from within and outside the Gulf nation .\nThe royal decree, announced live on state television Tuesday, will come into effect in June next year.

The jury returned a unanimous verdict on both counts of murder and the 31-year-old Jutting was sentenced to two concurrent mandatory life sentences. At the time, Judge Michael Stuart-Moore said Jutting -- who claimed diminished responsibility on the grounds of psychological problems -- plumbed \"the very depths of depravity\" in the treatment of his victims. Jutting told the court he was \"haunted daily by the memory of my actions\" and accepted the verdict as \"just.\" Read More However, his lawyer Michael Vidler told CNN Wednesday that Jutting is appealing his conviction. The South China Morning Post reported the appeal was filed several months ago. Vidler said Jutting's case will be heard by the Hong Kong Court of Appeals on December 12. Jutting's victims Seneng Mujiasih and Sumarti Ningsih. Simon Young, associate dean of law at the University of Hong Kong, told CNN Jutting's most likely tactic at appeal was to challenge the judge's directions to the jury. \"Alternatively there is always the possibility that new evidence, perhaps new medical evidence that would put his diminished responsibility defence beyond doubt has surfaced,\" he said, adding that the defense team may also rely on subsequent decisions by higher courts on diminished responsibility and other points of law. Two murders in six days Hong Kong sadist: British banker's descent into depravity On October 27, Jutting killed 23-year-old Ningsih after keeping her captive in his flat for three days. He tortured and degraded her, filming the acts on his iPhone, before slashing her throat in the shower. Three days later, on November 1, with Ningsih's body in a suitcase on his balcony, Jutting killed 26-year-old Mujiasih after she wouldn't stop calling for help, minutes after entering his apartment. Over the course of the six days in his apartment, Jutting made numerous videos on his phone, describing his plans for future torture and his fears of being caught. Before the trial began the judge warned prospective jurors the evidence would be \"very disturbing indeed,\" especially the footage recorded on Jutting's iPhone. 'Depraved drug and alcohol addict' During the trial last year, both sides accepted that Jutting had killed the two women. The verdict hinged solely on the issue of \"diminished responsibility,\" whether his mental state at the time of the killings substantially impaired his responsibility. If the jurors believed as much, Stuart-Moore had instructed them to to find for the lesser charge of manslaughter, not murder. Jutting's lawyers argued that he suffered from a debilitating combination of mental problems -- alcohol and cocaine addiction, a narcissistic personality and a sexual sadism disorder. The court rejected that claim however, with Stuart-Moore saying Jutting had failed to show a \"shred of remorse\" and urging \"no one be fooled by (his) superficial charm.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "simon young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael vidler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mujiasih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seneng mujiasih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael stuart-moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sumarti ningsih", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart-moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vidler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ningsih", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hong kong court of appeals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china morning post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn jutting", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong story", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wan chai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T10:14:30.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9cc23b7d32b8e08f352d553553e844ce184c74ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls9.aF2y62r1W5YM5O.LZ2FiupGtdxT0UxfJrfHMGefi3X4bwHETm5FAmoQ1j0XxDsapJp7kH6tz_gXjgMHQ4SdA--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Saudi women will be able to drive, but they still can't do these things", "title_full": "Saudi women will be able to drive, but they still can't do these things", "published": "2017-09-27T09:59:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170209161556-saudi-arabia-women-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 14577, "comments": 0, "shares": 14577}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 22}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9cc23b7d32b8e08f352d553553e844ce184c74ba", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33Ls9.aF2y62r1W5YM5O.LZ2FiupGtdxT0UxfJrfHMGefi3X4bwHETm5FAmoQ1j0XxDsapJp7kH6tz_gXjgMHQ4SdA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T09:59:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saudi women will be able to drive, but they still can't do these things", "text": "Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things By Jamie Tarabay, CNN Updated 0715 GMT (1515 HKT) September 30, 2017 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Did Saudi King snub President Obama? (CNN) In a first for the conservative religious kingdom, Saudi Arabia has declared that women will finally be able to drive , the culmination of years of activism and appeals both from within and outside the Gulf nation . The royal decree, announced live on state television Tuesday, will come into effect in June next year. A newly-formed committee will present its findings within 30 days on how the policy should be implemented. JUST WATCHED MUST WATCH 'Daring to Drive' as a woman in Saudi Arabia 07:39 Saudi women will reportedly be able to apply for their own driving licenses without having to secure the permission of their male guardians. However, rules that govern the guardianship of women continue to restrict many aspects of every day life for the country's female population. Saudi Arabia's election to UN women's commission draws ire Saudi Arabia, which adheres to some of the strictest interpretations of Sunni Islam in the world, has long prevented women from taking on a larger role in its society. The 2016 Global Gender Gap Report by the World Economic Forum ranked the kingdom 141 out of 144 countries on gender parity . Trailing behind Saudi Arabia were Syria, Pakistan and Yemen. Read More What women in Saudi Arabia can do: -- Vote in local elections. In 2015 women cast ballots for the first time ever during municipal elections, a vote in which they were also allowed to campaign for public office. But female candidates weren't allowed to speak to male voters and couldn't have men and women mixing in their campaign offices. -- Be appointed to the Consultative Council. At least 17 women were elected during the 2015 municipal vote . The late King Abdullah issued a decree in 2011 that gave women the vote and two years later, ordered that at least 20% of seats in the Consultative Council be set aside for women. -- Attain a college education. In 2015 a government report found that there were more Saudi women studying in universities than men . -- Play sports and compete in the Olympics. Saudi Arabia sent two women to the Olympics in 2012. In 2016 it send four. What Saudi Arabia's royal reshuffle means for the world What women in Saudi Arabia cannot do: -- Marry, divorce, travel, get a job or have elective surgery without permission from their male guardians. Women still are beholden to restrictive guardianship laws that govern nearly every aspect of their lives. In cases where a woman's father is deceased or absent, her husband, a male relative, brother, or in some cases, even a son, must give his approval before a woman can obtain often basic entitlements. -- Mix freely with members of the opposite sex. Some exceptions include hospitals, banks and medical colleges . In 2013 authorities ordered shops that employ both men and women to build \"separation walls\" to enforce rules preventing the sexes from mixing together. -- Appear in public without wearing a full-length black abaya. The all-encompassing loose robe is meant to protect women's modesty in public. Saudi activist, Manal Al Sharif, drives her car in Dubai in October 2013 in defiance of the authorities to campaign for women's rights to drive in Saudi Arabia. -- Conduct certain business without a male sponsor.

Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said. About half the residents do not have running water. Puerto Ricans are waiting hours in line to get gas, food and cash. Gas stations and supermarkets are rationing supplies, while banks are running low on cash. \"Right now we are in emergency mode,\" Rossell\u00f3 said on Wednesday afternoon. \"Our focus is not necessarily restoring energy. The energy grid has been destroyed. ... And we need to rebuild it. That does not get rebuilt in days.\" Asked if he thought the federal government was doing everything it can to help the island, Rossell\u00f3 said, \"Well, they are. This is an unprecedented event. President Trump has been in close communication with me practically every day making sure we have the assets, giving orders to his team so that they can execute.\" Read More The governor said getting aid where it's needed has been a challenge because of the magnitude of the destruction on the island. \"This has been the biggest catastrophe in the history Puerto Rico in terms of natural disasters,\" he said. Vital aid stranded at Puerto Rico's main port Critics said the government's aid effort could be improved if Washington lifted the Jones Act, an obscure, nearly 100-year-old law that requires all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans. The law had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive to ship things from the US mainland to Puerto Rico. Trump said Wednesday \"we're thinking\" about lifting the Jones Act for Puerto Rican ports in the wake of Hurricane Maria, but he said a \"lot of shippers\" don't want it lifted. Rossell\u00f3 said he had not asked the President to lift the Jones Act so aid might flow more fully to Puerto Rico. \"I did not solicit that to him personally but it is something that would help Puerto Rico, certainly, at least in the short run,\" Rossell\u00f3 said. DHS denies that it rejected request to loosen shipping rules for Puerto Rico As desperate Puerto Ricans wait for aid, there's not enough food to go around. In the town of Utuado, Lydia Rivera has started to ration crackers and drink rainwater to keep her two grandchildren alive. \"No water, no food,\" Rivera told CNN. People carry water in bottles retrieved from a canal this week in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico. The hurricane killed 16 people in Puerto Rico, 27 in the island nation of Dominica and one in the US Virgin Islands. As Puerto Rico attempts to recover from the disaster, there were signs that aid sent from the US mainland isn't making it to people in need . And the US recovery efforts in Puerto Rico have been markedly different from the recent responses to other Americans in hurricane-stricken Texas and Florida. Federal relief efforts With supplies running out, many Puerto Ricans are collecting water from mountain streams. JUST WATCHED Hundreds stranded at Puerto Rican airport Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nHundreds stranded at Puerto Rican airport 02:09 Harry Torres said the water is all they have for cleaning and drinking until help comes. They've heard on the radio that trucks loaded with supplies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency have arrived on the island. \"We haven't seen any,\" Torres said. Some help began arriving. On Wednesday, a plane carrying 3,500 pounds of water, Army meals ready-to-eat, diapers and other supplies headed from Florida to Puerto Rico. The plane, which usually carries out intelligence missions, returned to the US mainland with dozens of family members of federal employees. Families leave working loved ones behind to help Puerto Rico Two military officials told CNN on Wednesday that another 2,000 to 3,000 US troops will be sent to Puerto Rico in the coming days to assist with aid. One official with US Northern Command said there are approximately 2,500 active-duty troops in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

They are coming in by air or by boats. But they are starting to execute.\" Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have seen fewer personnel since Hurricane Maria hit than Texas and Florida did during recent hurricanes in those states. FEMA said more than 10,000 federal staff members were on the ground in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands assisting search-and-rescue and recovery efforts. 10k+ federal staff are on the ground in PR/USVI assisting with search & rescue, restoring power, & moving commodities. #Maria [\ud83d\udcf7: @USArmy ] pic.twitter.com/8mbThIzD7T \n\u2014 FEMA (@fema) September 25, 2017 Trump announced he will visit Puerto Rico next Tuesday, nearly two weeks after Maria struck the US commonwealth. \"Puerto Rico is a very difficult situation,\" he said Wednesday. \"I feel so badly for the people.\" The President has faced criticism for his response to Puerto Rico, compared with Texas and Florida -- two states he visited within four days of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma . Lack of diesel leads to deaths With nearly all Puerto Ricans still without power Wednesday, the lack of electricity and fuel have yielded dire consequences.

At the San Jorge Children's Hospital in San Juan, 12 children depend on ventilators to survive, but the hospital has only a limited amount of fuel for generators, said Domingo Cruz Vivaldi, the hospital's executive director. The hospital is the largest private children's medical center in the Caribbean. When the hospital ran out of diesel Monday, the ventilators had to run on batteries for hours until another hospital offered them fuel. \"We were very thankful for that. We were very lucky,\" Cruz Vivaldi said. The hospital is working to secure more gas, he said, because that diesel will only last about two days. 'People are starting to get desperate' Before sunrise every day, dozens of people hauling red plastic gas cans start lining up at gas stations. They need fuel to power their cars in case of an emergency or to keep generators running at home. People wait in line to buy gas in Bayam\u00f3n, Puerto Rico. Some wait for up to six hours armed with lawn chairs and umbrellas. \"If the gasoline arrives, it will fix our problems,\" Utuado Mayor Ernesto Irizarry said. \"People are starting to get desperate,\" At least 60 people have been arrested for violating the overnight curfew ordered by the governor to keep the island safe. And 36 have been arrested for looting and theft in Humacao, Caguas, San Juan and Bayam\u00f3n, said Michelle Hernandez, superintendent of the Puerto Rico police.

Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said. About half the residents do not have running water. Puerto Ricans are waiting hours in line to get gas, food and cash. Gas stations and supermarkets are rationing supplies, while banks are running low on cash. \"Right now we are in emergency mode,\" Rossell\u00f3 said on Wednesday afternoon. \"Our focus is not necessarily restoring energy. The energy grid has been destroyed. ... And we need to rebuild it. That does not get rebuilt in days.\" Asked if he thought the federal government was doing everything it can to help the island, Rossell\u00f3 said, \"Well, they are. This is an unprecedented event. President Trump has been in close communication with me practically every day making sure we have the assets, giving orders to his team so that they can execute.\" Read More The governor said getting aid where it's needed has been a challenge because of the magnitude of the destruction on the island. \"This has been the biggest catastrophe in the history Puerto Rico in terms of natural disasters,\" he said. Vital aid stranded at Puerto Rico's main port Critics said the government's aid effort could be improved if Washington lifted the Jones Act, an obscure, nearly 100-year-old law that requires all goods ferried between US ports to be carried on ships built, owned and operated by Americans. The law had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive to ship things from the US mainland to Puerto Rico. Trump said Wednesday \"we're thinking\" about lifting the Jones Act for Puerto Rican ports in the wake of Hurricane Maria, but he said a \"lot of shippers\" don't want it lifted. Rossell\u00f3 said he had not asked the President to lift the Jones Act so aid might flow more fully to Puerto Rico. \"I did not solicit that to him personally but it is something that would help Puerto Rico, certainly, at least in the short run,\" Rossell\u00f3 said. DHS denies that it rejected request to loosen shipping rules for Puerto Rico As desperate Puerto Ricans wait for aid, there's not enough food to go around. In the town of Utuado, Lydia Rivera has started to ration crackers and drink rainwater to keep her two grandchildren alive. \"No water, no food,\" Rivera told CNN. People carry water in bottles retrieved from a canal this week in Toa Alta, Puerto Rico. The hurricane killed 16 people in Puerto Rico, 27 in the island nation of Dominica and one in the US Virgin Islands. As Puerto Rico attempts to recover from the disaster, there were signs that aid sent from the US mainland isn't making it to people in need . And the US recovery efforts in Puerto Rico have been markedly different from the recent responses to other Americans in hurricane-stricken Texas and Florida. Federal relief efforts With supplies running out, many Puerto Ricans are collecting water from mountain streams. JUST WATCHED Hundreds stranded at Puerto Rican airport Replay More Videos ...

Yingluck failed to appear on August 25 as hundreds of her supporters waited outside Thailand's Supreme Court for the scheduled verdict. At the time, a highly-placed source in Yingluck's Pheu Thai party said she had fled Thailand just before the hearing and was \"safe and sound\" in Dubai. A warrant was issued for her arrest. Yingluck Shinawatra's supporters wait outside the Supreme Court for a verdict in her two-year trial, Wednesday, September 27. Controversial scheme Read More Yingluck had faced up to 10 years in prison for her role in the rice-buying scheme, introduced in 2011, which pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crops. Critics say the program wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with huge stockpiles of rice it couldn't sell. Yingluck said the subsidy scheme was \"beneficial for the farmers and the country\" and claims it lost billions of dollars were wrong and motivated by political bias against her. The verdict was delivered in absentia, after Yingluck fled the country before an earlier court date. Core support She has maintained a core group of followers since being ousted by a military coup in 2014. Some were outside the court Wednesday, waiting to hear the verdict, though there were far fewer than the crowds seen spilling over the pavement onto the streets in August. Then, large numbers of police had prepared for potential protests, depending on the outcome of the two-year trial.

MUST WATCH \n2016: Former Thai PM tells CNN, 'I've never thought of fleeing' 01:51 Yingluck was barred from leaving Thailand without court approval in 2015, when the trial started. When she fled, the court confiscated her bail of 30 million baht ($900,000). On Tuesday, the Thai junta's leader, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, told reporters that he knew where Yingluck was, and would reveal her whereabouts after September 27, the day of the verdict. When she was inaugurated in 2011, Yingluck became Thailand's first female prime minister and its youngest in over 60 years. She followed her brother Thaksin Shinawatra to the role. Anti-government protesters, drawn mainly from Bangkok's middle class, royalist establishment, allege that Yingluck was her brother's puppet, who was installed to carry on his work. Thaksin was overthrown as Prime Minister in a military coup in 2006. He lives in Dubai and London in self-imposed exile to avoid corruption charges. After the 2014 coup, Yingluck was impeached by Thailand's military-appointed National Legislative Assembly. The ruling barred her from political office for five years.

A committee has been formed to implement the ruling and it will present recommendations within 30 days. Then the government will have until June 24, 2018, to implement the new decree. \n\u201cThis is a historic big day in our kingdom,\u201d Prince Khaled bin Salman, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ambassador to the US, said Tuesday in a briefing with reporters. \nState Department spokesman Heather Nauert said the US \u201cwould certainly welcome that\u201d news, whileUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote on his official Twitter it was \u201can important step in the right direction.\u201d \nThe move to ease restrictions on women has huge implications for the Saudi economy and women\u2019s ability to work. It is just the latest in a series of changes that have been rippling through Saudi Arabia since the rise of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \nThe crown prince, known casually as \u201cMBS,\u201d is spearheading an ambitious plan to reform and transform the Saudi economy by 2030 and, in line with that goal, increase the number of women in the workforce. \u201cA huge step\u201d \nAmbassador bin Salman described the step as \u201cpart of Vision 2030, which is a huge step toward a brighter future.\u201d \nThat plan for the country\u2019s economic reinvention rests on a number of pillars, including youth empowerment, social organization and women\u2019s empowerment, \u201cwhich is an extremely important element of the changes happening in Saudi Arabia,\u201d the ambassador said. \n\u201cWe are trying to increase women\u2019s participation in the workforce,\u201d bin Salman said. \n\u201cIn order to change women\u2019s participation in the workforce we need them to be able to drive to work,\u201d said bin Salman, who is a son of the current king and a brother of the crown prince. \u201cWe need them to move forward, we need them to improve our economy.\u201d \nThe crown prince, who was appointed by his father to the position in June, is seen as a major power in the country and is expected by many to be named king before too long. \nAsked by CNN why the announcement was made now, ambassador bin Salman said, \u201cthere is no wrong time to do the right thing.\u201d He added that \u201cit\u2019s not religious nor a cultural issue\u201d and said women \u201cused to use transportation means during my grandfather\u2019s era.\u201d \nHe said that women will not have to get permission from their male guardians to take driving lessons. \n\u201cLegally there\u2019s nothing that can prevent it,\u201d the ambassador said, but he acknowledged that \u201cthere might be social issues.\u201d \nHe said that the choice will be up to women. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018women must drive,\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018women can drive.\u2019\u201c \nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia follows a strict form of Wahhabi Islam that bans the mixing of sexes at public events and places numerous curbs on women. These restrictions are enforced by religious police whose powers the crown prince has successfully lobbied to curtail since coming to power. \nHis success on that front is evident in the way Saudi Arabia, which is celebrating the 87th anniversary of its creation this month, has recently been easing some restrictions on women. \nWomen were allowed to enter a sports stadium for the first time on September 23, for a special pageant. \nIn May, King Salman decreed that government agencies should list services women can seek without permission from their husbands, fathers or other male guardian. He also ordered organizations to provide transportation for female employees \u2014 a step that eased one hurdle to women\u2019s employment given that public transportation is virtually non-existent. \nBefore May, women weren\u2019t able to access government services without getting permission from a male guardian or having him present. \nThere have also been some easing of restrictions on women\u2019s ability to work in the fields of law and education. In 2015, women were elected to municipal councils for the first time. \nMembers of the Saudi royal family have been signaling an easing on women\u2019s ability to drive for months now. In May, Prince Faisal Bin Abdullah, a former education minister, told a privately owned TV channel that he had \u201cno doubt\u201d women would one day be able to drive in his country. When Saudi women first defied the driving ban \n\u201cLet me tell you about our leadership\u2019s view on women,\u201d he said. \u201cNever mind driving a car, which is coming, no doubt \u2026 I want her to drive society.\u201d Another prominent prince, Alwaleed bin Talal, wrote a December blog post that pushed for authorities to allow women to drive, saying that the ban curtailed their rights and hurt the economy because it made it harder for women to work. In 2013, a campaign to defy the government ban on women driving saw dozens get behind the wheel and post photos of themselves driving on social media. They were quickly cut short by authorities and several spoke to CNN about their fear of retaliation in the aftermath. \nAmbassador bin Salman said the decree is part of a historical arc. \u201cWe have a young and dynamic society that is young and more open.\u201d He added that the decision is \u201cpart of a process that\u2019s happening since 1932\u201d when the country was founded.

Shanghai UVS Intelligence System is set to become the first company in the world to bring to market a commercial drone that's able to take off and land on water. It says the roughly 20-foot long unmanned seaplane, known as the U650, could be used by businesses and the military. The U650 drones should be rolling off factory production lines in Shanghai by the end of the year, a company spokeswoman told CNNMoney. That would put UVS ahead of other firms that have developed amphibious drones but haven't yet moved beyond prototypes into production, according to analysts. \nThe U650 can stay in the air for up to 15 hours, flying as far as 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), according to the company. But heavy cargoes will reduce those numbers. \nRelated: DJI's new drone fits in the palm of your hand \nUVS sees delivery firms as one set of potential customers. \nLike Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) in the U.S., Chinese e-commerce companies like JD.com ( JD ) are aggressively pursuing the use of drones in their supply chains. \nUVS Intelligence System said it has contracts with several clients, but would not disclose further details. Shanghai UVS Intelligence System's U650 amphibious drone \nThe U650 can carry up to 550 pounds of cargo, but it will face limits on where exactly it can go. \nBecause of its size, the new drone won't be able to fly in the same airspace as manned aircraft, which will \"restrict a lot of potential use,\" said Kelvin Wong, an analyst with research firm IHS Markit. \nRelated: U.S. military turns to Silicon Valley to protect troops from drones \nThe U650 may also appeal to the Chinese government, which has been building up man-made islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. \nThe drones would be able to carry out surveillance and deliver supplies, which \"comes in handy because you don't have a lot of runway in those environments,\" Wong said. \n-- Nanlin Fang contributed to this report.

Yingluck failed to appear on August 25 as hundreds of her supporters waited outside Thailand's Supreme Court for the scheduled verdict. At the time, a highly-placed source in Yingluck's Pheu Thai party said she had fled Thailand just before the hearing and was \"safe and sound\" in Dubai. A warrant was issued for her arrest. Yingluck Shinawatra's supporters wait outside the Supreme Court for a verdict in her two-year trial, Wednesday, September 27. Controversial scheme Read More Yingluck had faced up to 10 years in prison for her role in the rice-buying scheme, introduced in 2011, which pledged to pay farmers well above the market rate for their crops. Critics say the program wasted large amounts of public funds trying to please rural voters, hurting exports and leaving the government with huge stockpiles of rice it couldn't sell. Yingluck said the subsidy scheme was \"beneficial for the farmers and the country\" and claims it lost billions of dollars were wrong and motivated by political bias against her. The verdict was delivered in absentia, after Yingluck fled the country before an earlier court date. Core support She has maintained a core group of followers since being ousted by a military coup in 2014. Some were outside the court Wednesday, waiting to hear the verdict, though there were far fewer than the crowds seen spilling over the pavement onto the streets in August. Then, large numbers of police had prepared for potential protests, depending on the outcome of the two-year trial. JUST WATCHED 2016: Former Thai PM tells CNN, 'I've never thought of fleeing'\n2016: Former Thai PM tells CNN, 'I've never thought of fleeing' 01:51 Yingluck was barred from leaving Thailand without court approval in 2015, when the trial started. When she fled, the court confiscated her bail of 30 million baht ($900,000). On Tuesday, the Thai junta's leader, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, told reporters that he knew where Yingluck was, and would reveal her whereabouts after September 27, the day of the verdict. When she was inaugurated in 2011, Yingluck became Thailand's first female prime minister and its youngest in over 60 years. She followed her brother Thaksin Shinawatra to the role. Anti-government protesters, drawn mainly from Bangkok's middle class, royalist establishment, allege that Yingluck was her brother's puppet, who was installed to carry on his work. Thaksin was overthrown as Prime Minister in a military coup in 2006. He lives in Dubai and London in self-imposed exile to avoid corruption charges. After the 2014 coup, Yingluck was impeached by Thailand's military-appointed National Legislative Assembly. The ruling barred her from political office for five years. At the time, Yingluck said she had behaved with integrity and honesty during her time as prime minister.

Mahmood Farooqui, the co-director of the hit Bollywood film \"Peepli Live,\" was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2016 after he was found guilty of raping a Columbia University graduate student at his home. Farooqui's lawyers challenged the 2016 ruling in Delhi's High Court. In their appeal, they called attention to the lack of evidence that Farooqui was alone with the victim in his house on the night of the alleged incident. They also made an alternative argument, claiming that \"if at all, such an occurrence had taken place\" it was with the alleged victim's consent. In throwing out the conviction on Monday, High Court Judge Ashutosh Kumar said Farooqui deserved the \"benefit of the doubt\" on all points. Kumar said it was not clear whether the incident, as outlined by the alleged victim, took place. Moreover, he added, Farooqui had \"no idea at all\" that the alleged victim had not given her consent. Read More Indian guru Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh sentenced to 20 years for rape \"It is not unknown that during sexual acts, one of the partners may be a little less willing or, it can be said unwilling but where there is an assumed consent, it matters not if one of the partners to the act is a bit hesitant,\" Kumar observed in his ruling. \"Such feeble hesitation can never be understood as a positive negation of any advances by the other partner.\" Elsewhere in his ruling, Kumar ruled that \"instances of woman behavior are not unknown (sic) that a feeble 'no' may mean a 'yes',\" particularly in cases where the parties involved \"are known to each other, are persons of letters and are intellectually/academically proficient, and if, in the past, there have been physical contacts.\" 'Erodes the definition of consent' The ruling has revived a debate in India over the meaning of consent in rape cases. \"In this judgment, the court has unfortunately elided over the legal definition of consent that, that many of us worked to bring into law in 2013,\" said Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer who played a role in reforming India's sexual assault laws in the wake of the brutal gang rape of a physiotherapy student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012. Jyoti Singh Pandey later died, and anger about her case led to nationwide protests and triggered reforms to India's sexual assault and harassment laws. Indian law stipulates that consent must be \"unequivocal,\" or in other words, absolutely clear. In the case involving Farooqui, the victim's lawyer maintains that she did not give consent. \"She protested, she pushed him off, he was trying to take off her undergarments, she kept yanking them back up, but he was stronger than her, he pinned her down. Under those circumstances, it is therefore startling to hear this series of events recorded as a 'feeble no,'\" Nundy told CNN. The ruling was met with frustration in legal circles. \"(It) completely erodes the definition of consent,\" said Jhuma Sen, a professor at Jindal Global Law School. \"The court seems to be creating this additional defense that the accused must have been made aware (by the victim).\" According to court documents, the woman had met Farooqui in 2014, after she arrived in India to research her PhD. She alleged that the assault at the center of the case occurred during a visit to Farooqui's home in March 2015. The researcher's lawyers now plan to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court. \"The high court acquittal order is wrong on facts and in law,\" said Vrinda Grover, the lawyer appearing for the victim told CNN.

The second is expected as early as Oct. 5 and may add even more to Bombardier's tariff penalty. \nThe move could have serious implications for the renegotiation of NAFTA , the free trade deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.

Obamacare lives on ... for now. Now that Congressional Republicans have shelved their plans to repeal the health reform law , the future of Obamacare is in the White House's hands. And it's pretty clear that the Trump administration has little desire to fix it. At the moment, Obamacare will be available everywhere in 2018. At times this year, it looked like tens of thousands of Americans might not have any options on their Obamacare exchanges as insurers fled the market amid the uncertainty emanating from Washington D.C. But other carriers eventually stepped in to fill the gaps. \nThat could still change, however. Insurers have until Wednesday to sign the contracts that lock them into participating next year. \nRelated: Senate won't vote on GOP health care bill \nMeanwhile, the Department of Health & Human Services is making major changes for the upcoming open enrollment season, which begins in just five weeks. Critics say the moves will stifle sign-ups and further weaken the law. \nHHS officials pointed out that Obamacare has long had problems, and many of prior outreach methods didn't work. \n\"Americans are once again facing skyrocketing costs and plummeting choices because of Obamacare's fundamental failures,\" said Caitlin Oakley, HHS press secretary. \nHere's what the Trump administration has done so far: \nShortening open enrollment: The sign-up period will run from November 1 to December 15. That's half the length of this year's enrollment season, which ran through January 31. \nThe administration says the shortened period brings it more in line with the enrollment season for Medicare and employer-sponsored plans. Also, it means policyholders will have coverage for the full year. \nBut opponents argue that it gives consumers less time to enroll and could dampen sign-ups among the young and healthy, who usually wait until the last minute to complete their applications. \nSeveral states that run their own exchanges said they will extend the enrollment period. New Yorkers, for instance, will be able to sign up through Jan. 31 -- same as this year. \nSlashing advertising: HHS will spend $10 million on promotionsfor open enrollmentthis fall, compared to $100 million a year ago. \nThe administration justifies the budget cuts by saying it is basing advertising on effectiveness and performance. Officials say the agency spent about $100 million last year and 9.2 million people signed up for coverage through the federal exchange, healthcare.gov. A year earlier, the agency spent $51.2 million and 9.6 million Americans bought policies. \nObamacare supporters decry the move as sabotage, saying advertising and outreach are critical to maintaining and boosting enrollment. In particular, promotions help attract young and healthy consumers who may not feel they need coverage. A bipartisan coalition of governors urged the administration in August to continue to promote enrollment. \nRelated: Trump slashing Obamacare advertising by 90% \nReducing funding for enrollment assistance: The administration is cutting the budget for so-called navigators -- who help people sign up for coverage -- by 41%. The 98 navigator groups will receive a total of $37 million for the coming enrollment season. \nMore than three-quarters of the grantees failed to achieve their enrollment goals, officials said. This fall, navigators will receive funding based on meeting their targets. For instance, a grantee that enrolls only 30% of its goal will receive no more than 30% of its funding from the previous year. \nNavigators signed up roughly 81,500 people in 2016. \nTaking the federal exchange offline: The federal exchange will be shut down from midnight until noon all but one Sunday during open enrollment. It will also be offline overnight on November 1. \nThe administration said maintenance outages always occur during the sign-up period. But former Obama officials say they happened less frequently in prior years. \nRelated: Plan to shut Obamacare site during open enrollment draws critics \nLeaving the cost-sharing subsidies in limbo: One big thing the Trump administration hasn't announced yet is whether it will continue funding the cost-sharing subsidies, which reduce deductibles and premiums for lower-income enrollees. Many insurers said they had to raise premiums -- and some downsized or withdrew from Obamacare for 2018 -- because of the uncertainty. \nThe administration made the September payment last week, but said it is still reviewing the issue. \nKaiser Health News contributed to this report.

But a regulatory change could give them a boost overseas. The administration is considering shifting oversight of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department. The proposed change would treat handguns more like commodities and less like military weapons, and loosen the bureaucracy for gun manufacturers. \n\"They are currently hamstrung by considerable red tape,\" gun industry analyst Rommel Dionisio wrote in a report for Aegis Capital. \nRight now, the State Department oversees most weapon exports, including handguns, and evaluates them from a national security perspective. The Commerce Department oversees exports such as textiles, steel and food, plus some types of guns commonly used in hunting. \nMoving most gun exports under the Commerce Department would eliminate certain registration requirements and fees for gun makers. Analysts and a gun industry group say it would open a foreign market that is mostly untapped. \n\"This initiative will improve our nation's ability to compete in the global marketplace for commercial and sporting firearms and ammunition without impairing national security,\" the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a gun industry group, said in a statement. \nThe State Department would continue to monitor exports of military-grade weapons like machine guns and rocket launchers. But the oversight of semiautomatic AR-15s , which are commercially available in the United States, would shift to the Commerce Department. \nRachel Stohl, director of the Conventional Defense Program at the Stimson Center, a policy research organization on security threats, said she opposes a policy that could it make it easier for commercially available guns like the .50-caliber Barrett , a rifle favored by snipers, to end up in the wrong hands. \n\"This is about preventing U.S.-origin weapons for ending up in the hands of those that use them to commit human rights violations, for terrorist purposes, for criminal purposes,\" she said. \nRelated: No fed gun control for new silencer-muzzleloader \nThe stock prices for Sturm Ruger ( RGR ) and American Outdoor Brands ( AOBC ) , which owns Smith & Wesson, surged last weekafter Reuters first reported that the shift was under consideration. The news was later confirmed by CNNMoney. \nA State Department official told CNNMoney that the administration was working with Commerce \"to ensure that U.S. industries have every advantage in the global marketplace, while at the same time ensuring the responsible export of arms.\" \nIf it's approved by the White House, an oversight change could take months or longer to complete. \nAn executive with American Outdoor Brands declined to comment. Sturm Ruger did not return messages. \nSturm Ruger, in its most recent earnings report, said only 5% of its gun sales come from exports. American manufacturers exported $680 million worth of guns in the last fiscal year. The United States imported more than $2 billion, according to Chris Rogers, gun industry analyst for Panjiva. \nRelated: Gun maker shares spike on Trump move to loosen export oversight \nRogers said the biggest share of gun exports went to Canada ($144 million), followed by Australia ($58 million,) Japan ($46 million), Britain ($37 million) and Israel ($35 million). He said buyers include the military, police and individuals. \n\"When it comes to competing for existing demand, we have seen the Trump administration, including the president himself, actively get out there and sell,\" Rogers said. \"The government can certainly help crack open those markets.\" \nGun sales slowed precipitously after Donald Trump won the presidency. Gun buyers had stocked up because they feared Hillary Clinton would win and push for tighter gun control. When she lost, that fear evaporated, and sales slumped. \nAnalysts point out that U.S. companies will only benefit if demand for guns exists in those other countries. \n\"Just because you can sell them doesn't mean that people want to buy them,\" said Rogers. \"It's not like the Europeans are lining up to import handguns from the U.S.\" \nRelated: Gun companies are feeling a Trump slump hangover \nMany of the most prominent gun companies in the world are located in Europe. Dionisio said that police departments and government agencies in other countries are likely to \"retain considerable loyalty to their own domestic firearms producers,\" like Beretta in Italy and Heckler & Koch in Germany. \nBut other countries in Latin America and Africa, which don't have well known gun brands, might jump at the chance to buy American, said Rogers. \nThe problem? There's no overseas sales team at many manufacturers. The gun companies would have \"to rebuild an international sales force almost from scratch,\" Dionisio said.

Beijing said in February that it would halt all coal shipments from North Korea through the end of this year. Official Chinese customs data shows the country stuck to that pledge until August, when it imported 1.64 million tons of coal, worth about $138 million, from its smaller neighbor. News of the coal purchases comes as President Trump is stepping up efforts to try to stifle trade between North Korea and other countries in order to pressure Kim to back down on his country's rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program. \nCoal was one of North Korea's top exports to China, its main trading partner. The U.N. Security Council in November put a limit on North Korean exports of coal -- and then banned them altogether in August. \nRelated: What comes after Trump's 'final warning' on North Korea trade \nChina 'not a reliable partner' \nU.S. experts said Beijing's coal imports in August highlight its unwillingness to stick to promises to cut trade with Pyongyang. \n\"Even when China isn't officially violating U.N. Security Council resolutions, it violates the spirit of them over and over again,\" said Kent Boydston, a research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"It makes me question not just why coal imports appear to be happening again but what was the real volume of imports in the months it reported there were none.\" Why it's so difficult to report on North Korea \nAnthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the development \"shows that China is not a reliable partner.\" \n\"Sanctions against Chinese firms and banks likely will clarify the consequences of Beijing violating U.N. and U.S. sanctions,\" he said, referring to Trump's move last week to give the Treasury Department more power to crack down on companies and individuals that do business with North Korea. \nRelated: U.S. slaps sanctions on 8 North Korean banks \n'I don't think this was an act of bad faith' \nBut Tong Zhao, a fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said China didn't violate any U.N. sanctions with the August coal imports. \nThe ban China announced in February was imposed so abruptly that \"a lot of coal had already arrived at Chinese ports but had not passed through the customs,\" Zhao said, leaving the shipments stuck in limbo for months. \nThe new U.N. sanctions in early August banned coal imports altogether, but China had until September 5 to fully comply with them. Beijing sought to resolve the lingering issue of the leftover coal from February by letting it enter the country in August, according to Zhao. \nRelated: North Korea sanctions: Here's what Trump did \n\"I don't think this was an act of bad faith,\" he said, adding that it generated only a \"modest amount of money\" for North Korea that was unlikely to have a material impact on its nuclear program. \nWhen contacted for clarification on the coal imports, a spokesperson at China's customs agency referred to an August 15 statement stating that China planned to comply with U.N. sanctions on the import of coal and other resources from North Korea. \n-- Nanlin Fang and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.

Should South Korea have a nuclear weapon of its own? News \nThis remark, on the surface at least, reflects the current position of the Seoul government reasonably well. \nUntil a couple of months ago, no South Korean President would even bother to mention the idea of Seoul going nuclear \u2014 there was no need, such plans were clearly outside the realm of serious discussion. \nBut things have changed recently: Today, talks concerning the need for a South Korean nuclear program are fairly commonplace in Seoul. \nWhat\u2019s more, public opinion polls consistently indicate that a majority of the country\u2019s population would actually support the idea of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons. The most recent poll, for example, indicated that the so-called \u201cnuclear option\u201d is now supported by 60% of South Koreans (for comparison, the figure within Japan is close to 5%). Secret nuclear program \nIn decades past, enthusiasm for nuclear weapons in South Korea extended to the highest levels of government. In the 1970s, it was South Korea, not North Korea, which pursued a clandestine nuclear weapons development program. The program was able to become reasonably advanced, until the Americans discovered its existence and pushed Seoul into closing it down. \nSince the late 1970s, the idea of going nuclear had remained something of a non-issue politically. However, things changed in July this year, when North Korea successfully tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting the US \u2014 presumably, with nuclear warheads. \nWithin a few years, North Korea will become the latest country capable of obliterating San Francisco or Chicago, if chooses to do so. \nFor many South Koreans this was a wake-up call. \nFor decades the universal assumption has been that the US would come to South Korea\u2019s rescue if the country is attacked by the North \u2014 the events of 1950, and the arrival of US troops into the Korean war on the side of the South, confirmed that these expectations were not unfounded. \nHowever, North Korea\u2019s ICBMs might be a game changer. \nNow, many South Koreans wonder if the US is still committed to protecting South Korea, not at the cost of tens of thousands of US soldiers being killed, but at the cost of millions of civilians dead. South Korea now a target \nThe credibility of the US commitment is under doubt, and if the US can\u2019t be relied on \u2014 so the logic goes \u2014 South Korea will need to look after itself. \nPresident Moon, being a representative of the mainstream moderate Left, knows that his supporters do not like the idea of a domestic nuclear weapons program, but he must also contend with the fact that many politicians are now openly talking about the possibility. \nPredictably, most of theses politicians are from right-leaning parties, who are currently in opposition. \nThere is no doubt that South Korea has enough money and technical expertise to go nuclear, but there is less certainty in its ability to overcome the types of political obstacles blocking that goal. South Korea is a democracy, much dependent of foreign trade \u2014 and this makes the nuclear option difficult to realize. \nA domestic nuclear program would definitely make South Korea a target of international sanctions. \nOf special significance is China, for whom a nuclear South Korea is a greater threat than a nuclear North Korea. \nSo, China is going to hit South Korea hard. \nGiven that China controls over a quarter of South Korea\u2019s entire foreign trade, heavy Chinese sanctions, perhaps a complete boycott, are certain to provoke a grave economic crisis in South Korea. \nGiven the sensitivity of Korean voters to the country\u2019s economic performance, such a turn of events would ensure that any government seriously attempting to go nuclear would be voted out of power at the next possible opportunity. \nIt does not help that most South Koreans do not take the North Korean threat too seriously. \nWhile older generations would once probably be willing to make the necessary sacrifices (to protect their country from the North Korean threat), younger generations still see North Korea as little more than a bad joke, and their theoretical interest in the nuclear option is likely to evaporate once they encounter economic troubles. \nSo, one should expect a lot more talk about a nuclear Seoul, but this does not necessarily mean that South Korea will soon join the ranks of world\u2019s nuclear powers, officially recognized or otherwise. \nFor outsiders this might be good news, but one wonders whether it is a good for Koreans. \n/ENG-Portals ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "moon", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seoul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T13:23:27.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7f6e971e57f756bf7175b0f49c6a634669d0a155", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsBCDI6wx2UKE0bDRl6M7ykqlpnRQ7oG90o1cSe4iPNe_vUYzeSzkkxP82tdJnCkEnOdbhwtF3E08-", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_allpolitics.rss&author=CNN&title=Politics", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Politics", "title": "CNN poll: Most want major changes to the tax system", "title_full": "CNN poll: Most want major changes to the tax system", "published": "2017-09-27T13:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170418111945-tax-day-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1931, "comments": 0, "shares": 1931}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7f6e971e57f756bf7175b0f49c6a634669d0a155", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsBCDI6wx2UKE0bDRl6M7ykqlpnRQ7oG90o1cSe4iPNe_vUYzeSzkkxP82tdJnCkEnOdbhwtF3E08-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T13:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "CNN poll: Most want major changes to the tax system", "text": "Six in 10 lack confidence that Trump and Congress will improve immigration laws 41% say middle class will pay more in taxes should Trump's reform plan move forward There's cross-party agreement that DACA should remain in place Washington (CNN) As Congress turns its attention away from health care and back toward tax reform and other issues, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds most in favor of major changes to the nation's tax laws, but wary of President Donald Trump's handling of immigration.

Just 12% polled said tax laws ought to be Congress's highest priority over the next few weeks, 11% choose immigration. More, 36%, want Congress to focus on funding disaster relief efforts (the poll was completed September 17 through 20, before the effects of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico were clear) and 31% say dealing with health care should be the top priority. RELATED: At tax reform talk, Trump warns he'll work with Democrats on health care Neither taxes nor immigration prompts much support for Trump, according to the poll. Overall, just 36% approve of his handling of immigration -- down eight points from a high of 44% in March -- and 34% approve of his work on taxes. A sizable one in five say they're not sure yet how Trump is doing on taxes, as details of the tax reform effort he plans to advocate for yet to be released. Read More Many Americans agree with Trump's contention that the tax laws deserve a major revamp. All told, 68% say the federal income tax system needs either a complete overhaul (35%) or major changes (33%). That cuts across party lines, including 77% of Republicans, 70% of independents and 62% of Democrats. Asked about the impact of a reform effort led by Trump, though, about four in 10 say they expect taxes for the middle class to rise, while just 25% say middle class taxes will drop. Likewise, more Americans think their own personal taxes would go up under this effort than drop (34% to 21%). More see tax decreases on the horizon for big businesses (47% say so) and for the wealthy (42%). These views are divided by party. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say their own taxes would drop under a Trump-led plan (40% among Republicans, 11% among Democrats) and that middle-class taxes would decline (52% among Republicans, 9% among Democrats). But Democrats are more convinced that the wealthy would see a decline in their tax bills (61% vs. 19% of Republicans) and that big businesses would also get a break (57% vs. 36% among Republicans). Turning to immigration, most (60%) lack confidence that Trump and Congress will be able to enact new laws on immigration and border security that will improve the way the country handles this issue. That's similar to the sentiment toward then-president George W. Bush's efforts at immigration reform in mid-2006. RELATED: Senate Republicans float new DACA proposal That lack of confidence could stem from disagreements on policy. The poll finds most Americans oppose each of the major initiatives Trump has backed on immigration since taking office: 82% say they want the policy known as DACA to continue, 63% oppose building a wall along the entire border with Mexico, and 55% say they oppose changes in federal law to reduce the number of immigrants who enter the country legally. In dealing with those already in the country illegally, a whopping 84% say developing a plan to allow some people living in the US illegally to stay is a more important priority than deporting all people who are living in the US illegally. Considering how to deal with those attempting to move to the US, most favor reforming current laws to better reflect the country's needs than say stronger enforcement of current laws should be the top priority (56% to 40% for enforcement). And in principle, many seem to support at least one of the changes Trump has backed to immigration laws: 51% say they think job skills and education should be a more important factor than family ties in considering whether to grant a non-citizen legal residence in the US But those who see reforming immigration laws as a priority are split on this question, with 46% favoring job skills and 43% family ties, and opposed to reduced legal immigration generally (65% oppose it, 30% favor it).

The 39-year-old has visited the country he once described as \"home from home\" every year since 1998 -- once performing a slam dunk on the Great Wall -- and has signed endorsement deals with several local brands. According to the report, Bryant has built on his legacy by \"engaging with the Chinese community both online and offline.\" In six of the last 10 years Bryant's shirt has been China's best-selling sports jersey. During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Cleveland Cavaliers' LeBron James, who has no online presence in China, said: \"I thought I was famous until I got [to China] with Kobe.\" On September 12, the former Lakers man was mobbed by fans when he visited the country to announce that he would join forces with NBA China and the Mission Hills Group to set up the country's first NBA basketball school in Haikou, Hainan Province, which is expected to be completed in 2019.

The NBA's dominance can be partly attributed to its long history in the country -- the first NBA game was broadcast by state television CCTV in 1986 -- and the league's multi-million dollar partnership with Tencent Sports allows for around 300 games to be broadcast free. According to Mailman's analysis, the five top-performing NBA teams were: Golden State Warriors, Cleveland Cavaliers, Houston Rockets, LA Clippers and LA Lakers. But the NBA's influence in China is not all encompassing.

Senate won't vote on GOP health care bill GOP senators were forced to acknowledge on Tuesday that their eleventh hour push to repeal the Affordable Care Act had failed. For the second time in two months, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell publicly conceded that he could not find 50 senators who would support partisan legislation to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, made all the more painful by the reality that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But unlike after the last failed attempt to repeal Obamacare in July, senators are in agreement that it is time for Republicans to move on to other things. \"Health care, as far as I am concerned, is over,\" said GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the finance committee. \"Tax reform is where we have to do the job.\" Read More The Republican zombie repeal and replace effort just died. Again. With 10 months of the legislative calendar behind them, Republicans acknowledge they've lost precious time and burned well past the early days of the Trump presidency. Members know they cannot afford to make the same errors on tax reform and survive the 2018 midterms unscathed. Behind the scenes, the \"big six,\" a coalition of Senate, House and White House leaders have been working to hash out a framework and build broad consensus on tax reform. Republican leaders are preparing to roll out principles for their plan Wednesday. \"We have to deliver on tax reform,\" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a member of GOP leadership. \"Failure is not an option.\" Putting it differently, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told Bloomberg News that if Republican leaders in Congress fail on taxes like they had on passing health care bills, \"I may go home and put a bag over my head. And hide my head in a bag.\" Sen. Kennedy (R-LA) says if Congress fails on taxes like ACA repeal, \"I may go home and put a bag over my head. And hide my head in a bag.\" \u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) September 26, 2017 Still, there was no papering over the fact that Tuesday's defeat on health care was another setback for McConnell. The majority leader has spent years crafting the Republican's message around defeating the Affordable Care Act. Even his own re-election in 2014 echoed the promise. And across the Capitol, House Republicans blamed McConnell for not being able to bring his conference together. RSC chair calls female colleagues 'eye candy' during remarks Asked if he still supported McConnell as majority leader, Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker had a warning. \"Our faith does wane sometimes,\" Walker, a North Carolina congressman, said. \"We would hope that the majority leader would listen to his constituents as much as we listen to ours throughout the states we represent. We hope he can deliver on those promises but if not then we put all options on the table.\" McConnell's fellow senators were reticent to blame him for the defeat. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a sometimes harsh critic of McConnell, declined to attack his leader. \"It's frustrating that we haven't gotten there yet. I'm frustrated. Everybody else is frustrating, but we're making progress. We're closer than many outside observers believe,\" Cruz said. Others insisted that repealing Obamacare would remain an important mission for the party -- even if that goal isn't achieved this week. \"We haven't given up yet,\" said Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby. For now, Republican senators say they've learned some valuable lessons from the failed Graham-Cassidy bill. When the party is ready to tackle health care again, most members seemed to agree they will need an entirely new strategy. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a co-sponsor of the Graham-Cassidy bill that was declared dead Tuesday, said he would like to attempt Obamacare repeal again through the 2019 budget reconciliation bill -- but without the secrecy and rushed process that drew ire from his colleagues, including his best friend, Sen. John McCain. \"We'll have a different process. We'll go through the committee process. We'll mark the bill up through committee. We'll have three or months to talk to our Democratic friends to see if we'll have a breakthrough,\" Graham said. CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to properly attribute a quote to Sen.

How hip-hop turned on Trump and settled for Clinton in 2016 Hip-hop artists have been been raising awareness about police brutality and racial inequality in both music and activism since the 1980s. And Kaepernick, who became one of the most controversial figures in sports when he took a knee last year to protest police brutality, has since been mentioned in tens of lyrics advocating for social justice, including songs by J. Cole , Kendrick Lamar , Rapsody , Eminem and Lupe Fiasco in \"Kneelin' on Needles.\" Kaepernick is now a free agent and has not been signed by any NFL team. This has caused some to speculate whether the league is shunning him for his protests on the field.

Spain's Constitutional Court has outlawed the plebiscite, and the national administration in Madrid asserts that any such vote would be unconstitutional. The dispute between the regional government in Barcelona and the Spanish government has become increasingly bitter in recent weeks, with several high-ranking Catalan officials involved in organizing the referendum arrested, and mass protests in the region's capital of Barcelona and other towns. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump weighed in on the debate, casting doubt on recent polling suggesting a \"Yes\" vote will win and saying that he is for \"a united Spain.\" \"I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain. I think it would be foolish not to.\" Read More The vote risks plunging the country into one of its worst political crises since the end of Gen. Francisco Franco's dictatorship four decades ago. Hundreds of thousands have attended rallies to demand their region break from Spain in recent weeks. The basics... Catalonia is a wealthy region in Spain's northeast. One of 17 autonomous provinces, it has its own regional government -- or Generalitat -- which already has considerable powers over healthcare, education and tax collection. But it pays tax to Madrid, and pro-independence politicians argue that complex mechanisms for redistributing tax revenue are unfair on wealthier areas. Catalonia has long complained that its revenues subsidize other parts of Spain. The region hosts some 16% of the Spanish population and much of the country's manufacturing and finance sectors. Catalan nationalists argue that they are a separate nation with their own history, culture and language and that they should have increased fiscal independence. A banner reading \"I just want to vote\" is seen as demonstrators gather outside the Catalan high court. How did we get here? The long-running dispute goes back to the brutal years under Franco, whose dictatorial regime repressed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy. It wasn't until four years after his death in 1979 that the region gained full autonomy. In 2006, the Spanish government backed Catalonia's calls for greater powers granting \"nation\" status and financial control to the region. But it was one step forward and two steps back four years later, when that status was rescinded by the Constitutional Court, which ruled that while Catalan is a \"nationality,\" Catalonia is not a nation itself. Separatist supporters demonstrate in front of the Catalan high court building on Thursday in Barcelona. Catalonia's campaign to break away has been gaining momentum since 2010, when Spain's economy plunged during the financial crisis. It was further galvanized by the Scottish referendum for independence in 2014 , which ultimately saw voters opt to remain part of the United Kingdom. Catalonia held a symbolic poll in 2014 , in which 80% of voters backed complete secession -- but only 32% of the electorate turned out. What's behind this latest drive? Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has fought to establish an independent Catalan state since taking office last January, and called the referendum in June. A month later, the Generalitat approved a law allowing it to formalize plans for the October plebiscite. But it would appear support for an autonomous Catalan state has fallen in recent months, according to a June poll conducted on behalf of the regional government. The survey indicated some 41.1% were for independence, down from 44.3% in March. Where does Madrid stand? Firmly against Catalan independence, the central government has vowed to shut down what it says is an \"illegal\" referendum. It has the authority to do this, under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution . Spain's PM has called on separatists to stop the \"escalation of radicalism and disobedience.\" Madrid asked the Constitutional Court to suspend Catalonia's referendum law, which had paved the way for the ballot. Spain's high court is now investigating whether the regional government has breached the constitution. Catalan President blasts Madrid for 'illegal' referendum raids Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who leads the conservative Popular Party, has consistently argued that Catalonia cannot leave Spain because the country is indivisible, according to the 1978 constitution. \"What we have seen in Catalonia is an attempt to liquidize national sovereignty,\" he said in a recent address posted to his official Twitter account, adding that all Spaniards should have a say in what their country looks like. Police, acting under a court order, seized almost 10 million papers relating to the upcoming ballot at a warehouse in an industrial estate near Barcelona last week. Voter lists, signs and paperwork for counting votes were also confiscated. Additional state police have been deployed to the region in the days leading up to the ballot to maintain order and prevent the vote taking place, Reuters reported, citing the Spanish Interior Ministry. The Spanish government has moored three ships, one pictured, to the dock of Barcelona's port to house police reinforcements ahead of the proposed but illegal referendum. Despite these actions, Puigdemont says he intends to defy Madrid's orders and has called upon Catalan citizens to \"defend democracy against a repressive and intimidating regime\" by going to the polls to vote as planned. And sports stars are weighing in? The referendum row is a divisive subject across Spain, but some homegrown heroes have made their feelings clear. Barcelona's football club has backed the referendum. \"FC Barcelona in remaining faithful to its historic commitment to the defence of the nation, to democracy, to freedom of speech, and to self-determination, condemns any act that may impede the free exercise of these rights,\" it said in a statement posted to its official Twitter account. Manchester City (and former Barcelona) manager Pep Guardiola has also joined the pro-independence campaign, showing his support for Catalonia at separatist demonstrations. Football manager Pep Guardiola at a pro-independence demonstration in Barcelona on June 11. But others have been somewhat reluctant to reveal their thoughts. World no.1 men's tennis player Rafael Nadal chose a different approach when asked about the upcoming vote. \"I can't imagine Spain without Catalonia and Catalonia without Spain. I don't want to see it,\" he said at a recent press conference in Prague, according to Bloomberg . Nadal added that he hoped the two sides would come together to work things out: \"We don't want fights, we don't want problems I believe we are much better together and stronger.\" What happens if the vote goes ahead? It's unclear at this point -- but Madrid insists there will be consequences if the referendum goes ahead. And if it does get as far as a vote, those who do enter the voting booth will see a single question: Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state, in the form of a republic? Should the Electoral Commission declare victory for the \"Yes\" campaign, Puigdemont has said the Generalitat will declare independence within 48 hours, Reuters reported, while a \"No\" vote would likely spark an early election.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "francisco franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carles puigdemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariano rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puigdemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "popular party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electoral commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fc barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T13:47:06.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5f34620621ece90f9f94682cb184715d4603405d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKfRu6HKUlzeKx11kG4M5hvhaCHFqmfKQg1U_yXHhNavuTrqPkG7Kx5kY1qL__ubMKA--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "CNN poll: Most want major changes to the tax system - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "CNN poll: Most want major changes to the tax system - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170418111945-tax-day-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1931, "comments": 0, "shares": 1931}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5f34620621ece90f9f94682cb184715d4603405d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKfRu6HKUlzeKx11kG4M5hvhaCHFqmfKQg1U_yXHhNavuTrqPkG7Kx5kY1qL__ubMKA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jennifer Agiesta", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "CNN poll: Most want major changes to the tax system - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Six in 10 lack confidence that Trump and Congress will improve immigration laws 41% say middle class will pay more in taxes should Trump's reform plan move forward There's cross-party agreement that DACA should remain in place Washington (CNN) As Congress turns its attention away from health care and back toward tax reform and other issues, a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS finds most in favor of major changes to the nation's tax laws, but wary of President Donald Trump's handling of immigration.\nRead the poll results Tax reform and immigration have both been near the top of Trump's agenda, but the public sees them as lower priorities. Just 12% polled said tax laws ought to be Congress's highest priority over the next few weeks, 11% choose immigration. More, 36%, want Congress to focus on funding disaster relief efforts (the poll was completed September 17 through 20, before the effects of Hurricane Maria on Puerto Rico were clear) and 31% say dealing with health care should be the top priority. RELATED: At tax reform talk, Trump warns he'll work with Democrats on health care Neither taxes nor immigration prompts much support for Trump, according to the poll. Overall, just 36% approve of his handling of immigration -- down eight points from a high of 44% in March -- and 34% approve of his work on taxes. A sizable one in five say they're not sure yet how Trump is doing on taxes, as details of the tax reform effort he plans to advocate for yet to be released. Read More Many Americans agree with Trump's contention that the tax laws deserve a major revamp. All told, 68% say the federal income tax system needs either a complete overhaul (35%) or major changes (33%). That cuts across party lines, including 77% of Republicans, 70% of independents and 62% of Democrats. Asked about the impact of a reform effort led by Trump, though, about four in 10 say they expect taxes for the middle class to rise, while just 25% say middle class taxes will drop. Likewise, more Americans think their own personal taxes would go up under this effort than drop (34% to 21%). More see tax decreases on the horizon for big businesses (47% say so) and for the wealthy (42%). These views are divided by party. Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say their own taxes would drop under a Trump-led plan (40% among Republicans, 11% among Democrats) and that middle-class taxes would decline (52% among Republicans, 9% among Democrats). But Democrats are more convinced that the wealthy would see a decline in their tax bills (61% vs. 19% of Republicans) and that big businesses would also get a break (57% vs. 36% among Republicans). Turning to immigration, most (60%) lack confidence that Trump and Congress will be able to enact new laws on immigration and border security that will improve the way the country handles this issue. That's similar to the sentiment toward then-president George W. Bush's efforts at immigration reform in mid-2006. RELATED: Senate Republicans float new DACA proposal That lack of confidence could stem from disagreements on policy. The poll finds most Americans oppose each of the major initiatives Trump has backed on immigration since taking office: 82% say they want the policy known as DACA to continue, 63% oppose building a wall along the entire border with Mexico, and 55% say they oppose changes in federal law to reduce the number of immigrants who enter the country legally. In dealing with those already in the country illegally, a whopping 84% say developing a plan to allow some people living in the US illegally to stay is a more important priority than deporting all people who are living in the US illegally. Considering how to deal with those attempting to move to the US, most favor reforming current laws to better reflect the country's needs than say stronger enforcement of current laws should be the top priority (56% to 40% for enforcement). And in principle, many seem to support at least one of the changes Trump has backed to immigration laws: 51% say they think job skills and education should be a more important factor than family ties in considering whether to grant a non-citizen legal residence in the US But those who see reforming immigration laws as a priority are split on this question, with 46% favoring job skills and 43% family ties, and opposed to reduced legal immigration generally (65% oppose it, 30% favor it).

The dispute between the regional government in Barcelona and the Spanish government has become increasingly bitter in recent weeks, with several high-ranking Catalan officials involved in organizing the referendum arrested, and mass protests in the region's capital of Barcelona and other towns. On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump weighed in on the debate, casting doubt on recent polling suggesting a \"Yes\" vote will win and saying that he is for \"a united Spain.\" \"I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain. I think it would be foolish not to.\" Read More The vote risks plunging the country into one of its worst political crises since the end of Gen. Francisco Franco's dictatorship four decades ago. Hundreds of thousands have attended rallies to demand their region break from Spain in recent weeks. The basics... Catalonia is a wealthy region in Spain's northeast. One of 17 autonomous provinces, it has its own regional government -- or Generalitat -- which already has considerable powers over healthcare, education and tax collection. But it pays tax to Madrid, and pro-independence politicians argue that complex mechanisms for redistributing tax revenue are unfair on wealthier areas. Catalonia has long complained that its revenues subsidize other parts of Spain. The region hosts some 16% of the Spanish population and much of the country's manufacturing and finance sectors. Catalan nationalists argue that they are a separate nation with their own history, culture and language and that they should have increased fiscal independence. A banner reading \"I just want to vote\" is seen as demonstrators gather outside the Catalan high court. How did we get here? The long-running dispute goes back to the brutal years under Franco, whose dictatorial regime repressed Catalonia's earlier limited autonomy. It wasn't until four years after his death in 1979 that the region gained full autonomy. In 2006, the Spanish government backed Catalonia's calls for greater powers granting \"nation\" status and financial control to the region. But it was one step forward and two steps back four years later, when that status was rescinded by the Constitutional Court, which ruled that while Catalan is a \"nationality,\" Catalonia is not a nation itself. Separatist supporters demonstrate in front of the Catalan high court building on Thursday in Barcelona. Catalonia's campaign to break away has been gaining momentum since 2010, when Spain's economy plunged during the financial crisis. It was further galvanized by the Scottish referendum for independence in 2014 , which ultimately saw voters opt to remain part of the United Kingdom. Catalonia held a symbolic poll in 2014 , in which 80% of voters backed complete secession -- but only 32% of the electorate turned out. What's behind this latest drive? Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont has fought to establish an independent Catalan state since taking office last January, and called the referendum in June. A month later, the Generalitat approved a law allowing it to formalize plans for the October plebiscite. But it would appear support for an autonomous Catalan state has fallen in recent months, according to a June poll conducted on behalf of the regional government. The survey indicated some 41.1% were for independence, down from 44.3% in March. Where does Madrid stand? Firmly against Catalan independence, the central government has vowed to shut down what it says is an \"illegal\" referendum. It has the authority to do this, under Article 155 of the Spanish constitution . Spain's PM has called on separatists to stop the \"escalation of radicalism and disobedience.\" Madrid asked the Constitutional Court to suspend Catalonia's referendum law, which had paved the way for the ballot. Spain's high court is now investigating whether the regional government has breached the constitution. Catalan President blasts Madrid for 'illegal' referendum raids Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who leads the conservative Popular Party, has consistently argued that Catalonia cannot leave Spain because the country is indivisible, according to the 1978 constitution. \"What we have seen in Catalonia is an attempt to liquidize national sovereignty,\" he said in a recent address posted to his official Twitter account, adding that all Spaniards should have a say in what their country looks like. Police, acting under a court order, seized almost 10 million papers relating to the upcoming ballot at a warehouse in an industrial estate near Barcelona last week. Voter lists, signs and paperwork for counting votes were also confiscated. Additional state police have been deployed to the region in the days leading up to the ballot to maintain order and prevent the vote taking place, Reuters reported, citing the Spanish Interior Ministry. The Spanish government has moored three ships, one pictured, to the dock of Barcelona's port to house police reinforcements ahead of the proposed but illegal referendum. Despite these actions, Puigdemont says he intends to defy Madrid's orders and has called upon Catalan citizens to \"defend democracy against a repressive and intimidating regime\" by going to the polls to vote as planned. And sports stars are weighing in? The referendum row is a divisive subject across Spain, but some homegrown heroes have made their feelings clear. Barcelona's football club has backed the referendum. \"FC Barcelona in remaining faithful to its historic commitment to the defence of the nation, to democracy, to freedom of speech, and to self-determination, condemns any act that may impede the free exercise of these rights,\" it said in a statement posted to its official Twitter account. Manchester City (and former Barcelona) manager Pep Guardiola has also joined the pro-independence campaign, showing his support for Catalonia at separatist demonstrations. Football manager Pep Guardiola at a pro-independence demonstration in Barcelona on June 11. But others have been somewhat reluctant to reveal their thoughts. World no.1 men's tennis player Rafael Nadal chose a different approach when asked about the upcoming vote. \"I can't imagine Spain without Catalonia and Catalonia without Spain. I don't want to see it,\" he said at a recent press conference in Prague, according to Bloomberg . Nadal added that he hoped the two sides would come together to work things out: \"We don't want fights, we don't want problems I believe we are much better together and stronger.\" What happens if the vote goes ahead? It's unclear at this point -- but Madrid insists there will be consequences if the referendum goes ahead. And if it does get as far as a vote, those who do enter the voting booth will see a single question: Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state, in the form of a republic? Should the Electoral Commission declare victory for the \"Yes\" campaign, Puigdemont has said the Generalitat will declare independence within 48 hours, Reuters reported, while a \"No\" vote would likely spark an early election.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "francisco franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carles puigdemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mariano rajoy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puigdemont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rafael nadal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pep guardiola", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "popular party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "constitutional court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "electoral commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fc barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior ministry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "catalonia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barcelona", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manchester city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prague", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T14:00:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "dffa1a59b5a3e82b8afd368f70b00e6121ccc80e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKWnt.DCaScPELciaf7O31cCbnqZVAHuR3hQk3dud3KC_JtZ4GeMOYw8rjuS9mb1lfgmwoEbjFmTKY3g1KR6nFfebOGQw_r8vkg--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Bruised Republicans regroup after Obamacare repeal fail - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Bruised Republicans regroup after Obamacare repeal fail - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926162023-mcconnell-graham-cassidy-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1013, "comments": 0, "shares": 1013}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "dffa1a59b5a3e82b8afd368f70b00e6121ccc80e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKWnt.DCaScPELciaf7O31cCbnqZVAHuR3hQk3dud3KC_JtZ4GeMOYw8rjuS9mb1lfgmwoEbjFmTKY3g1KR6nFfebOGQw_r8vkg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "MJ Lee", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bruised Republicans regroup after Obamacare repeal fail - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Republicans again failed to get 50 senators to back their health care bill Lawmakers are moving on to another tough lift -- tax reform Washington (CNN) Republicans on Capitol Hill rallied around a familiar political slogan for the better part of the last seven years: \"Repeal Obamacare.\"\nThey're finally leaving that chant behind -- at least for now. Senate won't vote on GOP health care bill GOP senators were forced to acknowledge on Tuesday that their eleventh hour push to repeal the Affordable Care Act had failed. For the second time in two months, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell publicly conceded that he could not find 50 senators who would support partisan legislation to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, made all the more painful by the reality that Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House. But unlike after the last failed attempt to repeal Obamacare in July, senators are in agreement that it is time for Republicans to move on to other things. \"Health care, as far as I am concerned, is over,\" said GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the finance committee. \"Tax reform is where we have to do the job.\" Read More The Republican zombie repeal and replace effort just died. Again. With 10 months of the legislative calendar behind them, Republicans acknowledge they've lost precious time and burned well past the early days of the Trump presidency. Members know they cannot afford to make the same errors on tax reform and survive the 2018 midterms unscathed. Behind the scenes, the \"big six,\" a coalition of Senate, House and White House leaders have been working to hash out a framework and build broad consensus on tax reform. Republican leaders are preparing to roll out principles for their plan Wednesday. \"We have to deliver on tax reform,\" said South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a member of GOP leadership. \"Failure is not an option.\" Putting it differently, Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told Bloomberg News that if Republican leaders in Congress fail on taxes like they had on passing health care bills, \"I may go home and put a bag over my head. And hide my head in a bag.\" Sen. Kennedy (R-LA) says if Congress fails on taxes like ACA repeal, \"I may go home and put a bag over my head. And hide my head in a bag.\"\n\u2014 Sahil Kapur (@sahilkapur) September 26, 2017 Still, there was no papering over the fact that Tuesday's defeat on health care was another setback for McConnell. The majority leader has spent years crafting the Republican's message around defeating the Affordable Care Act. Even his own re-election in 2014 echoed the promise. And across the Capitol, House Republicans blamed McConnell for not being able to bring his conference together. RSC chair calls female colleagues 'eye candy' during remarks Asked if he still supported McConnell as majority leader, Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker had a warning. \"Our faith does wane sometimes,\" Walker, a North Carolina congressman, said. \"We would hope that the majority leader would listen to his constituents as much as we listen to ours throughout the states we represent. We hope he can deliver on those promises but if not then we put all options on the table.\" McConnell's fellow senators were reticent to blame him for the defeat. Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, a sometimes harsh critic of McConnell, declined to attack his leader. \"It's frustrating that we haven't gotten there yet. I'm frustrated. Everybody else is frustrating, but we're making progress. We're closer than many outside observers believe,\" Cruz said. Others insisted that repealing Obamacare would remain an important mission for the party -- even if that goal isn't achieved this week. \"We haven't given up yet,\" said Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby. For now, Republican senators say they've learned some valuable lessons from the failed Graham-Cassidy bill. When the party is ready to tackle health care again, most members seemed to agree they will need an entirely new strategy. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a co-sponsor of the Graham-Cassidy bill that was declared dead Tuesday, said he would like to attempt Obamacare repeal again through the 2019 budget reconciliation bill -- but without the secrecy and rushed process that drew ire from his colleagues, including his best friend, Sen. John McCain. \"We'll have a different process. We'll go through the committee process. We'll mark the bill up through committee. We'll have three or months to talk to our Democratic friends to see if we'll have a breakthrough,\" Graham said. CORRECTION: This story has been corrected to properly attribute a quote to Sen.

Testing, too, was probably a big part of anyone's educational experience no matter where they lived. Depending on how well one performed on tests, it often meant certain doors were open -- or closed. Imagine a school now, though, where students choose their own curriculum and teachers are more like mentors guiding them through activities and topics of interest. Instead of homework and tests, portfolios and exhibitions would display your films, writing, art, and creations, and you were constantly encouraged to keep doing more. A new wave of schools are increasing in number, particularly in the U.S., many of them flipping the traditional style of schooling to a more personalized-style of education. Read More A little girl plays at the Portfolio school, which opened a year ago. A new type of school Portfolio School is a project-based start-up school in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, which emphasizes guided choice and a personalized education, mixing technology with learning activities. The school calls itself a \"micro-school\", which aims to broaden a child's creativity and is based on the philosophy that children need an interdisciplinary model of learning. Currently, the school has 19 students ranging from ages 5-10 in a single open-plan multi-purpose space with plans to grow to 80 in two years. Portfolio says its research-based approach is reinventing everything -- from the curriculum, space design, classroom management, schedule, the role of teachers and a student's engagement with the outside world. One way of achieving self-motivation is by giving power to the students, said Nancy Otero, a former software engineer who is the director of research and learning design at Portfolio. \"Our school is more like a studio. Things are open all the time. We have drills, 3D printers. We give them these powerful tools, where they can code and construct,\" said Otero. Children at Portfolio learn to build and assemble, using all sorts of tools. Kids can make things out of plaster, they can speak, write, make videos. \"Technology is not viewed as something frightening. It's one of multiple tools,\" said Dr. Shira Leibowitz, director of the lower school at Portfolio. At traditional schools, there isn't much time for most of this. \"You need large amounts of time to tinker and play and those schedules (of traditional schools) are very conforming,\" said Leibowitz. There's a policy of no homework at Portfolio. \"Research has shown it's not a useful thing. Some of the kids start not wanting to learn so much (with homework),\" said Otero. What's more, says Leibowitz, kids have time to be with their families, time to nurture friendships. \"It's not for everybody, it's very different, but part of what makes it work is that the families are here by choice.\" Photos: Bangladesh, solar-powered floating schools \u2013 All around the world, schools are reinventing education. During monsoon season in Bangladesh, almost one third of the country is flooded, making school attendance next to impossible. Nonprofit Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha came up with a way to bring education to the children most affected: by creating solar-paneled floating schools. Each morning, the elementary schools travel to different communities, picking up children along the way. The boats then docks and teach up to 30 children at a time. The schools contain a laptop, hundreds of books and electronic resources powered by energy generated from the solar panels. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: UK, virtual reality \u2013 Immersive technology is having a big moment in education right now, making its way into classrooms around the world. Among those adopting the technology is Sevenoaks School , in the UK, which has introduced VR into its classrooms for a range of subjects including art, history and geography. Students are using the technology to go on virtual field trips and creating three dimensional paintings that move. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Bali, going green \u2013 As the Green School in Bali demonstrates, innovation doesn't always equal technology. Nestled between rainforests and made entirely from bamboo, the school's mission is to educate its students about sustainability by using a holistic approach. Students from nursery to high school learn how to be more environmentally-conscious while studying traditional topics like math and languages. The Green School boasts a diverse student body from all over the world and aims to create the next generation of green leaders. The school runs on three simple principles: be local, let the environment lead and think of your grandchildren's future. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Ghana, empower playgrounds \u2013 In many parts of rural Ghana, electricity is either limited or unavailable. Students in these areas are unable to study after it gets dark, which hinders their chances of getting into a secondary school. So Empower Playgrounds created merry-go-rounds that use the children's energy to charge a battery, which then powers a small lantern. Each recharge lasts for over 40 hours and allows students to study in the evening. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Canada, paper and desk-free classrooms \u2013 It's hard to imagine a classroom without desks and paper but it's now a reality. In some schools in Canada and the U.S., for example, recent trends of creating more comfortable and open classrooms have seen traditional desks disappear. Instead, bouncy balls, bean bags and seating mats having taken their place, while iPads and computers replace traditional pen and paper. Students submit their work via different tools, such as Google Classroom, and teachers are able to give feedback and mark assignments in real time. Even chalkboards and whiteboards are being replaced by interactive smartboards. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Netherlands, personalized learning \u2013 Steve Jobs Schools are inspired by, but not affiliated with, the Apple founder.\nTheir philosophy is to encourage personalized learning by giving their students, all of primary age, more control. Pupils choose which subjects they study, how they want to learn and at what pace. Teachers are known as coaches and students are grouped not by age but by their strengths and interests. Schedules are flexible and students are each given an iPad. Starting out in the Netherlands, they opened a school in Johannesburg in 2016. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Sweden, gender-neutral schools \u2013 At Egalia preschool in Stockholm, the words \"he\" and \"her\" are never used. Boys can play with dolls and girls with firetrucks. There are no designated areas for each gender and books are carefully selected to avoid traditional stereotyping. Egalia and other similar preschools in Sweden, reject gender stereotypes and hope to help children fight societal gender norms, which they believe can hinder growth and acceptance.

Introduced last year as part of a pilot project in Singapore, Pepper helped preschool teachers deliver lessons and told pupils stories. Teachers reported that the robot helped shy students come out of their shell and created a fun, interactive atmosphere to learn in. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Denmark, forest preschools \u2013 While nature-centered schools are not uncommon around the world, in Denmark teaching children the importance of Mother Nature starts at a very young age. According to the Danish Forest and Nature Agency, over 10 percent of Danish preschools are located in forests or other natural settings. These schools use their surroundings as teaching tools, where eating organic food, hiking and raising chickens are all part of the daily lessons. Proponents of forest preschools say that children develop better motor skills when there is more space and time to play in nature rather than sitting in a classroom. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: USA, the world as your classroom \u2013 Students at the THINK Global School in New York spend each semester in a different nation. They learn languages and in each new place they visit, they work with local experts to gain insights into the historical, cultural, and socioeconomic aspects of their host country. Destinations for the 2018-19 school year include India, Botswana, Japan and Spain. Hide Caption 10 of 10 Schools created by technology experts Other similar schools in the U.S. -- mainly clustered around, unsurprisingly, California's Silicon Valley -- have cropped up thanks to parents who have worked in technology. Co-founder and CEO of Portfolio, Babur Habib, and co-founder Doug Schachtel, who runs operations of the school, came up with the idea for Portfolio over a game of squash at their alma mater Princeton University. Both have had successful careers and now have young children and felt there needed to be something different, something that wasn't already available. AltSchool was created by a former Google executive who felt frustrated by school choice for his own kids. In a similar way, the California-based AltSchool is a group of micro-schools founded by former Google executive Max Ventilla. His financial supporters include Mark Zuckerberg among many other Silicon Valley executives. AltSchool now has schools in California and New York. In Boston, former Google executive Sep Kamvar started Wildflower School in 2014 after it evolved from a project within the MIT Media Lab. It has grown to many more locations since. Stripping away the old-school methods By taking away the traditional U.S. grading system of A, B, C, D, F, Portfolio say it's liberating students instead of holding them back. \"There's no end limit. In a traditional school if you get an A+, that's it. We've taken away that ceiling so that they (students) keep going. We keep stretching,\" said Leibowitz. Children independently problem solve on walls made of whiteboards. Instead of the typical pat on the back, Leibowitz said she and her team are constantly giving feedback so students can get better and better. \"There's this culture of 'we're so lucky, we can make it better'.\" We've created an environment which does two things, said co-founder Doug Schachtel. Portfolio fosters creativity and innovation by enabling students to pursue their interests and giving them space and time to go explore them, he said. The school also ensures students learn the core skills of reading, writing and math at their own pace. \"We've achieved this innovation not through a software program but being really thoughtful about all the aspects of school,\" he said, when asked about other similar schools. Parents stamp of approval One mother of twins who attend Portfolio, Georgia Marantos, said she makes the journey from uptown to downtown Manhattan every day (with a toddler in tow also) as she liked the school so much. Her son was part of an exhibit at the school where students had created their own ice cream machine. Seeing an older nine-year old student present the machine, Marantos' son was inspired. \"He said, 'I want to do that'.\" Only 19 students currently attend the Portfolio School, but it plans to have 80 students in two years. \"That's an opportunity that would never have been there in any other classroom,\" said Marantos, of the experience of mixed age groups working together. Marantos also praised the positive shift away from being the kid who gets the award or the best grades in class to the one who's creating something incredible. Another mother at the school agrees. \"Portfolio believes every child is a genius. They don't dumb down the content because of their age and they stretch the kids beyond their comfort zone. At the same time, the teachers know the kids well and recognize each has different strengths and weaknesses, and they challenge them with great compassion,\" said Jackie Tian. Finding the right balance Some say it's too early to know what results will be seen from experimental schools. \"There's a lot of great innovation in schools right now. Project-based learning can intrinsically motivate students to be creative and explore their own interests -- not just for the sake of a test score or grade. We do a disservice to students though if we shortchange foundational learning. There needs to be a balance,\" said Karyn Wynn, a school administrator based in Palo Alto, California. \"Learning driven by genuine inquiry sparks a child's mind,\" says Wynn. \"There are also times when you need to rework an essay for the third time or struggle through a proof. Students need to build these muscles to persevere as well.\" With a balanced approach, Wynn praises project-based learning. She says the current system of rigid testing causes too much pressure and the stakes are \"ridiculously\" high. \"It's great to have more creative energy in the education field. We do need to reimagine what is possible,\" she added.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "pepper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altschool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marantos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shira leibowitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "babur habib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leibowitz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie tian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "otero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shidhulai swanirvar sangstha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sep kamvar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nancy otero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark zuckerberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "doug schachtel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karyn wynn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "max ventilla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portfolio school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "altschool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sevenoaks school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wildflower school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "danish forest and nature agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "princeton university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mit media lab", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia marantos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "global school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "bali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singapore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannesburg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "egalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "silicon valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "usa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tribeca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ghana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bangladesh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palo alto", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "botswana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T14:00:54.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "202751c5888399b7caeff10806d72a2d937a595a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFisMOU3Fu9RR8PmHQr8vU785PtQ8IqucchNlrXumJtFaGcb8gFB8UGymSjLmCL21VPVFhAvW_ZjS2lww.1O.gP", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "'A feeble no may mean yes': Indian court overturns rape conviction - CNN", "title_full": "'A feeble no may mean yes': Indian court overturns rape conviction - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/130827122557-india-rape-protests-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 4798, "comments": 0, "shares": 4798}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "202751c5888399b7caeff10806d72a2d937a595a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFisMOU3Fu9RR8PmHQr8vU785PtQ8IqucchNlrXumJtFaGcb8gFB8UGymSjLmCL21VPVFhAvW_ZjS2lww.1O.gP", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Huizhong Wu, CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "'A feeble no may mean yes': Indian court overturns rape conviction - CNN", "text": "Story highlights Judge ruled that \"a feeble 'no'\" could still signal willingness Experts contend ruling erodes the definition of consent New Delhi (CNN) An acquittal in a high-profile rape case in India has reignited debate over the meaning of consent after a judge set aside the conviction of a Bollywood filmmaker, saying \"a feeble 'no'\" could still signal willingness on the part of an alleged victim. \nMahmood Farooqui, the co-director of the hit Bollywood film \"Peepli Live,\" was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2016 after he was found guilty of raping a Columbia University graduate student at his home. Farooqui's lawyers challenged the 2016 ruling in Delhi's High Court. In their appeal, they called attention to the lack of evidence that Farooqui was alone with the victim in his house on the night of the alleged incident. They also made an alternative argument, claiming that \"if at all, such an occurrence had taken place\" it was with the alleged victim's consent. In throwing out the conviction on Monday, High Court Judge Ashutosh Kumar said Farooqui deserved the \"benefit of the doubt\" on all points. Kumar said it was not clear whether the incident, as outlined by the alleged victim, took place. Moreover, he added, Farooqui had \"no idea at all\" that the alleged victim had not given her consent. Read More Indian guru Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh sentenced to 20 years for rape \"It is not unknown that during sexual acts, one of the partners may be a little less willing or, it can be said unwilling but where there is an assumed consent, it matters not if one of the partners to the act is a bit hesitant,\" Kumar observed in his ruling. \"Such feeble hesitation can never be understood as a positive negation of any advances by the other partner.\" Elsewhere in his ruling, Kumar ruled that \"instances of woman behavior are not unknown (sic) that a feeble 'no' may mean a 'yes',\" particularly in cases where the parties involved \"are known to each other, are persons of letters and are intellectually/academically proficient, and if, in the past, there have been physical contacts.\" 'Erodes the definition of consent' The ruling has revived a debate in India over the meaning of consent in rape cases. \"In this judgment, the court has unfortunately elided over the legal definition of consent that, that many of us worked to bring into law in 2013,\" said Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer who played a role in reforming India's sexual assault laws in the wake of the brutal gang rape of a physiotherapy student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012. Jyoti Singh Pandey later died, and anger about her case led to nationwide protests and triggered reforms to India's sexual assault and harassment laws. Indian Supreme Court upholds death sentences in Delhi gang rape Indian law stipulates that consent must be \"unequivocal,\" or in other words, absolutely clear. In the case involving Farooqui, the victim's lawyer maintains that she did not give consent. \"She protested, she pushed him off, he was trying to take off her undergarments, she kept yanking them back up, but he was stronger than her, he pinned her down. Under those circumstances, it is therefore startling to hear this series of events recorded as a 'feeble no,'\" Nundy told CNN. The ruling was met with frustration in legal circles. \"(It) completely erodes the definition of consent,\" said Jhuma Sen, a professor at Jindal Global Law School. \"The court seems to be creating this additional defense that the accused must have been made aware (by the victim).\" According to court documents, the woman had met Farooqui in 2014, after she arrived in India to research her PhD. She alleged that the assault at the center of the case occurred during a visit to Farooqui's home in March 2015. The researcher's lawyers now plan to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court. \"The high court acquittal order is wrong on facts and in law,\" said Vrinda Grover, the lawyer appearing for the victim told CNN.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ashutosh kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karuna nundy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vrinda grover", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kumar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jhuma sen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "farooqui", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jyoti singh pandey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurmeet ram rahim singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nundy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mahmood farooqui", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "columbia university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indian supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jindal global law school", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T14:01:03.006+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f9c035c5e66c61ad9486405e08f59b51c8aaad70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWGITi66UEagkHP43zRIzXBcXMkAcfM2VXfqOXpekzSm7sxKUnoT1vzx9QOvdRVJ2t0-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "5 things for September 27: Roy Moore, Puerto Rico, Russia probe, Iraq, Saudi Arabia - CNN", "title_full": "5 things for September 27: Roy Moore, Puerto Rico, Russia probe, Iraq, Saudi Arabia - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170927013445-roy-moore-victory-party-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 57, "comments": 0, "shares": 57}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f9c035c5e66c61ad9486405e08f59b51c8aaad70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWGITi66UEagkHP43zRIzXBcXMkAcfM2VXfqOXpekzSm7sxKUnoT1vzx9QOvdRVJ2t0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Doug Criss", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "5 things for September 27: Roy Moore, Puerto Rico, Russia probe, Iraq, Saudi Arabia - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Ready for a vacay?

Part of the concern centered on the far-reaching and broad requests from Mueller's team. In the case of Manafort, Mueller's investigators are reaching back 11 years as they investigate possible tax and financial crimes, according to search warrant documents. Mueller is bound by a written order issued by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May which allows the special counsel to investigate \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" JUST WATCHED IRS shares info with special counsel in Russia probe Replay More Videos ...

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Nancy Otero, founding director of research and learning design at the Portfolio School, and a student at the school which favors creativity over testing. Story highlights A new wave of schools are growing, many backed by tech executives Project-based learning shifts the focus from grades to creative thinking (CNN) Whether school years were socially awkward or the happiest days of your life, this time (hopefully) brings back lifelong memories and a tinge of nostalgia for the majority of grown-ups. It was also likely a time defined by strict timetables, rigid lessons, and unforgiving homework. Testing, too, was probably a big part of anyone's educational experience no matter where they lived. Depending on how well one performed on tests, it often meant certain doors were open -- or closed. Imagine a school now, though, where students choose their own curriculum and teachers are more like mentors guiding them through activities and topics of interest. Instead of homework and tests, portfolios and exhibitions would display your films, writing, art, and creations, and you were constantly encouraged to keep doing more. A new wave of schools are increasing in number, particularly in the U.S., many of them flipping the traditional style of schooling to a more personalized-style of education. Read More A little girl plays at the Portfolio school, which opened a year ago. A new type of school Portfolio School is a project-based start-up school in New York's Tribeca neighborhood, which emphasizes guided choice and a personalized education, mixing technology with learning activities. The school calls itself a \"micro-school\", which aims to broaden a child's creativity and is based on the philosophy that children need an interdisciplinary model of learning. Currently, the school has 19 students ranging from ages 5-10 in a single open-plan multi-purpose space with plans to grow to 80 in two years. Portfolio says its research-based approach is reinventing everything -- from the curriculum, space design, classroom management, schedule, the role of teachers and a student's engagement with the outside world. One way of achieving self-motivation is by giving power to the students, said Nancy Otero, a former software engineer who is the director of research and learning design at Portfolio. \"Our school is more like a studio. Things are open all the time. We have drills, 3D printers. We give them these powerful tools, where they can code and construct,\" said Otero. Children at Portfolio learn to build and assemble, using all sorts of tools. Kids can make things out of plaster, they can speak, write, make videos. \"Technology is not viewed as something frightening. It's one of multiple tools,\" said Dr. Shira Leibowitz, director of the lower school at Portfolio. At traditional schools, there isn't much time for most of this. \"You need large amounts of time to tinker and play and those schedules (of traditional schools) are very conforming,\" said Leibowitz. There's a policy of no homework at Portfolio. \"Research has shown it's not a useful thing. Some of the kids start not wanting to learn so much (with homework),\" said Otero. What's more, says Leibowitz, kids have time to be with their families, time to nurture friendships. \"It's not for everybody, it's very different, but part of what makes it work is that the families are here by choice.\" Photos: Bangladesh, solar-powered floating schools \u2013 All around the world, schools are reinventing education. During monsoon season in Bangladesh, almost one third of the country is flooded, making school attendance next to impossible. Nonprofit Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha came up with a way to bring education to the children most affected: by creating solar-paneled floating schools. Each morning, the elementary schools travel to different communities, picking up children along the way. The boats then docks and teach up to 30 children at a time. The schools contain a laptop, hundreds of books and electronic resources powered by energy generated from the solar panels. Hide Caption 1 of 10 Photos: UK, virtual reality \u2013 Immersive technology is having a big moment in education right now, making its way into classrooms around the world. Among those adopting the technology is Sevenoaks School , in the UK, which has introduced VR into its classrooms for a range of subjects including art, history and geography. Students are using the technology to go on virtual field trips and creating three dimensional paintings that move. Hide Caption 2 of 10 Photos: Bali, going green \u2013 As the Green School in Bali demonstrates, innovation doesn't always equal technology. Nestled between rainforests and made entirely from bamboo, the school's mission is to educate its students about sustainability by using a holistic approach. Students from nursery to high school learn how to be more environmentally-conscious while studying traditional topics like math and languages. The Green School boasts a diverse student body from all over the world and aims to create the next generation of green leaders. The school runs on three simple principles: be local, let the environment lead and think of your grandchildren's future. Hide Caption 3 of 10 Photos: Ghana, empower playgrounds \u2013 In many parts of rural Ghana, electricity is either limited or unavailable. Students in these areas are unable to study after it gets dark, which hinders their chances of getting into a secondary school. So Empower Playgrounds created merry-go-rounds that use the children's energy to charge a battery, which then powers a small lantern. Each recharge lasts for over 40 hours and allows students to study in the evening. Hide Caption 4 of 10 Photos: Canada, paper and desk-free classrooms \u2013 It's hard to imagine a classroom without desks and paper but it's now a reality. In some schools in Canada and the U.S., for example, recent trends of creating more comfortable and open classrooms have seen traditional desks disappear. Instead, bouncy balls, bean bags and seating mats having taken their place, while iPads and computers replace traditional pen and paper. Students submit their work via different tools, such as Google Classroom, and teachers are able to give feedback and mark assignments in real time. Even chalkboards and whiteboards are being replaced by interactive smartboards. Hide Caption 5 of 10 Photos: Netherlands, personalized learning \u2013 Steve Jobs Schools are inspired by, but not affiliated with, the Apple founder.Their philosophy is to encourage personalized learning by giving their students, all of primary age, more control. Pupils choose which subjects they study, how they want to learn and at what pace. Teachers are known as coaches and students are grouped not by age but by their strengths and interests. Schedules are flexible and students are each given an iPad. Starting out in the Netherlands, they opened a school in Johannesburg in 2016. Hide Caption 6 of 10 Photos: Sweden, gender-neutral schools \u2013 At Egalia preschool in Stockholm, the words \"he\" and \"her\" are never used. Boys can play with dolls and girls with firetrucks. There are no designated areas for each gender and books are carefully selected to avoid traditional stereotyping. Egalia and other similar preschools in Sweden, reject gender stereotypes and hope to help children fight societal gender norms, which they believe can hinder growth and acceptance. Hide Caption 7 of 10 Photos: Singapore, robot teachers \u2013 Pepper is a robot that interacts with students and answers their questions. Introduced last year as part of a pilot project in Singapore, Pepper helped preschool teachers deliver lessons and told pupils stories. Teachers reported that the robot helped shy students come out of their shell and created a fun, interactive atmosphere to learn in. Hide Caption 8 of 10 Photos: Denmark, forest preschools \u2013 While nature-centered schools are not uncommon around the world, in Denmark teaching children the importance of Mother Nature starts at a very young age. According to the Danish Forest and Nature Agency, over 10 percent of Danish preschools are located in forests or other natural settings. These schools use their surroundings as teaching tools, where eating organic food, hiking and raising chickens are all part of the daily lessons. Proponents of forest preschools say that children develop better motor skills when there is more space and time to play in nature rather than sitting in a classroom. Hide Caption 9 of 10 Photos: USA, the world as your classroom \u2013 Students at the THINK Global School in New York spend each semester in a different nation. They learn languages and in each new place they visit, they work with local experts to gain insights into the historical, cultural, and socioeconomic aspects of their host country. Destinations for the 2018-19 school year include India, Botswana, Japan and Spain. Hide Caption 10 of 10 Schools created by technology experts Other similar schools in the U.S. -- mainly clustered around, unsurprisingly, California's Silicon Valley -- have cropped up thanks to parents who have worked in technology. Co-founder and CEO of Portfolio, Babur Habib, and co-founder Doug Schachtel, who runs operations of the school, came up with the idea for Portfolio over a game of squash at their alma mater Princeton University. Both have had successful careers and now have young children and felt there needed to be something different, something that wasn't already available. AltSchool was created by a former Google executive who felt frustrated by school choice for his own kids. In a similar way, the California-based AltSchool is a group of micro-schools founded by former Google executive Max Ventilla. His financial supporters include Mark Zuckerberg among many other Silicon Valley executives. AltSchool now has schools in California and New York. In Boston, former Google executive Sep Kamvar started Wildflower School in 2014 after it evolved from a project within the MIT Media Lab. It has grown to many more locations since. Stripping away the old-school methods By taking away the traditional U.S. grading system of A, B, C, D, F, Portfolio say it's liberating students instead of holding them back. \"There's no end limit. In a traditional school if you get an A+, that's it. We've taken away that ceiling so that they (students) keep going. We keep stretching,\" said Leibowitz. Children independently problem solve on walls made of whiteboards. Instead of the typical pat on the back, Leibowitz said she and her team are constantly giving feedback so students can get better and better. \"There's this culture of 'we're so lucky, we can make it better'.\" We've created an environment which does two things, said co-founder Doug Schachtel. Portfolio fosters creativity and innovation by enabling students to pursue their interests and giving them space and time to go explore them, he said. The school also ensures students learn the core skills of reading, writing and math at their own pace. \"We've achieved this innovation not through a software program but being really thoughtful about all the aspects of school,\" he said, when asked about other similar schools. Parents stamp of approval One mother of twins who attend Portfolio, Georgia Marantos, said she makes the journey from uptown to downtown Manhattan every day (with a toddler in tow also) as she liked the school so much. Her son was part of an exhibit at the school where students had created their own ice cream machine. Seeing an older nine-year old student present the machine, Marantos' son was inspired. \"He said, 'I want to do that'.\" Only 19 students currently attend the Portfolio School, but it plans to have 80 students in two years. \"That's an opportunity that would never have been there in any other classroom,\" said Marantos, of the experience of mixed age groups working together. Marantos also praised the positive shift away from being the kid who gets the award or the best grades in class to the one who's creating something incredible. Another mother at the school agrees. \"Portfolio believes every child is a genius. They don't dumb down the content because of their age and they stretch the kids beyond their comfort zone. At the same time, the teachers know the kids well and recognize each has different strengths and weaknesses, and they challenge them with great compassion,\" said Jackie Tian. Finding the right balance Some say it's too early to know what results will be seen from experimental schools. \"There's a lot of great innovation in schools right now. Project-based learning can intrinsically motivate students to be creative and explore their own interests -- not just for the sake of a test score or grade. We do a disservice to students though if we shortchange foundational learning. There needs to be a balance,\" said Karyn Wynn, a school administrator based in Palo Alto, California. \"Learning driven by genuine inquiry sparks a child's mind,\" says Wynn. \"There are also times when you need to rework an essay for the third time or struggle through a proof. Students need to build these muscles to persevere as well.\" With a balanced approach, Wynn praises project-based learning. She says the current system of rigid testing causes too much pressure and the stakes are \"ridiculously\" high. \"It's great to have more creative energy in the education field. We do need to reimagine what is possible,\" she added.

She's also a business maven by Katy Scott @CNNMoney September 27, 2017: 8:15 AM ET Actress Sof\u00eda Vergara at the 22nd Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles in 2016. Sofia Vergara is best known for her role on the hit TV series \"Modern Family.\" But she has another job on the side: businesswoman. The Colombian actress has played a starring role in a series of businesses going back decades, often addressing a social issue that is close to her heart. The latest is an underwear subscription service called EBY . The company delivers women's underwear, and 10% of net sales go toward microfinance loans for female entrepreneurs. \n\"The impact and the profitability of the business are both equally important to me; hence why I invested in a social enterprise,\" said Vergara. EBY co-founders Sofia Vergara and Renata Black. \nVergara isn't hurting for cash. She's been the highest-paid actress on television for the past six years according to Forbes , with total earnings of $41.5 million in the year ended June. \nForbes says that Vergara's role on \"Modern Family\" accounts for only a quarter of her income. The rest comes from movie roles, speaking engagements, licensing deals and her own businesses. \nHer ventures are often aimed at empowerment. \n\"As a woman who has been able to build my career through business, business was the most logical way to enable other women,\" said Vergara. \nThe actress got her start in business in 1994, when she noticed there weren't many agents representing Hispanics in the entertainment industry. Her response was to find a business solution. \nThe result -- launched with co-founder Luis Balaguer -- was talent management firm Latin World Entertainment (LWE). \nLos Angeles-based LWE now represents some of the biggest names in Spanish-language TV, and has since expanded into licensing and marketing. \n\"I believe the most powerful way to have an impact is through business,\" said Vergara.

The Saudi Foreign ministry announced Tuesday that a royal decree has been issued that will allow women to drive by next June. \"This is a historic big day in our kingdom,\" Prince Khaled bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the US, said Tuesday in a briefing with reporters. The move follows years of activism and appeals both from within and outside the Gulf nation. A Saudi woman walks near car down a street in the Saudi capital Riyadh on September 27, 2017. Kholoud Attar, a 32-year-old Saudi designer and magazine owner who has been running her business for 10 years, told CNN the change would make a \"huge difference\" both to her and to her female employees. Read More \"Being able to drive really facilitates a lot of logistics and helps with shaving off the time to get things done,\" she said. \"It's so thrilling to be able to do this.\" For her female workers, the biggest gain will be in not having to pay for a driver or other transportation out of their salaries, Attar said. Employing a driver currently eats up a third of the average monthly salary for her staff members, who may also have to find the money for their children's care or education, she said. As for those who remain opposed to women driving, Attar said, their voices \"just became much quieter\" thanks to the government saying it would be allowed. 'Huge battle won' Manal al-Sharif, one of the women behind the Women2Drive campaign in Saudi Arabia, said the magnitude of the decision to allow women to drive \"won't make sense\" to those outside the country, \"but if you live in Saudi Arabia, it's a huge battle that was won today.\" She celebrated the victory Tuesday by posting a photo on Twitter of herself behind the wheel of a car. \u2014 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641 (@manal_alsharif) September 26, 2017 Sharif, who now lives in Australia, was jailed in Saudi Arabia 2011 after posting a video on YouTube of herself driving a car. The act provoked death threats and spurred her to start the campaign. Speaking to CNN from Australia, she hailed Saudi Arabia's \"new leadership\" as young and \"courageous.\" There will be a \"huge backlash\" from \"the extremist Islamists in my country,\" she said. \"It won't go unnoticed.\" Economic stagnation, she said, was a big impetus for the decision. \"They cannot afford keeping the women in the back seat. They want to make women fully involved in the economy, and you can't do that -- you can't assign a woman to be in a political position or in a government position, and she still can't drive her own car.\" 'Life will be faster' Nouf Alosaimi, a 29-year-old diving instructor based in Jeddah, is pictured in diving gear. Nouf Alosaimi, a 29-year-old diving instructor based in Jeddah, told CNN that even with a driver, it was a hassle arranging trips and scheduling work appointments. \"Life will be faster,\" she said, adding that she was looking forward most of all to the adventure that will come with driving her own car. \"I live in a country that I can't explore,\" she said. \"I've always wanted to explore the kingdom's coasts... I can't take someone I don't know to drive me to these places and my brothers are too busy to take me on long trips.\" Alosaimi, who recently returned to Saudi Arabia from abroad because of an increase in demand for diving among women, said the decision would increase tourism revenues, not just because of the expected increase in women tourists but also thanks to women-run tourism businesses. Restrictive rules remain The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia follows a strict form of Wahhabi Islam that bans the mixing of sexes at public events and places numerous curbs on women, including needing the permission of a male guardian to work or travel. These restrictions are enforced by religious police. Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things Saudi women will not have to get permission from their male guardians to take driving lessons, ambassador bin Salman told CNN. However, rules that govern the guardianship of women will continue to restrict many aspects of everyday life for the country's female population. Liesl Gerntholtz, executive director of the Women's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch, told CNN that while being allowed to drive was a \"very important step,\" there was still a long way to go for Saudi women. \"This prohibition on driving is just one in a vast series of laws and policies which prevent women from doing many things,\" she said. \"The guardianship rule stops women from making every decision in her life without the assistance of a male relative, even if that relative is her 7-year-old son.\" Economic gains The move to ease some restrictions on women has huge implications for the Saudi economy and women's ability to work. It is the latest in a series of changes that have been rippling through Saudi Arabia since the rise of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince, appointed to the position by his father in June, is spearheading a plan to reform and transform the Saudi economy by 2030 and, in line with that goal, increase the number of women in the workforce. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman viists the White House, March 14, 2017. Marriam Mossalli, a Saudi entrepreneur who founded a Jeddah-based consultancy firm specializing in luxury marketing, Niche Arabia, told CNN that \"with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, things are happening quite quickly, at a 'millennial' speed,\" compared with the past. The decision to let women drive will allow the debate to move on to other, more important issues, she said. \"We can go now beyond that and look at the real issues we have, more entrepreneurs, more women in the workforce, and this is why the ban was lifted, to facilitate putting women in the workforce,\" she said. \"A driver can be costly, around $400-800 a month, while an average entry level income for a woman working for example as a school teacher is $1,600... almost half of your salary is going to a driver. This is an economical decision and a human rights one.\" Mossalli, a social media influencer whose company helped to organize the first public sports day for women in Saudi history, added: \"Being conservative and contemporary are not mutually exclusive. You can be a modern conservative Saudi.\" Conservative concerns Throughout Wednesday, the leading hashtag in the Saudi Twittersphere was against women driving. Many social media users expressed concerns that allowing women to drive would violate the kingdom's strict rules on gender segregation. Adnan el-Bar, 52, deputy director of Jeddah municipality council, told CNN the issues raised after the announcement ranged from infrastructure challenges to reservations about the possible social changes. But, he said, the government has already laid out infrastructure changes that will be put in place, including setting up driving schools for women and special entities to issue driving licenses, and providing support for female drivers in case their car breaks down. El-Bar said he didn't expect a huge increase in number of vehicles on the road once the decision is implemented. \"I expect 50% of women will not let go of their drivers,\" he said, although this could change as more women join the job market as transportation costs drop.

He's got a disaster in Puerto Rico (not to mention two others in Texas and Florida), a failed health care bill, a pending tax reform fight, a potential deal on Dreamers that could anger his base -- oh, and by the way, a confrontation with North Korea that reaches new rhetorical excesses daily. But he's obsessively tweeting about the NFL -- or Steph Curry refusing to pay homage at the White House (President to Warriors: Don't come). Over and over again. More than 20 times. So what's he thinking? First, says a friend, \"he thinks all of this is great for him. He says that his base and most of America agree with him.\" Indeed, the President told this friend, \"I say what they all want to say.\" The feeling, he adds, is that the President believes he is \"doing what he was sent to Washington to do, to chip away at all of these establishment notions in places where people are afraid to go.\" Trump's gut knows that America agrees with him on NFL controversy But not brave Donald Trump. He's so brave that he's willing to cast aside the First Amendment so those \"sons of bitches,\" as the President calls them, don't take a knee as a form of protest when the anthem is played. Instead, he'd like them fired. Maybe it's not such a brave move, especially considering that what he cares about is deeply political: playing to his base of support with his version of patriotism. He knew it would play well when he campaigned in Alabama the other night. That way, if his base is jittery over his deals with the Democrats, he can throw them a bone. Or a flag. Read More It's intuitive, this Trump MO. When doing the CNN documentary on candidate Trump last year, I spoke with Louise Sunshine, a vice president of the Trump Organization for a dozen years in the seventies and eighties. Something she said about Trump's management style stuck with me: \"Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something nobody else ever expected him ever to say, upend the entire meeting, leave everybody agog and control every situation that way...\" Well, there you go. Only now it's not a small business meeting, but a national conversation. And we follow him around like moths to a flame. One minute, it's North Korea. But wait. There's an incendiary tweet on the NFL. Onto that field. Follow CNN Opinion\nYet there's more here than intuition. When this President feels insulted, he punches back. The President who has insults for everyone cannot abide criticism of himself. Barbara Res, another ex-Trump employee, told me \"he doesn't like being challenged. Ever.\" And when he was, \"he was very loud and mean and quick to react.\" (CC: General Kelly, who, according to the New York Times, told other White House staffers that in his 35 years of service he has never been spoken to in the way Trump speaks to him.) Unfortunately for Trump, criticism is impossible to avoid if you're president. And so this President becomes consumed by grievance. And he's equal opportunity: whether it's about his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, or about Hillary Clinton or the NFL or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. No slight is too small to be dealt with by the most powerful man in the world. He'll come at you, as he did in his real estate glory days when he even posed as his own press secretary to sing his own praises and critique others in Trumpian fashion. But there's a difference: Former employee Sunshine recalled that, back in the day, when he got bad press, she would run into his office and say, \"Look, Donald, this is terrible,\" and he would tell her to calm down, reminding her that all publicity is good publicity. This is a different time and a different job.

Their stance follows US President Donald Trump's recent suggestion to NFL owners that players not standing for the National Anthem are \"sons of bitches,\" unpatriotic, and should be fired. NFL players began to kneel during the National Anthem last year, when then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before kickoff to protest against racial and social injustice, sparking both support and backlash. JUST WATCHED #TakeAKnee heats up on and off the field 02:26 However, US golfers have struck a more conciliatory tone. \"I think President Trump is right,\" said Davis Love III, last year's victorious Ryder Cup captain and an assistant to Steve Stricker this week at the Presidents Cup, which pits the star-studded US golfers against an International side in the biennial competition. Read More \"There is a time for protest, and it probably isn't during the National Anthem,\" Davis Love III told Golf Channel's Morning Drive show Tuesday. The Presidents Cup is being staged at the Liberty National course on the New Jersey shore in sight of the Statue of Liberty. The incumbent president is the event's honorary chairman. Trump has yet to confirm whether he will attend the event, but Love suggested there would be no issues at Thursday's opening ceremony. JUST WATCHED Ravens, Jaguars kneel during National Anthem 00:40 \"I think you'll see in golf that there's a little bit more restraint,\" Love said. \"We adhere to our rulebook and to our core values and to our traditions, and I think that's why our sport is so successful. There's a time for us to protest, and it really isn't during the National Anthem. \"We ought to take a break during the prayer or during the National Anthem to thank our country, to thank our forefathers who went before us. And then we can protest with our votes, with our letters to our congressmen or however we want.\" 'Pay respect' US captain Stricker said \"none\" of his team wanted to protest during the National Anthem. \"We are going to do what we always do; take off our hat and put our hands across our chest and over our heart and respect the flag,\" said Stricker. Another US star Rickie Fowler is an advocate of free speech but agreed that the National Anthem should be respected. \"We have our flag, our freedom,\" he said. \"The people who fought for our right to be able to do that. Those guys have their right and freedom of speech to do what they want. \"Do I necessarily think it's the right time to do it? No. It's our National Anthem. It's our country's flag so it's a special time to, I guess, in a way pay respect and remember what a great country we get to live in. \"But it is, you know, free speech you can do what you want but I just think it may be better at a different time.\" A look at the senior game in golf 22:29 'Beneath the office of presidency' Phil Mickelson -- at 47 the elder statesman of the US team -- added: \"We have social injustices in this country we should all strive to eliminate them. \"We've made great strides over the years but we've got a way to go. And we should all strive to eliminate those.\" Trump's remarks to supporters at a rally in Alabama last week sparked a deluge of responses across the US and on social media. On Sunday at London's Wembley Stadium, over 20 players and staff from the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars took a knee to protest against racial and social injustice -- and defy Trump. Hours later, their counterparts back in the US followed suit as players throughout the NFL sat or knelt before kickoff. Others opted to link arms, while the Seattle Seahawks and Tennessee Titans remained in their locker rooms. Few golfers aired their views, although Peter Malnati, a one-time PGA Tour winner, wrote a lengthy Twitter post in which he said Trump's words were \"divisive.

Luther Strange in Tuesday's Alabama Republican Senate runoff.\nIt was a clear victory for the conservative grassroots over the GOP establishment as Strange had the backing of, among others, President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But, there were a lot more winners -- and losers -- from the results. Here's my look at the best and the worst from Tuesday night. WINNERS * Roy Moore : Moore was already a quasi-celebrity in national conservative circles thanks to his 10 Commandments fight and refusal to sanction same-sex marriages. (Each of those stances led to his removal as a state Supreme Court justice.) But this win -- and his likely general election victory in two months -- will make him a major star in the conservative firmament. Moore will be broadly aligned with the Ted Cruz wing of the Senate but his views -- on, say, Sharia Law -- are considerably more extreme than even Cruz. And in today's Republican Party, those views -- and his unapologetic willingness to voice them -- will make him a major player on the ideological right of the party. Read More * Steve Bannon : Bannon, the former chief strategist in the Trump White House, made Alabama a test case in his efforts to overthrow the Republican party establishment. In the run-up to the vote on Tuesday, he issued sweeping condemnations of McConnell and his ilk (\"most corrupt and most incompetent group of individuals in this country\") and issued a dire warning to them: \"Your day of reckoning is coming. Those words would be just bluster if Strange had won. But Moore's convincing victory suggests that Bannon is channeling -- and leading -- a grassroots activist army on the right that should rightly scare the crap out of any Republican incumbent with any sense. * Doug Jones : Most people have never heard of the Alabama Democratic nominee. But Jones, a former US Attorney, will likely become the new cause celebre for Democrats trying to beat back the rising Trumpism within the Republican Party. The math in Alabama -- particularly in what is expected to be a very low turnout special general election just 13 days before Christmas -- is very, very tough for any Democrat. If Strange had won, Democrats would have walked away from this race. But Moore's volatility -- and controversial past -- give Jones a puncher's chance here. * Alabama polling : One of the big stories leading up to this race was that Alabama was a notoriously difficult state to poll, particularly in what was expected to be a very low-turnout affair. But, by and large, the polls were right! The Real Clear Politics average of Alabama polls gave Moore an 11-point edge. He won by 9.2 points. JUST WATCHED Roy Moore: We can support the President Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nRoy Moore: We can support the President 01:02 * Bob Corker : I'm sure the Tennessee Republican senator's retirement announcement wasn't meant to dovetail with Moore's victory. But that they came on the same day is, in a way, fitting. Corker is one of the most admired senators -- of either party in Washington -- but faced the prospect of a serious primary challenge from his right next year. And, based on Moore's convincing win on Tuesday, it's uniquely possible Corker might have found himself on the wrong end of a primary. Lots of success in politics is knowing when to get in -- and knowing when to get out. And Corker looks like he got out at just the right time. * Alabama political reporters : The special general election between Moore and Jones has at least the potential to be competitive. And, because Moore is involved, it will draw national attention. If Moore wins -- as is likely -- then oh man what a story he will be to cover. ( Here's my list of best Alabama political reporters from 2015 .) LOSERS * Mitch McConnell : The Senate majority leader -- and his aligned super PAC -- went all out for Strange. That was the right move for McConnell's internal politics since GOP incumbents have to know that the leader will do everything he can to protect them from primary challengers. It was also the right move for McConnell's broader vision of Republican politics because Moore is going to say and do things that, at a minimum, distract from McConnell's preferred message. But losing is still losing. And now McConnell not only has to contend with Moore in the Senate but the possibility that the Bannon wing of the party will oust other GOP incumbents in places like Nevada, Arizona and Mississippi. * Donald Trump : The President may have spent Tuesday night/Wednesday morning deleting tweets in support of Strange , but that won't change the fact that he was for the loser in this race. Trump's endorsement of Strange was, uh, strange from the start. He acknowledged at a rally for Strange last Friday that he really didn't know him and hadn't even talked to him before he began making calls to shore up support for the repeal and replace legislation on Obamacare. You can see why Trump did it; he wanted to placate McConnell because he needs the majority leader on his side for the future legislative fights to come. Still, for a candidate whose #brand is \"winning,\" Trump didn't do that on Tuesday. And you can bet he's pissed about it. JUST WATCHED Steve Bannon celebrates Moore's win Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nSteve Bannon celebrates Moore's win 00:51 * Roger Wicker/Dean Heller/Jeff Flake : All three GOP incumbents either already face serious primary challenges or are expected to in the very near future. Moore's victory on Tuesday night will be looked at as a blueprint for the challengers in all three of these races. And with Bannon -- and the deep-pocketed Mercer family -- keen on taking it to the establishment, this trio had better look out. * Robert Bentley : The scandal-plagued former governor got one final kick in the teeth on Tuesday when Strange, who he appointed to fill the seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, lost. Bentley's cloud hung heavy over Strange throughout the campaign; many Alabama observers believe that had the \"Luv Guv\" not appointed Strange before resigning that Big Luther would have won the special election in his own right. * $$$ : Strange had a massive spending edge in the race thanks to almost $10 million in ad spending by the McConnell-backed Senate Leadership Fund. But the money didn't really matter against Moore, who had spent decades cultivating a base of committed supporters who weren't swayed by the barrage of negative attacks about him on the Alabama airwaves. As Trump proved during the 2016 GOP presidential primary campaign, money matters less than passionate supporters. And you can't buy those with all the money in the world. * Nicknames : Strange has a good one: \"Big Luther.\" (He's 6-foot-9.) Moore doesn't have a nickname. It's my strong belief we need WAY more nicknames in politics.

The move follows years of activism and appeals both from within and outside the Gulf nation. A Saudi woman walks near car down a street in the Saudi capital Riyadh on September 27, 2017.

Employing a driver currently eats up a third of the average monthly salary for her staff members, who may also have to find the money for their children's care or education, she said. As for those who remain opposed to women driving, Attar said, their voices \"just became much quieter\" thanks to the government saying it would be allowed. 'Huge battle won' Manal al-Sharif, one of the women behind the Women2Drive campaign in Saudi Arabia, said the magnitude of the decision to allow women to drive \"won't make sense\" to those outside the country, \"but if you live in Saudi Arabia, it's a huge battle that was won today.\" She celebrated the victory Tuesday by posting a photo on Twitter of herself behind the wheel of a car. #Women2Drive #\u0642\u064a\u0627\u062f\u0647_\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0647_\u0644\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0647 pic.twitter.com/tAge3Jyrix\n\u2014 \u0645\u0646\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0633\u0639\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641 (@manal_alsharif) September 26, 2017 Sharif, who now lives in Australia, was jailed in Saudi Arabia 2011 after posting a video on YouTube of herself driving a car. The act provoked death threats and spurred her to start the campaign. Speaking to CNN from Australia, she hailed Saudi Arabia's \"new leadership\" as young and \"courageous.\" There will be a \"huge backlash\" from \"the extremist Islamists in my country,\" she said. \"It won't go unnoticed.\" Economic stagnation, she said, was a big impetus for the decision. \"They cannot afford keeping the women in the back seat. They want to make women fully involved in the economy, and you can't do that -- you can't assign a woman to be in a political position or in a government position, and she still can't drive her own car.\" When Saudi women first defied the driving ban 'Life will be faster' Nouf Alosaimi, a 29-year-old diving instructor based in Jeddah, is pictured in diving gear. Nouf Alosaimi, a 29-year-old diving instructor based in Jeddah, told CNN that even with a driver, it was a hassle arranging trips and scheduling work appointments. \"Life will be faster,\" she said, adding that she was looking forward most of all to the adventure that will come with driving her own car. \"I live in a country that I can't explore,\" she said. \"I've always wanted to explore the kingdom's coasts... I can't take someone I don't know to drive me to these places and my brothers are too busy to take me on long trips.\" Alosaimi, who recently returned to Saudi Arabia from abroad because of an increase in demand for diving among women, said the decision would increase tourism revenues, not just because of the expected increase in women tourists but also thanks to women-run tourism businesses. Restrictive rules remain The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia follows a strict form of Wahhabi Islam that bans the mixing of sexes at public events and places numerous curbs on women, including needing the permission of a male guardian to work or travel. These restrictions are enforced by religious police. Women in Saudi Arabia still can't do these things Saudi women will not have to get permission from their male guardians to take driving lessons, ambassador bin Salman told CNN. However, rules that govern the guardianship of women will continue to restrict many aspects of everyday life for the country's female population. Liesl Gerntholtz, executive director of the Women's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch, told CNN that while being allowed to drive was a \"very important step,\" there was still a long way to go for Saudi women. \"This prohibition on driving is just one in a vast series of laws and policies which prevent women from doing many things,\" she said. \"The guardianship rule stops women from making every decision in her life without the assistance of a male relative, even if that relative is her 7-year-old son.\" Economic gains The move to ease some restrictions on women has huge implications for the Saudi economy and women's ability to work. It is the latest in a series of changes that have been rippling through Saudi Arabia since the rise of 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince, appointed to the position by his father in June, is spearheading a plan to reform and transform the Saudi economy by 2030 and, in line with that goal, increase the number of women in the workforce. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman viists the White House, March 14, 2017. Marriam Mossalli, a Saudi entrepreneur who founded a Jeddah-based consultancy firm specializing in luxury marketing, Niche Arabia, told CNN that \"with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, things are happening quite quickly, at a 'millennial' speed,\" compared with the past. The decision to let women drive will allow the debate to move on to other, more important issues, she said. \"We can go now beyond that and look at the real issues we have, more entrepreneurs, more women in the workforce, and this is why the ban was lifted, to facilitate putting women in the workforce,\" she said. \"A driver can be costly, around $400-800 a month, while an average entry level income for a woman working for example as a school teacher is $1,600... almost half of your salary is going to a driver. This is an economical decision and a human rights one.\" Mossalli, a social media influencer whose company helped to organize the first public sports day for women in Saudi history, added: \"Being conservative and contemporary are not mutually exclusive. You can be a modern conservative Saudi.\" Conservative concerns Throughout Wednesday, the leading hashtag in the Saudi Twittersphere was against women driving. Many social media users expressed concerns that allowing women to drive would violate the kingdom's strict rules on gender segregation. Adnan el-Bar, 52, deputy director of Jeddah municipality council, told CNN the issues raised after the announcement ranged from infrastructure challenges to reservations about the possible social changes. But, he said, the government has already laid out infrastructure changes that will be put in place, including setting up driving schools for women and special entities to issue driving licenses, and providing support for female drivers in case their car breaks down. El-Bar said he didn't expect a huge increase in number of vehicles on the road once the decision is implemented. \"I expect 50% of women will not let go of their drivers,\" he said, although this could change as more women join the job market as transportation costs drop. JUST WATCHED Saudi Arabia's Royal Family: What to know\nSaudi Arabia's Royal Family: What to know 01:13 \"Time has come for a cultural change,\" he said. \"Now, the debate has moved from the social realm to the family. It will be up for each family to decide.\" Decisions would be based on many variables, from the cost of buying a new car to family traditions and religious beliefs, he said. The social repercussions are unpredictable, El-Bar added. While one concern is a potential backlash from conservative society against female drivers, El-Bar said that even if such incidents occur, they would be isolated cases rejected by Saudi society. \"This is a sovereign decision by the government,\" he said. \"This is not a victory for one side over the other; all decisions are for the country's interests ... to move the wheel of development forward.\" The Saudi Senior Scholars Council, Saudi Arabia's highest religious body, \"commended\" the royal order allowing women to drive in a statement Wednesday, Saudi state news agency SPA reported, saying there was no religious reason to prevent women driving vehicles.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "nouf alosaimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khaled bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mossalli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alosaimi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kholoud attar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marriam mossalli", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liesl gerntholtz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "awwad alawwad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manal al-sharif", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "attar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mohammed bin salman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "women's rights division", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "human rights watch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wahhabi islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senior scholars council", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "saudi ministry of culture", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeddah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom of saudi arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingdom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gulf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niche arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "riyadh", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T15:44:14.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c69085e314da6c778286d954a33758de106f621b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWG.6SUCfnhCQdcuFPE8Eil4EKmJ1ik6PT51I8tLITti5vdS5DQfiYDfvj8VMrg9iQxuhnHEsg9YJyORDArlsolRM33CztXJ10eqAsvhdME9mA--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "In Trump's eyes, everything is working out perfectly - CNN", "title_full": "In Trump's eyes, everything is working out perfectly - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926142504-donald-trump-september-26-2017-07-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 6358, "comments": 0, "shares": 6358}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c69085e314da6c778286d954a33758de106f621b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWG.6SUCfnhCQdcuFPE8Eil4EKmJ1ik6PT51I8tLITti5vdS5DQfiYDfvj8VMrg9iQxuhnHEsg9YJyORDArlsolRM33CztXJ10eqAsvhdME9mA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Gloria Borger", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "In Trump's eyes, everything is working out perfectly - CNN", "text": "Story highlights While Trump tweets obsessively about NFL anthem protests, he tells friends he thinks he's on the right track, writes Gloria Borger In his real estate days, Trump routinely upended meetings to the consternation of many, she writes (CNN) While much of the American public never ceases to be amazed at the President's tweets, antics or declarations from the stump, those who have known him for years take it in stride. \"This is who he is,\" says a longtime ally, referring to the NFL take-a-knee conflict. \"He triples down, and he thinks this all is great.\"\nHuh? He's got a disaster in Puerto Rico (not to mention two others in Texas and Florida), a failed health care bill, a pending tax reform fight, a potential deal on Dreamers that could anger his base -- oh, and by the way, a confrontation with North Korea that reaches new rhetorical excesses daily. But he's obsessively tweeting about the NFL -- or Steph Curry refusing to pay homage at the White House (President to Warriors: Don't come). Over and over again. More than 20 times. So what's he thinking? First, says a friend, \"he thinks all of this is great for him. He says that his base and most of America agree with him.\" Indeed, the President told this friend, \"I say what they all want to say.\" The feeling, he adds, is that the President believes he is \"doing what he was sent to Washington to do, to chip away at all of these establishment notions in places where people are afraid to go.\" Trump's gut knows that America agrees with him on NFL controversy But not brave Donald Trump. He's so brave that he's willing to cast aside the First Amendment so those \"sons of bitches,\" as the President calls them, don't take a knee as a form of protest when the anthem is played. Instead, he'd like them fired. Maybe it's not such a brave move, especially considering that what he cares about is deeply political: playing to his base of support with his version of patriotism. He knew it would play well when he campaigned in Alabama the other night. That way, if his base is jittery over his deals with the Democrats, he can throw them a bone. Or a flag. Read More It's intuitive, this Trump MO. When doing the CNN documentary on candidate Trump last year, I spoke with Louise Sunshine, a vice president of the Trump Organization for a dozen years in the seventies and eighties. Something she said about Trump's management style stuck with me: \"Donald has always managed to walk into a meeting and say something nobody else ever expected him ever to say, upend the entire meeting, leave everybody agog and control every situation that way...\" Well, there you go. Only now it's not a small business meeting, but a national conversation. And we follow him around like moths to a flame. One minute, it's North Korea. But wait. There's an incendiary tweet on the NFL. Onto that field. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \nYet there's more here than intuition. When this President feels insulted, he punches back. The President who has insults for everyone cannot abide criticism of himself. Barbara Res, another ex-Trump employee, told me \"he doesn't like being challenged. Ever.\" And when he was, \"he was very loud and mean and quick to react.\" (CC: General Kelly, who, according to the New York Times, told other White House staffers that in his 35 years of service he has never been spoken to in the way Trump speaks to him.) Unfortunately for Trump, criticism is impossible to avoid if you're president. And so this President becomes consumed by grievance. And he's equal opportunity: whether it's about his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, or about Hillary Clinton or the NFL or the size of the crowd at his inauguration. No slight is too small to be dealt with by the most powerful man in the world. He'll come at you, as he did in his real estate glory days when he even posed as his own press secretary to sing his own praises and critique others in Trumpian fashion. But there's a difference: Former employee Sunshine recalled that, back in the day, when he got bad press, she would run into his office and say, \"Look, Donald, this is terrible,\" and he would tell her to calm down, reminding her that all publicity is good publicity.

Luther Strange in Tuesday's Alabama Republican Senate runoff. It was a clear victory for the conservative grassroots over the GOP establishment as Strange had the backing of, among others, President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. But, there were a lot more winners -- and losers -- from the results. Here's my look at the best and the worst from Tuesday night. WINNERS * Roy Moore : Moore was already a quasi-celebrity in national conservative circles thanks to his 10 Commandments fight and refusal to sanction same-sex marriages. (Each of those stances led to his removal as a state Supreme Court justice.) But this win -- and his likely general election victory in two months -- will make him a major star in the conservative firmament. Moore will be broadly aligned with the Ted Cruz wing of the Senate but his views -- on, say, Sharia Law -- are considerably more extreme than even Cruz. And in today's Republican Party, those views -- and his unapologetic willingness to voice them -- will make him a major player on the ideological right of the party. Read More * Steve Bannon : Bannon, the former chief strategist in the Trump White House, made Alabama a test case in his efforts to overthrow the Republican party establishment. In the run-up to the vote on Tuesday, he issued sweeping condemnations of McConnell and his ilk (\"most corrupt and most incompetent group of individuals in this country\") and issued a dire warning to them: \"Your day of reckoning is coming. Those words would be just bluster if Strange had won. But Moore's convincing victory suggests that Bannon is channeling -- and leading -- a grassroots activist army on the right that should rightly scare the crap out of any Republican incumbent with any sense. * Doug Jones : Most people have never heard of the Alabama Democratic nominee. But Jones, a former US Attorney, will likely become the new cause celebre for Democrats trying to beat back the rising Trumpism within the Republican Party. The math in Alabama -- particularly in what is expected to be a very low turnout special general election just 13 days before Christmas -- is very, very tough for any Democrat. If Strange had won, Democrats would have walked away from this race. But Moore's volatility -- and controversial past -- give Jones a puncher's chance here. * Alabama polling : One of the big stories leading up to this race was that Alabama was a notoriously difficult state to poll, particularly in what was expected to be a very low-turnout affair. But, by and large, the polls were right! The Real Clear Politics average of Alabama polls gave Moore an 11-point edge. He won by 9.2 points.

Is aviation next? Major European carrier EasyJet announced Wednesday that it is teaming up with U.S. startup Wright Electric to build an all-electric airliner. The aircraft they have in mind would handle short routes of 335 miles or less -- think New York to Boston or London to Paris. \nEasyJet, a budget airline that specializes in shorter flights, said the new aircraft would cover 20% of its passenger journeys. \nThe airline said it has been working closely with Wright Electric this year and it hopes to have an electric commercial aircraft flying in the next decade. \n\"We can envisage a future without jet fuel and we are excited to be part of it. It is now more a matter of when not if a short haul electric plane will fly,\" said EasyJet CEO Carolyn McCall.

But the sneaker giant's sales in the U.S. continue to tumble. Shares of Nike ( NKE ) , the worst performing Dow stock of 2016, fell more than 3% in early trading Wednesday after the company reported revenue below Wall Street's forecasts. \nIts biggest problem: a continued slowdown in its home market. Sales in North America fell 3% from a year ago. \nChina sales did rise 9%. But North America accounts for more than 40% of Nike's total sales. So the strength in China was not enough to offset the weakness in the U.S. \nNike, along with struggling rival Under Armour ( UAA ) , has faced brutal competition at home from a resurgent Adidas ( ADDDF ) , which recently moved ahead of Nike's Jumpman 23 Michael Jordan line of shoes to become the second-best selling sneaker brand in America. \nRelated: Slam dunk for Adidas as sales top Nike's Jordan brand \nNike has also been dragged into the recent war of words between President Trump and high profile athletes about NFL players not standing for the national anthem as well as basketball star Steph Curry's criticism of the president. \nIt's unclear if the controversy will impact sales. But Nike has sided with its athletes . \nThe company said it supports players' right to take a knee during the playing of The Star Spangled Banner. \nAnd Nike endorser LeBron James called Trump a \"bum\" in a tweet for his criticism of Curry, his rival and Golden State Warriors star, who has a line of sneakers for Under Armour. \nCNNMoney (New York)   27, 2017: 8:12 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "curry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armour", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lebron james", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steph curry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nike", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "nike nike", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "golden state warriors", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adidas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T15:52:18.010+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b49ce510faf88a80b88b62fc55d06a38577d51ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qiY5_9YIROJ8lm8mbgdwRQXwTyiCw7WykwM4ow8px2fbS9LuHDLQtrH9lVLMb29VY7FD5NA2skZPXA--", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Saudi women driving: Economy could be big winner", "title_full": "Saudi women driving: Economy could be big winner - Sep. 27, 2017", "published": "2017-09-27T15:43:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170531112242-saudi-women-driving-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 1, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 155, "comments": 0, "shares": 155}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b49ce510faf88a80b88b62fc55d06a38577d51ac", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qiY5_9YIROJ8lm8mbgdwRQXwTyiCw7WykwM4ow8px2fbS9LuHDLQtrH9lVLMb29VY7FD5NA2skZPXA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zahraa Alkhalisi", "published": "2017-09-27T15:43:00.000+03:00", "title": "Saudi women driving: Economy could be big winner", "text": "Women driving could rev up Saudi economy by Zahraa Alkhalisi @CNNMoney September 27, 2017: 1:17 PM ET Saudi Arabia to allow women to drive Saudi women are celebrating. They are finally being allowed to drive. For years they have called for change, and some have been arrested for defying the driving ban. But a royal decree announced late Tuesday has changed all that. Detailed recommendations will follow within 30 days, and the government has until June 24, 2018, to lift the ban. \nThe dramatic step should boost efforts to overhaul the Saudi economy, spearheaded by a young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. \nThe focus of his reform program -- Vision 2030 -- is to end the Kingdom's dependence on energy in the next decade. That will require a huge diversification of the economy, including giving women a much bigger role. \nOnly 22% of women are active in the workforce. Vision 2030 aims to lift that to 30%. And at 33%, the unemployment rate for women is much higher than for men. Saudi unemployment overall is 12.7%. \nVision 2030 was unveiled in 2016 and did not specifically address the issue of women driving. \nRelated: New app helps Saudi women claim their rights \nBut there have been signs of progress for women since the radical plan was launched. \nIn February, three top jobs in finance, including the head of the stock exchange, were filled by women. A few months later, King Salman ordered a review of laws that still make it hard for many women to work, travel, undergo medical procedures and go to university without the permission of a male relative or spouse. \nMore women will work \nEnding the driving ban should bring broad economic benefits, and help the government meet its target of generating 65% of GDP from the private sector. \n\"[Lifting the ban] will have an enormous trickle down effect for many sectors of the economy from automobiles, to retail consumption and greater productivity,\" said John Sfakianakis, director of economic research at the Gulf Research Center in Riyadh. \n\"More women will have the ability to work but also have an incentive to work as more will be able to save,\" because they won't have to pay for drivers, he added. \nRelated: Saudi Arabia pushes through pain of breaking oil habit \nMany working Saudi women have to rely on drivers, taxis or male family members to get around, including to work. \nEmployers will benefit too. Some companies add the cost of a driver to salaries and even locate factories and offices in city centers to make it easier for women to get to their place of work . \nKholoud Attar, a magazine publisher, told CNN hiring women should become easier because employers would be able to offer more attractive terms. \n\"We cannot do that if a big chunk of their salary goes to a driver or other transportation method,\" he said. \nPressure for change had been building for some time. In a blog post last year , Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal wrote it was \"high time that women started driving their cars.\" \nFamilies who hire foreign drivers could save 3,800 riyals ($1,000) a month on average if women were allowed to drive, he noted. \nMany barriers remain \nThe Kingdom still has a long way to go, however. Saudi is one of the worst countries in the world for gender inequality, including in income, according to a report by the World Economic Forum. \nA women wanting to start her own business often has to ask two men to testify to her character before she can be granted a loan or a license. \nAnd women still can't mix freely with members of the opposite sex --that means most workplaces are still segregated. Some exceptions include hospitals, banks and medical colleges. \nFor the first time last week women were allowed to enter a stadium to celebrate national day. But analysts say that the royal family is likely to tread carefully on removing remaining obstacles to avoid a backlash from conservative religious authorities who, for decades, have exercised enormous influence in the home of Islam's holiest sites.

Get rid of Filibuster Rule!\" Trump did not explain who the \"Yes\" vote belongs to, though Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, missed a Monday Senate vote. His office said he was recently treated for a urological issue, though the senator tweeted Wednesday afternoon that he was not hospitalized. Cochran's office said provisions would have been made for the senator to return to Washington to help pass the bill if his vote was needed. Tuesday marked a clear end to the latest campaign to try to jam through a partisan bill to gut the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The budget vehicle allowing for Republicans to pass their repeal effort with a simple majority vote, as opposed to the 60 votes it usually takes to move legislation forward in the chamber, expires on September 30. Read More Cillizza: The Republican zombie repeal and replace effort just died. Again. Trump has called for the elimination of the filibuster before, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has summarily rejected the idea. The chamber is also relatively unified, in a bipartisan manner, against the idea, with 28 Republicans signing onto a letter with Democrats saying they wouldn't support the rule change earlier this year. The President's tweets echo the message from Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the bill's co-authors, that essentially, the policy is on the right track, but Republicans just needed more time. At a potential reckoning point, Trump fumbles for success Graham, as he appeared with GOP leaders to announce they would not hold a vote this week on the repeal bill, said a lengthier and more fulsome process would open the door to lawmakers like Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to eventually support the bill. McConnell, according to one senior GOP aide, gave Graham his commitment that there would be another chance to push for the bill after the chamber completes its work on tax reform, the next major agenda item for Republicans. For GOP senators, the idea that the effort to strip away former President Barack Obama's cornerstone achievement would just disappear is an anathema, but their options to act without Democratic support are limited. The budget reconciliation rules, which allow for Republicans to pass their repeal effort with a majority vote, as opposed to the 60 votes it usually takes to move legislation forward in the chamber, expires on September 30. Moore win, Corker retirement give McConnell a rough day The next vehicle to lock in a majority-only option is the fiscal 2018 budget package, which House and Senate negotiators have been working on for weeks. But that package is designed to clear the path for tax reform, not another repeal and replace effort. While some lawmakers, including Graham, posited that health care instructions could be tacked onto that package, House and Senate leadership is ice cold to that idea, noting that tax reform will be a heavy enough lift in isolation and that adding health care to it would only push it closer to failure. Senate won't vote on GOP health care bill Republican leadership aides have ruled it out as an option, but are not foreclosing the possibility of trying to do health care again in a budget reconciliation package early next year. That would give Graham and Sen. Bill Cassidy, his co-sponsor, time to rally support for their bill, refine the policy and put it through a more regular Senate process. But it's a process -- and stated optimism -- that ignores two important realities. First, GOP aides have made clear there were several more Republican senators who were opposed to Graham-Cassidy than publicly known. Second, Republicans have been unable to muster 50 votes for any repeal effort, regardless of policy, and finding that breakthrough during an election year raises a whole new set of political issues for the conference.

Period. By AJ Willingham , CNN Updated 1424 GMT (2224 HKT) September 27, 2017 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. (CNN) This didn't start with a knee. Everyone seems to forget that before Colin Kaepernick knelt, he sat. After sitting for the national anthem during the first three preseason games of the 2016 NFL season, the then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback met with former NFL player and Army veteran Nate Boyer to discuss the optics of his protest. It was Boyer who helped him and his teammates come to the decision to kneel, a more respectful option. Kaepernick was on board. Because then, as now, kneeling during the National Anthem was never about the anthem itself. It wasn't about the flag, or the military. It was about race, and all of the struggles that come with being a minority in America. Read More The protest's black roots Colin Kaepernick, right, and Eric Reid of the San Francisco 49ers kneel in protest during the National Anthem on September 12, 2016. There was no way the protests that Kaepernick started, which have gained new momentum in recent days, could ever be centered around anything other than race. \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" Kaepernick told NFL Media at the outset of the controversy. In 2016, almost 70% of active players on NFL rosters were black . Until last month, when a handful of white players joined in public sideline displays, every player who participated, whether with a bended knee or a raised fist, was black. In November 2016 Kaepernick broadened the scope. A 2016 poll found 37% of white respondents disliked Kaepernick \"a lot.\" Only 2% of black respondents did. \"I've been very clear from the beginning that I'm against systematic oppression,\" he told CSN Chicago . \"Police violence is just one of the symptoms of that oppression. For me, that is something that needs to be addressed, but it's not the whole issue.\" By that time, he and the handful of other players who had taken a knee were being excoriated, their jerseys used as doormats and bonfire fodder. They were called unpatriotic, ungrateful, disrespectful of flag, military and country. The backlash may have been painted with broad strokes of red white and blue, but it couldn't hide the color line below. A 2016 poll about American's perceptions of NFL players revealed Kaepernick was the league's most disliked player . Of the results, 37% of white respondents said they disliked him \"a lot.\" Only 2% of black respondents did. Conversely, 42% of black respondents said they liked him \"a lot\" -- a huge jump from two years prior, when only 16% said so. The need to prove their patriotism An American flag covers the field during the National Anthem before the NFL game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Arizona Cardinals on November 22, 2015. It is often forgotten that Kaepernick and other early adopters, maligned as un-American and disrespectful, chose their form of protest carefully and with outside consultation. \"It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel,\" 49ers safety Eric Reid wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times this week . Reid was one of the first to adopt Kaepernick's protest, kneeling beside his then-teammate during the last pre-season game of 2016. He was also privy to the perspective of Boyer, the veteran who counseled Kaepernick. Cam Newton #1 of the Carolina Panthers is tackled by Eric Reid #35 of the San Francisco 49ers on September 10, 2017. \"We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture,\" Reid wrote. \"I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.\" It was as if players had to prove their patriotism to legitimize their message. Even now, every wave of red-blooded American backlash seems to drag the message back to where it began. Rarely does a player or sports figure speak in support of the protests without reiterating their essential American-ness. \"I understand why people are offended by people protesting the National Anthem,\" Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith told ESPN . \"My father served 25 years. When he dies, he's going to be wrapped in an American flag. But my dad is also out of the Army, and he drives trucks all over the country, and he's a black man everywhere he goes, and sometimes he has racial incidents still today. That doesn't protect him, just because he served our country. And I think that's important.\" We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy. Eric Reid The few white players who have joined the protests have also emphasized their patriotism when describing their reasons for joining the protest, while still placing race at the center of their reasoning. \"I, myself, will be raising children who don't look like me, \" said Seth DeValve, who is white and is married to a black woman . \"I want to do my part as well to do everything I can to raise them in a better environment (than) we have right now.\" The President's indictment President Trump speaks at a campaign rally in support of Sen. Luther Strange on September 22. But then, at a rally for an Alabama Republican Senate candidate, President Donald Trump delivered comments to an overwhelmingly white audience that forced the movement in a different direction. Upon seeing a player kneel, Trump said NFL owners should say, \"Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he's fired. He's fired!\" \"That's a total disrespect of our heritage. That's a total disrespect for everything we stand for,\" he continued. The inclusion of the word \"heritage\" perked up ears as a loaded term often used in racist rhetoric that positions whiteness as the favored American condition. To the audience in the room, it was a patriotic comment, and they erupted in cheers. Many who saw the event on TV heard it as a deeply coded indictment. NFL owners are overwhelmingly white. And with few exceptions, these \"sons of bitches\" were black men. The inclusion of the word \"heritage\" also perked up ears as a loaded term often used in racist rhetoric that positions whiteness as the favored American condition . Some of Trump's critics saw echoes of Charlottesville, where he was slow to disavow white supremacists and claimed there were \"fine people\" on both sides.

(CNN) Water is known as the elixir of life, with good reason. Every system in your body needs it to survive. \n\"Water regulates our body temperature, keeps our joints lubricated, helps prevent infections and delivers nutrients to our cells,\" said registered US dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer. \"Additionally, our kidneys and liver work hard to get rid of toxins in our bodies, and they depend on water to do their job.\" <img alt=\"Related article: CNN Parallels: Water\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/70928121925-water-large-169.jpg\"> CNN Parallels: Water Water makes up about 60% of your body's weight, and although you can survive without food for weeks, dehydration can kill you within days or even hours, depending on the temperature and your environment. Dehydration means more water is moving out of your body's cells than into them. And as this happens, it's not just water that you lose. Small amounts of electrolytes critical to cell function and energy, such as sodium and potassium, are lost along with the water. You're constantly losing water and electrolytes throughout the day via breath, sweat, urine and bowel movements, so even mild dehydration can exhaust you and affect many of your body's daily functions. Read More Hydration and your health You could quickly become constipated as your colon steals water from your stool to keep your digestive system moving. Urine will become darker; prolonged dehydration can also crystallize salts and minerals in urine, possibly leading to the formation of painful kidney stones. How much should you drink to stay hydrated during exercise? Because dehydration can often be mistaken for hunger, you might gain weight as you try to satisfy your body's needs. Fortunately, the opposite is also true if you're hydrated. \"If you are looking to lose weight, water can help you shed pounds,\" Drayer said. \"Drinking a glass of water before a meal can fill you up a bit and help you eat fewer calories at a meal.\" If you suffer from migraines, studies show that a lack of fluids might easily trigger an episode. Headaches are also likely to last longer if you're low on fluids. In addition, dehydration can leave you unable to concentrate, cause short-term memory problems and leave you feeling moody and anxious. \"When you're well-hydrated, your sleep quality is better, your cognition is better, you function better, your mood is better, the list goes on,\" said Douglas Casa, CEO of the University of Connecticut's Korey Stringer Institute , which studies athletic performance -- another area that benefits from drinking enough fluids. \"We did a study on people who were mildly dehydrated, which can happen within just 30 minutes of exercise,\" Casa said, \"and we found mood was compromised in both men and women.\" Signs of dehydration The signs of dehydration differ by age group. Infants and young children may not be able to recognize their need for fluids, so it's critical to provide frequent fluid intake and keep an eye out for symptoms of dehydration: irritability or lethargy, no tears when crying, no wet diapers for as little as three hours, a dry mouth and tongue, sunken eyes and cheeks, and a shrinking of the soft spot on top of head. <img alt=\"Related article: CNN Parallels: Sleep\" class=\"media__image\" src=\"//i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170810212828-cnn-health-parallels-sleep-large-169.jpg\"> CNN Parallels: Sleep Adults show much different signs of dehydration, including fatigue, dizziness, confusion, less-frequent urination and extreme thirst, but the latter has one exception: the elderly. Older adults may not feel thirsty but can still be dehydrated. That's why one of the best ways to tell whether you're lacking fluids is by the color of your urine. \"The morning is the best time to get a global sense of your hydration status,\" Casa advised. \"If your urine looks more like apple juice instead of lemonade, then you're dehydrated. On the flip side, the need to urinate throughout the day is a sign that you're well-hydrated.\" Additional causes of dehydration A lack of fluids is not the only cause of dehydration. Certain blood pressure and diuretic medications can increase urination, as can diabetes that has not been diagnosed or isn't well controlled. A sudden and extreme episode of diarrhea or vomiting can remove a large amount of fluids in a short amount of time. Add a high fever, and you could be in trouble quickly. Upping fluid intake is critical. Sweating due to hot, humid conditions or extreme physical activity is another sure way to become quickly dehydrated. Athletes and those who work outside have to be especially careful to avoid heat injuries including muscle cramps, heat exhaustion and seizures. Hypovolemic shock, in which low blood volume causes a drop in oxygen and blood pressure, is the most serious form of dehydration and can be life threatening. The many sources of water What's the best way to stay hydrated? Drinking plain water, of course, can't be beat. It's readily available and has zero calories. But what if, like many Americans, you don't like the taste of water? Drayer suggests adding fruit or vegetables, such as lemons, berries and orange or cucumber slices, to enhance the flavor. Artificial sweeteners: Where do we stand? The National Academies of Medicine recommends a little over 11 cups (2.7 liters) of fluids a day for the average woman and almost 16 cups (3.7 liters) for men. Though that may sound difficult to achieve, the fluids can come from many sources besides water, including food. \"I often remind people that broth-based soup, as well as other beverages including tea, coffee and milk, count towards your daily fluid intake,\" Drayer added. \"Also vegetables including cucumbers, lettuce, celery and tomatoes and fruits including watermelon, cantaloupe and strawberries.\" \"Why don't Americans like to drink water? Because we are conditioned to expect high levels of sweetness in everything,\" said renowned nutritionist Dr. Walter Willett, professor of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"And that has led to a lot of problems,\" he added. \"High levels of sugar have adverse metabolic effects, and the amounts we get in beverages today is so huge that it is one of our major health issues.\" Willett, who is also a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, has published over 1,700 research papers and reviews on lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease. \"You might say we are malhydrated, because we drink so much soda and fruit juice and other sugar-sweetened beverages, and by that I mean we drink beverages that harm our health,\" he said. \"Even energy drinks and vitamin waters, most are loaded with sugar and not worth the use.\" Calculate your fluids To help people make better choices about their fluid intake, the American Society for Clinical Nutrition's Beverage Guidance Counsel created a \"pitcher\" of liquids to illustrate at a glance how much of each fluid is considered best for optimal health. Though it was created in 2006, Willett, who served on the council, said the guidance holds true today. The vast majority of your daily fluid intake should come from water. In this illustration, a person on a 2,200-calorie diet would drink about 50 fluid ounces of water a day, which is just over 6 cups (1.4 liters) . Another 28 fluid ounces, which is 3.5 cups or just over 700 milliliters , could come from coffee or tea. \"There are health benefits to coffee. Studies show it can help with diabetes and has some modest cardiovascular benefits,\" Willett said. \"It's a mild antidepressant. In fact, studies show about a 50% lower risk of suicide of with three to four cups of coffee a day. \"Tea has about a third the amount of caffeine as coffee, so you're much less likely to have sleep problems,\" he added, \"but we don't see as many health benefits for tea as coffee.\" The next choice in the fluid pyramid is skim milk, also sold as 1% milk, as well as soy or other unsweetened alternatives such as almond milk. For adults who wish to add that beverage to their diet, the maximum amount per day would be two cups (almost 500 milliliters). \"Milk is really complicated area because it comes along with saturated fat,\" Willett said, \"and even low-fat milk is high in calories. Up to two servings a day is fine, but going beyond that is excessive.\" Can frequent, moderate drinking ward off diabetes? Level four in the diagram includes diet sodas, teas and other beverages with non-calorie artificial or natural sweeteners such as aspartame, sucralose and stevia. Because there is growing evidence that these drinks might contribute to weight gain, Willett says they should be seen as an \"occasional treat.\" They are listed in the pitcher as no more than 16 ounces a day (2 cups or almost 500 milliliters); keep in mind that a typical can of soda is 12 ounces. Then come alcohol, whole fat milk, sports drinks, vitamin enhanced waters and fruit and vegetable juices. Yes, even fruit and veggie drinks are capped at 4 ounces a day. \"Fruit juices are cautionary because they contain about the same amount of sugar as soda,\" Willett said. \"Orange juice has nutritional value, apple juice much less, so we recommend choosing orange over apple juice.\" Alcoholic beverages are complicated, he added. \"There are definite protective health benefits against heart disease for both sexes, but for women, even a half a drink a day can raise the risk of breast cancer. So if you're not at risk for heart disease, there's no benefit in preventing it, so there's no reason to drink,\" he said. That's why alcohol is listed on the diagram as zero fluid ounces toward your daily amount. The last category is reserved for sugar- or high fructose corn syrup sweetened beverages such as regular soda, lemonade and fruit drinks. Willett says those get a '\"thumbs down\" because they provide no nutritional value and plenty of calories.

People are not dying of dehydration in America, so choosing beverages other than water and other healthy sources has major health implications.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lisa drayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "casa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas casa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walter willett", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "willet", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national academies of medicine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard medical school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american society for clinical nutrition's beverage guidance counsel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn health on facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard t.h. chan school of public health", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of connecticut's korey stringer institute", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T16:22:17.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c5f8dfedebc77208cb572fa3d6059aa611d2d982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKZruzampAK9kcNZwfzIeezRLPekna0M2I6HjO1um_0I_XHX40RC3mLLChpYiQ2YpDIWyq8wHm25B", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Trump vows - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Trump vows - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170309064856-donald-trump-and-gop-leadership-paul-ryan-mitch-mcconnell-march-1-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1336, "comments": 0, "shares": 1336}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c5f8dfedebc77208cb572fa3d6059aa611d2d982", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKZruzampAK9kcNZwfzIeezRLPekna0M2I6HjO1um_0I_XHX40RC3mLLChpYiQ2YpDIWyq8wHm25B", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Phil Mattingly", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump vows - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Tuesday marked a clear end to the latest campaign to try to jam through a partisan bill to gut Obamacare Trump has called for the elimination of the filibuster before Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump vowed Wednesday morning that Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act are not finished, even after the demise of the Graham-Cassidy health care bill.\n\"With one Yes vote in hospital & very positive signs from Alaska and two others (McCain is out), we have the HCare Vote, but not for Friday!\" the President tweeted , before adding : \"We will have the votes for Healthcare but not for the reconciliation deadline of Friday, after which we need 60. Get rid of Filibuster Rule!\" Trump did not explain who the \"Yes\" vote belongs to, though Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Mississippi, missed a Monday Senate vote. His office said he was recently treated for a urological issue, though the senator tweeted Wednesday afternoon that he was not hospitalized. Cochran's office said provisions would have been made for the senator to return to Washington to help pass the bill if his vote was needed. Tuesday marked a clear end to the latest campaign to try to jam through a partisan bill to gut the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The budget vehicle allowing for Republicans to pass their repeal effort with a simple majority vote, as opposed to the 60 votes it usually takes to move legislation forward in the chamber, expires on September 30. Read More Cillizza: The Republican zombie repeal and replace effort just died. Again. Trump has called for the elimination of the filibuster before, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has summarily rejected the idea. The chamber is also relatively unified, in a bipartisan manner, against the idea, with 28 Republicans signing onto a letter with Democrats saying they wouldn't support the rule change earlier this year. The President's tweets echo the message from Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the bill's co-authors, that essentially, the policy is on the right track, but Republicans just needed more time. At a potential reckoning point, Trump fumbles for success Graham, as he appeared with GOP leaders to announce they would not hold a vote this week on the repeal bill, said a lengthier and more fulsome process would open the door to lawmakers like Sens. John McCain of Arizona and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to eventually support the bill. McConnell, according to one senior GOP aide, gave Graham his commitment that there would be another chance to push for the bill after the chamber completes its work on tax reform, the next major agenda item for Republicans. For GOP senators, the idea that the effort to strip away former President Barack Obama's cornerstone achievement would just disappear is an anathema, but their options to act without Democratic support are limited. The budget reconciliation rules, which allow for Republicans to pass their repeal effort with a majority vote, as opposed to the 60 votes it usually takes to move legislation forward in the chamber, expires on September 30. Moore win, Corker retirement give McConnell a rough day The next vehicle to lock in a majority-only option is the fiscal 2018 budget package, which House and Senate negotiators have been working on for weeks. But that package is designed to clear the path for tax reform, not another repeal and replace effort. While some lawmakers, including Graham, posited that health care instructions could be tacked onto that package, House and Senate leadership is ice cold to that idea, noting that tax reform will be a heavy enough lift in isolation and that adding health care to it would only push it closer to failure. Senate won't vote on GOP health care bill Republican leadership aides have ruled it out as an option, but are not foreclosing the possibility of trying to do health care again in a budget reconciliation package early next year. That would give Graham and Sen. Bill Cassidy, his co-sponsor, time to rally support for their bill, refine the policy and put it through a more regular Senate process. But it's a process -- and stated optimism -- that ignores two important realities. First, GOP aides have made clear there were several more Republican senators who were opposed to Graham-Cassidy than publicly known. Second, Republicans have been unable to muster 50 votes for any repeal effort, regardless of policy, and finding that breakthrough during an election year raises a whole new set of political issues for the conference.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "mccain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obamacare trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill cassidy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mccain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thad cochran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "corker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa murkowski", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "healthcare", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mississippi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T16:22:22.003+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fba37a562c09ad676e0dd3bd3434e79051d7f7d8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWHp.SsYz.pZElUqbuPPIX5xqm6EBaxmlA.PFV1kU3ACbcnfTdQRacJalF6wq1OLtwU0JiwbEW.hXQ--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "The #TakeAKnee protests have always been about race.

Period. - CNN", "text": "(CNN) This didn't start with a knee. Everyone seems to forget that before Colin Kaepernick knelt, he sat. \nAfter sitting for the national anthem during the first three preseason games of the 2016 NFL season, the then-San Francisco 49ers quarterback met with former NFL player and Army veteran Nate Boyer to discuss the optics of his protest. It was Boyer who helped him and his teammates come to the decision to kneel, a more respectful option. Kaepernick was on board. Because then, as now, kneeling during the National Anthem was never about the anthem itself. It wasn't about the flag, or the military. It was about race, and all of the struggles that come with being a minority in America. Read More The protest's black roots Colin Kaepernick, right, and Eric Reid of the San Francisco 49ers kneel in protest during the National Anthem on September 12, 2016. There was no way the protests that Kaepernick started, which have gained new momentum in recent days, could ever be centered around anything other than race. \"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\" Kaepernick told NFL Media at the outset of the controversy. In 2016, almost 70% of active players on NFL rosters were black . Until last month, when a handful of white players joined in public sideline displays, every player who participated, whether with a bended knee or a raised fist, was black. In November 2016 Kaepernick broadened the scope. A 2016 poll found 37% of white respondents disliked Kaepernick \"a lot.\" Only 2% of black respondents did.\n\"I've been very clear from the beginning that I'm against systematic oppression,\" he told CSN Chicago . \"Police violence is just one of the symptoms of that oppression. For me, that is something that needs to be addressed, but it's not the whole issue.\" By that time, he and the handful of other players who had taken a knee were being excoriated, their jerseys used as doormats and bonfire fodder. They were called unpatriotic, ungrateful, disrespectful of flag, military and country. The backlash may have been painted with broad strokes of red white and blue, but it couldn't hide the color line below. A 2016 poll about American's perceptions of NFL players revealed Kaepernick was the league's most disliked player . Of the results, 37% of white respondents said they disliked him \"a lot.\" Only 2% of black respondents did. Conversely, 42% of black respondents said they liked him \"a lot\" -- a huge jump from two years prior, when only 16% said so. The need to prove their patriotism An American flag covers the field during the National Anthem before the NFL game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Arizona Cardinals on November 22, 2015. It is often forgotten that Kaepernick and other early adopters, maligned as un-American and disrespectful, chose their form of protest carefully and with outside consultation. \"It baffles me that our protest is still being misconstrued as disrespectful to the country, flag and military personnel,\" 49ers safety Eric Reid wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times this week . Reid was one of the first to adopt Kaepernick's protest, kneeling beside his then-teammate during the last pre-season game of 2016. He was also privy to the perspective of Boyer, the veteran who counseled Kaepernick. Cam Newton #1 of the Carolina Panthers is tackled by Eric Reid #35 of the San Francisco 49ers on September 10, 2017. \"We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture,\" Reid wrote. \"I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.\" It was as if players had to prove their patriotism to legitimize their message. Even now, every wave of red-blooded American backlash seems to drag the message back to where it began. Rarely does a player or sports figure speak in support of the protests without reiterating their essential American-ness. \"I understand why people are offended by people protesting the National Anthem,\" Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith told ESPN . \"My father served 25 years. When he dies, he's going to be wrapped in an American flag. But my dad is also out of the Army, and he drives trucks all over the country, and he's a black man everywhere he goes, and sometimes he has racial incidents still today. That doesn't protect him, just because he served our country. And I think that's important.\" We chose to kneel because it's a respectful gesture. I remember thinking our posture was like a flag flown at half-mast to mark a tragedy.\nEric Reid\nThe few white players who have joined the protests have also emphasized their patriotism when describing their reasons for joining the protest, while still placing race at the center of their reasoning. \"I, myself, will be raising children who don't look like me, \" said Seth DeValve, who is white and is married to a black woman . \"I want to do my part as well to do everything I can to raise them in a better environment (than) we have right now.\" The President's indictment President Trump speaks at a campaign rally in support of Sen. Luther Strange on September 22. But then, at a rally for an Alabama Republican Senate candidate, President Donald Trump delivered comments to an overwhelmingly white audience that forced the movement in a different direction. Upon seeing a player kneel, Trump said NFL owners should say, \"Get that son of a bitch off the field right now, he's fired. He's fired!\" \"That's a total disrespect of our heritage. That's a total disrespect for everything we stand for,\" he continued. The inclusion of the word \"heritage\" perked up ears as a loaded term often used in racist rhetoric that positions whiteness as the favored American condition. \nTo the audience in the room, it was a patriotic comment, and they erupted in cheers. Many who saw the event on TV heard it as a deeply coded indictment. NFL owners are overwhelmingly white. And with few exceptions, these \"sons of bitches\" were black men. The inclusion of the word \"heritage\" also perked up ears as a loaded term often used in racist rhetoric that positions whiteness as the favored American condition . Some of Trump's critics saw echoes of Charlottesville, where he was slow to disavow white supremacists and claimed there were \"fine people\" on both sides.

With Trump's nflammatory comments on that Alabama stage, the President forced himself into the issue front and center. He forced the hand of NFL owners, coaches, teams and players, who now had to choose a side in a movement whose meaning was in danger of being diluted and distorted as it reached more and more corners. And his words, instead of emboldening NFL owners to sanction players who kneel during the anthem, had the opposite effect. The show of unity JUST WATCHED #TakeAKnee heats up on and off the field Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \n#TakeAKnee heats up on and off the field 02:26 A year after Kaepernick first took a knee, the gifted yet polarizing player remains out of a job, ostracized by the league that once celebrated him. The photos of the quarterback, defiant and largely alone in his gesture, seem like an ancient predecessor of the sudden images of unity that filled TV screens and social media after President Trump's comments. Entire NFL franchises stood arm in arm, with owners in suits wedged stiffly between their uniformed players. As before, the crowds sometimes jeered as players knelt, but there was an air of anticipation. Suddenly, a fringe movement -- so divisive only days before -- was must-see TV. Announcers hyped the National Anthem preceding each game, the cameras lingering on each face as the music swelled. The NFL noted the moment by re-running a themed ad, titled \"Unity.\" A majority of teams disavowed Trump's statements while defending their players and the constitutional right to free speech. Only a few directly mentioned complaints about systemic racism that were central to the original protests. Regardless, the reanimated controversy gave players a fresh opportunity to assert their beliefs. Member of the Washington Redskins stand arm in arm during the playing of the National Anthem on September 24. \"As a man, as a father, as an African American man, as somebody in the NFL, as one of those 'sons of bitches,' you know, yeah I take it personally,\" Miami Dolphins safety Michael Thomas told CNN Monday. \"It's bigger than me, I have a daughter. She's going to have to live in this world. And I'm going to do whatever I have to do to make sure that she can look at her dad and be like, 'You did something. You tried to make a change.'\" The moment also became an opportunity for white allies to express their support. Dallas sportscaster Dale Hansen in particular, issued a strong statement about the protests. \"The young, black athletes are not disrespecting America or the military by taking a knee during the anthem. They are respecting the best thing about America. It's a dog whistle to the racists among us to say otherwise,\" he said on air . \"They, and all of us, should protest how black Americans are treated in this country.\" The tipping point? Activists rally in support of Colin Kaepernick outside the NFL offices on August 23, 2017 When some owners in NASCAR, a traditionally white sport, came out and said they would fire any drivers or staff who did not stand for the anthem, President Trump praised them on Twitter -- moves that, in both cases, many commentators read as being inextricable from American notions about race. The same day Trump tweeted, \"The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country, Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!\" So between the social media hashtags, the intense TV coverage and criticism from the highest office in the land, the #TakeAKnee movement has officially reached the mainstream. Will the more palatable notions of patriotism and unity eclipse the original protest against racism?\nBut will it continue to gain steam? Will it keep its focus? Will the more palatable notions of patriotism and unity eclipse the original protest against racism? Some of the movement's biggest proponents see an opportunity for growth. Maybe a movement that began around issues of racial inequality can be strengthened by newfound unity. \"Yes, it is about race,\" the Dolphins' Thomas said. \"It is about any of the inequalities in our communities, and people are going to continue to voice their opinion.\" \"I think we have a responsibility as athletes, as role models, as leaders in our communities, to really engage in these conversations,\" Philadelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins told CNN Monday. \"And what brings people together more than football?\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "colin kaepernick", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "nate boyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seth devalve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "luther strange", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dale hansen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaepernick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cam newton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark o'brien", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm jenkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric reid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "torrey smith", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cincinnati bengals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nascar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national anthem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "espn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia eagles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carolina panthers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csn chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arizona cardinals", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington redskins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nfl media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dolphins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "san francisco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlottesville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kaepernick", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dallas", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T16:22:23.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "eedf7c176af1863f5021f086bccb36c85d30302d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWG.6SUCfnhCQdFo8H2IHjlrZ4AhWjv.tWKNjf9SR7nkR6IijwfEYqYgk8uEjj8F2aQGu3w3t6asEA--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "In Alabama's GOP primary, personality beat policy (Opinion) - CNN", "title_full": "In Alabama's GOP primary, personality beat policy (Opinion) - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170926200849-20170926-alabama-election-strange-moore-composite-supporters-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 35, "comments": 0, "shares": 35}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "eedf7c176af1863f5021f086bccb36c85d30302d", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWG.6SUCfnhCQdFo8H2IHjlrZ4AhWjv.tWKNjf9SR7nkR6IijwfEYqYgk8uEjj8F2aQGu3w3t6asEA--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Douglas Heye", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "In Alabama's GOP primary, personality beat policy (Opinion) - CNN", "text": "Story highlights Anti-establishment candidate Roy Moore wins Alabama's US Senate runoff to face Democrat Douglas Heye: His victory shows personality beats policy, and that should worry the GOP Douglas Heye is a CNN political commentator and ex-deputy chief of staff to former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \n(CNN) Whether in Washington, Alabama or the 2016 primaries, the force of personality has come to outweigh the demand for specific solutions to our nation's challenges. \nVolume -- and anger -- turned up high are what tend to get rewarded. For Republicans hoping to build a long-term GOP majority, that should be troubling. Douglas Heye Democrats, however, are relishing the victory of Roy Moore -- the insurgent who won Alabama's US Senate runoff Tuesday night. Democrats knew the nomination of a candidate such as Moore, who trails controversy and was backed by Stephen Bannon, Sarah Palin and others, can help them define Republicans nationally and on December 12 potentially pick up a Senate seat in Alabama they otherwise would have considered a lost cause. Moore is a former Alabama Supreme Court justice whose controversial statements about President Barack Obama, gays and so on could help put Republican candidates on the defensive the same way that Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana did in their respective, failed 2012 Senate campaigns. (They had made highly controversial comments about rape, abortion and pregnancy.) Votes being counted in Alabama Senate race between Roy Moore and Luther Strange Read More And to be sure, Moore's vanquished opponent, the Trump-backed Luther Strange, came into the race with his own flaws. He was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions by the very (now former) governor he was investigating as Alabama attorney general, Robert Bentley. In Alabama, they didn't love Bentley; his popularity was near the bottom nationally and Strange's support from Washington Republicans made him the perfect candidate to be picked off by an anti-establishment figure such as Moore. Indeed, Moore's victory was widely predicted despite some closing in the polls in the final week of the campaign. His arrival at the polling place Tuesday morning, astride a galloping horse , could be seen as a pre-victory dance. Based on the rhetoric we saw in the closing days of the runoff, Alabama Republicans, regardless of whom they supported, were prepared to vote \"no\" on Washington. Campaign support for Moore's candidacy from Bannon, Palin and even British \"Brexit\" champion Nigel Farage indicates that the growing GOP divide is less about policy than it is about personality. It also demonstrates how taking \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" either too far or just far enough threatens to tear the Republican Party further apart at a time when it's struggling to advance any kind of meaningful agenda. Moore's campaign was more about sticking it to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the \"establishment\" than anything the candidate might do for his home state. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook \n(This predicament might have been avoided had Bentley taken McConnell's reported advice to appoint a woman to the seat. The selection of then-Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey -- now Alabama's governor -- or hard-working US Rep. Martha Roby might have avoided a full-on civil war.) What's more, Bannon's vociferous support of Moore over the Trump-backed candidate may further show that the former White House chief strategist indeed views Donald Trump as a vessel for his priorities more than anything else. To be sure, for all of the President's campaigning for Strange (a mixed-blessing, as it turned out) and for all the hand-wringing and money spent in Alabama's Senate special election, the division and undercutting actually rather closely resemble the state of today's Republican Party.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "roy moore", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric cantor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nigel farage", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kay ivey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "robert bentley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martha roby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah palin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mitch mcconnell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas heye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "todd akin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard mourdock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "douglas heye democrats", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "us senate", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "alabama supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "twitter and facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alabama senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop douglas heye", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "alabama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "indiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "missouri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T16:22:24.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "b4e45b9ee31b30d7f2ed7929302a92b53499ed16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LshoW9j5Fo2JbAR1Kjl5txbTzusdzL65dFglZcSDz8fBqJc.sXmGbHi_79FPGMgJ_UcCBaT9djNS43H.Y5kl3PY84Xu78v109A", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_showbiz.rss\r", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - Entertainment", "title": "Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are engaged", "title_full": "Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are engaged", "published": "2017-09-27T16:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170927121104-02-kit-harington-rose-leslie-file-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3175, "comments": 0, "shares": 3175}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "b4e45b9ee31b30d7f2ed7929302a92b53499ed16", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LshoW9j5Fo2JbAR1Kjl5txbTzusdzL65dFglZcSDz8fBqJc.sXmGbHi_79FPGMgJ_UcCBaT9djNS43H.Y5kl3PY84Xu78v109A", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T16:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are engaged", "text": "'Game of Thrones' stars are engaged 00:53 Story highlights Couple have been private about their relationship Harington revealed in June they were living together (CNN) Is a winter wedding coming? \"Game of Thrones\" actors Kit Harington and Rose Leslie announced their engagement Wednesday in The Times of London newspaper .

Witness Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson's interview Wednesday morning on CNN's \"New Day.\" Here's the key exchange between Johnson and Alisyn Camerota: CAMEROTA: \"You know he said lots of controversial things, that President Obama is a Muslim, 10 Commandments need to be in the statehouse. What do you think of those two things?\" JOHNSON: \"Well Alisyn, no two people agree 100% of the time. Not by a longshot. So again, we have a pretty broad spectrum of opinion and ideology serving in our Republican conferences, certainly serving in Congress. So, you just deal with individuals as they are. I have found coming here to Washington, DC, there's an awful lot of stereotypes of individuals. What exactly -- how the press portrays them is not necessarily the individual they are. I never met Judge Moore. I am looking forward to meeting him and hoping we can work together to address these serious challenges facing America.\" Read More Um, ok. Here's the thing. Johnson is right -- no two people do agree 100% of the time. But that's not the point! Not even close. Facts are not opinions. Opinions are not facts. We would do well not to conflate the two. It is a fact that Barack Obama was born in the United States. It is not a fact that Sharia law is in place in communities in Indiana and Illinois. See? Simple! One more nit to pick with Johnson's answer to Alisyn. The idea that Moore's views are somehow the result of \"how the press portrays\" him is ridiculous. Roy Moore is the one who installed and then refused to remove the 10 Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building. Roy Moore is the one who, as the chief justice of the state Supreme Court, ordered his employees not to issue same-sex marriage licenses even after gay marriage was made legal by the Supreme Court. Roy Moore was the one who said last month that he didn't believe Obama was a natural-born US citizen . (Last month!) Yes, the media reported on all of these stories. But Moore said each and every word. Roy Moore made Roy Moore, not the media. Johnson's awkward -- and, candidly, bad -- answer on Moore is likely the first of many from Senate Republicans as they seek to come to grips with what it means to welcome someone who has said what Moore has said and believes what Moore believes into their ranks.

Between now and then, his soon-to-be colleagues need to come up with some better answers when questions arise about Moore's views -- up to and including his ongoing support for the Barack Obama \"birther\" movement and his insistence that Sharia law is in place in some communities in Illinois and Indiana. Witness Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson's interview Wednesday morning on CNN's \"New Day.\" Here's the key exchange between Johnson and Alisyn Camerota: CAMEROTA: \"You know he said lots of controversial things, that President Obama is a Muslim, 10 Commandments need to be in the statehouse. What do you think of those two things?\" JOHNSON: \"Well Alisyn, no two people agree 100% of the time. Not by a longshot. So again, we have a pretty broad spectrum of opinion and ideology serving in our Republican conferences, certainly serving in Congress. So, you just deal with individuals as they are. I have found coming here to Washington, DC, there's an awful lot of stereotypes of individuals. What exactly -- how the press portrays them is not necessarily the individual they are. I never met Judge Moore. I am looking forward to meeting him and hoping we can work together to address these serious challenges facing America.\" Read More Who exactly is Roy Moore? Um, ok. Here's the thing. Johnson is right -- no two people do agree 100% of the time. But that's not the point! Not even close. Facts are not opinions. Opinions are not facts. We would do well not to conflate the two. It is a fact that Barack Obama was born in the United States. It is not a fact that Sharia law is in place in communities in Indiana and Illinois. See? Simple! One more nit to pick with Johnson's answer to Alisyn. The idea that Moore's views are somehow the result of \"how the press portrays\" him is ridiculous. Roy Moore is the one who installed and then refused to remove the 10 Commandments from the Alabama Judicial Building. Roy Moore is the one who, as the chief justice of the state Supreme Court, ordered his employees not to issue same-sex marriage licenses even after gay marriage was made legal by the Supreme Court. Roy Moore was the one who said last month that he didn't believe Obama was a natural-born US citizen . (Last month!) Yes, the media reported on all of these stories. But Moore said each and every word. Roy Moore made Roy Moore, not the media. Johnson's awkward -- and, candidly, bad -- answer on Moore is likely the first of many from Senate Republicans as they seek to come to grips with what it means to welcome someone who has said what Moore has said and believes what Moore believes into their ranks.

On Tuesday, Twitter ( TWTR , Tech30 ) announced it would test doubling the character limit of tweets as part of an ongoing effort to make the social network more intuitive and appealing. The announcement quickly set off speculation and alarm bells among some users who worried what President Trump, a prolific tweeter, might do with all the extra space. \nIn response, Twitter cofounder Biz Stone said President Trump is \"not in the test group\" for the expanded tweets. \nRelated: Why Trump's offensive tweets don't get him kicked off Twitter \nTrump has been both a blessing and a curse for Twitter. On a daily basis, Twitter is mentioned in newspapers and TV stations around the world because of Trump's tweets. But it also comes under scrutiny. \nJust this week, Twitter faced questions from users about why it wouldn't remove a controversial tweet from Trump, which North Korea's foreign minister had called a declaration of war. \n\"Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N.,\" Trump tweeted on September 23. \"If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!\" \nIn a six-tweet response thread, Twitter said one of the factors it takes into account when weighing whether to remove a tweet is the newsworthiness and public interest of the post. \nBy definition, Trump's tweets will always be newsworthy -- and soon, they may be longer, too.

For Republicans hoping to build a long-term GOP majority, that should be troubling. Douglas Heye Democrats, however, are relishing the victory of Roy Moore -- the insurgent who won Alabama's US Senate runoff Tuesday night. Democrats knew the nomination of a candidate such as Moore, who trails controversy and was backed by Stephen Bannon, Sarah Palin and others, can help them define Republicans nationally and on December 12 potentially pick up a Senate seat in Alabama they otherwise would have considered a lost cause. Moore is a former Alabama Supreme Court justice whose controversial statements about President Barack Obama, gays and so on could help put Republican candidates on the defensive the same way that Todd Akin of Missouri and Richard Mourdock of Indiana did in their respective, failed 2012 Senate campaigns. (They had made highly controversial comments about rape, abortion and pregnancy.) Votes being counted in Alabama Senate race between Roy Moore and Luther Strange Read More And to be sure, Moore's vanquished opponent, the Trump-backed Luther Strange, came into the race with his own flaws. He was appointed to fill the Senate seat vacated by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions by the very (now former) governor he was investigating as Alabama attorney general, Robert Bentley. In Alabama, they didn't love Bentley; his popularity was near the bottom nationally and Strange's support from Washington Republicans made him the perfect candidate to be picked off by an anti-establishment figure such as Moore. Indeed, Moore's victory was widely predicted despite some closing in the polls in the final week of the campaign. His arrival at the polling place Tuesday morning, astride a galloping horse , could be seen as a pre-victory dance. Based on the rhetoric we saw in the closing days of the runoff, Alabama Republicans, regardless of whom they supported, were prepared to vote \"no\" on Washington. Campaign support for Moore's candidacy from Bannon, Palin and even British \"Brexit\" champion Nigel Farage indicates that the growing GOP divide is less about policy than it is about personality. It also demonstrates how taking \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" either too far or just far enough threatens to tear the Republican Party further apart at a time when it's struggling to advance any kind of meaningful agenda. Moore's campaign was more about sticking it to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the \"establishment\" than anything the candidate might do for his home state. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n(This predicament might have been avoided had Bentley taken McConnell's reported advice to appoint a woman to the seat. The selection of then-Lt. Gov. Kay Ivey -- now Alabama's governor -- or hard-working US Rep. Martha Roby might have avoided a full-on civil war.) What's more, Bannon's vociferous support of Moore over the Trump-backed candidate may further show that the former White House chief strategist indeed views Donald Trump as a vessel for his priorities more than anything else.

For the most part, the revival pulls that off, returning to NBC in the equivalent of midseason form. Fans should be able to slide right back in -- a lot fewer of them than during the show's \"Must-See TV\" heyday, almost surely, yet enough that NBC's pre-premiere Season 2 renewal doesn't seem quite so much like a premature declaration of victory. Faced with the inevitable challenge of puttying in the extended gap, the producers wryly handle that in the premiere by having Karen (Megan Mullally) awaken from a nap, rattling off a laundry list of what's transpired in the intervening years, just to make sure she hadn't dreamed it. When she double checks who won the election, Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) sullenly respond, \"Your guy.\" That sets up a premiere episode that's probably the weakest of the three previewed, with both Will and Grace having their political principles tested -- he by an attractive congressman, her by a professional opportunity. The weightier issues, admittedly, aren't always a perfect fit with the wild antics of Karen and Jack (Sean Hayes) or the physical gags -- including a Grace-Karen sequence in a subsequent episode that plays like a Lucy-Ethel homage -- and some efforts to comment upon the political and cultural moment, like name-checking Caitlyn Jenner, can feel a trifle forced. Read More \" allowfullscreen> The show's at its strongest, actually, in reflecting the not-all-that-long-ago passage of time since the idea of a network show so prominently featuring gay men was deemed daring and groundbreaking. That's especially true of a plot in which Will dates a much-younger guy who seems mystified that coming out was ever such a big deal. Then again, it was politics -- and a video supporting Hillary Clinton's candidacy -- that initiated this reunion, and the one thing that's pretty undeniable is that the chemistry still works. If TV shows, and especially sitcoms, are ultimately about family in whatever form one constructs it, then Will and Grace and their two wacky grown-up kids haven't missed much of a beat. While the nostalgia/reboot/revival crazy has brought back lots of artifacts from TV's past, perhaps that's why this one feels more natural and organic than most. Sure, middle-aged folks likely wouldn't be sharing an apartment, regularly hanging out or popping into each other's lives so frequently if the TV gods hadn't mandated it, but one way or another, these four would always be together. \"Will & Grace\" premieres Sept. 28 at 9 p.m. on NBC.

Percy Hynes White, Stephen Moyer, Amy Acker and Natalie Alyn Lind star in \"The Gifted.\" Story highlights The show is part of the \"X-Men\" cannon Stars say there's something for everyone (CNN) Sean Teale, one of the stars of Fox's new series \"The Gifted,\" finds it fitting that his show is filmed in Atlanta given the city's rich civil rights heritage. \"[Atlanta] is a special place,\" he told CNN. \"The Civil Rights Museum is haunting, it's an incredible place to go to. The city speaks for a lot of people and it's great that a show that's trying to speak to those people, too, to some degree, can be shot in a city like that.\" \"The Gifted,\" which premieres October 2, is the latest entry in the Marvel family of entertainment. The series is part of the \"X-Men\" franchise and centers on a family whose lives are torn apart in the midst of the government's persecution of mutants with extraordinary powers. If that sounds like a timely storyline, there's a reason for that. Read More The \"X-Men\" were birthed by a quest for social justice. Creator Stan Lee told The Guardian in a 2000 interview that he was looking for a fresh idea after the success of the \"Fantastic Four\" comics in the 1960s. \"I couldn't have everybody bitten by a radioactive spider or zapped with gamma rays, and it occurred to me that if I just said that they were mutants, it would make it easy,\" Lee said. \"Then it occurred to me that instead of them just being heroes that everybody admired, what if I made other people fear and suspect and actually hate them because they were different,\" Lee said. \"I loved that idea; it not only made them different, but it was a good metaphor for what was happening with the civil rights movement in the country at that time.\" Stephen Moyer plays Reed Stucker, the patriarch of the family, who as a prosecutor has been actively involved in going after the mutants. That is until he's forced to have a very personal change of heart. The British actor who found fame on \"True Blood\" recognizes how current \"The Gifted\" will feel to viewers given all of the conversations surrounding race and immigration in the United States. His character, he said, is \"definitely on the side of law and order\" and believes he is doing the right thing in prosecuting the mutants until it touches his family. \"He has this big decision to make and he obviously chooses his family, but it means moving away from everything that he's ever believed in,\" Moyer told CNN. \"I think that there will be people watching who will maybe be on his side and sort of see that story happen and have to make a decision within it of 'Well what would I choose in that situation?'\" The cast doesn't shy away from the buzz about how \"woke\" the series is in terms of taking on the big issues. \"There are a lot of reoccurring themes and it's a big part of our show in terms of how we treat a group of minorities, how we fear them, how society shuns them, what the government is doing to protect the society and not the minorities,\" said Jamie Chung, who plays mutant Clarice, also known as Blink. \"It's the underlying theme of our entire show ... but then you have the perspective of the people just trying to survive.\" Emma Dumont stars as mutant Lorna/Polaris and said the series also focuses on the violence directed toward the mutants. \"It's about people of all different ages,\" she said. \"Now we have children that are mutants and now they're being hunted. So where is the line drawn? We're killing children now, what is this?\" Even with such heady themes, \"The Gifted\" is still very much courting the core Marvel fan base, said Coby Bell, who plays government agent Jace Turner. \"The writers are doing a very good job of giving the comic book fans what they want to see,\" Bell said. \"They have a lot of respect for how loyal these fans are and how hard core these fans are so they don't want to let them down.\" \"None of us do,\" Bell added. \"We're all doing our best to make this something that that fan base is going to enjoy.\" Amy Acker is familiar to sci-fi fans having had roles on \"Alias\" and \"Angel.\" On \"The Gifted\" she portrays the mother, Caitlin Strucker, and said the series should appeal to a wide audience. \"If you are a comic book fan there is something in your show for you,\" Acker said. \"We've got all the great comic book characters, we've got explosions, special effects and love triangles and all that good stuff. But if you don't think you're into comics, we've got stuff for you, too, because the family drama element is as much a part of it as the X-Men.\" Follow Us \u00a9 2017 Cable News Network.

What ensued was a barrage of angry venting at his political team and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had consolidated establishment GOP support behind Strange. Trump, officials and informal advisers say, felt misled by McConnell and his political team, who encouraged him to endorse and campaign for Strange. Trump's recent tweets supporting Luther Strange deleted Trump praised Moore to reporters on Wednesday. \"I'm very happy with him, and I have to say Luther came a long way from the time I endorsed him and he ran a good race, but Roy ran a really great race,\" the President told reporters on the White House South Lawn before departing for Indiana. Read More Trump said he'd never met Moore. Even before Strange's loss on Tuesday, Trump expressed misgivings about getting behind the candidate, who he deemed too \"low energy.\" Trump fretted the endorsement made him appear weak, cowed by an establishment that he'd openly rebuffed during his own campaign. His concerns were only exacerbated by the endorsement of Moore by his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who made a highly visible push for Moore as the anti-GOP-establishment candidate. But Trump felt beholden to Strange, who has supported his agenda during his few months in the Senate. His decision, according to a person familiar, was not made entirely at McConnell's request. Trump \"knew it was a mistake but one he was willing to make because Luther was loyal,\" said a senior White House official. Following Strange's loss, Trump felt he was proven right and his team had largely failed him. Winners and losers in the Alabama Senate race He went to bed \"embarrassed and pissed\" following the election loss, according to a person familiar with his mindset. Trump, multiple sources said, was furious with McConnell -- with whom he has openly feuded -- and feels outdone by his former aide Bannon. On Wednesday, Trump insisted he was confident in the Senate majority leader. \"I do have confidence in him, yes. I do have confidence,\" Trump said. \"But it's really not up to me, it's up to the Senate, but I do have confidence in him. I will say they used him in the race, and I was very honored by the way I was treated in the race, but they used him the in the race.\" Inside the White House, fingers are being pointed at Ward Baker, a McConnell strategist, and Nick Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, both of whom were involved in pushing Trump to back Strange, according to sources. The vice president's office denied that Ayers pushed Trump to endorse Strange. \"Losing is bad for his brand,\" another GOP adviser to the White House said of Trump.

Fewer income tax rates for individuals. A much larger standard deduction and child tax credit. A repeal of the estate tax. CNN obtained a copy Wednesday of a Republican framework for tax reform that has been in the works for months and will finally be presented Wednesday. The blueprint, which President Trump will discuss in a speech Wednesday, omits many critical details and numbers that congressional tax writers will now have to decide on as they draft legislation. \nIt's not clear yet, however, just how closely the tax-writing committees will hew to that framework since it's been negotiated behind closed doors by just six key players from the White House, House and Senate. And even that small group -- known as the Big Six -- took a long time to reach broad agreement. \nHow individual taxes would change \nReduce individual income tax rates: The framework shrinks the number of tax rates to just three from seven today. The proposed rates are 12%, 25% and 35%. But it will be up to the tax committees to assign income ranges to each rate. \nAlso, the drop in the top rate to 35% from 39.6% may not stick. The framework gives tax legislators the \"flexibility\" to add a fourth rate above 35% to ensure reform keeps the tax code at least as progressive as the current system. \nIf 35% remains the top rate, Democrats will charge that reform is just giving a big tax cut to the wealthy. \nAnd even though the administration says it wants reform to offer middle class tax relief, the framework calls for a 12% bottom rate, which is actually higher than today's lowest rate of 10%. But typical families in the 10% bracket today \"are expected to be better off\" when all the changes under reform are considered together, the blueprint says. \nIncrease standard deduction: The plan doubles the standard deduction, to $24,000 for married couples and $12,000 for single filers. \nDoing so would drastically reduce the number of people who opt to itemize their deductions, since the only reason to itemize is if your individual deductions combined exceed the standard. \nIncrease child tax credit: The framework calls for a \"substantially higher\" child tax credit, which today is worth $1,000 per child under 17. It will be up to lawmakers to determine how much higher to make it. In addition, it would raise the income thresholds for eligibility for the credit, meaning more people would qualify for it. \nGet rid of valuable tax breaks: The framework proposes the elimination of most itemized deductions, including the state and local tax deduction . \nIt also eliminates personal exemptions, worth $4,050 per person. So a family of four could no longer reduce their taxable income by more than $16,000. \nPreserve some deductions: Again without specifics, the framework calls for lawmakers to retain tax incentives for home ownership, retirement savings, charitable giving and higher education. But that doesn't mean lawmakers won't seek to modify the tax breaks that currently exist in these areas. \nRepeal the Alternative Minimum Tax: The AMT most typically hits filers making between $200,000 and $1 million. \nIt was originally intended to ensure the wealthy pay at least some tax. \nKill the estate tax: What Republicans refer to as the \"death tax\" only affects about 0.2% of all estates -- and only those worth more than $5.5 million. \nHow business taxes would change \nCut corporate tax rate to 20%: Such a drastic drop from today's 35% rate would put the U.S. rate below the 22.5% average in the industrialized world. But doing so will be expensive. It's estimated to cost roughly $1.5 trillion over a decade. \nDrop tax rates on small businesses and other pass-throughs: The top rate would be 25% down from 39.6% on the profits of so-called pass-through businesses. A pass-through passes its profits through to partners and shareholders, who then report them on their individual returns. \nThe framework will recommend the committees include measures to prevent gaming , in which people try to recharacterize their wages as pass-through profits to get the lower rate. \nChange how U.S. multinationals are taxed: Today, U.S. multinational firms pay a 35% tax on overseas profits when they bring them back to U.S. shores. The framework calls for a switch to a \"territorial system,\" where the overseas profits of U.S. companies would no longer be subject to U.S. tax, just to the tax of the government where the money was made. \nThe hope is that the new system will make U.S. companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, and that they will use more of their foreign profits to invest and create jobs in the United States. \nBut to dissuade U.S. companies from artificially shifting their profits to low-tax (or no tax) havens, the framework also would impose a minimum foreign tax, though the rate is unspecifiied. \nIn addition, it would offer a low, one-time tax rate on existing overseas profits to entice companies to bring that money back too. It's not yet clear if the tax would have to be paid even if the money isn't brought back. \n-- CNN's Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report CNNMoney (New York) First published September 27, 2017: 10:05 AM ET ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jeanne sahadi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "deirdre walsh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T17:19:58.001+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1d5c17b5c6402b71f1be5b1ae9ed115dc61f239e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qia3A1XbH9zXyN1_GTDBKDMRMCAOZxHrQIpCqVzP46q_mqiv6XrvVUM_fg1JrvWkAK0-", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Night of desperation in San Juan's airport", "title_full": "Night of desperation in San Juan's airport", "published": "2017-09-27T17:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170927084412-puerto-rico-airport-heat-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 7480, "comments": 0, "shares": 7480}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1d5c17b5c6402b71f1be5b1ae9ed115dc61f239e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qia3A1XbH9zXyN1_GTDBKDMRMCAOZxHrQIpCqVzP46q_mqiv6XrvVUM_fg1JrvWkAK0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T17:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "Night of desperation in San Juan's airport", "text": "Hundreds stranded at Puerto Rican airport Doris Montalvo already escaped Puerto Rico once. She left the island and its economic problems seven years ago and found work as a nurse in Connecticut. She recently returned for the first time for vacation, and now she can't get out -- trapped this time in an airport terminal in San Juan, one sweltering corner of the humanitarian crisis caused by Hurricane Maria. \nIn 100-degree heat, with no air conditioning and a scarce security presence, Montalvo spent the night waiting with her daughter, three grandchildren and the daughter's boyfriend. Scores of others waited with them. They had little water, little food, no working ATMs and no idea when they would get out. \nMontalvo, 54, had driven from the other side of the island because their flight there was canceled. She and her family were told that the first flight they could get out of San Juan would depart October 9. Hotels weren't taking reservations. She couldn't withdraw cash. Stress set in. \n\"We just want to get home and get back to our routines, our lives,\" Montalvo said. \"I don't feel safe here. ... I don't want (my grandchildren) to sleep on the sidewalk.\" \nOne week after Maria battered the island, the more than 3 million Americans who live there are struggling to survive. People are scavenging for food, collecting water from mountain streams and drinking the rain. Power is out across the island. Generators and batteries are keeping hospitals open. \nThe San Juan airport, by far the largest on the island, is barely functioning. Airlines are having trouble printing boarding passes. TSA equipment was damaged by the hurricane, so security checks are done by hand. \nOnly 10 commercial flights made it in and out on Tuesday, and only 18 were expected on Wednesday, according to the airport authority. \nMore relief flights are getting in. Airlines are delivering food, water, medicine, blankets, cots, generators and blood for the Red Cross. Those relief flights are returning with as many people as can get on the plane, United says. \nRelated: Puerto Ricans still waiting for aid a week after Maria's devastation \nDoris Montalvo with her three grandchildren. \nWhen she lived in Puerto Rico, Montalvo made $15 an hour as a nurse. She got out in the early years of an economic crisis. The unemployment rate on the island is double the national average. The government is bankrupt. People leave every year by the tens of thousands. \nNow she makes $36 an hour at a dialysis clinic in Connecticut. She needed to get back to her job, and she needed to get the grandchildren home to be registered at their new school, Walsh Elementary in Waterbury. Montalvo worries they will lose their seats if they are stuck in Puerto Rico for weeks. \nFifty yards down the terminal, Stephanie Navarro also wants to give her two young daughters a better life. They were supposed to move Tuesday to a relative's place in upstate New York, where Navarro believes she can find a better job and good schools. \nInstead, they slept on the terminal floor, along with Navarro's boyfriend, Javier, waiting for the next Delta plane after their original flight was canceled. \n\"We're stuck here. There's no phone to call people, there's no water, there's no ice, there's no nothing,\" said Navarro, 26. \nRelated: Who will help Puerto Rico? \nOther travelers described their own nightmares. \nAlicia Beniquez was traveling with her husband and her 3-year-old granddaughter. Before trying to fly home to New Haven, Connecticut, she tried to return her rental car to the company, U Save, with a full tank of gas. \n\"You go to the gas station and all you get is $10,\" Beniquez said. \"I brought it back with a quarter tank and they want to charge you.\" \nU Save did not respond to CNNMoney's request for comment. Beniquez slept at the airport Tuesday. \nStanding in line, Eric Mott tried to bring order to chaos. He made a list of the names of the strangers waiting with him. He planned to give it to Southwest Airlines employees in the morning. He had three pages' worth already. \nMott, a real estate agent in Denver, wanted to make sure no one stole a place in line. People were sweating through the night, sleeping on steel chairs. \n\"I'm a firm believer that people want to do the right thing, but then when emotions get involved ... \" Mott said, trailing off. \"We're going to spend the night here tonight. I want it to be nice and orderly.\" \nSurrounded by strangers at an airport that was barely operating, he had no plans to sleep. \n\"I haven't pulled an all-nighter since college,\" he said, \"so I'm due for one.\" \n--Chris Isidore, Ivan Watson and Jo Shelley contributed reporting to this article \nCNNMoney (San Juan, Puerto Rico)   10:07 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T17:20:01.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e85b8a26898f4e266f9606edc2b2944b0cd2cf36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKZruzampAK9kcNZwfzIeezSWkCZjQsIYKVxLX7Ehr5qTCk21DW.mzi8yER73aM3GTLcJ9pQtN8Fz", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Trump infuriated after backing Alabama loser - CNNPolitics", "title_full": "Trump infuriated after backing Alabama loser - CNNPolitics", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170922224906-trump-luther-strange-09-22-2017-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 0, "comments": 0, "shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e85b8a26898f4e266f9606edc2b2944b0cd2cf36", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWH8rwDYKWyGKZruzampAK9kcNZwfzIeezSWkCZjQsIYKVxLX7Ehr5qTCk21DW.mzi8yER73aM3GTLcJ9pQtN8Fz", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jim Acosta", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Trump infuriated after backing Alabama loser - CNNPolitics", "text": "Story highlights Trump expressed misgivings even before Luther Strange's loss It's increased his ire against McConnell Trump deleted a series of tweets backing Strange (CNN) Returning from a high-dollar fundraiser in Manhattan on Tuesday evening, an infuriated President Donald Trump watched aboard Air Force One as Fox News called the Alabama Senate primary for Roy Moore against Trump's favored candidate, Luther Strange.\nWhat ensued was a barrage of angry venting at his political team and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had consolidated establishment GOP support behind Strange. Trump, officials and informal advisers say, felt misled by McConnell and his political team, who encouraged him to endorse and campaign for Strange. Trump's recent tweets supporting Luther Strange deleted Even before Strange's loss on Tuesday, Trump expressed misgivings about getting behind the candidate, who he deemed too \"low energy.\" Trump fretted the endorsement made him appear weak, cowed by an establishment that he'd openly rebuffed during his own campaign. His concerns were only exacerbated by the endorsement of Moore by his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who made a highly visible push for Moore as the anti-GOP-establishment candidate. Read More But Trump felt beholden to Strange, who has supported his agenda during his few months in the Senate. His decision, according to a person familiar, was not made entirely at McConnell's request. Trump \"knew it was a mistake but one he was willing to make because Luther was loyal,\" said a senior White House official.

Winners and losers in the Alabama Senate race He went to bed \"embarrassed and pissed\" following the election loss, according to a person familiar with his mindset. Trump, multiple sources said, is furious with McConnell, and feels outdone by his former aide Bannon. It is only the latest in growing list of reasons Trump is furious at McConnell. Inside the White House, fingers are being pointed at Ward Baker, a McConnell strategist, and Nick Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, both of whom were involved in pushing Trump to back Strange, according to sources. \"Losing is bad for his brand,\" another GOP adviser to the White House said of Trump. One person Trump has not appeared to blame: himself. Late Tuesday, Trump sought to erase his backing of Strange, deleting a series of tweets encouraging Alabamans to vote for the Republican senator.

For the most part, the revival pulls that off, returning to NBC in the equivalent of midseason form.\nFans should be able to slide right back in -- a lot fewer of them than during the show's \"Must-See TV\" heyday, almost surely, yet enough that NBC's pre-premiere Season 2 renewal doesn't seem quite so much like a premature declaration of victory. Faced with the inevitable challenge of puttying in the extended gap, the producers wryly handle that in the premiere by having Karen (Megan Mullally) awaken from a nap, rattling off a laundry list of what's transpired in the intervening years, just to make sure she hadn't dreamed it. When she double checks who won the election, Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace (Debra Messing) sullenly respond, \"Your guy.\" That sets up a premiere episode that's probably the weakest of the three previewed, with both Will and Grace having their political principles tested -- he by an attractive congressman, her by a professional opportunity. The weightier issues, admittedly, aren't always a perfect fit with the wild antics of Karen and Jack (Sean Hayes) or the physical gags -- including a Grace-Karen sequence in a subsequent episode that plays like a Lucy-Ethel homage -- and some efforts to comment upon the political and cultural moment, like name-checking Caitlyn Jenner, can feel a trifle forced. Read More \" allowfullscreen> The show's at its strongest, actually, in reflecting the not-all-that-long-ago passage of time since the idea of a network show so prominently featuring gay men was deemed daring and groundbreaking. That's especially true of a plot in which Will dates a much-younger guy who seems mystified that coming out was ever such a big deal. Then again, it was politics -- and a video supporting Hillary Clinton's candidacy -- that initiated this reunion, and the one thing that's pretty undeniable is that the chemistry still works. If TV shows, and especially sitcoms, are ultimately about family in whatever form one constructs it, then Will and Grace and their two wacky grown-up kids haven't missed much of a beat. While the nostalgia/reboot/revival crazy has brought back lots of artifacts from TV's past, perhaps that's why this one feels more natural and organic than most. Sure, middle-aged folks likely wouldn't be sharing an apartment, regularly hanging out or popping into each other's lives so frequently if the TV gods hadn't mandated it, but one way or another, these four would always be together. \"Will & Grace\" premieres Sept. 28 at 9 p.m. on NBC.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sean hayes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caitlyn jenner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debra messing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megan mullally", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric mccormack", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T17:21:17.004+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "537be85634e8016c28c97017cf2f2d456e565a25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFaTaVfEUjSYU003SB13qKQr3SO5Q4ntMHuqEsEjQ4rJA_iIenGxcUUtNwFVSG.B_U-", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "'The Gifted' enters 'X-Men' cannon - CNN", "title_full": "'The Gifted' enters 'X-Men' cannon - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170927081710-the-gifted-family-fox-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 51, "comments": 0, "shares": 51}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "537be85634e8016c28c97017cf2f2d456e565a25", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWFaTaVfEUjSYU003SB13qKQr3SO5Q4ntMHuqEsEjQ4rJA_iIenGxcUUtNwFVSG.B_U-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Lisa Respers France", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "'The Gifted' enters 'X-Men' cannon - CNN", "text": "Story highlights The show is part of the \"X-Men\" cannon Stars say there's something for everyone (CNN) Sean Teale, one of the stars of Fox's new series \"The Gifted,\" finds it fitting that his show is filmed in Atlanta given the city's rich civil rights heritage.\n\"[Atlanta] is a special place,\" he told CNN. \"The Civil Rights Museum is haunting, it's an incredible place to go to. The city speaks for a lot of people and it's great that a show that's trying to speak to those people, too, to some degree, can be shot in a city like that.\" \"The Gifted,\" which premieres October 2, is the latest entry in the Marvel family of entertainment. The series is part of the \"X-Men\" franchise and centers on a family whose lives are torn apart in the midst of the government's persecution of mutants with extraordinary powers. If that sounds like a timely storyline, there's a reason for that. Read More The \"X-Men\" were birthed by a quest for social justice. Creator Stan Lee told The Guardian in a 2000 interview that he was looking for a fresh idea after the success of the \"Fantastic Four\" comics in the 1960s. \"I couldn't have everybody bitten by a radioactive spider or zapped with gamma rays, and it occurred to me that if I just said that they were mutants, it would make it easy,\" Lee said. \"Then it occurred to me that instead of them just being heroes that everybody admired, what if I made other people fear and suspect and actually hate them because they were different,\" Lee said. \"I loved that idea; it not only made them different, but it was a good metaphor for what was happening with the civil rights movement in the country at that time.\" Stephen Moyer plays Reed Stucker, the patriarch of the family, who as a prosecutor has been actively involved in going after the mutants. That is until he's forced to have a very personal change of heart. The British actor who found fame on \"True Blood\" recognizes how current \"The Gifted\" will feel to viewers given all of the conversations surrounding race and immigration in the United States. His character, he said, is \"definitely on the side of law and order\" and believes he is doing the right thing in prosecuting the mutants until it touches his family. \"He has this big decision to make and he obviously chooses his family, but it means moving away from everything that he's ever believed in,\" Moyer told CNN. \"I think that there will be people watching who will maybe be on his side and sort of see that story happen and have to make a decision within it of 'Well what would I choose in that situation?'\" The cast doesn't shy away from the buzz about how \"woke\" the series is in terms of taking on the big issues. \"There are a lot of reoccurring themes and it's a big part of our show in terms of how we treat a group of minorities, how we fear them, how society shuns them, what the government is doing to protect the society and not the minorities,\" said Jamie Chung, who plays mutant Clarice, also known as Blink. \"It's the underlying theme of our entire show ... but then you have the perspective of the people just trying to survive.\" Emma Dumont stars as mutant Lorna/Polaris and said the series also focuses on the violence directed toward the mutants. \"It's about people of all different ages,\" she said. \"Now we have children that are mutants and now they're being hunted. So where is the line drawn? We're killing children now, what is this?\" Even with such heady themes, \"The Gifted\" is still very much courting the core Marvel fan base, said Coby Bell, who plays government agent Jace Turner. \"The writers are doing a very good job of giving the comic book fans what they want to see,\" Bell said. \"They have a lot of respect for how loyal these fans are and how hard core these fans are so they don't want to let them down.\" \"None of us do,\" Bell added. \"We're all doing our best to make this something that that fan base is going to enjoy.\" Amy Acker is familiar to sci-fi fans having had roles on \"Alias\" and \"Angel.\" On \"The Gifted\" she portrays the mother, Caitlin Strucker, and said the series should appeal to a wide audience. \"If you are a comic book fan there is something in your show for you,\" Acker said. \"We've got all the great comic book characters, we've got explosions, special effects and love triangles and all that good stuff. But if you don't think you're into comics, we've got stuff for you, too, because the family drama element is as much a part of it as the X-Men.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "stan lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamie chung", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed stucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coby bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amy acker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emma dumont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caitlin strucker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jace turner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "acker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen moyer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean teal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "the guardian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "civil rights museum", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T17:21:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "54e1d8d826a942defc0c301f1c107ea4ffff4c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qiaQ7MOZgLiuS1QrqqxsYA8GU5mvn69Ce8_Ldarqe025J.3RkYJNHw4W.BJJTDT4JhqEHOYP61uEA0GVhSt7e7jH", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_technology.rss#2", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Technology news - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Super Nintendo mini-console is your new must-have obsession", "title_full": "Super Nintendo mini-console is your new must-have obsession - Sep. 27, 2017", "published": "2017-09-27T18:01:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170926161109-super-nintendo-classic-mini-1-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 3, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 378, "comments": 0, "shares": 378}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "54e1d8d826a942defc0c301f1c107ea4ffff4c1f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGa6j0GHu4qiaQ7MOZgLiuS1QrqqxsYA8GU5mvn69Ce8_Ldarqe025J.3RkYJNHw4W.BJJTDT4JhqEHOYP61uEA0GVhSt7e7jH", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Samantha Murphy Kelly", "published": "2017-09-27T18:01:00.000+03:00", "title": "Super Nintendo mini-console is your new must-have obsession", "text": "by Samantha Murphy Kelly @HeySamantha September 27, 2017: 10:01 AM ET Hands on with the Super Nintendo Classic Edition Grab a seat on the floor in front of the TV, fire up a '90s playlist and cancel your weekend plans. The Super Nintendo Classic Edition has arrived. Nintendo ( NTDOF ) on Friday will follow-up its ultra popular NES Classic Edition, a miniature version of its original console gaming system, by releasing a miniature version of its Super NES system. The smaller Super NES Classic Edition comes with 21 built-in games, including \"Super Mario World,\" \"Yoshi's Island\" and a new title, \"Star Fox 2.\" \nThe NES Classic Edition was one of the hottest holiday gifts of 2016, and nearly impossible to find. It was so popular the company announced plans to bring back the product in 2018 because of strong demand. \nIf pre-order buzz is any indication, it could be even harder to pin down a Super NES Classic this holiday season. \nFor now, the release is good news for anyone determined to once again beat the Rainbow Road level of \"Mario Kart\" and take a delightful trip down memory lane. These throwback devices have massive mainstream appeal, and tug at the heartstrings of anyone who played Nintendo games growing up. \nRelated: Nintendo's mini-sized classic console is coming back in 2018 The Super NES Classic Edition (left) and the original gaming system (right) \nUnlike modern gaming systems, the mini-consoles don't connect to the internet and therefore, players can't download -- and spend money on -- new games over time. But Nintendo is onto something with the introduction of the new Star Fox title.That game is incentive enough for serious gamers to drop $79.99 on the console -- about $20 more than last year's NES Classic Edition. (You'll need to play the first level of the original \"Star Fox\" game to unlock the sequel). \nThe size alone, while cute, is also smart: It's easy to toss the system into a bag and bring it to a friend's house. \nThe console comes with two wired controllers that fit in the palm of your hand. That's a solid improvement from the NES Classic, which only came with one. \nRelated: Nintendo's mini-sized classic console is worth the hype \nSimilar to the NES Classic Edition, graphics are pixelated and gritty. But you can argue that's perhaps part of the charm. \nHowever, Nintendo still hasn't fixed one of the biggest complaints from the NES Classic Edition: the controllers' wires are incredibly short. You'll need to pull up a chair or sit on the floor, tethered to the screen like old times. It's endearing for the first 10 minutes -- and then you're ready for wireless controllers, a la 2017. \nThere's a reason why the first mini-console flew off shelves last year -- or went for three times the asking price from the third-party sellers on sites like Amazon. The games hold up, and that couldn't be more true with the Super NES Classic Edition.

Ryanair said Wednesday that it will cancel 18,000 flights scheduled between November and March because of a shortage of pilots. It said 400,000 people have already booked seats on these flights. The latest cancellations come on top of 2,100 flights Ryanair has already canceled in September and October. That means some 715,000 passengers in total have been affected by a staffing crunch triggered by a change in the way pilots take vacation. \nThe airline also announced it would withdraw from bidding for Alitalia , the bankrupt Italian airline, to \"eliminate all management distractions.\" \nRyanair ( RYAAY ) had said previously that it would cancel 40 to 50 flights a day up until the end of October because of a pilot scheduling problem. \nRelated: Ryanair offers pilots major cash to keep flying \nRyanair said it would fly 25 fewer planes than previously planned over the winter period, and then 10 fewer starting in April, to avoid further cancellations down the road. It said it would temporarily suspend flights on 30 routes out of a total of 1,800. \nIt said it hoped Wednesday's announcement would draw a line under recent turmoil. \n\"From today, there will be no more rostering related flight cancellations this winter or in summer 2018,\" Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said in a statement. \n\"We deeply regret any doubt we caused existing customers last week about Ryanair's reliability,\" he added. \nThe airline said the new cancellations would affect less than 1% of the 50 million people flying Ryanair this winter. \nRyanair said customers should have received an email on Wednesday giving them between five weeks and five months notice of the cancellations, and offering them alternative flights or refunds. \nRyanair now expects to carry over 129 million passengers in the year to March 2018, two million fewer than it previously forecast. \nIt said refunds and costs related to the initial 2,100 cancellations would total less than \u20ac25 million ($29 million). On top of that, free flight vouchers it issued to passengers would cost an additional \u20ac25 million. \nIt didn't say how much the cancellations announced Wednesday would cost. \n-- Emma Bowden contributed reporting.

His comments come a day after he ordered the Kurds to yield control of their airports to the central government by Friday. Several international flight operators have announced plans to cease flights to the region on Friday, including Egypt Air and Royal Jordanian Airlines. Iran closed its airspace on Sunday. Nearly all neighboring regional powers objected to the referendum, warning that independence could further destabilize the region. On Tuesday, KRG President Masoud Barzani hailed the preliminary results and urged the world to \"respect the will of the people of Kurdistan.\" \"Let's engage in a serious dialogue and become good neighbors,\" Barzani said during a televised speech. Barzani appears at a pro-independence rally in Irbil on Friday. The vote was held across the autonomous region and in disputed territories including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, a flashpoint city claimed by both sides. It comes as Kurdish forces play an instrumental role in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In helping to eliminate the terror group, Kurdish leaders appear to have expected the backing of the international community in pursuing nationalist aspirations. But the referendum has received little support outside northern Iraq. Both Iran and Turkey have sizable Kurdish minorities and fear the ballot might galvanize independence movements in their countries. The United States, United Kingdom and the United Nations denounced the vote amid concerns that it could detract from the campaign against ISIS. As voters cast their ballots Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the referendum as \"illegal\" and suggested Turkey could cut off oil exports from northern Iraq, depriving the KRG of a key source of revenue. On Wednesday night, after the announcement of the voting results, Irbil's main square was quiet -- a sharp contrast to the revelry on the streets the night of the vote. \"I'm afraid of the situation,\" said Ahmad Tayeb, 30, an Arab from Anbar who now lives in Irbil. \"As Arabs, we're worried that clashes in Kirkuk will lead to revenge on us here.\" Bewyar Abdullah, 28, a peshmerga fighter who was injured during war on Isis in Mosul, said he was at the square with friends. They expected large gatherings and fanfare but found none. \"Actually, I want to be split from the Arabs ... For that reason I voted to break away from them,\" he said. \"We don't understand why there are no celebrations.\" Israel is the only country in the region that supported the vote, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing what he described as \"the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to achieve their own state.\" European Union leaders issued a statement on Wednesday calling on all parties involved to \"exercise calm and restraint\" and to resolve their issues through peaceful dialogue. Numbering 30 million, Kurds make up a sizable minority in a number of Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Despite nearly a century of Kurdish nationalist movements in various countries, the Kurds have never had a nation of their own.

U.S. trade officials said Tuesday that they plan to slap a 220% tariff on a new jetliner from Canadian manufacturer Bombardier ( BDRAF ) . The ruling, which Bombardier described as \"absurd,\" risks further inflaming tensions with a vital trading partner that buys more American exports than any other country. \nPresident Trump campaigned on the promise of a much more aggressive trade policy, but his rhetoric focused primarily on China. Since Trump took office, it's Canada that has often been in the crosshairs. \nThe Trump administration has taken steps to impose duties of up to 33% on most Canadian lumber -- one of the country's top exports. \nAt least two more disputes are ongoing: Trump wants Canada to open its market to dairy products, and a spat has erupted over groundwood paper, which is used in the production of newspapers and magazines. \n\"Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult,\" Trump tweeted in April. \"We will not stand for this. Watch!\" Canada has made business for our dairy farmers in Wisconsin and other border states very difficult. We will not stand for this. Watch! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2017 \nThe disputes threaten to upend one of the U.S.'s most important trading relationships. \nCanada is America's biggest trading partner after China, buying exports worth $337 billion each year. There are millions of American jobs that depend on the trade. \nRelated: U.S. slaps stiff tariff on Bombardier's new jet \nThere is now talk of Canada striking back. \n\"I think where you are going to see retaliation is in areas where the Canadian government has discretion over purchasing American products,\" said Chris Rogers, an analyst at trade research firm Panjiva. \nCanada has warned that it may ditch a $5.2 billion deal to purchase up to 18 fighter jets from Boeing ( BA ) , the American firm that brought the Bombardier case to the U.S. Commerce Department. \n\"We won't do business with a company that's busy trying to sue us and put our aerospace workers out of business,\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier this month. \nCanada, which recently completed a free trade agreement with the European Union, has a reputation for punching above its weight on trade issues. \n\"Americans are so used to ignoring Canada that it would surprise most to know that Canada has a long history of fighting hard for its own interests on trade,\" Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote in June . \nA further deterioration of the relationship could damage Trump's ability to successfully renegotiate NAFTA, the 23-year-old free trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico. \nRogers said that Canada could pursue a much more aggressive \"Canada first agenda\" during talks, which are currently in their third round. \nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Wednesday that his department has initiated 48% more trade cases than the Obama administration over the same period last year. \nRoss expects the trend to continue, but added that Canada shouldn't take it personally. \n\"One shouldn't get the impression that we are picking out one country here or there for some selective reason,\" he said at a press conference in Hong Kong. \nTrump, however, has not been shy about singling out America's neighbors to the north. \n\"People don't realize, Canada has been very rough on the United States,\" Trump told a farmers' group in April. \n\"Everyone thinks of Canada as being wonderful, and so do I. I love Canada. But they've outsmarted our politicians for many years, and you people understand that,\" he said.

I want to start saving more and invest it in a way that can best put the benefits of compounding investing to work for me. Any suggestions? -- H.M. Your question shows that you're already on the right track, by which I mean that you seem to get the fact that to build wealth and achieve financial security you need to both save and invest. That may sound like an obvious notion -- and it is -- but nonetheless too many people put far too much emphasis on the investing part and tend to neglect the saving part.\nIn fact, I'd go so far as to say that while saving and investing are partners in building wealth, saving is the more important of the two. It's possible to accumulate wealth solely by saving (although I don't recommend you limit yourself to saving alone). But you can't generate wealth just by investing, as without savings you'd have nothing to invest. And even the savviest investing in the world can only do so much if you're not saving regularly.\nHere's an example. Let's say that you invest your $1,500 in a diversified portfolio of funds that earns 6% a year. And let's further assume that to get the benefits of compounding -- i.e., earning interest on interest or a return on your investment returns -- that you reinvest all your investment earnings in additional fund shares (something pretty much all funds will do for you automatically if you choose).\nAfter 40 years, your $1,500 would have grown to just over $15,400. Not bad, but hardly enough to set you up for life or to fund a secure retirement.\nRelated: How do I retire with $1 million?\nBut look what happens when you continually throw more savings into the pot. If, for example, each year you save an additional $1,500 and invest that alongside your original $1,500 and continue reinvesting all your investment gains, after 40 years you would have just over $246,000. Now we're beginning to talk about real money.\nWhat you might find particularly interesting about this second scenario of saving and then investing $1,500 a year is that by the 12th year the amount you're adding to your stash through re-invested earnings actually exceeds the $1,500 a year you're saving. Indeed, by the end of that 40-year period, your re-invested investment earnings each year would total nearly 10 times the $1,500 in savings you're kicking in. That shows just how much compounding can work for you when you combine regular saving with investing.\nLook what happens when you save more\nBut you can probably do even better. After all, when you're just starting out, scraping together $1,500 a year to save may be a challenge. But as you advance in your career and earn more, you ideally should be able to save more without crimping your lifestyle too badly. And by increasing the amount you save as your salary increases, you can really start to see the bucks add up.\nLet's take the case of someone who's 25, earns $35,000 a year and receives 2% annual pay raises. If that 25-year-old saves 10% of salary each year and earns a 6% annual return on that money, by age 65 that person would have just over $725,000. Push that savings rate to 15% -- the target recommended by many retirement experts -- and our hypothetical 25-year-old's stash would crack the $1 million mark.\nRelated: Is an annuity a good deal?\nI'm not suggesting you can duplicate these figures exactly. Neither I nor anyone else can precisely predict what returns the financial markets will deliver over the next 30 to 40 years (although many investment firms believe returns will come in lower over the next decade or so than in the past). More importantly, even the most committed savers may experience bouts of unemployment, health problems or financial setbacks that knock them off their savings regimen.\nThe point, though, is that if you really want to build wealth and create financial security for yourself, you need to save diligently and invest sensibly. And you should start ASAP, as even a few years of procrastination can significantly reduce the size of your savings balance. (For example, if the 25-year-old above waits until age 30 to start saving 15% a year, his age-65 account balance would shrink by more than 20%.)\nTips for saving on a regular basis\nSo as a practical matter how do you do this? There's no shortage of ways to save money. Some people use budgeting software to track their spending in dozens of categories (lattes, clothing, telecom fees, dining out, etc.) to find places to reduce outlays and squeeze out some savings. Others like to use savings apps that invest your spare change or rely on algorithms that periodically shift money into savings supposedly without you noticing it. If such systems work for you, fine.\nRelated: The secret to being a great saver\nPersonally, I prefer a simple system of setting aside a certain percentage of salary upfront -- ideally 15%, but you can start with a lower figure and gradually increase it -- and having that amount directly deducted from your paycheck and put into a 401(k) or transferred from your checking account to a mutual fund account. I like this arrangement because it makes saving automatic, ensuring that the money you intend to save actually gets saved, not spent (which is usually the more likely outcome). But whatever method works for you is fine, as long as you actually end up saving on a regular basis.\nHow to invest your savings\nI also prefer simplicity when it comes to investing. Ignore all the chatter from investing pundits about shifting your money from one market sector to another to maximize gains and don't fall for the pitch that you've got to invest in every new whiz-bang investment Wall Street churns out in order to earn competitive returns. All you need is a simple mix of low-cost stock and bond funds, preferably index funds or ETFs. Index funds and ETFs typically charge only a small fraction of the fees that actively managed funds do, which is important as research shows that funds with lower fees tend to outperform their high-fee counterparts.\nYou can get by with just a total U.S. stock market fund and a total U.S. bond market fund, but for additional diversification you might consider adding a total international stock fund. If you really want to go the extra mile, you can also throw in a total international bond fund. You can find such low-cost stock and bond funds at a variety of investment firms, including Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard to name a few.\nRelated: I'm 23. How do I start investing?\nSince you're young, you'll probably want to tilt your holdings more toward stocks than bonds, as stocks have historically generated much higher returns. That said, stocks can go through some pretty severe downturns, so you'll want to make sure you can handle the ups and downs without bailing out of stocks when their prices are depressed. You can get a sense of how to divvy up your holdings between stocks and bonds by going to Vanguard's risk tolerance-asset allocation tool.\nIf you're not sure that you're up to the task of putting together a portfolio on your own, you can always invest in a target-date retirement fund , a type of fund that gives you a ready-made mix of stocks and bonds appropriate for your age.\nOne more thing: I get the feeling that you're anxious to start investing that $1,500 you saved up. And such enthusiasm is fine, but before you start investing in stock and bond funds, you should first set aside three to six months' worth of living expenses in a very secure place such as an FDIC-insured savings or money-market account. Yes, the returns will be abysmal on that money. But the idea is to have a stash you can fall back on in the event of an emergency or to cover a large unexpected expense without having to tap into your stock and bond investments, which you'll want to hold for the long term.\nSo ramp up your saving effort, and once you've established that emergency fund, start putting together a mix of low-cost stock and bond funds or ETFs. Then stand back and let the power of compounding do its work.\nCNNMoney September 27, 2017: 10:03 AM ET", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "-- h.m. your", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "schwab", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fidelity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vanguard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T17:51:02.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "156ea9c26df555ae8d7acc1a0c18aa11e71e0c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsldWXWdYYxXopLLOQ.adsTC4S.HxyqLM_Dl8bZiD.4UncYv.WP8Pyfg--", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - HP Hero", "title": "Puerto Rico's desperate fight for survival", "title_full": "Puerto Rico's desperate fight for survival", "published": "2017-09-27T17:32:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170923130458-08-hurricane-maria-puerto-rico-0923-super-tease.jpg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 1599, "comments": 0, "shares": 1599}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "156ea9c26df555ae8d7acc1a0c18aa11e71e0c8a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7enpVQ9s33LsldWXWdYYxXopLLOQ.adsTC4S.HxyqLM_Dl8bZiD.4UncYv.WP8Pyfg--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T17:32:00.000+03:00", "title": "Puerto Rico's desperate fight for survival", "text": "By Veronica Rocha, Meg Wagner and Amanda Wills , CNN Updated 1432 GMT (2232 HKT) September 27, 2017 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger.

Hide Caption 6 of 6 (CNN) Here is a look at the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah - a celebration of the new year. September 9, 2018 - Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown. Facts: Rosh Hashanah means \"head of the year\" in Hebrew. It is a time for reflection and repentance. It is referred to as the \"day of judgment\" or the \"day of repentance.\" According to the Talmud, the world was created on the first day of Tishri, the seventh month of the Jewish calendar. So Rosh Hashanah is considered a birthday of sorts for the world. Read More It is celebrated on the first and second days of the month of Tishrei, which generally corresponds to September or October on the Gregorian calendar. Rosh Hashanah begins the High Holy Days or Ten Days of Penitence, which end with Yom Kippur. One of the most significant rituals during Rosh Hashanah is the blowing of the Shofar, or ram's horn. It is used as a call to repentance during the High Holy Days. During this time, Jewish people attend synagogue services and refrain from working. It is also customary during this time to wear new clothes and get haircuts. Another popular practice is to eat apples dipped in honey, symbolizing the hope for a good year to come. Also, challah bread in round loaves instead of braided loaves is dipped in honey instead of salt. Pomegranates are eaten because the seeds are symbolic of the many commandments in the Torah that Jews must fulfill. Another popular ritual is to walk to a river or stream and recite special prayers of penitence. Afterward, one throws breadcrumbs in the river, to symbolically cast away sins.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rosh hashanah", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rosh hashanah rosh hashanah", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook messenger", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "rosh hashanah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tishri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "talmud", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T18:00:32.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8f493427d0bf04e498369c3f5829dd1d31b90090", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC4HiRcMgyqqkZ8XBwS_wymAuZk_g9eq5oT7BK0vBdKO6nsYijGH46WCai5CpqgrBoLq1I3a7_kSAiLUILYuRODlIlYBSKhBdKf50fyqCSRKHr4BIw5gVvEcM48Juh0MosBSTZ8DSaI1Wa3tGukaup.Q-", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_video_business.rss#2", "site_categories": ["financial_news", "finance"], "section_title": "Video - CNNMoney.com", "title": "Melinda Gates and her hope for women & girls", "title_full": "Melinda Gates and her hope for women & girls", "published": "2017-09-27T17:46:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170920111453-video-title-melinda-gates-full-interview-780x439.jpg", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 2, "comments": 0, "shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8f493427d0bf04e498369c3f5829dd1d31b90090", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC4HiRcMgyqqkZ8XBwS_wymAuZk_g9eq5oT7BK0vBdKO6nsYijGH46WCai5CpqgrBoLq1I3a7_kSAiLUILYuRODlIlYBSKhBdKf50fyqCSRKHr4BIw5gVvEcM48Juh0MosBSTZ8DSaI1Wa3tGukaup.Q-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T17:46:00.000+03:00", "title": "Melinda Gates and her hope for women & girls", "text": "Melinda Gates and her hope for women & girls by Jordan Malter, Richa Naik & Jack Regan @CNNMoney At CNNMoney's American Opportunity breakfast, Melinda Gates tells CNN's Poppy Harlow why she has committed her life's work to advancing opportunity for women and girls in the U.S. and around the globe.

The outcome represents a step towards independence for the semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq and areas it claims, and puts Kurdish authorities on a collision course with their counterparts in Baghdad. The poll took place despite vehement opposition from the Iraqi government , which described it as unconstitutional and has authorized use of force against Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdistan Regional Government, however, says the referendum will give it a mandate for talks to secede from Iraq, although Baghdad has already ruled out such talks. Read More JUST WATCHED Who are the Kurds?\nWho are the Kurds? 01:40 On Wednesday, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for the referendum to be annulled and for the KRG to engage in dialogue as guided by the constitution. His comments come a day after he ordered the Kurds to yield control of their airports to the central government by Friday. Several international flight operators have announced plans to cease flights to the region on Friday, including Egypt Air and Royal Jordanian Airlines. Iran closed its airspace on Sunday. Nearly all neighboring regional powers objected to the referendum, warning that independence could further destabilize the region. On Tuesday, KRG President Masoud Barzani hailed the preliminary results and urged the world to \"respect the will of the people of Kurdistan.\" \"Let's engage in a serious dialogue and become good neighbors,\" Barzani said during a televised speech. Barzani appears at a pro-independence rally in Irbil on Friday. The vote was held across the autonomous region and in disputed territories including the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, a flashpoint city claimed by both sides. It comes as Kurdish forces play an instrumental role in the fight against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. In helping to eliminate the terror group, Kurdish leaders appear to have expected the backing of the international community in pursuing nationalist aspirations. But the referendum has received little support outside northern Iraq. Both Iran and Turkey have sizable Kurdish minorities and fear the ballot might galvanize independence movements in their countries. The United States, United Kingdom and the United Nations denounced the vote amid concerns that it could detract from the campaign against ISIS. As voters cast their ballots Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described the referendum as \"illegal\" and suggested Turkey could cut off oil exports from northern Iraq, depriving the KRG of a key source of revenue. On Wednesday night, after the announcement of the voting results, Irbil's main square was quiet -- a sharp contrast to the revelry on the streets the night of the vote. \"I'm afraid of the situation,\" said Ahmad Tayeb, 30, an Arab from Anbar who now lives in Irbil. \"As Arabs, we're worried that clashes in Kirkuk will lead to revenge on us here.\" Bewyar Abdullah, 28, a peshmerga fighter who was injured during war on Isis in Mosul, said he was at the square with friends. They expected large gatherings and fanfare but found none. \"Actually, I want to be split from the Arabs ... For that reason I voted to break away from them,\" he said. \"We don't understand why there are no celebrations.\" Israel is the only country in the region that supported the vote, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing what he described as \"the legitimate efforts of the Kurdish people to achieve their own state.\" European Union leaders issued a statement on Wednesday calling on all parties involved to \"exercise calm and restraint\" and to resolve their issues through peaceful dialogue. Numbering 30 million, Kurds make up a sizable minority in a number of Middle Eastern countries, including Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Despite nearly a century of Kurdish nationalist movements in various countries, the Kurds have never had a nation of their own.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "masoud barzani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barzani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "haider al-abadi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "krg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan regional government", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "irbil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kurdistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirkuk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "baghdad", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T18:01:51.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4c5d7a37102325673c401f07cda6543ab3bc0154", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWG.6SUCfnhCQdbMdie_TBQvj14yxScRtm0KUqS_66P4iMiSAohAulWP1NkwYtDLkclygcX1iLc7Gg--", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "Why Rep.

And women. If it wasn't sexist, I would say the RSC eye candy, but we'll leave that out of the record,\" US Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said. The record heard him loud and clear, and the remark immediately sparked social media backlash, with some calling him sexist. Of course, it was an offhand remark, which Walker has already acknowledged was \"meant to be lighthearted but fell short,\" adding, \"I'm proud of the women who serve in our RSC leadership.\" In fact, against the backdrop of the nation's resurgent culture wars, many will undoubtedly view Walker's remark as no big deal -- a compliment, actually -- and believe that women need to understand how to take a joke. Read More JUST WATCHED Brooke Baldwin ends interview after lewd remark Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nBrooke Baldwin ends interview after lewd remark 04:17 But the statement actually is a big deal. Much as some would like to imagine it as innocuous, it reflects some serious, real-world and consequential views that keep women -- including women in Walker's own life -- in a second class of American culture. Three reasons: First, Walker's comment suggests that he doesn't take women -- and their equal role in the workplace -- seriously. The message: If women actually are eye candy, then they are present in Congress, at least in part, for the pleasure of men, rather than to do the same work as men: solve policy problems. His comment also sends a disturbing message -- to his own daughters, and to every woman in America -- that women's ideas and intelligence aren't what counts. Second, Walker's comment sexualizes the workplace. There is no way around this: Calling women eye candy suggests that Walker believes it is OK to view female colleagues as sexual objects. In some cases expressing this view can create an \"offensive workplace environment,\" which is illegal , according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And it could drive women from important roles. Obama's 'best-looking' remark was sexist Women are already drastically underrepresented in politics. They hold just 19.3% of seats in the House, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Republican women are especially underrepresented: Only 22 House Republicans are women, compared with 62 House Democrats. At a time when we need more women in the House, treatment such as this could discourage them from seeking and keeping such positions. Indeed, a 2016 study by Redbook magazine found that almost half of American women have left a job or know a woman who has left a job due to sexual harassment. Third, Walker is a leader in the GOP. He sets a terrible example for other men -- in and out of politics -- by suggesting that it's OK to talk about women this way. Researchers say the best way to prevent sexual harassment in workplaces is to create a culture in which it isn't tolerated. Walker's remark, however, promotes the kind of environment in which it can thrive. Walker may believe his female colleagues are beautiful, but his own remark was nothing short of ugly. Here's hoping the feedback he's getting from around the country today also catches his eye -- and leads him to treat women differently in the future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kara alaimo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mark walker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooke baldwin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "treasury department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hofstra university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutgers university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican study committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for american women and politics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redbook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equal employment opportunity commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T18:01:54.007+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "744c8b9c5279f96eb12cc861319b4780b922a317", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWHmmLva1gTF_d1rZQeGYW.sseIdr2Keo9aAp3yhG5AzKIbQKS5_fzvJBy_76mKVsPHlq5Fm50uHC9eZGdwWqPPQ", "site_full": "edition.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_latest.rss", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel", "title": "A nurse, who was out shopping, jumps in to deliver a baby at Target - CNN", "title_full": "A nurse, who was out shopping, jumps in to deliver a baby at Target - CNN", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170927090811-women-delivers-baby-target-super-tease.jpeg", "performance_score": 10, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 3501, "comments": 0, "shares": 3501}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "744c8b9c5279f96eb12cc861319b4780b922a317", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3JaXg5X46kqTnjMvGX4JruXQomwDmYdLWHmmLva1gTF_d1rZQeGYW.sseIdr2Keo9aAp3yhG5AzKIbQKS5_fzvJBy_76mKVsPHlq5Fm50uHC9eZGdwWqPPQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "cnn", "published": "2017-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "A nurse, who was out shopping, jumps in to deliver a baby at Target - CNN", "text": "(CNN) Tanya St. Preux went into a store to pick up some stuff -- and left with a newborn.\nThe Georgia woman was shopping at her neighborhood Target this week when she went into labor.

And women. If it wasn't sexist, I would say the RSC eye candy, but we'll leave that out of the record,\" US Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina said. The record heard him loud and clear, and the remark immediately sparked social media backlash, with some calling him sexist. Of course, it was an offhand remark, which Walker has already acknowledged was \"meant to be lighthearted but fell short,\" adding, \"I'm proud of the women who serve in our RSC leadership.\" In fact, against the backdrop of the nation's resurgent culture wars, many will undoubtedly view Walker's remark as no big deal -- a compliment, actually -- and believe that women need to understand how to take a joke.

MUST WATCH\nBrooke Baldwin ends interview after lewd remark 04:17 But the statement actually is a big deal. Much as some would like to imagine it as innocuous, it reflects some serious, real-world and consequential views that keep women -- including women in Walker's own life -- in a second class of American culture. Three reasons: First, Walker's comment suggests that he doesn't take women -- and their equal role in the workplace -- seriously. The message: If women actually are eye candy, then they are present in Congress, at least in part, for the pleasure of men, rather than to do the same work as men: solve policy problems. His comment also sends a disturbing message -- to his own daughters, and to every woman in America -- that women's ideas and intelligence aren't what counts. Second, Walker's comment sexualizes the workplace. There is no way around this: Calling women eye candy suggests that Walker believes it is OK to view female colleagues as sexual objects. In some cases expressing this view can create an \"offensive workplace environment,\" which is illegal , according to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. And it could drive women from important roles. Obama's 'best-looking' remark was sexist Women are already drastically underrepresented in politics. They hold just 19.3% of seats in the House, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. Republican women are especially underrepresented: Only 22 House Republicans are women, compared with 62 House Democrats. At a time when we need more women in the House, treatment such as this could discourage them from seeking and keeping such positions. Indeed, a 2016 study by Redbook magazine found that almost half of American women have left a job or know a woman who has left a job due to sexual harassment. Third, Walker is a leader in the GOP. He sets a terrible example for other men -- in and out of politics -- by suggesting that it's OK to talk about women this way. Researchers say the best way to prevent sexual harassment in workplaces is to create a culture in which it isn't tolerated. Walker's remark, however, promotes the kind of environment in which it can thrive. Walker may believe his female colleagues are beautiful, but his own remark was nothing short of ugly. Here's hoping the feedback he's getting from around the country today also catches his eye -- and leads him to treat women differently in the future.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "brooke baldwin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walker", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rutgers university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "center for american women and politics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redbook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "equal employment opportunity commission", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-09-27T18:11:09.002+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "705b02b596ad3cb0376d2467d39146a73c92dd70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwfLP24YtKw5podyjTqghgU5G0qKrqrQc8.S4qZgctj.5K3mPV6N3oFBy4guoRZjisQE.LdlV190TPLXkFFCObPy", "site_full": "www.cnn.com", "site": "cnn.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": ["media"], "section_title": "", "title": "Corruption scandals rock South Africa - CNN Video", "title_full": "Corruption scandals rock South Africa - CNN Video", "published": "2017-09-27T14:09:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.683, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 0, "domain_rank": 81, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 60, "comments": 0, "shares": 60}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "705b02b596ad3cb0376d2467d39146a73c92dd70", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.iJPgI2z6a7QKVpHUQD4INsprDvelbWwfLP24YtKw5podyjTqghgU5G0qKrqrQc8.S4qZgctj.5K3mPV6N3oFBy4guoRZjisQE.LdlV190TPLXkFFCObPy", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-09-27T14:09:00.000+03:00", "title": "Corruption scandals rock South Africa - CNN Video", "text": "\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger.
